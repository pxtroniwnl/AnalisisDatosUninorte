7527,pub.1133738457,10.1111/eci.13480,33350464,,Effects of age and comorbidities on serum levels of inflammatory markers in community‐acquired pneumonia,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have suggested that an inappropriate inflammatory response is a major cause of treatment failure and mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to determine the effect of age and comorbidities on serum inflammatory markers in CAP.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of adults hospitalized with CAP. For the purposes of this study, we compared patients according to comorbidities and age. Inflammatory markers were measured at hospital admission, focusing on acute phase proteins, cytokines and monocyte human leucocyte antigen DR (mHLA-DR) expression.
RESULTS: In patients with chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), serum cytokines had significantly decreased levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and mHLA-DR expression, as well as the C-reactive protein (CRP), compared with patients who had no comorbidities. Similarly, patients with chronic heart disease had a significantly reduced CRP levels and mHLA-DR expression, whereas patients with chronic kidney disease had significantly higher serum levels of procalcitonin and TNF-α. Lower procalcitonin, IL-6 and IL-10 levels, as well as mHLA-DR expression, were documented in older patients, but with no significant differences compared to younger patients. Multimorbidity in older patients was associated with significant lower levels of CRP and mHLA-DR expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The circulating inflammatory markers to CAP have profiles that differ with age and underlying comorbidities. Multimorbidity in the elderly is also associated with lower serum levels of some inflammatory markers. Our findings suggest that inflammatory markers in CAP should be interpreted after considering age and comorbid conditions.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interests.,"Funding information The study was supported by Instituto de Salud Carlos III (research grants 11/01106, 14/00580, and 17/01332).

To determine the best cut-off threshold value of the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) for the detection of diabetes and non-diabetic hyperglycaemia in people 35 years or older at primary health care settings in Europe.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 11,444 adults from primary health care centres using community and opportunistic screening approaches. All participants completed the FINDRISC questionnaire and underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The FINDRISC performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, Youdeńs index, positive and negative prediction values for different FINDRISC cut-offs were calculated.
RESULTS: The optimal FINDRISC value for detecting both diabetes or glucose impairment in the community - screened sample was 14 point with the associated AUC 0.75,5 (95 %CI 0.73,7-0.77,3). The optimal score in the opportunistic screening sample was 16 with the associated AUC only 0.60,4 (95% CI 0.56, 4-0.64, 4).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The FINDRISC is a non-invasive tool useful for detecting people with unknown diabetes and glucose impairment in people visiting primary health centres in Europe.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

METHOD: ADHD severity was derived using latent class cluster analysis of DSM-IV symptomatology. Family-based association tests were conducted to detect associations between SNPs and ADHD severity latent phenotypes. Machine learning algorithms were used to build predictive models of ADHD severity based on demographic and genetic data.
RESULTS: Individuals with ADHD exhibited two seemingly independent latent class severity configurations. SNPs harbored in DRD4, SNAP25, and ADGRL3 showed evidence of linkage and association to symptoms severity and a potential pleiotropic effect on distinct domains of ADHD severity. Predictive models discriminate severe from non-severe ADHD in specific symptom domains.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the role of DRD4, SNAP25, and ADGRL3 genes in outlining ADHD severity, and a new prediction framework with potential clinical use.",We express our highest sentiment of appreciation to all families enrolled in this study.,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was financed by COLCIENCIAS, project “Fenotipos Complejos y Endofenotipos del Trastorno por Déficit de Atención e Hiperactividad y su Asociación con Genes Mayores y de Susceptibilidad”, grant 1253-5453-1644, contract RC 384-2011, awarded to Grupo de Neurociencias del Caribe, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla.

6824,pub.1148084071,,35603021,PMC9097025,The Outcomes of Inhalation Injuries in Lesser Burns: Still a Deadly Injury.,"Background: Although it has been widely proposed that inhalation injuries worsen burn outcomes, large-scale studies have yet to demonstrate the exact relationship. This study proposes inhalation injuries as an independent risk factor that worsens burn outcomes.
Methods: A retrospective review of the American Burn Association Registry from 2002 to 2011 was conducted. Inclusion criteria included burn patients with a total body surface area (TBSA) of less than 15% and adequate data recording of the inhalation injury within the registry. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: inhalation injuries (group 1) vs non-inhalation injuries (group 2). Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and days on a ventilator.
Results: A total of 93781 burn patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 4204 patients in group 1 and 89577 patients in group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of TBSA, with 3.50% in group 1 and 3.58% in group 2. There was a significantly higher ICU LOS at 8.55 days in group 1 compared to 6.27 days in group 2. There was a significantly higher hospital LOS at 11.48 days in group 1 compared to 6.27 days in group 2. The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in group 1 at 8.54% vs group 2 at 1.42%.
Conclusion: The presence of inhalation injury may be a predictor of increased mortality and poor outcome in burn patients, even in those with small sized burns.",,,Eplasty,,,,2021-09-29,2021,2021-09-29,,21,,e7,Closed,Article,"Puyana, Salomon; Ruiz, Samuel; Amador, Francisco; Mckenney, Mark; Young, Elizabeth; Lim, Rizal; Mir, Haaris","Puyana, Salomon (Department of Plastic Surgery, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana.); Ruiz, Samuel (Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami, Florida.); Amador, Francisco (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Mckenney, Mark (Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami, Florida.; Department of Surgery, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.); Young, Elizabeth (Burn and Reconstructive Centers of Florida, Miami, Florida.); Lim, Rizal (Burn and Reconstructive Centers of Florida, Miami, Florida.); Mir, Haaris (Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami, Florida.; Burn and Reconstructive Centers of Florida, Miami, Florida.)",,"Puyana, Salomon (Tulane University); Ruiz, Samuel (Kendall Regional Medical Center); Amador, Francisco (Universidad del Norte); Mckenney, Mark (Kendall Regional Medical Center; University of South Florida); Young, Elizabeth (Burn and Reconstructive Centers of Florida, Miami, Florida.); Lim, Rizal (Burn and Reconstructive Centers of Florida, Miami, Florida.); Mir, Haaris (Kendall Regional Medical Center; Burn and Reconstructive Centers of Florida, Miami, Florida.)",1,1,,0.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148084071,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Plain film, CT, and MRI of the cervical spine (C3–C5) revealed enlargement of the spinal canal, soft tissue calcification, spinal dysraphism, and an intramedullary, predominantly fatty, mass. The mass had associated calcifications and a highly proteinaceous cyst. Surgical resection of the spinal lesion was subsequently performed. Histopathological evaluation revealed a mature teratoma.

Sin embargo, la mortalidad varía entre los estudios.
Objetivos: Determinar las características clínicas y el pronóstico de los adultos con COVID-19 ingresados en UCI en Colombia durante la primera ola de la pandemia.
Materiales y métodos: Este estudio retrospectivo multicéntrico se realizó en 8 hospitales. Se incluyeron pacientes con infección confirmada por SARS-CoV-2, de marzo a julio de 2020.
Resultados: Durante el período de estudio, 229 adultos con COVID-19 ingresaron en las UCI. La mayoría de los pacientes (54,5%) tenían más de 65 años. Se documentaron comorbilidades en 146 (64%) pacientes, principalmente hipertensión arterial y diabetes mellitus. La mediana de la puntuación SOFA al ingreso en UCI fue de 5 (rango intercuartílico, 2-12). En cuanto a las complicaciones, 118 (51,5%) requirieron ventilación mecánica, 51 (22,4%) terapia de reemplazo renal y 85 (35%) uso de vasopresores. La mortalidad fue 38,4% (88 de 219 pacientes). La mortalidad aumentó con la edad (20% en menores de 40 años y 54,1% en mayores de 65 años; p<0,001). En el análisis multivariado, los factores asociados con la mortalidad fueron edad ≥65 años (OR 11,9; IC 95%, 3,20-44,23), puntuación SOFA (OR 1,21; IC 95%, 1,05-1,39), uso de vasopresores (OR 12,8; IC 95%, 3,45-48,17) y terapia de reemplazo renal (OR 9,0; IC 95%: 2,37-34,42).
Conclusiones: Los pacientes críticos con infección por SARS-CoV-2 tuvieron una mortalidad elevada, principalmente relacionada con la edad avanzada, la gravedad de la enfermedad al ingreso en UCI y el desarrollo de disfunción orgánica.","We would like to thanks to all our colleagues in the participants ICU who have worked to provide clinical care during this pandemic.

We quantified plant extinction and ecological change in tropical forests resulting from the end-Cretaceous event using fossil pollen (>50,000 occurrences) and leaves (>6000 specimens) from localities in Colombia. Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) rainforests were characterized by an open canopy and diverse plant-insect interactions. Plant diversity declined by 45% at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and did not recover for ~6 million years. Paleocene forests resembled modern Neotropical rainforests, with a closed canopy and multistratal structure dominated by angiosperms. The end-Cretaceous event triggered a long interval of low plant diversity in the Neotropics and the evolutionary assembly of today's most diverse terrestrial ecosystem.","We thank Carbones El Cerrejón, the Montecristo/Peñitas coal mines, and Chechua/Cogua siltstone mines; E.

The extension of the bread shelf life together with innovative systems of food waste treatment might decrease waste biomass decay, the need for transportation, and the need for storage. In recent years, insects have been selected as a valuable tool for food waste treatment owing to their capability to transform low-value food waste into biomass with high nutritional value. Bakery wastes can be used profitably for this purpose. This work had two objectives: (i) to measure the impact of flaxseed cake fortification on bread shelf life depending on the leavening agent (baker's yeast vs sourdough); (ii) to evaluate the possible reuse of the stale bread fortified with flaxseed cake for Tenebrio molitor rearing.
RESULTS: Our results showed that fortification seemed to slow the hardening rate of bread, particularly if baker's yeast was used. The time necessary for mold to appear in sourdough bread doubled (from 2 to 4 days). The addition of flaxseed cake to the recipe determined an increase of its scrap consumption by T. molitor larvae. We also observed a significant increase in the body mass of the T. molitor larvae fed with bread obtained with the brewer's yeast with respect to larvae fed with the sourdough.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these preliminary data can indicate that sourdough bread fortified with 5% of flaxseed cake can represent a promising tool to reduce food waste and to recycle bread scraps by a novel zero-waste approach. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","The authors wish to thank Mr. Paolo Giannotti for the photographs of the insects.

In Latin America, hypertension prevalence varies from 30 to 50%. Moreover, the proportion of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension is very low. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus varies from 8 to 13% and around 40% of patients are unaware of their condition. In addition, the prevalence of prediabetes varies from 6 to 14% and this condition has also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The principal factors linked to a higher risk of hypertension in Latin America are increased adiposity, low muscle strength, unhealthy diet, low physical activity and low education. Besides being chronic conditions, leading causes of cardiovascular mortality, both hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, represent a substantial cost for the weak health systems of Latin American countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement and reinforce public health programs to improve awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, in order to reach the mandate of the United Nations to decrease the premature mortality for CVD.","A large number of organizations participated in the development of the study: Fundación Oftalmológica de Santander (FOSCAL), Floridablanca; Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga, Bucaramanga; Universidad de Santander, Bucaramanga; Universidad de Caldas y Médicos Internistas de Caldas, Manizales; Universidad del Quindío, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Armenia; Fundación Cometa, Pasto; Hospital Susana Lopez, Popayán; Fundación RIESCAR, El Espinal; Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Bogotá; ENDOCARE, Bogotá; Universidad del Norte y Biolab, Barranquilla; Centro Cardiovascular Santa Lucía, Cartagena; FUNDEMOS, Yopal y Universidad de Santander, Valledupar.",,Current Hypertension Reviews,,,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypertension; Latin America; Prevalence; Risk Factors",2021,2021,,2021,17,2,112-120,Closed,Article,"Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio; Lopez-Lopez, Jose; Cohen, Daniel; Alarcon-Ariza, Natalia; Mogollon-Zehr, Margarita","Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio (Masira Research Institute, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, ;; Centro Integral para la Prevencion de Enfermedades Cardiometabolicas, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Lopez-Lopez, Jose (Masira Research Institute, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, ;; Centro Integral para la Prevencion de Enfermedades Cardiometabolicas, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Cohen, Daniel (Masira Research Institute, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, ;); Alarcon-Ariza, Natalia (Masira Research Institute, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, ;); Mogollon-Zehr, Margarita (Masira Research Institute, University of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, ;)","Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio (University of Santander; University of Santander)","Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio (University of Santander; University of Santander); Lopez-Lopez, Jose (University of Santander; University of Santander); Cohen, Daniel (University of Santander); Alarcon-Ariza, Natalia (University of Santander); Mogollon-Zehr, Margarita (University of Santander)",9,6,1.02,5.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130931246,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The aim of the study was to investigate the associations between recommended physical activity and mortality in adults 65 years or older. This prospective cohort study used data from the National Health Interview Surveys from 1997 to 2013 linked with mortality files through December 31, 2015 (n = 89 962). The main outcomes included all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. The main exposure variables were aerobic LTPA and guideline-concordant strength training during leisure time. Cox regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Muscle-strengthening activity at least twice per week were associated with lower hazards of all-cause mortality (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.96), CVD mortality (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-0.99), and cancer mortality (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.96). Those who reached the recommended weekly amount of LTPA had a lower hazard of all-cause mortality by 35% (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.63-0.67), the hazard of CVD by 38% (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.58-0.67), and cancer mortality by 22% (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.84). The hazard of death among those who were physically active in both leisure time and engaged in muscle-strengthening activities was 0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.60) for all-cause mortality, 0.53 (95% CI 0.47-0.61) for CVD mortality, and 0.66 (95% CI 0.58-0.75) for cancer mortality.

A 9-month study of 96 children (Mage  = 5.37 years, SD = 0.42) from Barranquilla, Colombia, assessed socioeconomic differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning across the kindergarten year. Children were from four different classrooms in one school. Saliva samples were collected twice a day across 3 consecutive days at the beginning and end of the school year. We examined whether change in HPA axis activation across the year varied as a function of a child's socioeconomic status (SES) and experience in the peer group. We found that rejected children and lower SES children had lower cortisol levels early in the morning. Rejected children had a flatter morning cortisol slope. Lower SES children had higher cortisol than their higher SES peers at the end of the school year and a flatter morning cortisol slope. Taken together, these findings suggest that diurnal cortisol in children beginning kindergarten may be influenced by both peer rejection and SES.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by grants to the first and fourth authors from The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Fonds de recherche du Québec: Société et culture, and from COLCIENCIAS (the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovación) to the second and third author.

Here, we investigated the effect of 1/ADHD and 2/ methylphenidate (MPH), on these two components of interference control. We compared interference control between untreated children with ADHD, children with ADHD under MPH, and typically developing children performing a Simon task. The main findings were that 1/ children with ADHD were more susceptible to reacting impulsively and less efficient at suppressing impulsive actions, and 2/ MPH improved the selective inhibition of impulsive actions but did not modify the strength of response impulse.

(2005). This prior study revealed contextual variations in the association between two measures of social behavior, specifically aggression and withdrawal, and two measures of effective functioning with peers, specifically sociometric preference and friendship. The Montréal participants were primarily from families with European backgrounds. The ethnicity of the participants from Barranquilla can be described as Latinx/Caribbean. Multilevel analyses provided evidence of replication of place differences only for the associations between measures of aggression and sociometric preference. Stronger negative associations were observed between (a) measures of aggression and sociometric preference, (b) measures of withdrawal and sociometric preference, and (c) withdrawal and friendship in peer groups that were high in collectivism. These findings are interpreted as largely replicating the deep structure of the findings from the Valdivia et al. study.

Nevertheless, these findings have not been replicated (specifically attentional control, flexibility, and working memory). In addition, most studies have focused on children and adolescents, but few studies analyze the executive function performance in BO adults.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to compare the neurocognitive performance of BO with control parent-offspring (CO) in a sample that included various age groups.
METHOD: We conducted a cohort study, including subjects between six to 30 years old. We evaluated 129 BO and 113 CO subjects using validated psychiatric diagnostic interviews and an extensive neuropsychological battery.
RESULTS: Compared to the CO group, the BO group presented a lower performance in several executive functioning domains, mainly in tasks of attentional control, flexibility, and working memory. All age groups exhibited these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: BO group presents executive function deficits, regardless of the age group: children, adolescents, and adults. This neurocognitive deficit should be accountable as a neurocognitive endophenotype candidate in BD.","We thank all families who participated in the study for their time and patience.

The aim of this research was to determine empathy in dentists in the process of specialisation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through an observational and cross-sectional study, all postgraduate students of Dentistry Faculty of Universidad Andrés Bello (Chile) were analysed (N = 195). The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy Scale was applied.
RESULTS: The results show an adequate reliability of the empathy measure (α = 0.819, ω = 0.928). A three-factor structure is evidenced by confirmatory factor analysis (χ2 /df = 1.445, GFI = 0.952, RMSEA = 0.047) and adequate factor invariance between men and women. Women showed greater empathy on the global scale and in the perspective adoption dimension, with no gender differences found in the dimension Compassionate care and putting oneself in the other's shoes (POOS). The median empathy reaches 120 points. Below, are placed, the specialty of oral rehabilitation (Med = 114.5), surgery (Med = 117) and periodontics (Med. = 117.5). With superior scores, temporomandibular disorder (Med. = 121), endodontics (Med. = 121), Orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics Med. = 122), Implantology (Med. = 125) and Pediatric dentistry (Med. = 127.5) are located.
CONCLUSION: Women were more empathetic than men.

Diseño: Estudio de casos y controles anidado, unicéntrico, realizado entre marzo y agosto del 2020.
Pacientes: Pacientes mayores de 18 años, una estancia hospitalaria mayor a 72 horas, soporte de ventilación mecánica invasiva admitidos en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos. Intervenciones: Ninguna.
Mediciones: Se agruparon variables clínicas tanto para casos y controles. Se calcularon medias y desviación estándar en variables cuantitativas y proporciones en variables categóricas. Para evaluar las diferencias entre proporciones se usó la prueba exacta de Fisher y para las diferencias de medias se usó la prueba de U Mann Whitney. Las variables con diferencia estadísticamente significativa se corrieron en un modelo explicativo basado en regresión logística binaria.
Resultados: La frecuencia de neumonía bacteriana fue del 10,07% encontrando un elevado consumo de terapia antibiótica empírica. Se encontró asociación estadística entre el tiempo de uso de dexametasona (OR = 1.520 IC 95% 1.131 – 2.042) con el desarrollo de neumonía bacteriana. El resto de variables no resultaron estadísticamente significativas tras ajustar el modelo con regresión logística.
Conclusión: Se encontraron tasas bajas de neumonía bacteriana predominando la Klebsiella pneumoniae como la bacteria más frecuente.

This can potentially impact on how written information is understood. Websites increasingly provide information about different medical interventions including epilepsy surgery. Our aim was to assess the readability of a sample of one hundred patient-oriented educational English language websites related to epilepsy surgery.
METHODS: A Google search was carried out using the terms epilepsy and surgery, and a sample of forty-nine websites from both the UK and the US were chosen. These websites were uploaded to a freely available online readability scoring tool (readabilityformulas.com) and seven measures of readability generated were examined. Other data including use of figures/diagrams, patient narratives, and mention of the risks/benefits of surgery were noted.
RESULTS: The majority of the websites analyzed in this study were found to be 'difficult' to read for the average reading level of the population (n = 1-impossible, 10-very difficult, 23-difficult, 14 fairly difficult). Only 1 website was considered suitable for average reading level. The use of infographics was variable - some webpages used them extensively to reiterate the textual information and other websites did not.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The available online patient information literature is likely to be too difficult for the average reader to understand.

METHODS: Descriptive study with association. Skeletal class measured by the Steiner method. Postural analysis through APECS mobile application for forward head posture and shoulder discrepancy, and surface electromyography with Biopac® device.
RESULTS: The skeletal class, forward head posture, and shoulder discrepancy presented statistical association with the symmetrical electromyographic response of digastric muscles and masseter muscles during swallowing.
DISCUSSION: This study exhibited a positive relationship between digastric muscle symmetry and skeletal class during swallowing. The compensation of the hyoid system explains these results, showing that skeletal Class III has better electromyographic balance. In contrast, masseter muscle symmetry during swallowing presented a negative relationship with skeletal class.

PURPOSE: To identify disease and non-disease related factors associated with NP manifestations in early SLE.
METHODS: We included 1193 patients from the GLADEL inception cohort free of NP involvement at cohort entry. We evaluated the association of demographic, clinical and laboratory data with NP involvement during follow-up.
STATISTICAL METHODS: Independent factors associated with NP involvement were identified using a multivariable Cox regression model.
RESULTS: Factors independently associated with NP manifestations were: mestizo ethnicity (HR 1.701, 95% CI 1.282-2.258, p = 0.0002), myalgias/myositis (HR 1.832, 95% CI 1.335-2.515, p = 0.0002), pneumonitis (HR 2.476, 95% CI 1.085-5.648, p = 0.0312), shrinking lung (HR 2.428, 95% CI 1.074-5.493, p = 0.0331) and hemolytic anemia (HR 1.629, 95% CI 1.130-2.347, p = 0.0089).

Using UV-visible spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the effects of tetrahydrofuran solvent vapors on the optical properties and surface morphology of biobased films with different POTE contents were studied. Results indicate that morphological rearrangements of POTE take place during the process of solvent exposure. Specifically, the solvent vapor induced the formation of POTE small crystalline domains, which allows envisioning the potential of tuning UV-visible absorbance and wettability behavior of biobased films. Finally, theoretical electronic calculations (specifically frontier molecular orbitals analysis) provided consistent evidence on POTE's preferential orientation and selectivity toward the THF-vapor medium.","The authors would like to thank FONDECYT projects 1211022 (C.S.) and 11191012 (R.

There is no specific test, and diagnosis is based on high clinical suspicion and good differential diagnosis. A clinical picture consistent with hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered level of consciousness, together with signs of rhabdomyolysis in analytical studies and a history of taking neuroleptic drugs are the key elements in the detection of this entity. Due to its low incidence and potential mortality, it is essential to publish case reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in order to raise awareness of this entity and facilitate diagnostic suspicion when encountering a patient with compatible symptoms. The following is the case of a 79 year old patient with chronic alcohol consumption as the only history of interest, who was given a single dose of haloperidol after an episode of delirium in the postoperative period of conventional trauma surgery. She subsequently developed a picture of progressive deterioration of the level of consciousness, diaphoresis, generalized muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, together with severe metabolic acidosis, hyperlacticaemia, rhabdomyolysis, hypertransaminasemia and hypocalcemia. After ruling out other entities compatible with the clinical picture, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was given as the main diagnostic hypothesis.

CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man with a history of catatonia, refractory epilepsy and functional impairment, required frequent changes in his anticonvulsant and antipsychotic treatment, due to adverse effects. During 2019, in the month of July, clozapine was changed to amisulpride, in September he developed fever, muscle stiffness, stupor, diaphoresis and tachypnea over a two-week period; paraclinical tests showed elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and leukocytosis, so NMS was considered. The antipsychotic was withdrawn and he was treated with bromocriptine and biperiden, with a good response. Ten days after discharge, he began treatment with olanzapine, which generated a similar episode to the one described in December, with subsequent management and resolution.
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis is based on the use of drugs that alter dopamine levels, plus altered state of consciousness, fever, autonomic instability and paraclinical tests showing leukocytosis and elevated CPK. Differential diagnosis must be ruled out. Early diagnosis generally leads to total remission, although some patients will suffer complications, long-term sequelae or recurrences. The recurrence in this case derived from the early reintroduction of the neuroleptic after the first episode. Treatment should be individualised according to severity to avoid mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical antipsychotics are rarely suspected of generating NMS. Moreover, the time to reintroduction after an episode must also be taken into account.",,,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,,2021-07-06,2021,2021-07-06,2023-01,52,1,78-81,Closed,Article,"Mogollon Díaz, Johana Patricia; Lizcano Toloza, Linda Yurani; Serrano García, Angie Yarlady; Alquichire Luna, Camilo Andrés; García Bohorquez, Diego Fernando; Chaparro Durán, María Fernanda; Cáceres Valero, María Valentina","Mogollon Díaz, Johana Patricia (Departamento de Salud Mental, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia.); Lizcano Toloza, Linda Yurani (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia.

As a result, there is often a close match between the evolutionary history of river basins and their natural history. Thus, the regional landscape and ecological features, such as temperature, have shaped the evolution and adaptation of local fish assemblages. Climate change is expected to affect fish diversity and increase extinction, especially in low latitudes, and it has been suggested that species that inhabit low latitude species are more susceptible since they live close to their maximum thermal limits and have low capacity for acclimation. To understand the mechanisms of variation in thermal tolerance across a broad-scale of South American fishes is fundamental to be able to assess the vulnerability of species and habitat to global warming. Herein, we present the first attempt to analyze the vulnerability of South American freshwater fish species, based on the review of upper thermal limits of 106 species from a broad range of latitudinal habitats. Our findings show that upper thermal limits decrease with latitude, while the thermal safety margin (TSM) increase. Furthermore, the latitude has little effects on the acclimation response ratio, and the TSM decreased with rising temperatures. These data suggest that thermal phenotypic acclimation has low potential for mitigating global warming. These results indicate that South American fish species living in tropical areas are more susceptible to global warming since they are already living close to their maximum habitat temperature.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was part of the INCT ADAPTA supported by the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq, 465540/2014‐7), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM, 062.01187/2017), and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES, Finance Code 001).

Likewise, the feminization of old age underscores the importance of developing research from the perspectives of gender and critical feminist gerontology. The objective of the present study is to identify and analyze women baby-boomers' conceptualizations about social participation regarding the configuration of social participation spaces. Five discussion groups and five individual interviews were conducted with 56 baby boomers residing in Andalusia (Spain).

The first was to establish whether characteristics such as self-esteem, perception of body image, and dating perpetration explain dating victimization. The second was to check if sex moderates the relationship between low self-esteem and dissatisfaction and if body dissatisfaction mediates the effect of low self-esteem on being a victim of dating violence (DV). A total of 1,409 Colombian adolescents and young adults, secondary and university students (42.5% men and 57.5% women), aged between 14 and 25 years (M = 18.6 years; SD = 2.8 years) participated. An explanatory correlational design was used, in which the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Body Shape Questionnaire, and the Revised Dating Violence Questionnaire were applied. Six regression models were proposed for both men and women, where it was found that low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and violence exerted in the courtship explain the violence received. Also, through the moderated mediation analysis, a moderate conditional indirect effect was verified of low self-esteem in DV victimization (R2 = 0.052***) through body dissatisfaction, being higher in women than in men.

This study compared the 79 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) panel with the SNPforID 52plex set used in forensic identification, using samples belonging to Continental Caribbean populations from Colombia with a high percentage of locals self-determined as Native American descendants. The results show a bias in the individual estimation made with the identification markers, which disregards the Native American ancestry component and overestimates the African ancestry component.

Following a multiple instrumental case study methodology with pre-post-intervention measurements, the cases of eight people were analyzed, six women and two men between the ages of 30 and 65, low socioeconomic and educational level, all of whom had been victims of forced displacement and currently reside in Ibagué where the intervention program was performed. The reliable change index was applied to estimate the effects of the program. In each case, participation in the program significantly improved the results of certain variables, but there were differences between the cases concerning the improvement levels and intensity. Therefore, the development of programs that reinforce community resilience can have positive effects on the perceptions of the participants regarding their well-being and social relationships.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We extend our sincere gratitude to Dr. Ricardo Olmos Albacete, Lecturer at the School of Psychology of the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid, for reading this study paper and providing his guidance with regard to methodology, assessment, and the submission of this article&#x27;s results.

Our approach employs the three-dimensional-variational (3D-Var) cost function to estimate posterior modes of error distributions. The proposed method works as follows: at each iteration, we estimate the 3D-Var cost function's negative gradient via a first-order Taylor approximation. This vector is then multiplied by random positive definite matrices to obtain a set of potential descent directions. We employ these directions to build an initial sub-space onto which partial analysis increments can be computed. Subsequently, we create a set of orthogonal directions to previous sub-spaces in a least-square sense; we search for additional analysis contributions onto the new directions via line-search optimization. Sub-space analysis increments are mapped back onto model spaces as they are found. We theoretically prove the convergence of our proposed optimization method. Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz-96 model. The results reveal that additional directions can improve the quality of analysis corrections during assimilation steps. Even more, as the sub-space dimension increases, the optimization method can converge faster to posterior modes of analysis distributions.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Lab (AML-CS) at Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.",,Journal of Computational Science,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,53,,101373,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

The method exploits the information brought by ensemble members to estimate optimal radius lengths of model components. This estimation process is performed by using Bayes’ Theorem; our prior beliefs and likelihood functions are modeled via Gamma distributions: in priors, hyper-parameters are fixed based on our prior knowledge of error dynamics while to build likelihood functions, model parameters are fitted with empirical statistics from background ensembles at assimilation steps. Once the optimal radius lengths are estimated, a modified Cholesky decomposition is employed to estimate precision covariances of background error distributions. The assimilation process is then performed similarly to that of the EnKF based on a modified Cholesky decomposition (EnKF-MC). Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz-96 model. To compare our results, we employ an EnKF-MC implementation with different structures of background error correlations. In terms of ℓ 2 -norm of errors, the proposed filter implementation can outperform the EnKF-MC method for fixed radius lengths across all model components, and even more, different hyper-parameters can be tried in our filter formulation without degrading its convergence.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory (AML-CS) at Universidad del Norte, BAQ, COL.",,Journal of Computational Science,,,,2021-04,2021,,2021-04,51,,101328,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

A subregister of reports, lack of education in the population, inadequate empirical treatments, and medical underestimation are components of a public health problem that threatens patients' lives.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature of cutaneous myiasis associated with malignant wounds and skin cancer, characterizing sociodemographic variables, risk factors, clinical and histological features, and treatment. Additionally, we present a demonstrative case with the adequate taxonomic evaluation.
DISCUSSION: Cutaneous myiasis is an underestimated and poorly managed infestation, which can generate severe complications in oncological patients. This is the first systematic review in the literature about this clinical scenario, which provides information to the physician and clinical researcher about the epidemiological gaps and what has been published so far.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the current review have helped to display the sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical behavior of myiasis in skin cancer and malignant wounds. Its contribution to the greater tumor tissue destruction is clear; however, more studies are required. The therapeutic management in these patients is equally clarified.","Acknowledgments Dr. Daniel Cuestas wants to extend a special thanks to Drs.

Due to the complexity of providing mental health services to people from various cultures, there is much debate among GMH advocates regarding the best way to proceed. While biomedical interventions offer some degree of help, complementary approaches should focus on the social/community aspects. Many cultures conduct traditional rituals involving the communal use of psychoactive plants. We propose that these practices should be respected, protected, and promoted as valuable tools with regard to mental health care at the community level. The traditional use of psychoactive plants promotes community engagement and participation, and they are relatively affordable. Furthermore, the worldviews and meaning-making systems of local population are respected. The medical systems surrounding the use of psychoactive plants can be explained in biomedical terms, and many recently published clinical trials have demonstrated their therapeutic potential. Psychoactive plants and associated rituals offer potential benefits as complementary aspects of mental health services. They should be considered as such by international practitioners and advocates of the GMH movement.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.",Transcultural Psychiatry,,,Humans; Mental Health; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services,2021-10-19,2021,2021-10-19,2022-10,59,5,638-651,Closed,Article,"Ona, Genís; Berrada, Ali; Bouso, José Carlos","Ona, Genís (ICEERS – International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Anthropology, Philosophy and Social Work, Medical Anthropology Research Center (MARC), Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain); Berrada, Ali (Unidad de Medicina Interna, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain); Bouso, José Carlos (ICEERS – International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Anthropology, Philosophy and Social Work, Medical Anthropology Research Center (MARC), Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain)","Bouso, José Carlos (ICEERS – International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service, Barcelona, Spain; Rovira i Virgili University)","Ona, Genís (ICEERS – International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service, Barcelona, Spain; Rovira i Virgili University); Berrada, Ali (Hospital Del Mar); Bouso, José Carlos (ICEERS – International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service, Barcelona, Spain; Rovira i Virgili University)",12,8,2.05,5.42,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142016558,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Nevertheless, historical and recent large-interface and intermediate-depth slab earthquakes of moment magnitudes M w = 7.8 (Ecuador, 2016) and 7.2 (Colombia, 2012) evidenced the vast potential damage that vulnerable populations close to earthquake epicenters could experience. This article proposes a new empirical ground-motion prediction model for subduction events in northern South America, a regionalization of the global AG2020 ground-motion prediction equations. An updated ground-motion database curated by the Colombian Geological Survey is employed. It comprises recordings from earthquakes associated with the subduction of the Nazca plate gathered by the National Strong Motion Network in Colombia and by the Institute of Geophysics at Escuela Politécnica Nacional in Ecuador. The regional terms of our model are estimated with 539 records from 60 subduction events in Colombia and Ecuador with epicenters in the range of −0.6° to 7.6°N and 75.5° to 79.6°W, with M w ≥4.5, hypocentral depth range of 4 ≤ Z hypo ≤ 210 km, for distances up to 350 km. The model includes forearc and backarc terms to account for larger attenuation at backarc sites for slab events and site categorization based on natural period. The proposed model corrects the median AG2020 global model to better account for the larger attenuation of local ground motions and includes a partially non-ergodic variance model.","The authors thank Colombian Geological Survey for providing access to the recordings of the Colombian strong motion database, especially those within the group for the evaluation and monitoring of seismic activity. Discussions with Fernando Díaz-Parra at the Colombian Geological Survey helped in the characterization of the seismic stations, and the influence of local effects in GMMs. The work by undergraduate students Daniel Gómez, Pedro González, Natalia Lora, and Juliana Rivera at Universidad del Norte is greatly appreciated.

River deltas can present morphological variations caused by natural or anthropogenic factors, affecting the navigability conditions of cargo ships. In order to guarantee feasible conditions for the navigability of river deltas and reduce economic costs caused by dredging activities, further studies are required to assess the relationship between hydrological and hydrodynamic processes with the morphodynamic behavior along the river basin. This study evaluates the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions of the Magdalena River delta (Colombia) based on river discharges, water levels, and bathymetric information for the period 2006–2012. Moreover, linear-time-invariant systems (LTI) was developed to perform correlation analysis between the climatic oscillations, such as the ENSO, and the water level conditions in the Magdalena River. The bathymetric analysis showed unsteady morphological conditions along the river bed and high erosion rates during the studied period. The delta presented sedimentation conditions during El Niño years, or periods with negative discharge anomalies, and erosion rates during La Niña years, or periods with positive discharge anomalies. For intrannual scales, dry periods (January–April) presented sedimentation trends, whereas wet periods (September–December) exhibited significant erosion trends.","The authors thank CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brazil)-Finance Code 001 for the doctoral fellowship of the first author and CNPQ (PQ-2 308078/2019–5) for grant of the last author.

However, this practice has several challenges due to its stationary nature. Recently, a Rolling Weight Deflectometer (RWD), capable of measuring the pavement deflections at regular traffic speeds, has been introduced into the market. This research aims to develop a finite element (FE) model simulating pavement structural response under the moving RWD loads. This model could be further utilised for accurately estimating pavement layers mechanical characteristics. The model was successfully validated utilising the RAPTOR (a commercially available RWD) data collected on the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT) test track.

About half a percent of infertility cases are related to male-related factors. Male infertility is a complex disease that is the result of various insults as lifestyle issues, genetics, and epigenetic factors. Idiopathic infertility is responsible for 30% of total cases. The genetic factors responsible for male infertility include chromosomal abnormalities, deletions of chromosome Y, and mutations and genetic variations of key genes.
AREAS COVERED: In this review article, we aim to narrate performed studies on polymorphisms of essential genes involved in male infertility including folate metabolizing genes, oxidative stress-related genes, inflammation, and cellular pathways related to spermatogenesis. Moreover, possible pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for genetic polymorphisms are discussed.

Intercultural effectiveness was the factor that showed the most statistically significant improvement, while willingness to learn from and adapt to other cultures, openness to other cultures, and awareness of diversity developed to a lesser extent. In addition, the dimensions of attitude and knowledge showed improvement while skills demonstrated only slight change. Therefore, IB teaching can be improved by including well-planned international-intercultural classroom activities to promote not only discipline-related knowledge but also global competence development without relying on student mobility.","We would like to thank the Center for Teaching Excellence of the Universidad del Norte (CEDU), and especially Gina Camargo, Loraine Bruges, and Anthony Millán for their support with the use of statistical instruments.",,Journal of Teaching in International Business,,,,2021-01-02,2021,2021-05-29,2021-01-02,32,1,81-101,Closed,Article,"Corrales, Kathleen A.; Lombana-Coy, Jahir; Rey-Paba, Lourdes","Corrales, Kathleen A.

The experimental program results evaluating four natural aggregates (AF1, AF2, AF3, and AF4) and two Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA1 and RCA2), as presented here, were used in the model predictions. The SCMs used in this study consisted of fly ash class C (FA1), fly ash class F (FA2), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (SL), and silica fume (SF). For each SCMs, three levels of Portland cement replacements were used in the production of mortar bars: 15%-20%-25% for FA1-FA2; 20%-40%-60% for SL; and 5%-8%-10% for SF. The natural aggregates were tested according to the ASTM C1260 accelerated mortar bar test. For the RCA, an alternative preparation procedure was applied in the experimental phase to eliminate variability in the results given the RCA's high absorption. Further testing was then implemented for the aggregates classified as potentially reactive by evaluating different SCMs replacement levels to mitigate ASR using the accelerated mortar bar method, following the ASTM C1567. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the chemical index prediction uncertainty, based on the model inputs statistical variation. The SCMs evaluated in this investigation were effective in mitigating ASR while used in sufficient proportion. The most effective SCMs in reducing ASR was silica fume, with a 10% replacement of Portland cement's weight, fly ash class F was next (15–25%), and finally ground granulated blast-furnace slag (40–60%). The chemical index has proven to give good results when predicting the minimum replacement of supplementary cementitious materials required to suppress ASR based on its chemical composition.","This work was part of the Research Project 745/2016: contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105 supported by the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia – Colciencias and Universidad del Norte.

These concrete mixtures are mainly associated with incorporating Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM), which usually involve recycled materials or co-products from other processes, thus contributing to concrete production sustainability. Due to global warming and irreversible impacts on the planet, the circular economy and sustainability concepts are now of particular concern in the cement and concrete industry. Different ways to reduce the environmental impacts of Portland cement concrete include using SCM and Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) to replace natural aggregates. Despite there are no concrete structures made with RCA that have been reported showing signs of ASR, it is essential to check the potential reactivity of RCA to take the necessary corrections to use them safely. This paper includes a laboratory investigation on mitigating the ASR of RCA in PCC production by using several SCM (fly ash, slag, and silica fume) to achieve a more sustainable material, reducing the production cost and the environmental load associated. Results indicate that replacement levels of fly ash (FA, 20%), slag (SL, 40%), and silica fume (SF, 10%) were able to mitigate the alkali-silica reaction of one source of RCA successfully. The optimum dosage of RCA is suggested to be between 25 and 50% (by weight of total coarse aggregate) for mixes containing fly ash and 50–100% for silica fume and slag mixes, respectively. The work also involves a life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental benefits depending on the SCM used and the aggregate portion replaced by RCA on PCC mixtures. SCM and RCA in concrete mixtures significantly reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy demand due to lower Portland cement contents.","This work was part of the Research Project 745/2016: contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105 supported by Universidad del Norte and the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia – COLCIENCIAS.

The prominent features of coral reefs, including the delineation of reef morphological structure, wave energy dissipation and wave transformation processes are obtained in a reef lagoon in San Andres Island, Colombia. Results show that reef attenuates incident waves by approximately 75 % due to both frictional processes and wave breaking, with an equivalent bottom roughness of 0.20 m and a wave friction factor of 0.18. These parameters are comparable with estimates reported in other shallow coral reef lagoons as well as at seagrass meadows obtained using in‐situ measurements. Also, the mean height of the reef elements H  bed  and its standard deviation σ  b  are also estimated in the entire radar coverage area. H  bed  and σ  b  (0.5 and 7.66 cm respectively) are in the same order of magnitude of measured data reported by previous studies and in good agreement with the geometric parameters proposed by in‐canopy flow models for branched species, such as Stylophora and Pocillopora , which are also common in the coral carpets of San Andres Island. This work proposes a completely novel use for X‐Band radars by describing prominent features in barrier‐reef systems including the delineation of the reef structure and wave energy dissipation. 
Plain Language Summary  Coral reefs are diverse and vulnerable ecosystems that protect the coast by dissipating wave energy through a highly heterogeneous seabed. Indeed, reef health determines the bottom roughness and the coral reef capabilities of attenuation and coastal protection. Recently, coral reef health has declined due to coastal development and climate change, thus decreasing coastal protection from wave‐driven erosion and flooding. From the necessity of detailed and continuous measurements of hydrodynamics on coral reefs this research proposes a completely novel use for X‐Band radars by describing prominent features in the barrier‐reef system in San Andres Island, Colombia, including the delineation of the reef structure and the wave energy dissipation analysis in the lagoon. Model‐predicted data and in‐situ wave measurements, are used to validate radar‐derived estimates in the coverage area (i.e., 9.8 square kilometers). Results reveal that the reef attenuates incident waves by approximately 75 % and the wave energy dissipation can be studied through a spectral methodology. Also, the mean height of the reef elements is also estimated. Hence, a new research in the assessment of threats to coral reefs is introduced by combining multiple data sources (i.e., marine radars, in‐situ sensors and numerical modeling) to provide more detailed information that can be used for coastal management services. 
Key Points    We evaluate the efficacy of X‐band marine radar for measuring waves across a shallow barrier reef, through assessment with observations   In combination with modeling, the radar data are used to compute the wave friction factor, bottom roughness, and height of bed elements   We demonstrate the potential for radar‐derived wave observations as a tool for monitoring and management of coral reef environments","Acknowledgments This research has been possible thanks to financial support from Colombian Science and Technology Ministry Projects FP44842‐144‐2016 (Wave propagation and sediment transport on coral reefs) and 0376‐2013 (Developing and modeling of a sea state sensor through the processing of radar signals).

The MRCPSP covers problems where activities can be executed in several ways or modes, and is affected by parameters such as their duration, temporary relationships with other activities, and renewable and non-renewable resource requirements. The objective of the MRCPSP is to select a combination of time/resources to minimize the duration of the project and complete all activities while satisfying all resource constraints and precedence relationships. Here, we describe a memetic algorithm to solve the MRCPSP. This algorithm uses the components of genetic algorithms and variable neighborhoods search to implement (1) an adaptation of the uniform crossover operator, and (2) a local search to assess agents’ performance that appropriately guides the evolution of the algorithm and hence generate better solutions. We implement a metaheuristic strategy and compare its performance for solving different instances of the standard PSPLIB and MMLIB libraries. Overall, our memetic algorithm provides suitable solutions for the MRCPSP and shows outstanding performance in all tested instances.","LFM-D was supported by the Colombian Agency for Research and Development (COLCIENCIAS), contract FP44842-068-2018, and receive a Ph.D. scholarship from Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

Coastal meteo-marine parameters of Hurricane Matthew along the Colombian Caribbean coast: Establishing a baseline of knowledge. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(1), 6676. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The hurricanes on the Colombian continental coast have been lower in intensity and number than in other areas of the Caribbean Sea. Thus, given the lack of knowledge about the hurricane parameters in this area, the protocols to deal with a hurricane emergency on the Columbian continental coast are not clear. This work analyzes the meteo-marine parameters caused in Colombia by the passage of Hurricane Matthew to establish a baseline of knowledge. Further progress in understanding the effects the hurricane may have had on several coastal areas, particularly in the areas of hydrology, morphological changes, storm surge, and flood, is expected in future work. The results show that the most significant meteo-marine parameter was the swell generated by the hurricane; although it followed a NW trajectory toward the coast, the swell reached up to 4.5 m of significant wave height and a peak period of 14 seconds. Also, the accumulated rainfall in only 3 days significantly exceeded the average monthly values of October (the rainiest month of the year). This effect is of particular interest given that recent modeling studies established an increase in precipitation rates associated with tropical hurricanes. The wind was not significant with respect to typical values in the zone.","We thank the Instituto de Hidrologa, Meteorologa y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM) of Colombia, La Direccin de Investigacin Desarrollo e Innovacin (DIDI) of Universidad del Norte, and Centro de Investigaciones Oceanogrficas e Hidrogrficas (CIOH) de La Direccin Martima (DIMAR) of Colombia.",,Journal of Coastal Research,,,,2021-09-24,2021,2021-09-24,,38,1,66-76,Closed,Article,"Royero, Juan C.

We used a sample of 63 children and adolescents (65% girls), between 7 and 18 years with an average age of 12.67 (SD = 3.07). The subjects were administered the questionnaire on resilience in children and adolescents, which consists of three factors: internal protective factor, external protective factor and empathy. The results showed that both groups had higher levels of resilience than the theoretical median.

Therefore, to mitigate pollution's effect on insulator performance, utility operators should frequently wash insulator chains. However, this process is not an easy task and brings extra costs due to the conventional maintenance planning that defines the washing cycles. This conventional procedure does not take into account the actual insulator pollution, but rather human experience. Thus, washing cycles may occur either when the pollution is not extensive or when it already affects the reliability of the system. Hence, the paper presents a novel method to predict the adequate time to wash the insulators based on the characteristics of leakage current in a substation on the north coast of Colombia. The method then uses the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart to determine the appropriate days to wash insulator chains. Results show that the proposed method obtains a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the leakage current two orders of magnitude smaller than the actual method. Hence, the proposed method is a useful tool for maintenance planning in utilities.","The authors would like to thank the Power System Research Group GISEL of the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellín, for the financial support to conduct this research.

Nevertheless, there are no guidelines to estimate the capacity for a cold-formed built-up box-beam composed of two C-sections in contact, considering weld seam spacing as a relevant constraint. This research compares the nominal flexural strength of a beam section, determined by theoretical formulations described in AISI S100-16, and experimental investigation on 20 beams, considering four seam-weld spacings (ranging from 0 mm -continuous- to 900 mm). The length of the specimens was 1800 mm, with a cross-section of 220 mm × 160 mm; the base material thickness was 1.5 mm. The experimental and analytical evidence suggests that a maximum separation between seam welds ( a max ), calculated as a mean value between the theoretical distortional buckling lengths for the single C-section ( L crd - S ) and the box-section ( L crd - D ), results in a reasonable parameter to guarantee the maximum capacity of the box section.

However, detecting human activities with signals from kinetic harvesters still needs improvement due to the use of approaches based on handcrafted features and the overfitting to device location or subjects. Hence, in this article, we present a deep learning architecture that leverages the feature extraction capability of the convolutional neural networks and the construction of the temporal sequences of recurrent neural networks to improve existing classification results. To provide sufficient data for the deep learning classifier, we propose three data augmentation methods to increase intraclass variance simulating new users performing the same activities. The proposed architecture outperforms existing approaches of kinetic harvesting-based human activity recognition by 13% of accuracy when the training data are augmented with the proposed methods. Finally, given the dependency of kinetic harvesting signals on device location and subjects, we employ transfer learning to improve the classification performance when the system is exposed to new subjects and locations. Transfer learning helps to increase classification performance by 30% when the device location is changed and 35% when the data come from a new subject.",,"This work was supported in part by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología eInnovación (COLCIENCIAS) under Grant 809-2018.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2021-06-29,2021,2021-06-29,2022-01-15,9,10,7545-7558,Closed,Article,"Manjarrés, José; Lan, Guohao; Gorlatova, Maria; Hassan, Mahbub; Pardo, Mauricio","Manjarrés, José (Department of Engineering, Olivet Nazarene University, Bourbonnais, IL, 60914, USA); Lan, Guohao (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27705, USA); Gorlatova, Maria (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27705, USA); Hassan, Mahbub (School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia); Pardo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 0800101, Colombia)","Manjarrés, José (Olivet Nazarene University)","Manjarrés, José (Olivet Nazarene University); Lan, Guohao (Duke University); Gorlatova, Maria (Duke University); Hassan, Mahbub (UNSW Sydney); Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",8,7,,3.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139256200,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing; 4611 Machine Learning,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

                    Background and Aims
                    In the last decades, clinical research biomarker (BM) to improve assessment of kidney function have been intensive, and proenkephalin (PENK) has been identified as a new BM of filtration. We hypothesized whether PENK would have a better accuracy for the diagnosis of severe AKI than serum cystatin (CYS) and the serum creatinine (Scr). We evaluate patient in the peri op of liver transplant (LT).
                  
                  
                    Method
                    Blood samples were collected during the pre and post (until 48 hours) operative (op.) period of LT in 57 eligible patients. Where was analyzed PENK (Sphingotest®), CYS (Milipex) and Scr (Quimioluminence). AKI diagnosis was based on the Kidney Disease International Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria using Scr. KDIGO 1 was subclassified according to the International Club of Ascites (ICA).
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Of the 57 patients undergoing LT, 50 (88%) developed AKI according to the KDIGO criteria in the first week after LT. Twenty-one patients without AKI and with KDIGO 1-A (37%) were summarized as the no AKI/mild AKI group, whereas 36 patients with KDIGO 1-B, 2 and 3 (63%) were summarized as the severe AKI group. Before the intra - operative insult only PENK was significantly higher in patients that developed severe AKI, median 55 [P25-75(44,25 – 94,55)] in no AKI/mild AKI versus 90,16 [P25-75(64,70 – 135,76)] pmol/l in severe AKI p 0,021, an AUC 0,685 (CI 0,536 – 0,833), with a cutoff 55 pmol/l, sensibility of 0,86 and specificity 0,52, accuracy 0,75 to severe AKI. Scr levels in pre-op. were non- significantly higher in severe AKI; p=0,088. The CYS in the pre-op was similar within the groups. Pos-operative 48 hours after LT, PENK was significantly higher in severe AKI, median 81 [P25-75(61,25 – 101,50)] versus 161,45 [P25-75(122,85 – 294,03)] in severe AKI - p <0,0001 an AUC 0,83 (CI 0,72 - 0,94) with a cutoff 119,05 pmol/l, sensibility of 0,80 and specificity 0,90, accuracy 0,84 to severe AKI. Scr levels in post-op achieve an AUC 0,77 (CI 0,63 - 0,92) with a cutoff 1,49mg/dl, sensibility of 0,94, specificity 0,67 and accuracy 0,82. In a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for age, anestesia time, urine output and fluid balance, the PENK only was independently associated of severe AKI in pre-op. with OR 4,40 (CI 1,40 – 13,88) – p0,001 and the post-op. with OR 44,64 (CI 5,40 – 368,5) – p<0,0001.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    PENK is a promisor filtration biomarker and showed a better acuracy to severe AKI in pre-operative than standard AKI diagnostic by Scr. Prediction of severe AKI in pre-operative period by PENK can help the management of these patients in the future.",,,Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,,,,2021-05-29,2021,2021-05-29,2021-05-29,36,Supplement_1,gfab083.0015,Closed,Article,"Lima, Camila; Macedo, Etienne","Lima, Camila (University São Paulo, Department of Internal Medicine, São Paulo, Brazil); Macedo, Etienne (University of California San Diego, Department of Medicine, Nephrology Division, CA, United States of America)",,"Lima, Camila (Universidade de São Paulo); Macedo, Etienne (University of California, San Diego)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138469382,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

1743,pub.1143532077,10.1111/geb.13432,,,Effects of consecutive dry and wet days on the forest–savanna boundary in north‐west South America,"Abstract  Aim Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, mainly the amount and seasonality of precipitation, fire regime, soil properties and species adaptation strategies, have been invoked to explain the existence of the tropical savanna–humid forest transition. We explored the rainfall variables that influence the probability of forest or savanna occurring in north‐west South America, specifically monthly precipitation and the mean and maximum duration of wet and dry spells, defined as the number of consecutive wet (dry) days.   Location North‐west South America.   Time period 1980–2017.   Major taxa studied Savanna and humid forest.   Methods We used a set of logistic generalized linear models to assess the effect of multiple variables on the probability of occurrence of forest. Predictor variables included monthly precipitation, mean monthly dry and wet spells and maximum monthly dry and wet spells.   Results The probability of forest (savanna) occurrence depends mostly on the average duration of dry and wet spells and the interaction between these two variables, whereas the effect of total monthly precipitation is marginal. Dry spell duration had the largest effect on the probability of forest occurrence, which decreased by 7.5% for each additional consecutive dry day. For wet spells, the probability of forest occurrence increased by 4.1% for each additional consecutive wet day. Our model shows that the savanna–forest transition takes place under an average combination of dry spells lasting 8–10 days and wet spells lasting 1–3 days during the dry season (December–February). This combination changes to dry spells lasting 1–3 days and wet spells lasting 4–6 days during the wet season (May–July).   Main conclusions This study reveals the importance of using precipitation data with a fine temporal scale to investigate forest–savanna distribution and indicates the limited explanatory power of aggregated precipitation variables (e.g., monthly and annual values). Models that assess the effect of climate change should therefore incorporate precipitation variables acquired at finer temporal resolution.","We thank Dr Mark Brenner for his corrections to the grammar of an earlier version of this manuscript.

New species proposed are Crella (Pytheas) chiloensis Fernandez, Gastaldi, Pardo Hajdu, sp. nov., from southern Chile (15 m depth), C.

These new species are set apart from each other and from known species mainly due to aspects of their spiculation. Chelae microscleres and acanthostyles supply characters that might be used to infer phylogenetic relationships and to verify the monophyly of Crella Gray, 1867 and Crellidae, which has seemingly been contradicted by preliminary molecular data available in the systematics literature. Our own interpretation of phylogenetic affinities, in the light of morphological characters from previous taxonomic studies, argues for a classification reassessment of materials (vouchers) included in these molecular phylogenies, especially in the case of Crella incrustans (Carter, 1885).

This paper reports the permanent deformation response of simulative (laboratory-scale) inverted pavements with various thickness combinations through the use of two laboratory devices. A new analytical methodology is implemented to predict rutting based on the linear-viscous approach, which replaces the material’s elastic modulus with viscosities in a multi-layer linear analysis that calculates strain rates in pavement layers by using KENLAYER, to ultimately estimate rutting. The application of the newly developed methodology results in predicting pavement rutting within a range of ± 22% of the measured values and represents a step forward in predicting rutting in actual/real inverted pavements.","The authors would like to thank Mirpur University of Science and Technology (MUST), Mirpur AJK Pakistan and University of Nottingham, UK for their financial assistance to carry this research project.

In the Drift Flux Model, mean drift velocity of the gas phase is estimated by using a Dispersed-Phase Distribution Coefficient and Gas Drift Velocity closure relationships. This study investigates the hydrodynamic of the slug flow regime with high-viscous liquids, and develops an equation for the Distribution Coefficient. Simulation cases were run with inclination angles varying from 0° (horizontal direction) to 90° (vertical upward) and a 0.051m-ID pipe. OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD software, was used to numerically solve the two-phase flow problem. A detailed methodology to estimate drift flux parameters from the data stored at each grid block is presented. This step-by-step methodology allows researchers to further develop the constitutive equations for Distribution Coefficient and the Drift Velocity for other cases. Simulated results were compared with experimental data from the literature and other published models for horizontal and vertical pipes. The results showed that this CFD modeling approach is suitable for representing actual slug flow in pipes. The newly developed Distribution Coefficient constitutive equation has less than 10% absolute average relative error for the viscosity range of 0.14 to 1.120 P a · s , and pipe inclinations from 0° to 90°.","OpenFOAM cases and files used to post-process the data are distributed with CC0 license to allow transparency.

However, the extent to which right ventricular (RV) dysfunction contributes to myocardial dysfunction and a poor prognosis in sepsis remains unknown. Our aim is to investigate the association between RV dysfunction and mortality in patients with sepsis.   Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature. We systematically searched Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science for full-text articles from inception to June 2020. Studies were included if they reported RV function and mortality in patients with sepsis using echocardiography. Data was extracted using a collection form designed a priori . Significance was determined by a two-tailed p value < 0.05. The present study was registered in the PROSPERO (CRD42020204423).   Hypothesis: RV dysfunction is associated to mortality in adult patients with sepsis.   Results: Six studies including 526 patients were selected for final analysis. Patients had a mean age of 57 years, 45% were females, and there was an overall mortality of 37%. In three studies, transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 24h of sepsis diagnosis, and reported Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) in a total of 366 patients. In pooled analysis, survivors had a higher TAPSE compared to non-survivors ((SMD):1.89 (95%CI 0.14-3.655) p=0.03, Figure1). All other parameters of RV dysfunction assessed did not have a statistically significant difference between survivors and non-survivors (Figure 2-6).   Conclusion: RV dysfunction as demonstrated by a lower TAPSE is associated with higher mortality in patients with sepsis and/or septic shock. This data suggest that RV dysfunction is an important contributor to sepsis-associated myocardial dysfunction and worsening prognosis in patients with sepsis.",,,Circulation,,,,2021-11-16,2021,,2021-11-16,144,Suppl_1,a10066-a10066,Closed,Article,"Del Rio-Pertuz, Gaspar; Toro, Juan; Triana, Abel; Singh, Sneha; Gomez, Hernando","Del Rio-Pertuz, Gaspar (Dept of Internal Medicine, Texas T, Lubbock, TX); Toro, Juan (Critical Care Medicine, Univ of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA); Triana, Abel (Dept of Internal Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Singh, Sneha (Dept of Internal Medicine, Guthrie Robert Packer Hosp, Sayre, PA); Gomez, Hernando (Critical Care Medicine, Univ of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA)",,"Del Rio-Pertuz, Gaspar (Dept of Internal Medicine, Texas T, Lubbock, TX); Toro, Juan (University of Pittsburgh); Triana, Abel (Universidad del Norte); Singh, Sneha (Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital); Gomez, Hernando (University of Pittsburgh)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146420355,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Initially, we develop a tractable implementation of the LW estimator in high-dimensional probability spaces such as those found in the context of operational data assimilation. We employ this well-conditioned, full-rank covariance matrix estimator to approximate background error covariances and to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations during assimilation steps. The proposed formulation can be coupled within the EnKF framework to derive a matrix-free implementation via an iterative Woodbury formula. Experimental tests are performed by using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model. The numerical results are compared with those of the EnKF based on the Rao–Blackwell Ledoit, and Wolf covariance matrix estimator (EnKF-RBLW) wherein Gaussian assumptions are a must on prior members. The outcomes reveal that the use of the proposed filter can mitigate the impact of spurious correlations during assimilation stages, and even more, the proposed method can improve on the results of the EnKF-RBLW as a consequence of the Gaussian relaxation on prior errors.","This work was supported in part by award UN 2018-38, and by the Applied Math and Computer Science Lab at Universidad del Norte, Colombia .",,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,384,,113163,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Guzman, Luis; Jabba, Daladier","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

Integrating a phase change material in the hybrid module (PVT-PCM), a lower and stable operating temperature is achieved. The baseline for the experimental comparison is established by an experimental campaign that includes simultaneous operation of a hybrid PVT-PCM module and a traditional photovoltaic (PV) module. Both photovoltaic modules used are from the same manufacturer, model, and technical specifications. Before the modification to a hybrid PVT-PCM module, a difference in electrical performance between the photovoltaic modules is quantified to determine the factual effect of the modification. After the modification, the daily electrical efficiency of the hybrid PVT-PCM increased a 7.43% with respect to the traditional PV module. In addition, the daily hybrid efficiency of the PVT-PCM module reaches 31.35%, while the daily electrical efficiency of the PV module is 13.12%, which translates to a total increase of 20.45% in the capability to extract useful energy from the sun for the PVT-PCM module.","This study was possible thanks to the “Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para las Regiones: Atlántico” regional government doctoral scholarship program, and the “Es tiempo de volver” program of MINCIENCIAS.",,Renewable Energy,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,172,,680-696,Closed,Article,"Carmona, Mauricio; Bastos, Alberto Palacio; García, José Doria","Carmona, Mauricio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bastos, Alberto Palacio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); García, José Doria (Department of Electric Electronic Engineering, Universidad Del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Bastos, Alberto Palacio (Universidad del Norte); García, José Doria (Universidad del Norte)",111,68,,37.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136424523,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Gradients in the incident flux, a consequence of the natural variability of the solar resource on the earth’s surface, and temperature limits must be considered in the operation of the system, due to corrosive phenomena caused by the interaction between the metal alloys used on the receiveŕs tubes and the molten salt. Furthermore, considering thermal stresses in the receiver as operational constraints leads to the prevention of fractures and has the potential to improve the lifespan of the subsystem. In this work, a novel control strategy is tested in a simulated power plant with a nominal thermal power of 450 MW and a solar field with 6482 heliostats. A flux-feedback closed-loop control law is proposed, which manipulates the swarm behavior of groups of aiming points for heliostats in the solar field and also reduces each iteration the information from the incident flux on the receiver’s surface into one variable per group. This work established that the proposed controller can reach a steady-state with a configuration of aiming points, which is close to the optimal solution obtained by a hybrid optimization approach, but much faster and with less computational resources.

Los resultados presentan una alta variabilidad en la dieta de grupos que consumen recursos mixtos marinos y terrestres, además de maíz. Se reporta la presencia de objetos no locales que sugiere que Pica efectivamente actuó como un punto intermedio entre el litoral y el altiplano. No se observa ninguna relación entre el ajuar funerario y la dieta. Se sugiere que bajo un contexto de armonía social las poblaciones de la costa y el oasis de Pica estuvieron en contacto permanente.
We present the results of interdisciplinary research on the topic of diet and mobility in the arheic zone of northern Chile during the Late Intermediate period (AD 900–1450), based on the study of the Pica-8 cemetery. A strategic location between the Altiplano and the coast, Pica-8 was used by an agrarian population that grew tropical and semitropical species of plants, especially maize, and engaged in highly sophisticated craft production. During the development of the Pica-Tarapacá complex, resources moved between inland oases and the coast, based on the evidence of marine species found in the valleys and vice versa. We describe the Pica-8 population using radiocarbon dates and stable isotope analysis to gain insight into diet and mobility. We also consider the relationship between diet, mobility, and funerary contexts. Results demonstrate that diet was quite variable, with groups eating a mix of marine and terrestrial resources, as well as maize. The presence of nonlocal objects suggests that Pica acted as a contact point between the coast and the Altiplano. No relationship was found between funerary context and diet. We conclude that coastal and Pica oasis populations were in permanent contact and that their relations were characterized by social harmony.","El primer autor agradece las facilidades otorgadas para el estudio de la Colección Ancker Nielsen del Museo Regional de Iquique.

These wet conditions are caused by the presence of a tropical low-level atmospheric current known as the Chocó low level Jet that transports moisture from the Pacific Ocean to the Andes of Colombia and is responsible for a large portion of moisture entering the continent, reaching as far as the Eastern Cordillera. In order to understand better the climate and ecosystem dynamics of such a wet region, we investigated the past hydroclimate and environmental conditions of a yet an unexplored area, the Medellincito wetland at 2020 m above sea level, located on the water divide of the Western Cordillera of Colombia, under the direct influence of the Chocó Jet. Our results indicate that between ∼6680 and 3710 cal yr BP the wetland had permanent waters and was surrounded by forest. This suggests wet conditions with a strong and persistent Chocó Jet. From ∼3710 to ∼1560 cal yr BP, the wetland dried out and open vegetation dominated by grasses replaced the forest. Later on, between ∼1200 and 750 cal yr BP the wetland formed again although with shallow waters, while open vegetation continued to expand. Humid conditions and the forest were re-established after 750 cal yr BP. We hypothesize that dry conditions in an otherwise very wet area were caused by the weakening of the Chocó Jet, possibly associated with ENSO-moderated changes in the temperature of the Pacific Ocean that coincided with changes in the position, relative to today’s, of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This record highlights that the ecosystems’ dynamics in the Chocó biogeographic region are highly responsive to variations in moisture from the Chocó Jet, which in turn depends on temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. With current global change leading to the warming of the oceans, this highly biodiverse region can potentially be transformed into grass-rich ecosystems as it had occurred in the past.","Colciencias supported this research through the program “Jóvenes Investigadores” to D.

Novel protection schemes with an adaptive approach should be developed to guarantee the protection of ADN under all their operating conditions. This paper proposes an ADN adaptive protection methodology, which is based on an intelligent approach fault detector over locally available measurements. This approach uses Machine Learning (ML) based techniques to reduce the strong dependence of the adaptive protection schemes on the availability of communication systems and to determine if, over a fault condition, an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) should operate considering the changes in operational conditions of an ADN. Additionally, the methodology takes into account different and remarkable recommendations for the use of ML techniques. The proposed methodology is validated on the modified IEEE 34-nodes test feeder. Additionally, it takes into consideration typical features of ADN and micro-grids like the load imbalance, reconfiguration, changes in impedance upstream from the micro-grid, and off-grid/on-grid operation modes. The results demonstrate the flexibility and simplicity of the methodology to determine the best accuracy performance among several ML models. Besides, they show the methodology’s versatility to find the suitable ML model for IEDs located on different zones of an ADN. The ease of design’s implementation, formulation of parameters, and promising test results indicate the potential for real-life applications.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación - Colciencias (now Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - Minciencias) by call contest “Convocatoria 757 de 2017” and “Convocatoria 852 - Conectando conocimiento de 2019” - Project INTEGRA 2023.",,Applied Soft Computing,,,,2021-01,2021,,2021-01,98,,106839,Closed,Article,"Marín-Quintero, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Percybrooks, W.S.; Vélez, Juan C.; Montoya, Oscar Danilo; Gil-González, W.","Marín-Quintero, J.

Several protection schemes have been developed towards a reliable operation on these type of networks, however, the methods are strongly dependent on robust communication systems. This paper presents a decentralized adaptive protection scheme and introduces a data-driven and communication-less approach. The presented solution uses an Artificial Neural Network to train Intelligent Electronic Devices as fault classifiers, also, it uses a cuckoo search metaheuristic to its quasi-optimal adjustment. The Artificial Neural Network enables each classifier to detect faults with only local voltage and current measurements. Presented solution does not assume communication between devices, however, each device brings support to their neighboring devices as back-up protection. Further, system dynamics on the electrical network, such as, changes of topologies, micro-grid status or Distributed Energy Resources outage are considered. The time coordination is simple and easily adjustable due to each fault label of the data-driven model has its own time operation. The presented method is validated on the modified IEEE 34-nodes test feeder. The results of the adaptive protection scheme show accuracy values above of 96% and dependability of 99%. Also, the solution reveals a correlation between the location and the combination of features and hyper-parameters for each Intelligent Electronic Device. The method is development to be easy-to-implement, without hard-to-design parameters, and with highlights potential aspects for real-life applications.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTEI del sistema general de regalías SGR, and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación - COLCIENCIAS (now Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - Minciencias) by call contest ‘‘Convocatoria 757 de 2017’’ and ‘‘Convocatoria 852 - Conectando conocimiento de 2019’’ – Project Integra2023, code 111085271060, contract 80740-774-2020..",,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2021-09,2021,,2021-09,130,,106960,Closed,Article,"Marín-Quintero, J.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Velez, Juan C.; Bretas, A.S.","Marín-Quintero, J.

1624,pub.1141999865,10.1002/cae.22466,,,A gamification strategy in engineering education—A case study on motivation and engagement,"Abstract Classical teaching–learning methods have been widely used in higher education. However, current teaching and evaluation methodologies are incorporating dynamic techniques that allow greater student participation in the learning process. It is essential that the classic model of education adapts to the changes in society and uses proper tools to encourage motivation in the education process. Gamification approaches generate motivation in the students and can lead to enhance the learning processes and outcomes. These strategies offer an alternative that is being used increasingly in higher education. Therefore, in this study, we developed a gamification strategy to generate motivation and engagement in engineering students. The strategy is applied in different courses and both in traditional and remote modalities. The validation of the proposal was carried out through a diagnostic tool in the form of a survey applied to the students of the courses where the gamified strategies were implemented. From these results we concluded that the gamified strategy helped to increase the motivation and engagement of the students, generating greater participation in the academic activities.",,,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,,,,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,2022-03,30,2,472-482,Closed,Article,"Gamarra, Margarita; Dominguez, Anderson; Velazquez, Jhonnys; Páez, Heyder","Gamarra, Margarita (Department of Computational Science and Electronic, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia); Dominguez, Anderson (Bacherlor's Program, Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios UNIMINUTO—Sede Barranquilla, Barranquilla, Colombia); Velazquez, Jhonnys (Electronic Engineering Program, Electronic Engineering, Politécnico de la Costa Atlántica, Barranquilla, Colombia); Páez, Heyder (Electronic Engineering Program, Electronic Engineering, Politécnico de la Costa Atlántica, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Gamarra, Margarita (University of the Coast)","Gamarra, Margarita (University of the Coast); Dominguez, Anderson (Bacherlor's Program, Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios UNIMINUTO—Sede Barranquilla, Barranquilla, Colombia); Velazquez, Jhonnys (Politécnico de la Costa Atlántica); Páez, Heyder (Politécnico de la Costa Atlántica)",17,14,,11.37,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141999865,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems; 40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,4 Quality Education

These parameters were obtained from the MOHID numerical model outputs, which were implemented and calibrated for the MMRD. Analysis of the spatio-temporal variability of φ and β indicated stratification at different mouth zones, and the spatio-temporal variability of R L and P indicated a mixing process. Results show that during the dry season, the mixing zone of the MMRD presents its maximum intra-annual variability, and during El Niño conditions, it has its highest interannual variability. Further, the maximum penetration of the salt wedge occurs during El Niño - dry season conditions. On the other hand, during the wet season, the salt wedge is located at the mouth entrance, independent of the ENSO phase. During La Niña conditions, the mixing zone restricts its intra-annual variability to around 0 km of the MMRD.","This research was partially funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia (MINCIENCIAS).

Incorporating wood by-products in asphalt materials helped improve the performance and mitigate the stated problems, but little work was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating wood ashes at the Nanoscale. Therefore, the aim is to study the effects of different Nano wood ashes on the performance of asphalt binder and mixtures. The mechanically-processed Nano wood ashes were used to produce asphalt binder and mixtures at 1%, 3%, and 5% by weight. Initially, X-ray diffraction was used to study chemical properties and Nano-size of wood ashes. The rheological and mechanical properties of modified binders and mixtures were assessed through physical tests, performance grading, frequency sweep, wheel tracker, dynamic modulus, four-point beam fatigue, bitumen bond strength, and rolling bottle tests. The results showed a significant improvement in rutting and moisture resistance and an insignificant effect on fatigue resistance of modified materials with increased concentration of all Nano-wood ashes. Overall, the results illustrated that incorporating nano-wood ash in asphalt materials can be regarded as an effective alternative for pavement applications that could minimise waste material disposal.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Civil engineering department at the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila.

The fossil-fuel dependence of trigeneration/cogeneration systems presses for maximizing energy conversion rates. Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) from natural gas engine exhaust represents a significant opportunity to improve fuel utilization. This study presents a thermoeconomic analysis of a novel WHR system consisting of a Vortex Tube heat booster coupled to the exhaust stream of a 2000 kW natural gas engine that drives a Supercritical CO2 Brayton Cycle (SCBC). SCBC operates under two different configurations, namely Regenerative and Recompression. Results indicate that implementing the Vortex Tube (or Ranque-Hilsch tube) increases energy and exergy efficiencies up to around 1.85% and reduces exergy destruction by approximately 4–8%. The Recompression SCBC features higher thermal and exergy efficiencies, while the Regenerative SCBC results in higher power output. Economic indicators reveal that the energy production cost of the Recompression configuration is significantly lower than that of the Regenerative. The turbine features the highest share of total equipment cost, with around 40–50%, followed by the heater and regenerators. The proposed WHR system can potentially recover up to around 7.8% of the total engine power output and provide an electricity price lower than 0.3 $·kWh−1 with a payback period in the range of 8–12 years. Heat exchangers represent an opportunity to improve thermoeconomic performance since they significantly increase exergy costing and limit overall efficiency.

The optimization model consists of a mixed integer linear formulation, aiming at maximizing the expected net present value of the entire SC, including electricity supplied to the national grid by this activity. The model considers different products, types of warehouses, transportation modes, and export options, reflecting as far as possible the current situation of the oil palm industry in Colombia. It sets as free variables the location of the storage and production facilities, their expansion possibilities, and the flows of all feedstock and final products involved in the SC. The model constitutes a quantitative decision-making tool in the area of strategic design and optimal planning of biomass-based SCs. The optimal solution obtained by the model presents a more rational distribution of the production units in comparison with the current situation.","The authors are grateful for the support of the Government of Magdalena, the project of scholarships General System of Regalías (SGR) doctorate Nacional Colombia [Not. 672], the Universidad del Norte (Colombia) and the CYKLOS research group of the National University of Tucumán (Argentina).",,Computers & Chemical Engineering,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,146,,107208,Closed,Article,"González, Darwin Peña; Borda, Daniel Cortés; Mele, Fernando D.; Sarmiento, Agustín Barrios; Santiago, Mildred Domínguez","González, Darwin Peña (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Borda, Daniel Cortés (Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia); Mele, Fernando D.

In doing so, this paper builds on the empirical and theoretical work of capability scholars which has looked at the role of English in educational settings. It highlights the importance of viewing linguistic capabilities as inchoative since viewing them as fully formed can obscure injustices. These injustices can include poor quality English language education (ELE), an unfavourable financial situation, and a lack of opportunities for exposure to and practice of English. This last-mentioned injustice foregrounds another important dimension of linguistic capabilities: their inter-subjective, relational nature. To aid in this conceptualisation, the paper also draws on Phillipson’s [1992. Linguistic Imperialism. Oxford: Oxford University Press] theory of linguistic imperialism to better illustrate how English is implicated in asymmetrical power relations which give rise to oppression and domination. However, this paper also shows how some injustices can be navigated by educationally resilient individuals.

Insights from Chris Freeman’s thinking,"In recent years a concept gaining much traction amongst both economic and policy communities is that of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (EE). We are interested in this concept because it has clear roots in innovation system thinking and can be argued to represent a contemporary iteration of ideas around systemic understandings and policy approaches to economic development, innovation, and entrepreneurship. In our work we have been exploring the links between earlier innovation systems and newer entrepreneurial ecosystem concepts. In this essay, we expand this line of thinking by interrogating the EE concept from the perspective of the work of Christopher Freeman, often called the father of innovation studies. It is our argument that by combining contemporary debates in EE with the more ‘classic’ literatures from the innovation systems cannon, we can gain a deeper understanding of the trinity of economic development, innovation, and entrepreneurship to be of benefit both to the research and policy communities. Specifically, in this paper we zoom in on two specific elements of Freeman’s thinking on innovation systems: context specificity and evolutionary dynamics and push EE thinking forward using these insights.",,Jana Schmutzler is grateful for the financial support this research received from Colciencias through grant 121577657885.

                    This paper argues that decentralization reforms in Colombia, implemented since the 1980s, have led to the decentralization of political clientelism rather than its demise. Clientelism is a system of political and economic institutions that turns every local democracy into an extractive political institution. The authors theoretically demonstrate that an increase in public resources will increase corruption.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The authors develop and test a subnational public choice model, where clientelism in elections and corruption in public administration constitute a stable long-term institutional equilibrium. The model comprises two linked subgames: electoral tournament and corruption in public policy. The model makes two predictions that currently oppose predominant approaches: (1) increasing the severity of jail sentences to electoral crimes increases their price and the predominance of machine politics, instead of improving the quality of electoral tournaments and (2) increasing local governments' public finance increases clientelism in elections and corruption in public administration.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The authors find evidence in favor of the theoretical model of curse of public resources, using difference-in-differences estimation with a database 2016–17 of Colombia's 1,034 municipalities. This country is well-suited for our analysis because it has a long-term commitment to formal democratic processes (since 1958), while plagued by endemic corruption and clientelism problems.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    (1) The theoretical approach is innovative and disruptive of current models on the problem, (2) the model builds upon the Colombian situation, a country with prominent corruption and political violence problems regardless of its relatively long-term commitment with free elections (since 1958) and (3) the theoretical discussion is tested using a comprehensive set of difference-in-differences estimations.",,,Journal of Economic Studies,,,,2021-07-02,2021,2021-07-02,2022-05-06,49,4,665-682,Closed,Article,"Cendales, Andrés; Garza, Nestor; Arcila, Andres","Cendales, Andrés (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Garza, Nestor (California State University Dominguez Hills, Carson, California, USA; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arcila, Andres (University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada)","Arcila, Andres (University of Waterloo)","Cendales, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Garza, Nestor (California State University, Dominguez Hills; Universidad del Norte); Arcila, Andres (University of Waterloo)",1,1,,0.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139289249,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In this article we address a detailed characterization of the texture, mineralogy and chemical composition of the variscite beads belonging to the Nahuange (100–1000 AD) and Tairona (1000–1600 AD) societies of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta region (northern Colombia), which we compare with the known deposit located in the Gran Roque Island, Venezuela. The presented evidence proves the origin of the material from this location, allowing the interpretation of the distribution models of northern South American archaeological variscite. Indeed, different findings of beads made of variscite have shown that this mineral could have a much wider distribution that extends to the Northern Andes, the Amazon basin and the Caribbean islands, though other not yet discovered geological sources cannot be discarded. This is shown by the discovery of variscite beads at the Nueva Esperanza Archaeological Site south of Bogotá and in the archaeological records of the Nariño culture (Colombia), the Amazon basin in Brazil, Aruba and the Lesser Antilles.","This research was supported by Colciencias (Project No. 111866044635) and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Project No. 18819).

                    Background and Aims
                    Acute obstructive renal failure is secondary to obstruction of the upper excretory tract occurring bilaterally or in a single anatomical or functional kidney. It accounts for 8 to 14% of all acute renal failure in Morocco. They constitute serious conditions which can jeopardize the functional prognosis of the kidney .
                    The objective of our study is to describe the profile of patients on emergency hemodialysis for acute obstructive renal failure (AKI), the main indications for hemodialysis and to assess the risk factors for mortality.
                  
                  
                    Method
                    It was a 2-year retrospective and descriptive study from January 2018 to December 2019; performed in the nephrology and hemodialysis department CHU IBN ROCHD CASABLANCA.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    A total of 118 patients were counted: 43 women, 75 men or 36.4%, 63.5%, with an average age of 54.3 years ""+/- 10.3"". The circumstances of discovery were: Oligo anuria 51.5%, hematuria 25%, AEG 24%. The obstacle was neoplastic in 67.79%; lithiasis 26.27%; on pregnancy in 0.84%; bladder malformation 0.84%, and unknown etiologies in 4.2%. The neoplastic origin was cancer of the cervix, followed by the bladder and then the prostate. The average creatinine level was 89.7mg / l. The indication for hemodialysis was: threatening hyperkalemia, uremic syndrome, acidosis and acute pulmonary edema in 56%, 25.8%, 9.6% and 10% of cases, respectively
                    The total number of hemodialysis sessions was 227 hemodialysis sessions with an average number of 1.91. Obstacle removal was performed by percutaneous nephrostomy in 70.8% of cases, by mounting a double J probe in 10% of cases and by ureterostomy in 4.2% of cases. The course was good in 77.9% of the cases, 13.5% progressed to the IRCT. Mortality was 8.4%. Risk factors for mortality were: age, etiology of neoplasia.

1500,pub.1136207490,10.1111/cura.12403,,,Voices of Water and Violence: Exhibition Making and the Blue Humanities for Transitional Justice,"Abstract  This article examines how the relationships between water and violence are represented as objects for public museum exhibitions in order to guarantee symbolic reparations in a transitional justice context. Using the 2018–2019 exhibition Voces para transformar a Colombia, we show that considering a non‐human element such as water in this context requires a methodological reflection about how to expand the notion of victimhood to include nature. After decades of armed conflict, the Colombian government initiated a transitional justice process which led to the creation of the Museum of Memory as a setting for post‐conflict reconciliation. This museum‐pilot exhibition approached violence and resistance in the armed conflict through three main axes: land, water, and the human body. Unlike land and the body, water has played only a marginal role in the public understanding of the armed conflict. The article analyzes the curatorial process underlying the creation of the Water axis of this exhibition. In light of this exhibition, we propose a reflection on what Nicholas Thomas calls “the museum as a method,” which involves three specific moments: discovery, captioning, and juxtaposition. We suggest a fourth moment, ramification, whereby the exhibition branches off through alliances with communities and scholars, and technologies that geographically decenter the museum. The water axis allows for a broader reflection about violence and the environment in which science and the arts come together to create citizens' engagement with justice and ecological crisis. From this perspective, the analysis of the water axis advances the burgeoning field of the blue humanities.","We thank Juliana Botero and Cristina Lleras for their comments on previous versions of this article, Water curator, Lorena Luengas, for leading us to the discussions that inspired it, and John Donovan for his editorial assistance.",,Curator The Museum Journal,,,,2021-01,2021,2021-03-08,2021-01,64,1,183-204,Closed,Article,"González‐Ayala, Sofía N.; Camargo, Alejandro","González‐Ayala, Sofía N.

LE was obtained by three extraction methods: conventional (CE), ultrasound (UAE) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHPE). Experimental results show that the extraction method used to obtain the LE had a significant influence on antioxidant capacity, cellular proliferation, and induction of apoptosis in SNU-1 cells. LE was showed to be cytotoxic with an IC50 of 1747.0 µg mL-1 and 1704.3 µg mL-1, as obtained by UAE and HHPE, respectively. In addition, this extract induces apoptosis as evidenced by confocal microscopy. Our findings indicate that LE would be an attractive source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and antiproliferative capacity and can improve the functional value of food.","The authors wish to thank Dr. Dawit Kidane-Mulat for kindly providing the human cells used in this study, MSc.

Estudio de Cohorte longitudinal,"Introducción Las fracturas de clavícula son muy comunes, representan el 2.6% de todas las fracturas en la población adulta y el 35% de todas las lesiones del hombro. El objetivo de este estudio es determinar cuál es la mejor técnica quirúrgica entre los métodos tipo placa superior versus placa antero-inferior para el tratamiento de fracturas del tercio medio de clavícula. Materiales y métodos Se realizó un estudio de tipo cohorte longitudinal bajo criterios de inclusión, con seguimiento de 9 meses. Se midieron distintos desenlaces de la técnica quirúrgica y fueron utilizados los cuestionarios Dash y Constant Score para evaluar el grado de satisfacción y el resultado funcional, respectivamente. Este estudio cuenta con la aprobación del comité de ética institucional. Resultados Se seleccionaron 96 pacientes (44 sometidos a placa antero-inferior y 52 a placa superior). Los desenlaces medidos se comportan como factor protector para el método de placa antero-inferior: sangrado intraoperatorio (RR 0.60), tiempo quirúrgico (RR 0.52), de consolidación (RR 0.55), irritación del material (RR 0.12) y retiro del material (RR 0.25). Las diferencias respecto a resultados funcionales y grado de satisfacción también fueron estadísticamente significativas. Discusión En concordancia con la literatura, el método de placa antero-inferior demostró ser más seguro y recomendado que el de placa superior, pues mejora el tiempo de unión, reduce la tasa de retardo de la consolidación, el volumen de pérdida de sanguínea intra-operatoria y el tiempo quirúrgico, con mejor resultado funcional y grado de satisfacción en los pacientes. Nivel de evidencia: III. Background Clavicle fractures are frequent injuries of the shoulder, with an overall incidence of 2.6% of all fractures among the adult population and 35% of all shoulder injuries. This study aims to determine whether dorsal plating or anterior/inferior plating is a better surgical technique for treating middle-third clavicle fractures. Methods A cohort study using inclusion criteria and involving a nine-month follow-up period was carried out. Different surgical technique outcomes were measured; Dash and Constant Score questionnaires, respectively, were used to assess the degree of satisfaction and functional outcome of patients. This study has the approval of the hospital's Ethics Committee. Results 96 patients were selected; 44 underwent anterior-inferior plating and 52 superior plating. The following measured variables are revealed as protective factors for anterior-inferior plating: operative blood loss volume (RR 0.60), operative time (RR 0.52), union rate (RR 0.55), irritation due to material (RR 0.12), and request for material extraction (RR 0.25). Differences regarding functional outcomes and patient satisfaction degrees were also statistically significant. Discussion According to literature, anterior-inferior proved to be safer than dorsal plating method and thus advisable, due to it reduces union time, retarded union rates, operative blood loss volume, and operative time; which results in better functional outcomes and greater patient satisfaction.

Stochastic behavior complicates deterministic solutions, while probabilistic approaches are yet to be fully explored. This paper presents analytical physics-based models towards the solution to this challenge. Presented models consider information availability from distributed energy resources to improve the fault location reliability. Information considered is divided into two categories: synchronized measurements provided by intelligent electronic devices located in the substation and in each terminal of distributed energy resources; and linear analytical-based models of distributed energy resources. Distributed energy resources models are used only when remote measurements are not available. Different distributed energy resources technologies and their operation modes are modeled. The presented fault location solution is validated on the IEEE 34-nodes test feeder modified. Easy-to-implement model, without hard-to-design parameters, built on the classical impedance-based fault location solution, indicates potential for real-life applications.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Electric Power Systems Research,,,,2021-06,2021,,2021-06,195,,107178,Closed,Article,"Bretas, A.S.; Orozco-Henao, C.; Marín-Quintero, J.; Montoya, O.D.; Gil-González, W.; Bretas, N.G.","Bretas, A.S.

The adopted three-dimensional simplification of the strength criterion accounts for the intermediate principal stress influence, maintaining the simplicity in the numerical implementation. This criterion corresponds to a paraboloid surface of circular cross section in the principal stress space. The introduction of multiple yield surfaces allows for a smooth definition of the nonlinear stress–strain behavior of the material. In addition, a kinematic hardening rule is adopted, allowing yield surfaces to translate with loading, enabling a hysteretic and path-dependent stress–strain response.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support obtained from the FONDECYT-INICIACION research (Grant No 11181252) and from Universidad de Chile, Project U-Inicia Code (N° UI 24/2018).",,International Journal of Geomechanics,,,,2021-12-17,2021,2021-12-17,2022-03,22,3,06021039,Closed,Article,"Mercado, Vicente; Fuentes, William; Ochoa-Cornejo, Felipe","Mercado, Vicente (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia, (corresponding author).

1452,pub.1139593709,10.1108/arla-07-2020-0170,,,The relationship between innovation and informal entrepreneurship: evidence from a developing country,"Purpose
                    This paper aims to evaluate whether entrepreneurs with an innovative product/service are more likely to formally register their businesses. Understanding the decision of business registration as a rational choice of the entrepreneurs, where she weighs the costs versus the benefits of such formalization, the study expands the literature on informal entrepreneurship by looking at the benefit-side rather than the typically evaluated cost-side of an individual cost-benefit evaluation.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The authors relied on the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) adult population survey to evaluate the hypothesis. Specifically, the authors used the GEM data of 2016 for Colombia, covering 2,069 observations (a representative sample at the country level), evaluating the relationship between innovativeness and business registration for the early stage of the entrepreneurial process. Given the nature of our dependent variable, the authors estimated a logistic regression model.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Different from what the authors hypothesized, they did not find empirical evidence for a positive correlation between an innovative product or service and business registration. Instead, businesses that compete with many others offering the same product/service have a higher tendency to register at the Chamber of Commerce. Contrarily of what might be suspected, opportunity-based entrepreneurship – as opposed to necessity-based – is not a relevant variable when formalizing a business, providing evidence for our hypothesis that necessity-based entrepreneurship cannot be equalized with informal entrepreneurship. Additionally, the authors show that an entrepreneur with higher socioeconomic status is more likely to register his company.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The results provide first exploratory evidence that the benefit evaluation may play a role in formalizing a start-up, thus calling for future research that not only tackles the influence of registration costs and administrative burden but rather looks at the outcome of a cost-benefit analysis. The data imply several limitations which future research should address: variables measuring the innovativeness of the product/service are rather coarse measures and need to be expanded and detailed in future research. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that a relatively high number of missing values may generate a selection bias in our population sample. Finally, because of situating the research in a developing country, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    In a country like Colombia with very high levels of informality, it is necessary that the government fully understands the role of innovation in the formalization process of start-ups. The results indicate that a differentiation of support mechanisms to increase the formalization of businesses according to the different stages of their development may be necessary and that aside from costs, benefits of formalization play a role. A higher level of formality is not only related to economic growth but also much better protection of workers, therefore going beyond the reduction of registration costs and the implied administrative burden should be an additional public policy target for decreasing informality. Finally, the correlation of socioeconomic stratum with the decision to register hints at a varying evaluation of formalization, a point that merits attention by government and academia.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The study shifts the focus from the evaluation of solely costs for business registering as a barrier to start-up formalization to the cost-benefit analysis. The authors propose – and show – that such an evaluation is not generalizable for all kinds of business. Specifically, the authors show that a start-up is more likely to register when it competes with a large number of competitors than when it competes with a smaller number of others offering the same. At the same time, the authors also show that the stage at which the start-up company is at influences the decision to formalize.
                  

                    Propósito
                    Este trabajo tiene como objetivo evaluar si los empresarios con un producto/servicio innovador son más propensos a registrar formalmente sus negocios, entendiendo la decisión de registrar el negocio como una elección racional, en la que el emprendedor sopesa los costos frente a los beneficios de dicha formalización. Este estudio amplía la literatura sobre el emprendimiento informal al plantear un análisis enfocado en los beneficios de una formalización del negocio.
                  
                  
                    Diseño/metodología/enfoque
                    Se utiliza la encuesta Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Adult Population Survey para evaluar nuestras hipótesis. Específicamente, utilizamos los datos del GEM de 2016 para Colombia, cubriendo 2.069 observaciones (una muestra representativa a nivel de país), evaluando la relación entre una oferta innovadora y el registro de negocios para la etapa temprana del proceso emprendedor. Dada la naturaleza de nuestra variable dependiente, estimamos un modelo de regresión logística.
                  
                  
                    Conclusiones
                    Contrario a la hipótesis propuesta, no encontramos una correlación estadísticamente significativa positiva entre un producto o servicio innovador y el registro de empresas. En su lugar, las empresas que compiten con muchas otras empresas que ofrecen el mismo producto/servicio tienen una mayor tendencia a registrarse en la Cámara de Comercio. Asimismo, el emprendimiento basado en la oportunidad -en contraposición al basado en la necesidad- no es una variable relevante a la hora de formalizar un negocio, hallazgo en congruencia con a nuestra hipótesis de que el emprendimiento basado en la necesidad no puede equipararse al emprendimiento informal. Además, mostramos que un emprendedor con un estatus socioeconómico más alto tiene una mayor probabilidad de registrar su empresa.
                  
                  
                    Limitaciones/implicaciones de la investigación
                    Los resultados obtenidos proporcionan la primera evidencia exploratoria de que la evaluación de los beneficios puede desempeñar un rol en la formalización de una empresa de nueva creación, por lo que se requiere mayor investigación que no sólo aborde la influencia de los costos de registro y administrativos asociados, sino que examine el resultado de un análisis costo-beneficio. Los datos utilizados tienen varias limitaciones que una investigación posterior debería abordar: las variables que miden el carácter innovador del producto/servicio son medidas muy básicas y deben ampliarse y detallarse en futuros estudios. Además, el número relativamente alto de valores perdidos puede generar un sesgo de selección en nuestra muestra empleada. Por último, al situar nuestra investigación en el contexto de un país de desarrollo, los resultados pueden ser poco generalizables. Por lo tanto, futuras investigaciones deberían abordar en detalle los hallazgos presentados.
                  
                  
                    Implicaciones prácticas y sociales
                    En un país como Colombia, con niveles muy altos de informalidad, es necesario que el gobierno comprenda plenamente el papel de la innovación en el proceso de formalización de las empresas emergentes. Nuestros resultados indican que una diferenciación de los mecanismos de apoyo para aumentar la formalización de las empresas según las diferentes etapas de su desarrollo puede ser necesario. A su vez, además de los costos, los beneficios de la formalización juegan un papel importante. Un mayor nivel de formalidad no sólo está relacionado con el crecimiento económico sino también con una mejor protección de los trabajadores, por lo que ir más allá de la reducción de los costos de registro y de la carga administrativa implícita debería ser un objetivo adicional de política pública para disminuir la informalidad. Por último, la correlación del estrato socioeconómico con la decisión de registrarse sugiere que la evaluación de formalizarse varía dependiendo del estatus socioeconómico, un punto que merece la atención del gobierno y la academia.
                  
                  
                    Originalidad/valor
                    Nuestro estudio desplaza la atención exclusiva en los costos de registro de una empresa, y sus barreras asociadas, hacia el análisis costo-beneficio como parte de la evaluación y decisión de formalización de las nuevas empresas. Proponemos ‐y demostramos‐ que dicha evaluación no es generalizable para todo tipo de empresas. En concreto, demostramos que es más probable que una empresa emergente se registre cuando compite con un gran número de competidores que cuando compite con un número menor de otras que ofrecen lo mismo. A su vez, también mostramos que la etapa de desarrollo en la cual se encuentra la empresa emergente influye en la decisión de formalizarse.","This paper forms part of a special section “Entrepreneurship in Latin American Countries: Evidence from GEM and GUESSS Project”, guest-edited by Gianni Romaní, Rodrigo Varela and Izaías Martins.

In the Colombian Caribbean, throughout the 20th century, agrarian modernization re-configured black geographies of rice by transforming cultivated landscapes and disavowing black people´s agricultural knowledges and practices. This article analyzes tongueo, a form of rice harvesting that became widespread during the 1970s and 1980s in the municipality of Marialabaja, a historic afro-campesino territory. Tongueo involved women and children collecting and pounding the rice that was left after mechanized harvest. The stories told by tongueadora women re-signify this practice as a space of enjoyment, sociability and transmission of cultural memory. Drawing on theoretical elements of black geographies and Latin American feminist spatial thought, I argue that tongueo was an embodied territorial practice that occurred within the spaces of agrarian modernization. By shedding light on the configuration of black geographies in articulation with racialized agrarian change in Colombia, the article contributes to broaden the field of black geographies beyond Anglo-centric literature, establishing a dialogue with Latin American debates on territory and body-territory.","I would like to thank Eloisa Manjarrés and the women from Paloaltico for their generosity sharing their time, spaces and stories.

We studied the antioxidant activity of hesperidin which was isolated from mandarin (Citrus reticulata) fruit peels against singlet oxygen (1O2). High-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection was used for chemical characterization. The total singlet oxygen quenching rate constants of the hesperidin was measured by using the Stern–Volmer model. Results showed an overall quenching rate constant with a value of 6.43 × 107 M−1 s−1 for 1O2, which for the best of our knowledge has not been reported before. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations were performed to get insight into the molecular and electronic structure properties of this antioxidant, which confirms that the quenching mechanism through energy transfer is rarely probable and that 1O2 could interact with the methoxy phenyl charge rich fragment of the molecule.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Atlántico.

To the best of our knowledge, these problems have traditionally been solved separately. Therefore, we aim to support the decision-making process by following an integrated approach. First, we develop a novel mathematical model that coordinates inventory policies between one warehouse and N retailers and determines the selling price using multinomial logit (MNL) demand functions. Then, given the conditions of high nonlinearity in the resulting discrete-continuous problem, we implement three well-known metaheuristics to solve the integrated problem. Last, to quantify the impact of such integration, 180 instances are randomly generated, and the problem is solved using both sequential and integrated approaches.

The influence of different substituents on the phenyl ring in the para position is evaluated at 500 K. A deep analysis of the mechanisms reveals the influence of the substituents in the activation energy, where the reactivity order OCH3 > CH3 > H > Cl > NO2 is found, following Hammet parameters (σ p). To reach the transition state, geometric changes contribute more than 70% of the energy in agreement with the reaction force analysis. A recent independent gradient model (IGM) is also applied to establish an influence between the substituent and the strength of the bonds involved in the mechanism, through an intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI). Furthermore, the influence of the substituent was also evaluated in terms of interatomic distances and evolution percentages, finding high correlations with Hammet σ p values.",This study was supported by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito by the research grants 2019-2021.

It is shown that the KLaX half Heusler compounds are energetically and mechanically stable. The calculated band structure estimates with modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) potential, indicates a semiconducting nature with direct band gaps of 0.76 eV, 0.79 eV, and 0.81 eV for KLaC, KLaSn, and KLaX (X = Si and Ge) respectively. The valence band of KLaX is more influenced by spin-orbit coupling than in the conduction band. The Seebeck coefficient (S), electronic conductivity (σ), electronic thermal conductivity (κe), figure of merit (ZT) and the power factor (PF) have been investigated using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory with rigid band theory. The KLaX half Heusler compounds exhibit high thermopower values and p-type charge carriers for their thermoelectric performance than electron doping. Including the spin-orbit coupling in our calculations increases the flatness of the valence band from X = Si to Sn. The high values of ZT and PF of KLaX half-Heusler compounds make it promising materials for thermoelectric applications.","The first author would like to thank Doctor Bachir Bouhadef for the valuable help in editing the English.

The global warming targets (D1.5,D2.0,D2.5$${D}_{1.5}, {D}_{2.0}, {D}_{2.5}$$) are attained by the 2024, 2040 and 2056 under the RCP4.5 scenario, on the other hand, the respectively, attained years for Iran are 2023, 2036 and 2051, an evidence of a higher mean increase in surface air temperature respect to the global behavior. We identified important aspects regarding to temperature anomalies in the Iran region: (1) A mean warming of 1.0 ℃ for the 2001–2010 decade respect to the preindustrial baseline. (2) A mean warming of 0.5 ℃ for the 1960–2005 period respect to the preindustrial period. (3). For the 2006–2100 period under RCP4.5 scenario, was possible to identify a warming trend (0.028∘Cyear-1$$0.028 {^\circ{\rm C} } {\mathrm{year}}^{-1}$$), which is above double the trend observed in the period 1960–2005 (0.012∘Cyear-1$$0.012 {^\circ{\rm C} } {\mathrm{year}}^{-1}$$). 4) Largest trends over Iran occur for the 2006–2050 period (2.75 ± 0.74 to 4.72 ± 0.82 °C/century) respect to the 2006–2100 period (2.28 ± 0.36 to 3.39 ± 0.37 °C/century) with the most possible reason associated with the fact that under the RCP4.5 scenario, the emission rate increases toward 2040 and then stabilizes to the end of the century. All of these indicators evidence an intensification of the warming over the Iran region respect to the global trends. From the spatial analysis of surface air temperature trends over 5 regions of Iran for the 1850–2005, 1960–2005, 2006–2050 and 2006–2100 periods was possible to identify a significant increase in all the trends over Iran, but specially in the Southwestern of the country with a warming rate higher in warm regions than the cold climate regions.

Solvent effects were explicitly considered as a random variable by modelling the non-radiative interaction with the solute. Optical susceptibilities of stochastic origin were solved through cumulant expansions in Gaussian distributions considering a white noise as a correlation function.

It represents a bioenergy feedstock of 1500–5500 million tons per year. The shape and size of the corncob are suitable for gasification without pretreatment (size reduction, densification, or drying) in a downdraft gasifier. However, its volatile content (about 80% DAF) can generate high tar content, representing a challenge to adopt this technology. In the present work, an evaluation of the effect of air-steam mixture and calcium carbonate CaCO3 as a promoter of both reforming and gasification reaction was carried out using corn cob without grains as raw material in a 40 kW gasifier. An analysis of variance of four experimental treatments was used to determine the main statistical and interactive effects on the syngas composition, hydrogen yield (yH2), syngas lower heating value (LHVgas), and cold gas efficiency (CGE). Results reveal the highest gasification performance achieved hydrogen production yields of 310 Nml/g, an LHVgas value of 4.8 MJ/Nm3, and cold gas efficiency of 59.18% with steam and CaCO3. Statistical analysis indicated that CaCO3 and steam influence H2 production by increasing 15.8% and 10.8%, respectively, with a CaCO3/biomass ratio of 1% (w/w) and a Steam/biomass ratio of 11% (w/w). Main statistical effects were found for CGE increase of 5% with the addition of steam, 10% with CaCO3, and synergy of 10% using CaCO3 and steam simultaneously.",This research was supported by CIDI UPB- foundings of project 205M-07/17-G004.

The present paper summarizes an experimental campaign on two slender U-shaped reinforced concrete walls detailed with a single-layer of reinforcement. State-of-the-art instrumentation was used to capture the three-dimensional displacement field of the wall surfaces using digital image correlation techniques. Experimental findings are presented, including strain profiles, equivalent plastic hinge lengths, longitudinal strains at the base, cracking distributions and widths, and out-of-plane deformations. Approximately half of the yielding zone length was found to be equal to the equivalent plastic hinge lengths, which were found to decrease as a function of drift. The longitudinal strains at the base of these walls showed some shear lag effects when subjected to in-plane or diagonal loading. For most directions of loading, the largest crack widths were found to be associated with flexural-shear or shear cracks. When subjected to a pure torque, the vertical strain distribution at the base of the wall correlated with the theoretical distribution for an open section governed by warping torsion. The out-of-plane deformations were primarily concentrated within a small region towards the ends of the flanges prior to the local buckling failures that were observed experimentally.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Swiss Government Excellence Postdoctoral Scholarship for the year 2018/2019 and the funding provided through the Swiss Bilateral Research Programs for the Latin American Region through the one-year research merger scheme.

Two CR gradations, #30 (coarser) and #50 (finer), were selected for this study. The blends were prepared by mixing 22.5% CR (by weight of base bitumen) into 50/70 pen grade bitumen for 60 min at 177 ± 10 °C with a shear mixing speed of 700 rpm. Blends prepared with #30 CR were found to improve the elastic response and storage stability compared to #50 CR modified binder. The presence of a greater number of coarser CR particles – which mostly remained in the swollen-form at the end of the blending process – as compared to finer particles – which instead were depolymerized and released the absorbed oils back into the binder phase – proved to increase the flexibility of the binder and improve its rheological performance. This same factor also reduced the #50 modified binder’s UV resistance as the C–C, C–H bonds in the saturates portion of the bitumen have a lower bond energy than the energy produced by the impact of UV rays. Overall, crumb-rubber modified bitumen resists better to ageing produced by UV radiation compared to standard unmodified bitumen. Further reprocessing of waste vehicle tyres into smaller #50 mesh size is deemed not to produce substantial improvements in the final bituminous blend other than the reduced viscosity for the same CR content.",The Authors would like to acknowledge the support given by Tyre Stewardship Australia under the scholarship “Crumb rubber asphalt binder characterisation and specifications for road pavement applications”.

This study aimed to present a mechanistic framework to determine the Paris’ law parameters A ′ and n ′ of asphalt mixtures and fatigue life of asphalt pavements. The dynamic modulus test and indirect tensile (IDT) test results were obtained from Texas Data Storage System (DSS) to evaluate the linear viscoelastic properties and fracture properties. Modified Griffith crack criterion in tension was used to determine the damage density rate and pseudo J-integral of macrocracks appeared in the post-peak phase of the IDT test, and the damage density with time was shown as a sigmoidal shape from microcracking initiation. The Paris’ law parameters were then computed using the regression analysis in the macrocracking stage. It was shown that the fracture resistance of asphalt mixtures could be characterized using n ′ , and a smaller value of n ′ indicates a better fracture resistance. The mode-I fatigue life equation for reflection cracking in asphalt pavements was also proposed based on the J-integral from the finite element model and Paris’ law parameters, which shows that the empirical fatigue life transfer function could also be determined from actual material properties and pavement structural boundary conditions.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The application of vehicular load induces micro-cracks with each application eventually causing macro-cracks and failure. The chances of crack propagation multiply if a brittle cement-treated base layer lies underneath, as in the case of an inverted pavement. This study investigates the fatigue cracking in inverted pavements considering the effect of the brittleness of an underlying cemented layer. Several specimens were manufactured and tested in a wheel tracking environment while crack initiation and propagation were carefully monitored using a GoPro camera. A mechanics-based methodology has been developed to calculate the critical horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of the hot mix asphalt surface layer, which has been related to fatigue life by a fatigue prediction model. It is observed that the laboratory results are in close correlation with the predicted fatigue life. The developed approach has also been successfully applied to real pavements, constituting an important development in fatigue life prediction in inverted pavements.","The authors would like to thank Mirpur University of Science and Technology (MUST), Mirpur (AJK), Pakistan and University of Nottingham, UK for their financial and technical support to carry out the current research project.",,Construction and Building Materials,,,,2021-12,2021,,2021-12,311,,125288,Closed,Article,"Ahmed, Imtiaz; Thom, Nick; Zaidi, Syed Bilal Ahmed; Ahmed, Nabeel; Carvajal-Munoz, Juan S.; Rahman, Taqia; Ahmad, Naveed","Ahmed, Imtiaz (Department of Civil Engineering, Mirpur University of Science and Technology (MUST), Mirpur, AJK 10250, Pakistan; School of Energy, Construction and Environment, Coventry University, United Kingdom); Thom, Nick (Nottingham Transportation Engineering Centre (NTEC), University of Nottingham, United Kingdom); Zaidi, Syed Bilal Ahmed (Civil Engineering Department, University of Engineering Technology (UET), Taxila, Pakistan); Ahmed, Nabeel (Civil Engineering Department, Comsats University Islamabad (CUI), Wah Campus, Pakistan); Carvajal-Munoz, Juan S.

1331,pub.1138042576,10.1093/beheco/arab060,,,Interspecific aggression in sympatry between congeneric tropical birds,"Abstract Interspecific aggression may shape species distributions through competitive exclusion, resulting in spatial segregation, or facilitate sympatry as an adaptive mechanism for resource partitioning. Competitive exclusion results from asymmetric aggression of one species towards another, but if the aggressive relationship between species is symmetric, they may persist in sympatry. Interspecific aggression is widely cited as a mechanism for maintaining the distributional limits of tropical birds, but how it shapes the spatial dynamics of competing species that are sympatric over larger geographic areas is less clear. To address this issue, we conducted reciprocal playback experiments on two congeneric Antbirds — Thamnophilus atrinucha and T. doliatus — that occur in sympatry across a habitat matrix in Colombia to characterize their relationship as symmetrically or asymmetrically aggressive and analyzed point count data to assess the degree to which they occur sympatrically. We found weak evidence for competitive exclusion, with the larger T. doliatus responding asymmetrically to T. atrinucha, and the two species having a low co-detection rate during point counts. However, despite their 22% difference in body size, T. atrinucha still responded to T. doliatus playback in over half of our trials, and the two species co-occurred on nearly 25% of point counts, indicating that interspecific aggression does not drive complete spatial segregation. Our findings highlight how the degree to which one species can competitively exclude another may vary, especially across a dynamic landscape.",,"This work was supported by Hampshire College’s Ray and Lorna Coppinger fund, a Chapman grant from the American Museum of Natural History, the Cooper Ornithological Society, Sigma-Xi, and National Geographic-Waitts Grant No. W270-13 to J.P.

For this investigation, twenty-three chalcones (4a-w) were synthesized and evaluated as antiproliferative agents against MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells, finding three and two compounds with similar or higher antiproliferative activity than daunorubicin, while only two chalcones showed better selectivity indexes than daunorubicin on MCF-7. From these results, we developed good-performance QSAR models (r > 0.850, q2>0.650), finding several structural features that could modify chalcone activity and selectivity. According to these models, chalcones 4w and 4t have high potency and selectivity against Caco-2 and MCF-7, respectively, which make them attractive candidates for hit-to-lead development of ROS-independent pro apoptotic agents.",,"This work was supported by [Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)] under [Fondecyt Postdoctorado 3180408, Fondecyt 1161490] research grants; and [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso] under [VRIEA-PUCV 37.0/2017] grant.",Natural Product Research,,,Antineoplastic Agents; Caco-2 Cells; Cell Proliferation; Chalcone; Chalcones; Daunorubicin; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Molecular Structure; Neoplasms; Structure-Activity Relationship,2021-09-29,2021,2021-09-29,2022-09-02,36,17,4404-4410,Closed,Article,"Mellado, Marco; Reyna-Jeldes, Mauricio; Weinstein-Oppenheimer, Caroline; Coddou, Claudio; Jara-Gutierrez, Carlos; Villena, Joan; Aguilar, Luis F","Mellado, Marco (Facultad de Ciencias, Instituto de Química, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile.); Reyna-Jeldes, Mauricio (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Santiago, Chile.); Weinstein-Oppenheimer, Caroline (Facultad de Química y Farmacia, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile.; Centro de Investigación Farmacopea Chilena, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile.); Coddou, Claudio (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Santiago, Chile.); Jara-Gutierrez, Carlos (Laboratorio de Bioensayos, Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Centro de Investigaciones Biomédicas (CIB), Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile.); Villena, Joan (Laboratorio de Bioensayos, Facultad de Medicina, Centro de Investigaciones Biomédicas (CIB), Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile.); Aguilar, Luis F (Facultad de Ciencias, Instituto de Química, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile.)","Mellado, Marco (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Reyna-Jeldes, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Santiago, Chile.)","Mellado, Marco (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Reyna-Jeldes, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Santiago, Chile.); Weinstein-Oppenheimer, Caroline (University of Valparaíso; University of Valparaíso); Coddou, Claudio (Catholic University of the North; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Santiago, Chile.); Jara-Gutierrez, Carlos (University of Valparaíso); Villena, Joan (University of Valparaíso); Aguilar, Luis F (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)",9,6,2.27,1.55,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141488193,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,

The intensification of fish farming systems has led to an increased occurrence of parasitic diseases, and this has become a serious issue, especially in fish farms in northern Brazil. The present study evaluated the use of albendazole and praziquantel in the control of Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae in tambaqui, in two separate trials. In the first experiment, six concentrations of albendazole (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg kg−1 diet) were evaluated, in triplicate, with 12 fish per tank, for 21 days. In the second experiment, using the same experimental design, fish were given five different doses of praziquantel (0, 4, 6, 8, and 10 g kg−1 diet). In both trials, control group were fed with commercial feed not medicated. Also, fish from each treatment (n=9) of both experiments were sampled and subjected to parasitological and hematological tests to determine the efficacy of the drugs. The prevalence of the acanthocephalans in fish was 100% in the albendazole trial, with no efficacy observed in 21 days. Prevalence of N. buttnerae in the praziquantel trial ranged from 66.7 to 77.8%, and efficacy varied from 0 (doses < 6 g kg−1 diet) to 59.01% (8 g kg−1 diet, respectively). There was no significant difference between treatments in both trials regarding hematological parameters. Further studies to determine the best treatment route, optimum dose, toxicity to fish, palatability, and any potential side effects are thus needed.","To the laboratory assistants Edson Paiva Afonso, Iraní Morais, and José Marconde da Costa e Silva at Embrapa Amazônia Ocidental for helping with feeding production, fish collection and laboratorial analyses.",,Aquaculture International,,,,2021-03-31,2021,2021-03-31,2021-08,29,4,1495-1505,Closed,Article,"Farias, Caio Francisco Santana; Brandão, Franmir Rodrigues; de Alexandre Sebastião, Fernanda; de Melo Souza, Damy Caroline; Monteiro, Patrícia Castro; Majolo, Cláudia; Chagas, Edsandra Campos","Farias, Caio Francisco Santana (Uninorte Laureate International Universities, Av.

This capacity is enhanced by education, occupational attainment, learning languages and the habit of reading, among other important factors. This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of Rami et al's Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire in an Argentinian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample that participated in the study comprised 203 Argentinian adult volunteers from the general population (mean age, 66.1; standard deviation, 8.1). The Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire was administered together with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to test the unidimensionality of the questionnaire. In addition, reliability was estimated by the categorical omega coefficient and associative validity was analysed by means of bivariate correlations.
RESULTS: Factor analysis confirms the unidimensionality of the questionnaire with good fit indices. Items 5 (musical training) and 8 (intellectual games), however, show low factor loadings. The test has acceptable reliability, with a categorical omega coefficient = 0.72, although it should be noted that the average variance extracted (0.41) is below the recommended criterion of 0.5. Good associative validity is observed: r (200) = 0.4; p < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: The Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties for use in an Argentinian population. More research is required to further investigate the low factor loadings of items 5 and 8 and to strengthen the evidence of reliability.",,,Revista de Neurologia,,,Aged; Argentina; Cognitive Reserve; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychological Tests; Psychometrics,2021,2021,,2021,73,6,194-200,Closed,Article,"Martino, P; Cervigni, M; Caycho-Rodríguez, T; Valencia, P; Politis, D","Martino, P (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de Argentina (CONICET), Rosario, Argentina.; Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Rosario, Argentina.); Cervigni, M (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de Argentina (CONICET), Rosario, Argentina.; Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Rosario, Argentina.); Caycho-Rodríguez, T (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Valencia, P (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Tlalnepantla de Baz, México.); Politis, D (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de Argentina (CONICET), Rosario, Argentina.; Hospital Interzonal de Agudos Eva Perón, Buenos Aires, Argentina.)",,"Martino, P (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de Argentina (CONICET), Rosario, Argentina.; National University of Rosario); Cervigni, M (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de Argentina (CONICET), Rosario, Argentina.; National University of Rosario); Caycho-Rodríguez, T (Private University of the North); Valencia, P (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Politis, D (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de Argentina (CONICET), Rosario, Argentina.; Hospital Interzonal de Agudos Eva Perón, Buenos Aires, Argentina.)",8,4,0.5,7.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141077976,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 42 Health Sciences,

Using low-coverage short Illumina 150bp pair-end reads sequencing, this study examines, for the first time, the 'repeatome' (= repetitive genomic elements), including the 45S ribosomal RNA DNA operon and microsatellites, in B. humboldti. Repetitive elements comprised a large fraction of the nuclear genome and a considerable proportion of them could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, the most frequent belonged to the 45S ribosomal RNA operon or were classified as satellite DNA and Class I - Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) which were considerably more abundant than Class I - LTR elements. The ribosomal RNA gene operon in B. humboldti is comprised of, in the following order, a 5' ETS (length = 233 bp), ssrDNA (2082 bp), ITS1 (346 bp), 5.8S rDNA (150 bp), ITS2 (572 bp), lsrDNA (3887 bp), and a 3' ETS (1097 bp). A total of 15 SSRs were identified.

The results show, on the one hand, the documentary’s potential to generate a significant degree of narrative sympathy insofar as it includes, firstly, the voices of guerrilla women traditionally excluded from the discourses of conflict, and secondly, by generating emotional and sympathetic reactions among participants who have experienced the armed conflict up close. On the other hand, a group of participants clearly distanced themselves from the documentary by considering that it is a romanticised discourse of the lives of guerrilla women and avoids to address the human rights violations inflicted upon members of the group and the civilian population at large. This project was framed within a mixed method research design and addressed two dimensions: the emotional response of spectators from a sympathy and narrative understanding perspective, and the projection and identification of the spectators mediated via empathy with the characters portrayed.

However, most of the current approaches consider them to be isolated choices, while just a few contemplate them as a joint choice. The present investigation modelled the choice process of individuals related to a set of alternatives formed by a combination of airline and flight departure time, in the context of domestic travellers in the Metropolitan Area of Medellín, Colombia. The approach specifies discrete choice models, estimated from face to face surveys of revealed preferences data collected in the two airports serving the city. Correlations between alternatives and substitution patterns are calculated, including subjective values of time, direct and cross elasticities for ticket cost, travel time and departure time attributes. We also discuss some policy scenarios. According to the results, flights operating at a similar time, and those offered by airlines with the highest market presence have a higher level of competition. Travellers for leisure purposes are less sensitive to travel time than those travelling for business or another motive. Furthermore, the difference between the actual departure time and the preferred departure time of the traveller affects negatively the probability of choosing a specific alternative. In Colombia, air travellers have a highly elastic behaviour towards airfares, travel time and flight departure time. The conclusions drawn by the interpretation of the proposed models are useful for authorities in the formulation of policies, and for aviation companies to optimise their operation.

In this study, using cox1 gene, we evaluate the genetic variation of C. rogercresseyi from farmed Salmo salar along a latitudinal range (40°-52°S) in south Chile to determine whether morphological differences are explained by genetic or environmental factors. Female parasites were randomly collected from S. salar at five farms. Body variation was examined using multivariate analyses and genetic heterogeneity was explored with AMOVA. C. rogercresseyi exhibited significant morphometric variability among sites and parasites collected from >54°S were the longest ones. Parasites did not show genetic structure among farms. Thus, C. rogercresseyi infesting salmons is panmictic along an extensive latitudinal range in south Chile. The same genetic pattern can be explained by the frequent movement of parasitized S. salar among farms in that region. Phenotypic plasticity in parasites could be explained by natural or aquaculture-mediated environment variability. C. rogercreseyi from 54°S could favor the local spread of this disease, suggesting an immediate health risk for the recent salmon industry in that region. Further research is required to confirm genetic homogeneity of this parasite along its geographical distribution using more powerful markers (e.g. SNPs).","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This study was funded by Project 5303–VRIIP–U.

It is for this reason that the 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion proposed the inclusion of food, water and ecosystems in any health promotion strategies. The present study describes the extent to which climate change in the form of rainfall scarcity and increased temperatures impacts the availability and accessibility of quality water, food and traditional medicine as basic determinants of indigenous health promotion. In-depth interviews were conducted with 240 participants purposely selected from Dikgale community in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The study results show that availability and accessibility of water, food and traditional medicine are negatively impacted by increased temperature and scarcity of rainfall. These resources are scarcely encountered, and where they exist, they are of poor quality. However, community members resorted to modern technological practices such as sourcing water from the municipal water reticulation system, buying foodstuffs from retail outlets and immunization against disease via modern health care facilities. It can be deduced from the study that the prerequisites of indigenous health promotion are climate-sensitive. They become available and accessible under favourable climate conditions, and are scarce under unfavourable climate conditions, a situation that compromises the practice of indigenous health promotion.",We thank the local authorities for their support during the study and the community members by consenting to participate in the study.,"Funding The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Global Health Promotion,,,Climate Change; Ecosystem; Health Promotion; Humans; South Africa; Water,2021-06-10,2021,2021-06-10,2022-03,29,1,58-64,Closed,Article,"Rankoana, Sejabaledi A.","Rankoana, Sejabaledi A.

Concerns about the impact on the absorbed dose due to the use of the three 99mTc-based compounds as well as the use of different phantoms were here treated for the case of a female at early pregnant state. The lowest absorbed dose in the kidneys was obtained with 99mTc (MAG3), and the relative difference of using Stabin and Segars anthropomorphic representations was 2.5%.

However, there are currently no standardized preparatory procedures for the preprocessing and pretreatment of the RPAF additive to ensure a homogeneous blend and optimum performance for the resultant RPAF modified asphalt-binder. The work presented in this paper was directed at determining the optimal parametric criteria for harmonizing/standardizing the preparatory procedures, stirring, and blending conditions for using RPAF additives as an asphalt-binder modifier, namely the stirring temperature, stirring rate, and stirring time. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to assess and quantify the effects of these stirring conditions on the physical properties and storage stability of asphalt-binder modified with different RPAF dosages. For the materials evaluated, the Penetration, softening point temperature, and ductility test results indicated that the optimal parametric conditions to optimize the physical properties of the RPAF modified asphalt-binder were as follows: a stirring temperature range of 145 °C to 165 °C at a stirring rate of 5000 r/min to 5500 r/min for at least 30 min stirring time, with 5.0% being the optimum RPAF dosage. Overall, the study beneficially contributes to the literature enrichment through provision of a preliminary reference datum for the optimal parametric conditions of stirring, mixing, and blending RPAF when used as an asphalt-binder modifier.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Solvent effects have been explicitly considered by modeling the nonradiative interaction with the solute as a random variable. To formulate a solution, it is necessary to introduce stochastic considerations. We assume that system–solvent interactions induce random shifts in the Bohr frequency of the adiabatic states, and their manifestation corresponds to the broadening of the upper level. The Born–Oppenheimer (BO) electronic energy curves for this molecular model consist of two intertwined harmonic oscillator potentials shifted in both their position and their minimum equilibrium energy. The critical quantities for this analysis are the transition and permanent dipole moments, which depend strongly on intramolecular coupling. Our results show how absorption and refractive index are affected by vibronic coupling and solvent stochasticity.",,,Journal of Nonlinear Optical Physics & Materials,,,,2021-11-03,2021,2021-11-03,2022-03,31,01,2150011,Closed,Article,"Paz, Jose Luis; Loroño, Marcos; González-Paz, Lenin A.; Marquez, Edgar; Vera-Villalobos, Joan; Mora, José R.; Alvarado, Ysaias J.","Paz, Jose Luis (Departamento Académico de Química Inorgánica, Facultad de Química e Ingeniería Química, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); Loroño, Marcos (Departamento Académico de Química Analítica e Instrumental, Facultad de Química e Ingeniería Química, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); González-Paz, Lenin A.

A Rule-based EMS (RBEMS), which is typically found in microgrid controllers nowadays, and an implementation of an Optimization-based EMS (OBEMS), which is not usual in today’s controllers, are proposed, tested, and demonstrated in the microgrid testbed. The RBEMS consists of a state machine that represents the commitment of different genset units in the system and the curtailment of load and renewable generation. The OBEMS is based on a unit commitment model for microgrids that minimizes the generation and curtailment costs, while operating the microgrid equipment according to technical limits. Both EMS systems are integrated into a Python application which integrates various open-source packages and solvers, making it affordable, flexible and easy to replicate and upgrade. The successful implementation and performance of the EMS is discussed, showing that the components of the microgrid follow the dispatch commands, with the OBEMS yielding better overall results than the RBEMS, as expected, using the existing communications links and maintaining the stability of the microgrid.",This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and Canadian Solar Inc .,,Applied Energy,,,,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,290,,116760,Closed,Article,"Restrepo, Mauricio; Cañizares, Claudio A.; Simpson-Porco, John W.; Su, Peter; Taruc, John","Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Cañizares, Claudio A.

Specifically, we seek to understand how they redefined and negotiated their professional roles to survive in Colombia's complex and unsafe environment. The results of our analysis reveal four emerging roles: (1) resilient watchdog; (2) savvy expert; (3) crusader; (4) and community-embedded. The texts examined also reveal how journalists negotiated the agenda-building, since reporters were forced to limit on-site newsgathering, consult multiple sources, self-censor, and deal with the differential working conditions of metropolitan and local journalists as a consequence of risk. This study contributes to role theory by focusing on narrated roles of an insecure democracy from an inductive approach. It further introduces an innovative perspective to boundary work theory, since reporters’ boundaries have been challenged in new, often menacing ways, due to the world's longest-running internal conflict and transition to peace.","The results presented in this paper are part of the project “Roles periodísticos en la transición entre la guerra y la paz en Colombia.

In doing so this paper highlights domains where English skills may be more or less useful in developing contexts in general and in Colombia more specifically and identifies factors which may influence the role of English in development. To aid in this analysis, this article draws on Phillipson’s (Linguistic imperialism. Oxford University Press, 1992) theory of linguistic imperialism and relevant literature which looks at the role of English and development in the global South. The paper argues that although English may foster development in domains such as employment, trade, migration, and education, this is contingent upon a range of personal and contextual factors including level of Englishand socioeconomic status. It is also argued that, regardless of the contribution that English can make to development, interests in the global North are benefitting from the proliferation of this language in developing contexts.",,,Current Issues in Language Planning,,,,2021-06-08,2021,2021-06-08,2022-03-15,23,2,137-156,Closed,Article,"Mackenzie, Lee","Mackenzie, Lee (Institute of Languages, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Mackenzie, Lee (Universidad del Norte)","Mackenzie, Lee (Universidad del Norte)",22,18,,30.74,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138734771,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

For a long time, it has been presumed that P. venusta did not emit mating calls. Here, we observed the entire vocal activity period of P. venusta over the night and recorded male calls and a female distress call. We recognized and described a single male call type, identified as the advertisement call. This call has an extremely low timbre, and it is composed of a single or a sequence of pulsed notes. The multi-noted calls were usually emitted in intrasexual agonistic contexts. Although both call duration and note number have a high coefficient of variation values, they are linearly correlated, so they should be acting as a single independent variable in the P. venusta calls. As expected, the distress call is longer and with a higher timbre than the advertisement call. Interspecific comparisons were made based on the ratio between advertisement call dominant frequency (DF) and body size. This ratio is similar to those of the species of the P. tarsius group.",We thank prof. Dr. Domenico Otranto and M.Sc. Kerry Cobb for the careful scientific and English reviews of the drafts.

The main osmoregulatory organs of decapod crustaceans, the gills, are continually bathed in freshwater and are therefore at risk from trace metal impacts. The effects of chronic (21 d) exposure to raised dissolved concentrations of Zn, Cd, Cu and Pb on aspects of hydromineral balance were investigated in Potamonautes warreni, a freshwater crab endemic to rivers in South Africa at potential risk from trace metal contamination from mining operations. Generally, hydromineral balance of P. warreni was tolerant to chronic metal exposures although sublethal cadmium exposure of 860 µg.l-1 for 21 days resulted in a reduced sodium concentration in the haemolymph. A chronic exposure to 43 µg.l-1 cadmium produced an elevated maximum unidirectional sodium uptake, possibly resulting from acclimation to the metal exposure. Branchial Na+/K+-ATPase and V-Type H+-ATPase activity were not affected by chronic in vivo Cd (43 µg.l-1) and Zn (500 µg.l-1) exposures. An important aspect of ameliorating metal toxicity may be through antioxidants and therefore the effects of applying a reducing agent were tested following in vitro metal treatment. Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase could be prevented by pre-incubation with a reducing agent, indicating the importance of antioxidants in reducing metal toxicity in this species. Although this study demonstrates the physiological resilience of P. warreni to dissolved trace metal impacts, the energetic consequences of long-term exposure are as yet not known.",Thanks to Dr Dalene Vosloo for assistance with collecting animals in South Africa.

The model allows for multiple channels of interdependence across firms and for employment creation to be determined by technological and institutional factors. We show that industrial policies are key to ensuring the effectiveness of educational policies, and that robust employment creation is key to ensuring the effectiveness of both industrial and educational policies. These results speak to recent concerns about insufficient employment creation in high‐productivity activities and suggest the need to include employment promotion as an objective of development policy.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We acknowledge the helpful comments made on previous versions of this paper by two anonymous referees and an associate editor.,,Metroeconomica,,,,2021-08-13,2021,2021-08-13,2021-11,72,4,849-867,Closed,Article,"de Souza, Joao Paulo A.; Gómez‐Ramírez, Leopoldo","de Souza, Joao Paulo A.

From the institutional perspective, businesses are affected by norms, processes, rules of moral and ethical behaviour, which have not been studied for the base of the pyramid in inclusive businesses, much less in agricultural cooperatives. The objective of this research is to identify institutional factors that can affect agribusiness inclusive models. In this research, agricultural cooperatives of banana production in the province of Magdalena, Colombia, are the unit of analysis to identify institutional factors. The method of review of institutional factors is the multiple cases (six banana cooperatives) with a simple unit using inductive analysis. The results show that institutional factors—both formal (certifications, quality standards, social responsibility policies and economic incentives) and informal (cooperation, improvement of quality of life, generation of social capital)—promote the development of inclusive businesses in cooperatives of the base of the pyramid. The research is a first step to show its potential replication in other agricultural industries and even in other economic sectors.",,"The authors would like to thank the Department of Magdalena, COLCIENCIAS and COLFUTURO for their funding on the training process of one of the article authors.

The hippo Hippopotamus amphibius, native to Africa, has invaded extensive areas of the Magdalena River basin (Colombia) over the past decades, and has been considered the largest invasive animal in the world. Here, we propose the use of two approaches of predictive modeling, in order to guide recommendations for the management of this biological invasion. First, we developed a population viability analysis (PVA) to simulate a hypothetical population growth under different management scenarios. Next, we explored the potential invasion area under future climate change scenarios throughout ecological niche modeling analyses. PVA models predicted that in the absence of an intense culling/hunting pressure, the population size will continue to steadily increase, which is consistent with the population growth observed during the last 20 years. Furthermore, our static and dynamic habitat suitability projections suggested that without dispersal limiting factors, potential colonization habitat for hippos may become very extensive across the landscape and can be favored by climate change in the future. Therefore, our findings show the urgent need of taking critical management decisions by the Colombian authorities, which should be focused on limiting the hippos' population growth and expansion. Ignoring cost-benefit considerations for the control of this invasive species may have unexpected and long-term social and ecological implications. However, the proposal of a course of action can become controversial when the species has a charismatic value for the society, regardless of its ecological or social impact.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Despite the extension of the franchise to the formerly enslaved, Southern elites used violence and other extralegal means to regain power and ultimately remove these newly granted rights. In this paper, we study the importance of enforcement of political rights on the ability of the formerly enslaved to achieve political power during Reconstruction. We use data on the location of federal troops to predict the election of black politicians in the Congressionally mandated state constitutional conventions and subsequent state legislatures. Using various estimation strategies, we find that the federal enforcement enhanced black representation and that the presence of the Army interacted positively with other federal efforts such as the Freedmen's Bureau. In light of the recent Supreme Court decisions to weaken the enforcement mechanisms of the Voting Rights Act and subsequent legislative efforts to suppress minority turnout, our evidence has implications on minority representation to this day.",,,Journal of Historical Political Economy,,,,2021-11-23,2021,2021-11-23,2021,1,3,319-351,Closed,Article,"Chacón, Mario L.; Jensen, Jeffrey L.; Yntiso, Sidak","Chacón, Mario L.

Evasion causes huge economic losses to operators and cities, but also negatively influences the system’s security perceptions. Despite its importance, there are few efforts to understand which observable and non-observable factors motivate individuals to evade fares in a public transport system. Most studies dealing with fare evasion evaluate the effectiveness of several policies, quantify the amount of evasion, or correlate fare evasion with system satisfaction using aggregate data. This paper proposes a Hybrid Discrete Choice model to understand current evaders’ behavior considering sociodemographic, fare evasion records, trip characteristics, user satisfaction with the transport system, and perceptual indicators. The model was estimated using a unique stated preferences survey applied to 324 fare evaders of Transmilenio, the Bogotá (Colombia) Bus Rapid Transit system, in mid-2019. This is an interesting case study because, in 2018, the evasion rate was measured for the first time and it was discovered that evaders comprised approximately 15% of their users on weekdays. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, results highlight the importance of considering observable and latent variables to understand individual behavior in examining fare evasion in similar public transport systems. Age and the evasion records resulted in being the most important observable variables in our case study. Latent variables suggest that the more the user is satisfied with the transport system, the less likely is to evade fares. However, we found that personality traits, such as individual rule-unconsciousness, moderate the effect of satisfaction on the evasion behavior. Second, our results provide evidence that the discussion between certainty and severity of punishment on fare evasion should not necessarily be centered on whether to exacerbate one of these factors. A combination of both, however, should reduce the recidivism rate.",We thank Transmilenio S.A.

We draw on a unique dataset of subsidiary-level engagement in corruption of 175 foreign subsidiaries entering three Central American countries.

The effect of dependency on a corrupt host government can be mitigated by enacting internal and external legitimacies.",,,Latin American Business Review,,,,2021-06-03,2021,2021-06-03,2022-07-03,23,3,279-307,Closed,Article,"Godinez, Jose; de Mello, Rodrigo Bandeira; Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier; Khalik, Mahmoud Abdel","Godinez, Jose (Manning School of Business, Management Department, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA); de Mello, Rodrigo Bandeira (Girard School of Business, Merrimack College, North Andover, MA, USA); Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Departamento de Finanzas y Organizaciones, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Khalik, Mahmoud Abdel (School of Management, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, UK)","Godinez, Jose (University of Massachusetts Lowell)","Godinez, Jose (University of Massachusetts Lowell); de Mello, Rodrigo Bandeira (Merrimack College); Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte); Khalik, Mahmoud Abdel (University of St Andrews)",2,2,,1.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138580802,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This study examined diatom records from sediment cores from paleoclimate studies in mountain lakes of Guatemala, Panama, and Colombia, in order to clarify the long-term human influences on the ecology of these lakes. We focused on two aspects of beta diversity in identified diatom zones: species turnover and variation in relative abundances of species. All records displayed a single diatom zone or cluster of zones with assemblages that had no close analogues in the past. The ages of these distinctive assemblages varied from post-European to 5000 cal yr BP. Most novel assemblages comprised moderately motile, non-planktonic, single-celled diatoms, associated with disturbed, productive environments. Archaeological data and pollen records pointed to the onset of intensification of human activities as the main driver behind the changes in diatoms. Maximum depth exerted control on how diatom communities responded to anthropogenic stressors. In shallower lakes, diatom assemblages transitioned gradually over time into their current novel composition. In deeper lakes, assemblages displayed slight fluctuations before shifting to their current condition. Differences between the two lake groups likely resulted from a more complete water-column mixing and higher rates of nutrient cycling in the shallow lakes, which led to a more rapid response of the diatoms to environmental changes. The shift to novel recent diatom assemblages suggests that these lakes now display ecosystem characteristics with no past analogues, and that they have lost their capacity to resist change or recover from stressors, jeopardizing the future of mountain water resources.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Because concrete is placed in varied, damage-inducing conditions, its durability performance is crucial for allowing the material to reach its intended service life and avoid premature replacement. In this multidisciplinary research program, a concrete is developed for both reduced environmental impact and enhanced durability compared to conventional solutions. These goals are realized through a novel combination of design parameters: recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) that increase reuse of construction demolition waste; a high-volume fly ash (HVFA) matrix that further incorporates industrial waste products while reducing portland cement content; and internal fiber reinforcement that increases composite crack resistance. The resulting high-performance concrete, designated as green hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete (GHyFRC), contains 39% waste materials by volume and is evaluated by life cycle assessment (LCA), exposure to a corrosive environment for 4.3 years, and structural loading. Corrosion activity of steel rebar embedded within GHyFRC was reduced through the low chloride permeability of a high-volume fly ash matrix and fiber reinforcement that limited crack propagation, maintaining the low designed matrix permeability. GHyFRC can be a more sustainable alternative to concrete under certain conditions by contributing to greater retention of flexural strength after corrosion has begun and lowering global warming potential (GWP) when normalized by flexural strength.",This work was supported by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) [grant DTFH61-09-R-00017].

To induce anesthesia, juvenile tambaqui (130.55 ± 22.4 g; 16.8 ± 0.95 cm) were individually exposed to different concentrations of the essential oils (EOAT: 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 150 mg L−1; EOLS: 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg L−1; EOMP: 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 70 and 90 mg L−1), for exposure periods of between four minutes and six hours. The three essential oils evaluated presented anesthetic properties. The concentration intervals over which the fish reached all the stages of anesthesia (1, 2, 3a, 3b and 4) were between 40 and 150 mg L−1 for EOAT; 20 and 50 mg L−1 for EOLS; and 40 and 90 mg L−1 for EOMP. The times taken to reach the anesthesia stages were inversely proportional to the increases in the concentration of the essential oils. The histopathological damage to the gills of the tambaqui that resulted from using essential oil concentrations that were defined as anesthetic (150 mg L−1 EOAT, 30 mg L−1 EOLS and 90 mg L−1 EOMP) were also evaluated. The main damage recorded was hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the lamellar epithelium, lamellar fusion and proliferation of chloride cells. According to the histopathological alteration index (HAI), there were no irreversible damage (such as fibrosis and necrosis) to the gills of the tambaqui. However, while EOLS and EOMP caused mild damages in the gills, the EOAT generated more severe damages. Overall, for the tambaqui, the essential oils of A. triphylla, L. sidoides and M. piperita are efficient anesthetic in the doses of 150, 30 and 90 mg L−1, respectively.","We would like to thank Embrapa (MP2 - 02.12.01.020.00.00) for financial support, the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation (FAPEAM) for the PhD scholarship for F.R.

1175,pub.1140517238,10.1111/oik.08274,,,Shared predators between primate groups and mixed species bird flocks: the potential for forest‐wide eavesdropping networks,"A basic tenet of animal behavior is that animal groupings (e.g. schools of fishes or flocks of birds) are widely influenced by predators. Many studies have focused on communication between individuals within the same species or different species within a defined social group; but predators typically select from a number of different co‐occurring species. To evaluate whether two distantly‐related species with similar predators share vocal information regarding predator threats, we conducted a field experiment in the Amazonian rainforest involving an avian prey‐species, a primate prey‐species and a shared predator. In our reciprocal field experiment, we elicited alarm calls from birds (bluish‐slate antshrikes Thamnomanes schistogynus ) and primates (saddle‐backed tamarins Leontocebus weddelli ) by exposing them to a trained raptor (bicolored hawk Accipiter bicolor ). We then played all types of recorded alarm calls back to birds and tamarins, and measured 1) the time to respond (for both birds and tamarins), and 2) the distance moved across the substrate (for tamarins). Our results show that both birds and tamarins were significantly more likely to flee when hearing vocal alarms compared to a control (a common bird call, the screaming piha Lipaugus vociferans ), regardless of the species who produced the alarm. In addition, tamarins moved significantly more upon hearing bird alarm calls when compared to the control. We suggest that signals regarding shared predators may be highly valued across prey from distinct social groups. These data support the hypothesis that overlapping potential predators can drive communication between distinct prey groups, resulting in taxonomically diverse eavesdropping networks within tropical rainforests.",,Funding – This project was funded by a National Geographic Grant to AEM (9848‐16).,Oikos,,,,2021-08-19,2021,2021-08-19,2022-10,2022,10,,Closed,Article,"Martínez, Ari E.; Parra, Eliseo; Gomez, Juan Pablo; Vredenburg, Vance T.","Martínez, Ari E.

The effects of these measures, necessary to prevent the virus from spreading, must be studied. In particular, quarantines are known to have an impact on quality of life and well-being (for example, associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other psychosocial consequences). Furthermore, these effects are expected to be more pronounced in previously disadvantaged populations, such as LGBT people. This paper describes the main measures taken by LGBT population during quarantine to avoid COVID-19 and its psychosocial consequences on an individual and social basis. Method Non-probability sampling was used. An online self-administered survey including 1181 participants was used. These were lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender residents over 18 years old from Chile. Results Almost eight out of ten participants were in a total quarantine situation. From them, 18.2% were in partial isolation and only 4.6% were not in quarantine. COVID-19 has affected almost all the LGBT participants to a certain extent. COVID-19 has emotionally affected the vast majority of the LGBT participants to a certain extent. In other words, the pandemic has affected their lives. This psychosocial impact of COVID has been greater for people who define themselves as *sexual (include queer, asexual, pansexual, demisexual). Discussion The measures taken to prevent the virus transmission significantly affect LGBT people's life. In particular, these measures affect *sexual people. *sexual people must manage discrimination and misunderstanding of their identity in many contexts including their family.","The authors appreciate the contribution of all the participants in the study, particularly the institutional support given by the Sexual Diversity Movement (MUMS, for its acronym in Spanish).",,Sexologies,,,,2021-01-02,2021,2021-01-02,2021-01,30,1,e35-e41,Closed,Article,"Barrientos, J.; Guzmán-González, M.; Urzúa, A.; Ulloa, F.","Barrientos, J.

However, some mental health indicators, such as ethnic identity, may have a protective effect on this relationship. This study’s main objective is to analyze the mediating effect of ethnic identity on the relationship between acculturation stress and abnormal eating behaviors in Colombian migrants living in Chile.MethodsWe obtained data on 976 Colombian migrants who were recruited with the help of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Colombian Consulate in Chile, and self-managed groups of migrants residing in Chile. The mediation model was analyzed using Mplus 8.2 software, using the robust weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimation method.ResultsThe most common abnormal eating behaviors were eating until you feel full and eating large amounts of food. The mediation model was adapted to the data. The effects indicate that ethnic identity only had an indirect effect on the problems of social relations with other migrants (indirect effect = .17, p = .01) and on the distance from the origin (indirect effect = −. 06, p = .01) on the abnormal eating behaviors. On the other hand, the ethnic identity presented a direct and indirect effect on the relationship between citizenship and legality problems, and abnormal behaviors (indirect effect = −.06, p = .04; direct effect = −.35, p = .01).DiscussionEthnic identity could be fundamental in the relationship between acculturation stress and abnormal eating behaviors, considering that post-migration eating practices are associated with unhealthy eating habits.",,"This publication is part of the FONDECYT Grant # 1180315, funded by the National Research and Development Agency of the Government of Chile—ANID (Ex-CONICYT)—who did not have any interference in the writing or content of the text.",Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities,,,Acculturation; Chile; Colombia; Ethnicity; Humans; Transients and Migrants,2021-02-08,2021,2021-02-08,2022-04,9,2,413-419,Closed,Article,"Hun, Nelson; Urzúa, Alfonso; Henríquez, Diego Tomás; López-Espinoza, Antonio","Hun, Nelson (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

Our results show that the nine islands of the archipelago (San Andres, Providencia, Albuquerque, Este-Sureste, Roncador, Quitasueño, Serrana, Serranilla and Bajo Nuevo) correspond to the emerged portions of a belt of volcanic edifices extending along the ASAPSC seafloor. Overall, the submarine slopes are characterized by having steep flanks that extend to depths greater than −2000 m and are frequently cut by linear gullies and canyons. The submarine volcanic buildings are aligned in specific directions, parallel to the trends of the main fault systems in the area, indicating that the genesis and evolution of the archipelago have been strongly influenced by the interplay between volcanism and tectonics. Moreover, the presence of several pull-apart basins (Providencia, Albuquerque, Nutibara, Cunas and Guambiano depressions) related to S-shaped releasing bends in the Albuquerque-Providencia, Pedro and Serrana fault systems evidences that an intraplate transtensional tectonics is currently operating in this sector of the Caribbean plate. We propose that the ASAPSC belongs to the Northwestern Caribbean Volcanic Province (NCVP), which corresponds to a province made of an oceanic crust highly affected by volcanism sandwiched between a block composed of continental crust (Upper Nicaraguan Rise) and a block underlain by a CLIP-type to normal oceanic crust (Colombia Basin). Finally, the identification of massive debris avalanche deposits and large-scale bedforms shows that mass wasting processes have been common in the most recent history of the ASAPSC. This implies that collapses of the seamount flanks and the subsequent generation of tsunamis should be considered as a new threat to the coastal zones of the western Caribbean Sea.","The authors are very grateful to the General Maritime Directorate of Colombia (DIMAR) and the Center for Oceanographic and Hydrographic Research of Colombia (CIOH) for kindly sharing the multibeam bathymetry data, and to the National Hydrocarbon Agency of Colombia (ANH) for sharing the regional seismic profiles.

In this paper we formulate and estimate a joint travel mode-departure time model for commuting trips using combined revealed preference (RP) and stated choice (SC) data. The RP data considered nine alternative modes and up to 11 time periods, and the level-of-service data were obtained at an unusual level of precision using GPS measurements. The travel time, cost and cost divided by the wage rate coefficients were fairly similar in both the RP and SC environments, suggesting equal error variances for both datasets. The only parameters that differed between each type of data were those associated with the schedule delay early (SDE) and late (SDL) variables required by Small’s Scheduling Model. This may be due to the potentially different temporal perspectives between RP choices (longer term decisions) and SC decisions, arguably shorter term given the nature of the experiment and the context presented in it (implementation of a congestion charging policy and a flexible working-hours scheme). The models were used to forecast the impacts of a hypothetic congestion charging scheme in Santiago, showing that the schedule delay coefficients derived from the SC context produced a smoother and less-peaked temporal distribution of travel demand than the RP parameters.","We are grateful to Instituto Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería (ANID PIA/BASAL AFB180003) for supporting our research work.

Using data from a physical activity survey of São Paulo (Brazil), we estimate multigroup structural equation models considering four age cohorts: young adults (18 to 29 years old), middle-aged adults-1 (30 to 45), middle-aged adults-2 (46 to 59) and older adults (60 to 70 years old). The study shows that security and walkability positively influence the subjective wellbeing of all age cohorts. Our findings suggest that improving the wellbeing of a population through urban strategies should focus on providing attractive neighborhoods and increasing people's perceptions of security. The wellbeing of the elderly is the most affected by safety, while middle-aged adults value more walkability comparing to other groups. The youngers' wellbeing seems to be less influenced by these two variables and also influenced less neighborhood satisfaction. Few studies have been conducted on this subject, particularly in cities in the Global South. The results of this study could contribute to debates on wellbeing by promoting cities designed to respond to peoples' emotional needs and behavior.",The authors thank the brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPQ) for the financial support provided from Project 407630/2016-3.,,Research in Transportation Business & Management,,,,2021-09,2021,,2021-09,40,,100559,Closed,Article,"Lucchesi, Shanna Trichês; Larranaga, Ana Margarita; Ochoa, Julian Alberto Arellana; Samios, Ariadne Amanda Barbosa; Cybis, Helena Beatriz Bettella","Lucchesi, Shanna Trichês (Industrial and Transportation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; Departamento de Ingenierıa Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Larranaga, Ana Margarita (Industrial and Transportation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); Ochoa, Julian Alberto Arellana (WRI Brazil Sustainable Cities, Brazil); Samios, Ariadne Amanda Barbosa (WRI Brazil Sustainable Cities, Brazil); Cybis, Helena Beatriz Bettella (Industrial and Transportation Engineering Department, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil)","Lucchesi, Shanna Trichês (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; Universidad del Norte)","Lucchesi, Shanna Trichês (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; Universidad del Norte); Larranaga, Ana Margarita (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Ochoa, Julian Alberto Arellana (WRI Brazil Sustainable Cities, Brazil); Samios, Ariadne Amanda Barbosa (WRI Brazil Sustainable Cities, Brazil); Cybis, Helena Beatriz Bettella (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul)",34,15,,13.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131249830,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Due to its great potential to cover short and medium distances, the use of the bicycle as a feeder mode to BRT is a priority on the public policy agenda. In addition to physical, level of service, and socioeconomic variables, safety perception is a factor playing a major role in the intention to use bicycles, and it may become more important for potential users than the infrastructure itself. Even though bicycle infrastructure and safety perception are linked, few studies have analyzed the effects that the bicycle infrastructure has on the safety perception. This paper studies how the characteristics of bike lanes influence safety perception and the intention to use bicycles as a feeder mode to BRT, using Bogotá’s Transmilenio as a case study. For this purpose, we used a hybrid discrete choice modeling approach to simultaneously estimate the attributes’ parameters explaining safety perception and the intention to use cycling as a feeder mode to BRT. Our findings showed that providing colored pavement, buffers with planters or buffers with safe hit posts increase both the safety perception and the potential demand of the bicycles as a feeder mode to BRT. Our modeling approach allowed us to identify combining promotion policies and measures of adaptation of existing infrastructure to increase bike lane coverage and encourage potential users to adopt the bicycle as a feeder mode to Transmilenio.",,,Travel Behaviour and Society,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,24,,205-217,Closed,Article,"Márquez, Luis; Cantillo, Víctor; Arellana, Julián","Márquez, Luis (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia, Avenida Central del Norte 39-115, Tunja, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte)",20,15,,7.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137371988,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

The mitogenome of R. diazi was assembled from short Illumina 150 bp pair-end reads with a coverage of 189x. The AT-rich mitochondrial genome of R. diazi is 17,400 bp in length and is comprised of 13 PCGs, two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. The gene order observed in the mitochondrial genome of R. diazi is identical to that reported for other leporids. Phylogenetic analyses based on PCGs support the basal position of Romerolagus within the Leporidae, at least when compared to the genera Oryctolagus and Lepus. Nonetheless, additional mitochondrial genomes from species belonging to the genera Bunolagus, Sylvilagus, and Pronolagus, among others, are needed before a more robust conclusion about the derived vs basal placement of Romerolagus within the family Leporidae can be reached based on mitochondrial PCGs.ConclusionsThis is the first genomic resource developed for R. diazi and it represents a tool to improve our understanding about the ecology and evolutionary biology of this iconic and endangered species.","First author would like to thank Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, México, for its financial support with master’s degree scholarship number 1018336.

The Micronucleus (MN) test was carried out using hemocytes of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus from two sites in northern-central Chile (La Pampilla and Totoralillo). Nuclear abnormalities were assessed, and high frequencies of micronucleus (10.7–14.4‰) and other abnormalities were found (51.9–76.6‰). These values tended to be higher in La Pampilla, possibly due to the large presence of pollution sources in that site. However, considerably high values were observed in both sites. P. purpuratus is a suitable bioindicator and further monitoring along the Chilean coast using this species should be developed using the MN test and/or other biomarkers to comprehend the effects of human activities on the coastal environment of Chile.","We thank to the volunteers that helped in different stages of this work.

Our multidisciplinary approach comprises technical, technological, and technology diffusion assessments (market analysis). We estimate the theoretical energy potential in the MRM from spatial and temporal measurements of the physical and biochemical properties of the waters. Thereafter, we compare the power output of a tailored RED prototype using synthetic solutions and untreated natural waters from MRM. Finally, we propose a dynamic model for RED diffusion in Colombia. Our results show that the MRM exhibits suitable conditions for harnessing SGP given the prevailing thermohaline structure, tolerable water quality, and an existing physical barrier between the sea and the river. However, our experiments demonstrated that maximum power is reduced by half when feeding with MRM waters. This is attributed to the divalent ions and low concentration of the river. Finally, the dynamic model shows that the learning rate and the initial operational costs are key variables for technology diffusion. This research is a pioneer in integrating multidisciplinary perspectives of SGP in emerging economies. However, this baseline may be further complemented with socio-political, and economic analyses.","This work was supported by the department of science, technology, and innovation of Colombia (Colciencias) [contract numbers: 361-2015, 134-2016, and 077-2017]; and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through the granted project: “SWINDON – Sustainable Water Management in Developing Countries” [Project ID: 57159929].

I propose that this mail system, in which official and unofficial postal services coexisted, allowed for an intense communicational experience; rather than restricting correspondence, mail circulated at unprecedented levels. To understand this system's rationale I focus on the figure of the correos mayores, who were responsible for the distribution of official information (or information of interest to the crown) within certain Spanish American cities. Using sources in American and European archives, I question the premise that Spanish American communication was chaotic during this period. I also argue that the exceptional circulation of mail within Spanish America and overseas during the sixteenth century is essential for understanding European expansion and the early modern world.",,,Hispanic American Historical Review,,,,2021-11-01,2021,,2021-11-01,101,4,567-596,Closed,Article,"Martínez, Nelson Fernando González","Martínez, Nelson Fernando González ()",,"Martínez, Nelson Fernando González ()",2,2,,6.09,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142444748,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

Contamination levels were represented by thin layers with different values of conductivities and thicknesses. Altitudes differences were simulated by equivalent voltages using correction factors. The results showed that by increasing the conductivity and altitude values, there was a considerable increase in the concentration of the electric field and leakage currents, changing from capacitive to resistive regime of electrical potential distribution along the insulator surface. The proposed levels of contamination and altitudes were analyzed by increasing the dimensions of the insulator according to IEC standards. In the case of the capacitive regime (conductivities lower than 10-4 S/m) there was a decrease in the electric field intensity up to 21% compared to an insulator at sea level. In resistive regime, a decrease up to 34.5% was obtained for leakage currents considering conductivities calculated according to the site pollution severity shown in the IEC standard. Despite the decrease of the leakage current after the increase of the insulator dimensions based on the standards, it did not mitigate all theoretical leakage current calculated along the insulator surface. Future work will focus on experimental research to validate this theoretical results.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2021-07-07,2021,2021-07-07,,19,8,1278-1285,Closed,Article,"Araya, Jersim; Montana, Johny; Schurch, Roger","Araya, Jersim (Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria); Montana, Johny (Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria); Schurch, Roger (Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria)",,"Araya, Jersim (Federico Santa María Technical University); Montana, Johny (Federico Santa María Technical University); Schurch, Roger (Federico Santa María Technical University)",15,10,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139509109,40 Engineering,

It occurs in organisms across all biological kingdoms and has a range different of functions, thus indicating its important evolutionary role. The presence of melanin offers several protective advantages, including against ultraviolet radiation, traumatic damage, oxidative stress, extreme temperatures, and pressure. For many species of fungi, melanin also participates directly in the process of virulence and pathogenicity. These organisms can synthesize melanin in two main ways: using a substrate of endogenous origin, involving 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN); alternatively, in an exogenous manner with the addition of L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA or levodopa). As melanin is an amorphous and complex substance, its study requires expensive and inaccessible technologies and analyses are often difficult to perform with conventional biochemical techniques. As such, details about its chemical structure are not yet fully understood, particularly for nematophagous fungi that remain poorly studied. Thus, this review presents an overview of the different types of melanin, with an emphasis on fungi, and discusses the role of melanin in the biology and ecology of nematophagous fungi.",The authors thank FAPERJ- Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio de Janeiro and the State University of North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro-UENF.,,Journal of Chemical Ecology,,,Fungi; Laccase; Levodopa; Melanins; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Naphthols; Polyketide Synthases,2021-07-07,2021,2021-07-07,2021-07,47,7,597-613,Closed,Article,"Freitas, Deivid França; da Rocha, Izabelli Martins; Vieira-da-Motta, Olney; de Paula Santos, Clóvis","Freitas, Deivid França (Laboratory of Cellular and Tissue Biology-LBCT, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro-UENF, Av.

Its exploitation ended in 2003 due to the exhaustion of its reserves. In November 2004, the controlled flooding of the openpit began. During this process, both the qualities of stored water and piezometric levels have been monitored to control the possible water detraction from the Saja-Besaya hydrographic system. This paper deals with the water chemistry analysis of the pit lake surface, as well as the different conditions of the area. Geological and hydrogeological contexts play an important role in the lake water chemistry. The lake water quality continues improving. The sulphate content and zinc concentrations are already below the permitted pouring limits. Three factors are distinguished: the washing of the mine shafts is completed; the water supply from the aquifer contributes to the dissolution of the salt content and the bedrock, and dolomite, which neutralizes acid waters and improves the water quality during the flooding process with a pH value of 8. Owing to these conditions, the stored water meets the necessary conditions for discharge and provides the opportunities to use it.","The authors thank Asturiana de Zinc SA, belonging to Xstrata international mining group, for contributing invaluable information to this study.",Not applicable.,Environmental Geochemistry and Health,,,"Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Lakes; Spain; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Water Supply",2021-05-25,2021,2021-05-25,2021-12,43,12,5119-5134,Closed,Article,"Barral, Noemí; Husillos, Raúl; Castillo, Elena; Cánovas, Manuel; Lam, Elizabeth","Barral, Noemí (Transport and Project and Process Technology, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain); Husillos, Raúl (Transport and Project and Process Technology, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain); Castillo, Elena (Geographic Engineering and Graphic Expression Techniques Department, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain); Cánovas, Manuel (Mining and Metallurgical Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Lam, Elizabeth (Chemical Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Barral, Noemí (University of Cantabria)","Barral, Noemí (University of Cantabria); Husillos, Raúl (University of Cantabria); Castillo, Elena (University of Cantabria); Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Lam, Elizabeth (Catholic University of the North)",4,2,0.26,1.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138331324,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology,

METHODS: The 3435C>T polymorphism prevalence was analyzed using oligonucleotide probes and next-generation sequencing in 421 unrelated healthy individuals living in Cuba. Data were stratified by gender, ethnic background and residence. The genotype and allelic frequencies were determined.
RESULTS: The genotype distribution met the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumption. The allelic frequency was 63.5% for the 3435C variant. The genotype frequencies were 41.1% for CC, 44.9% for CT and 14.0% for TT. The allele and genotype distributions differed between individuals living in La Habana and Santiago de Cuba (p<0.05) when ethnic background was analyzed. The allelic distribution was similar among Admixed and Black subjects, and they differed from Caucasians. The CC genotype was equally distributed among Admixed and Black subjects, and they differed from Caucasians. The TT genotype frequency differed between Caucasians and Admixed. The CT genotype was distributed differently among the three groups. Similar distribution was obtained in Brazilians, whereas some similarities were observed in African, Spanish and Chinese populations, consistent with the mixed Cuban ethnic origin.

Since industrialization, metal micronutrients in these regions have increased. Phytoplankton use metals as micronutrients in metabolic processes, but in excess, had deleterious effects. In coastal systems, picoeukaryotes represent a diverse and abundant group with widespread distribution and fundamental roles in biogeochemical cycling. We combined different approaches to explore picoeukaryotes seasonal variability in a chronically metal polluted coastal area at the south-eastern Pacific Ocean. Through remote and field measurements to monitor environmental conditions and 18S rRNA gene sequencing for taxonomic profiling, we determined metal chronic effect on picoeukaryote community's structure. Our results revealed a stable richness and a variable distribution of the relative abundance, despite the physicochemical seasonal variations. These results suggest that chronic metal contamination influences temporal heterogeneity of picoeukaryote communities, with a decoupling between abiotic and biotic patterns.","This study is part of the research project FONDECYT 1171259 founded by CONICYT, and CONICYT PhD fellowship N°21161269 to B.

1073,pub.1135283706,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112086,33571852,,Long-term operation of a permeable reactive barrier with diffusive exchange,"In this study, we evaluate the long term operation of a bench-scale reactor which simulates a permeable reactive barrier with sulfidic diffusive exchange (SDES PRB) to treat acid mine drainage (AMD), considering that treatment costs are very sensitive to the useful life for passive reactors. Its functioning was evaluated for a much longer period of 591 days compared to previous SDES PRB studies, with two influents simulating moderately and highly acid groundwater contaminated by AMD. First, we fed water amended with 200 mg/L Zn2+ and 3300 mg/L SO42- at pH 4.9; and after, water with 450 mg/L Fe2+, 100 mg/L Zn2+, 10 mg/L Ni2+, 5 mg/L Cu2+ and 3600 mg/L SO42- at pH 2.5. Biologically produced sulfide and alkalinity were enough to remove both metals and acidity (~99%) from the moderately acidic water, while with the highly acidic water, they resulted in significant removal of the metals reaching up to 87% and 79% of total Fe and Zn, respectively. Furthermore, no inhibitory effect was apparent, as the sulfate reduction rates in the two experiments did not vary significantly (averages close to 0.2 mol/m3-d), despite the much higher acidity and metal load in the second case. Hence, the SDES PRB protected the microbial consortium from metal toxicity and acidity in the long-term, and thus is suitable for remediation of AMD contaminated groundwater with high concentrations of metals, extending the operational range of conventional biological PRBs. Furthermore, an economic evaluation shows that SDES costs can be competitive with the costs of conventional chemical precipitation if the enhanced reactivity that SDES technology offers is realized.",This work was financed by project ANID/FONDAP/ 15130015 and ANID FONDECYT-Postdoctoral project 3180297.,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,"Acids; Groundwater; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metals; Mining; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2021-02-09,2021,2021-02-09,2021-04,284,,112086,Closed,Article,"Schwarz, Alex; Pérez, Norma","Schwarz, Alex (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Centro de Recursos Hídricos para La Agricultura y Minería (CRHIAM), Universidad de Concepción, Barrio Universitario, Concepción, Chile.

In the laboratory setting, there are various tests – both of dynamic and monotonic loading modes – that can be used to measure, characterize, and quantify the cracking resistance potential of HMA mixes. However, one key challenge with most of these laboratory tests is correlations and validation with field performance data. Quite often, field data availability is a challenge or otherwise, needs costly long-term performance monitoring. Using the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely the Texas Data Storage System (DSS), as the data source, this study was conducted to correlate and preliminarily validate the laboratory monotonic-loading overlay tester (OT) to the field crack performance of in-service highway sections. As excerpted from the DSS, four HMA mixes and six in-service highway sections (overlays) were used. Overall, the monotonic-loading OT test exhibited promising potential as a repeatable test (coefficient of variation [COV] < 30%) for evaluating and quantifying the cracking resistance potential of HMA mixes in the laboratory relative to the field performance of in-service highway sections. In particular, the following HMA fracture parameters, fracture energy (FE), tensile strength (σt ), FE Index, and peak load (Pmax ) from the monotonic-loading OT test, with COV values less than 30%, were able to statistically differentiate the HMA mixes (statistical groups ≥ 2) and also correlated well (coefficient of determination [R2 ] > 60%) with the measured field cracking performance data.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The present study was carried out with the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente (Colombia) community by environmental engineering students enrolled in a Chemistry 2 course. The students helped the Universidad Autonoma de Occidente community reinforce criteria for separating solid waste generated in the cafeteria. To carry out this project, the students had to appropriate concepts from the chemistry course such as functional groups, types of polymers, and the biodegradation process of materials and its relation to the principles of solid waste separation. Once the concepts were learned, students developed strategies to guide the community in the correct separation of solid waste using a simple vocabulary so that people unfamiliar with chemistry could understand and apply the concepts. The project positively impacted student learning and promoted personal satisfaction as a result of performing useful service and using their knowledge to solve a real worldwide problem.","The corresponding author wishes to thank the Chemistry 2-2018 students at Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, Camila Bonilla, Camila Duque, Natalia Valencia, Daniela Velez, and Sara Gomez, who designed and provided the brochure used in this paper.

We use three climate models provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathways scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to assess the trends and spatial behavior of six atmospheric and ocean variables in the Caribbean Basin during the twenty-first century. Atmospheric results are reported from the model ensemble; however oceanic results are reported from ACCESS1.0 model, as its resolution captures mesoscale processes which are important for regional sea level projections. Surface atmospheric pressure and wind do not show significant trends. On the contrary, air and sea surface temperature, surface salinity, and mean sterodynamic sea level have coherent positive trends in the Caribbean Basin, which increase with a greater RCP scenario. Air temperature will probably increase by 2 °C over the preindustrial period during the century. Moreover, sea surface temperature is expected to rise between 1.92° and 3.01 °C in the 1976–2005 to 2071–2100 period. The Caribbean Sea warming will have the potential to extend the hurricane season, increase the frequency of tropical storms, and intensify coral bleaching events. In the same period, mean sterodynamic sea level is expected to rise in the basin between 32.53 and 43.25 cm, depending on the RCP scenario used. The strongest trend expected in 2005-2100 is 50.84 ± 1.48 cm cy−1 under RCP8.5 scenario. Furthermore, the trends appear to accelerate since the last century in the basin. Besides, sterodynamic sea level rise would account for slightly over half of the total sea level rise in the Caribbean, after land-ice melting among other contributions not accounted by CMIP5 models are included. These trends have the potential to exacerbate flooding and erosion, putting at risk coastal areas, including low-elevation islands such as some in the San Andres and Providencia Archipelago.",The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on this paper.,,Ocean Dynamics,,,,2021-05-14,2021,2021-05-14,2021-07,71,6-7,757-777,Closed,Article,"Bustos Usta, David Francisco; Torres Parra, Rafael Ricardo","Bustos Usta, David Francisco (Grupo de Investigación en Geociencias GEO4, Departamento de Física y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía, Barranquilla, Puerto Colombia, Colombia); Torres Parra, Rafael Ricardo (Grupo de Investigación en Geociencias GEO4, Departamento de Física y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía, Barranquilla, Puerto Colombia, Colombia)","Bustos Usta, David Francisco (Universidad del Norte)","Bustos Usta, David Francisco (Universidad del Norte); Torres Parra, Rafael Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",11,7,,2.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138068552,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 3702 Climate Change Science; 3708 Oceanography,13 Climate Action

A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was estimated to test an a priori model that relates the sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 Anxiety, psychological well-being, anxiety and depression. The model fit indices indicated a good fit to the data. The socio-demographic variables explained 23.8% of the variance of the COVID-19 Anxiety (R2 = .238). Socio-demographic variables explained 50.5% of psychological well-being variance, 52% of anxiety and 46.9% of depression. Also, sex, work; being diagnosed with COVID-19; family member with COVID-19 diagnosis; and time of exposure to COVID-19 information had statistically significant effects psychological well-being, anxiety and depression. In conclusion, some sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 anxiety affect the psychological well-being, anxiety and depression.

1048,pub.1135875265,10.1002/ajpa.24260,33655516,,The accuracy of age estimation using transition analysis in the Hamann‐Todd collection,"OBJECTIVES: Reconstructing demography of past populations using skeletal data is challenging when analyzing adults because the process of biological aging does not always reflect the individual's chronological age. A proposed solution to address the limitations of traditional age estimation methods is transition analysis (TA), a multifactorial method of age estimation. However, despite its methodological refinement, TA has varying degrees of accuracy when applied to different known-age skeletal samples. This study assesses TA's accuracy by comparing age estimates to known age at death in the Hamann-Todd Collection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We contrasted the maximum likelihood age estimates generated by the ADBOU program to the known ages of 221 individuals. The absolute error was calculated for the entire sample, and compared between sex and ancestry.
RESULTS: The mean absolute error in the sample is 11.6 (SD = 10.3) years, with white individuals' errors (14.1 years) being significantly higher than black individuals' (9.1 years; p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between sexes (p = 0.621). A weak to moderate positive correlation was found between known age and absolute error for white males (R = 0.607; p < 0.001), white females (R = 0.509; p < 0.001), and black males (R = 0.371; p = 0.006). The accuracy of TA age estimates varied when each anatomical region was analyzed independently, but the combination of all three anatomical regions yielded the most accurate age estimates.
DISCUSSION: These findings further support that TA accuracy depends on the prior distribution used and, in the Hamann-Todd Collection, the accuracy for white individuals is more influenced by this limitation than when black individuals are analyzed.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,Adult; Aging; Female; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male,2021-03-02,2021,2021-03-02,2021-07,175,3,680-688,Closed,Article,"Simon, Allyson M.; Hubbe, Mark","Simon, Allyson M.

However, along with these processes and in relation to the metabolism of the microorganism and the worms present in the vermicomposting, CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. Taking these issues into account, different masses of fly ash were used to study the control of the CO2 of the gas coming from a vermicomposting process and to evaluate the possibility of using the adsorbent as fertilizer in the culture of lettuce Lactuca sativa. Along the vermicomposting process, an increase in the concentration of CO2 emissions was observed, with a maximum level of emission at the day 20 of the process and an average of 770 mg/L in air. After the adsorption process, the CO2 concentration was lower due to the effect of the fly ash that was able to trap the emitted gas. The percentage of CO2 adsorption shows maximum values of 55.5, 58.1 and 63.8% with 0.5, 1 and 1.5 kg of fly ash, respectively. The CO2 uptake capacities of the different loads of fly ash used were 3.39, 7.03 and 6.84 mmol CO2/g sorbent with 0.5, 1 and 1.5 kg of fly ash, respectively. After five weeks of sowing L. sativa, it was observed that when no fly ash was used in the soil, the length of the stem was 10.2 cm. Then, the length of the stem was 22 cm, and 16 cm when 10% of fly ash was applied and not applied in the adsorption process, getting a significant correlation between the load of fly ash and the length of the stem. The r when fly ash was used in the adsorption process was 0.9817 and 0.9811 when no ash fly was used in the process.",The authors thank to the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for providing invaluable equipment support.,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon Dioxide; Coal Ash; Composting; Environmental Pollution; Soil,2021-09-04,2021,2021-09-04,2022-01,803,,150069,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Cortes, Ernesto; Munizaga-Plaza, Juan Antonio","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Coquimbo, Chile.

Due to its restricted distribution, habitat specificity, and diet requirements, E. alba has been strongly affected by habitat loss and fragmentation during the last decade. In this study, we developed the first genomic resource for this species; we assembled and analyzed in detail the complete mitochondrial genome of E. alba. The mitogenome of E. alba is 16,664 bp in length and is comprised of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and a putative Control Region (CR) 1,232 bp in length. Gene arrangement in the mitochondrial chromosome of E. alba is identical to that reported before in other species of co-familiar bats. All PCGs are under purifying selection, with atp8 experiencing the least selective pressure. In all PCGs, codons ending with adenine are preferred over others ending in thymine and cytosine. Except tRNA-Serine 1, all tRNAs exhibit a cloverleaf secondary structure. The CR of E. alba exhibits three domains commonly described in other mammals, including bats; extended terminal associated sequences (ETAS), central, and conserved sequence block (CSB). A ML phylogenetic reconstruction of the family Phyllostomidae based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs confirms the monophyletic status of the subfamily Sternodermatinae and indicates the close relationship between E. alba and the genus Artibeus. This is the first genomic resource developed for E. alba and represents the first step to improving our understanding of the genomic underpinnings involved in the evolution of specialization as well as acclimatization and adaptation to local and global change of specialist bats.",J.

The UNESCO Chair wanted to stimulate interest in Developmental Biology among Brazilian students and scientists by organizing annual international courses on Evolution and Developmental Biology at an advanced level. At the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the UNESCO Chair established an international laboratory for the permanent training of researchers and the development of research programs in Developmental Biology and related areas. Moreover, the program aimed at establishing an international network connecting Brazilian Universities and research centers in Latin America and Europe. The advanced hands-on courses, symposiums, and workshops promoted by this Chair inspired the careers of many young scientists. They generated new lines of research in Developmental Biology using a variety of animal models.

Such disruptions have the potential of obstructing the performance of post-disaster relief operations, whose objective is to serve the affected population promptly. Therefore, it is important to develop strategic plans for restoring the transportation networks in the aftermath of a disaster. In this study, we address the problem of coordinating road network restoration and relief activities under the presence of heterogeneous types of roads disruptions. In this regard, we present a mathematical model for scheduling and routing restoration machines as well as relief vehicles. The approach seeks a restoration plan that is devoted to providing support to the relief operations. This implies prioritizing road rehabilitations taking into consideration their impact on the efficiency of relief activities. Additionally, we provide a heuristic algorithm to solve large instances of our problem for which commercial optimizers are insufficient. The approach is applied on a realistic case study based on the flooding which occurred in the Mojana region of northern Colombia in 2010–2011.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",OR Spectrum,,,,2021-07-17,2021,2021-07-17,2021-12,43,4,941-981,Closed,Article,"García-Alviz, Juliette; Galindo, Gina; Arellana, Julián; Yie-Pinedo, Ruben","García-Alviz, Juliette (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Galindo, Gina (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Galindo, Gina (Universidad del Norte)","García-Alviz, Juliette (Universidad del Norte); Galindo, Gina (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte)",13,9,,4.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139745786,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Globally, Gymnura altavela is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Our study analyzed the complete mitochondrial genome of G. altavela sequenced from an individual captured in the western Atlantic and compared it with a mitochondrial genome from a conspecific collected in the Mediterranean to explore if G. altavela comprises cryptic species. The newly assembled mitochondrial genome of G. altavela is 19,361bp in length and has 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (12s ribosomal RNA and 16s ribosomal RNA), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a 3,659 bp control region. The gene order is identical to that reported for the specimen collected in the Mediterranean and that of the congeneric Long-tailed Butterfly Ray, G. poecilura. A phylomitogenomic analysis based on translated PCGs supported the monophyly of the genus Gymnura and indicated that genetic dissimilarity between G. altavela from the western Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea was greater than that calculated among congeneric species belonging to the genera Mobula and Neotrygon, similar to that calculated among congeneric stingrays in the genus Hemitrygon, but lower than that calculated among congeneric species in the genera Pateobatis and Urogymnus. Overall, our comparisons suggest that G. altavela comprises cryptic species or at least indicates considerable genetic structure between populations in the western Atlantic and Mediterranean. We present these findings in a phylomitogenomic analysis of other Myliobatiformes and Rhinopristiformes. Additional phylogeographic and taxonomic studies of G. altavela are needed to support conservation efforts for this endangered ray that may comprise cryptic evolutionary units.","JAB thanks Dr. Vincent P.

The aim of this research was to test this effect in a Global South context, in two Brazilian cities where pedestrian-oriented urban environments are scarce and where modal choice is conditioned on economic constraints. We used multigroup structural equation models to represent the perception of walkability and to assess its interrelations with perceptions of personal safety and quality of life. The impact of walkability on sales price was tested using buying opportunities and walking frequency as moderator variables to see whether this effect can be scaled up. The results show that the prices of multifamily residential properties in the two study areas increase as perceived walkability increases but the magnitude of the effect is city-independent demonstrating that exist demand to live in walkable areas even in restricted conditions.

The structure is instrumented with seismic accelerometers, which are moved in different setups for a detailed characterization of the mode shapes. In addition, eight strain gauges are installed, two at the bottom of each leg of the tower. Two particular challenges in the modal analysis are highlighted. First, due to the symmetry of the tower, the bending modes occur in pairs with near to identical natural frequencies and orthogonal mode shapes. These mode shapes change from one setup to another, which complicates the merging of partial mode shapes obtained from different setups. Second, the acceleration signals are polluted by radio signals. It is shown how these two issues are solved, resulting in the identification of five bending modes. The identified natural frequencies and mode shapes are very close to those predicted by a detailed finite element model of the tower, where the vertical columns are modeled using beam elements and the connections between the columns and the braces are assumed pinned. This confirms the validity of such detailed finite element models for the assessment of the dynamic response of these lattice towers under wind loading.","The research presented in this paper has been performed within the framework of the project ZEIN2016PR419 “VIBRAS”, funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), Belgium.

This perspective can help researchers understand an excitable cell’s action potential from a mathematical and electrical approximation using a simple model. The experiment was designed based on RC circuits associated with the ionic channels of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+). The proposed model also incorporates the ‘dendrite’ action not employed in the Hodgkin and Huxley model. Thus, a linear function by parts was used in mathematical modeling, recreating the excitable cell’s behavior through numerical and electronic simulation.

Identifying the sources of FMD is important to take the necessary actions to diminish their abundance. In 2019 eleven transects were opportunistically conducted to evaluate the abundance, spatial distribution and composition of FMD in the same area, and to compare them with the previous study using the same methodology. FMD identified were classified into the same six categories from the previous study, however ""Others"" category were now the dominant one indicating that new pollutants have been increasing during the last decade. Inside the ""others"" category, plastics buoy and other floating devices, that normally are used by the salmon aquaculture, were the main items. Similarly than the previous study, styrofoam and domestic plastics were also the other most abundant items. In general, also, an increase in abundance compared with the previous study was found. The highest abundances were similarly found in the ""Golfo de Corcovado"" zone ranging from 50 to 230 items km-2. Our results, as well as the previous study, confirm that sea-based activities are still responsible for the FMD found in the Northern Patagonia. To avoid the origin of this contamination it is urgent to implement public policies that effectively reduce FMD, and hold the aquaculture industries responsible.","Special acknowledgement to the crew of the R/V“Tiffara”.

METHODS: A cross-sectional instrumental model was used, with a sample of 253 caregivers of patients suffering of Schizophrenia in Bolivia, Peru and Chile. The psychometric properties of the S-CGQoL were tested through construct validity, reliability and some aspects of external validity. In addition, in order to assess the nature of the different items across the three countries, a Differential Performance Analysis (DPA) was conducted.
RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale structure was well correlated to the initial structure of the QoL-MDS. The results confirmed the existence of adequate reliability indicators (α>.70 and ω>.80) and the absence of FIDs supporting the invariance of item calibrations among the three Latin American countries.

Species in this genus exhibit a range of social organizations, including pair-forming, communal breeding, and eusociality, the latter only known to have evolved within this genus in the marine realm. This study examines the complete mitochondrial genomes of seven species of Synalpheus and explores differences between eusocial and non-eusocial species considering that eusociality has been shown before to affect the strength of purifying selection in mitochondrial protein coding genes. The AT-rich mitochondrial genomes of Synalpheus range from 15,421 bp to 15,782 bp in length and comprise, invariably, 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. A 648 bp to 994 bp long intergenic space is assumed to be the D-loop. Mitochondrial gene synteny is identical among the studied shrimps. No major differences occur between eusocial and non-eusocial species in nucleotide composition and codon usage profiles of PCGs and in the secondary structure of tRNA genes. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the complete concatenated PCG complement of 90 species supports the monophyly of the genus Synalpheus and its family Alpheidae. Moreover, the monophyletic status of the caridean families Alvinocaridae, Atyidae, Thoridae, Lysmatidae, Palaemonidae, and Pandalidae within caridean shrimps are fully or highly supported by the analysis. We therefore conclude that mitochondrial genomes contain sufficient phylogenetic information to resolve relationships at high taxonomic levels within the Caridea. Our analysis of mitochondrial genomes in the genus Synalpheus contributes to the understanding of the coevolution between genomic architecture and sociality in caridean shrimps and other marine organisms.",J.A.B. thanks Dr. Vincent P.

We develop a flexible and consistent approach in which the estimations of generated/attracted parameters are fuzzy with entropic membership functions. Based on a fuzzy-entropy approach, we measure the uncertainty associated with fuzzy variables. We solve the problem by means of compromise programming considering a weighted sum objective function. We compute and extend concepts such as accessibility, attractiveness, and generalized cost, typically obtained in transport economic analyzes. Considering that our formulation is convex, we solve the problem in one step only, maintaining the uniqueness of the the optimization problem solution. We present two numerical examples to illustrate the proposed methodology, analyzing the impact of the results based on strong mathematical and statistical arguments. Finally, we show that our approach has better prediction capabilities than traditional fuzzy models regarding aggregated indicators and structural distribution patterns.","The authors are grateful for the financial support provided under Projects ANID/FONDECYT/Regular 1191200, CONICYT/FONDECYT 11160320, Instituto Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería (ANID PIA/APOYO AFB180003) and project 4.148 of Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología.

According to our literature review, no previous models on optimal bundle composition can handle the competition as we do in this paper. Besides, we explain how a firm designing multiple bundles with equal price obtains a replication of identical bundles and an artificially increased estimation of the firm’s profit and market share, which is a consequence of the well-known Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives Property. To mitigate this effect, we use the Constrained Multinomial Logit Model, which induces differentiation in composition through soft constraints that represent the minimum quantity of the attributes offered in bundles. Although this methodology helps, its use implies more effort to estimate its parameters; nevertheless, these are feasible to be assessed. Firms can use our model to identify the bundles in which they should focus their commercial efforts, given the characteristics of their consumers.",The corresponding author was supported by FONDECYT projects 11160320 and 11200616.

And while much research has explored the role of migration on economic growth, the role of diaspora for the development of the country-of-origin entrepreneurial ecosystems remains virtually unknown. We advance evidence that the entrepreneurial activity in a country does not depend only on the activities of the current residents but also on the ties that keep them interconnected via its diaspora to global entrepreneurial hubs and on the (intangible) resources that the diaspora makes available to local entrepreneurs.

Invasive species often undergo adaptive evolution, but whether invasive species show greater evolutionary potential than their native counterparts under climate change has rarely been evaluated. We conducted experimental evolution trials comparing the evolution of physiological performance (light-saturated photosynthetic rate, Amax ) of coexisting and closely related (1) invasive-native species pairs from Arid, Alpine, and Antarctic ecosystems, and (2) an invasive-naturalized species pair from a Mediterranean ecosystem differing in invasiveness. Experiments were conducted over three generations and under four environments of temperature and water availability resembling typical and climate change conditions in each ecosystem. Amax increased across generations for most species. Invasive species from Arid, Alpine, and Antarctic ecosystems showed similar, greater, and lesser evolution of Amax than their native counterparts, respectively. The Mediterranean invasive species showed greater evolution of Amax than its naturalized congener. Similar patterns were observed in all four experimental environments for each ecosystem, suggesting that comparable responses may be expected under climate change scenarios. All study species showed a positive association between Amax and reproductive output.

The objective was to evaluate the dimensionality, homogeneity, gender differential item functioning (DIF), and nomological validity of Francis-4. 1,108 university students between 18 and 60 years of age were evaluated; 80.4% were women (n = 891). CFA was performed with the following fit indicators: chi-square, RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and McDonald’s omega were calculated. For nomological validity, the mean and standard deviation according to gender were compared with Student’s t-test. Gender DIF was quantified with Kendall’s tau-b. The CFA revealed the following goodness-of-fit coefficients: chi-square = 25.45, df = 2, p = .001, RMSEA = .10, 90% CI .07 – .14, CFI = .99, TLI = .99, and SRMR = .01.

The proposed rectifier-less circuit acted as a boost converter to extract energy from a piezoelectric device (PD). It combined the conventional boost, buck-boost methods using two split inductors and single filter capacitor. The proposed integrated circuit topology functioned in both positive and negative half cycles generated by the PD. In the proposed topology, inductors were invigorated by being enveloped with the current, which was produced by the PD through the switches. This facilitated active rectification of ultra-low AC (amplitude < 0.5 VP). Theoretical analysis, control strategies, simulation and experimental study were presented. The proposed circuit was capable of converting a low amplitude AC voltage of 0.5 VP into 5.1 Vdc. The highest output power extracted by the proposed circuit was 281.1 W, which outperformed existing circuits. It could potentially facilitate the advancement of vibration-based energy harvesting systems for low power demand applications such as sensors, quartz watches and portable charging devices.","This work was supported by the Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia.",,IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion,,,,2021-08-10,2021,2021-08-10,,37,1,505-514,Closed,Article,"Edla, Mahesh; Lim, Yee Yan; Mikio, Deguchi; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez","Edla, Mahesh (Faculty of Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Lim, Yee Yan (Faculty of Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Mikio, Deguchi (Department of Electronics and Control Engineering, National Institute of Technology Niihama College, Niihamashi, 792, 0022, Japan); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Faculty of Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia)","Edla, Mahesh (Southern Cross University)","Edla, Mahesh (Southern Cross University); Lim, Yee Yan (Southern Cross University); Mikio, Deguchi (National Institute of Technology, Niihama College); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University)",19,13,,6.42,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140323427,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

However, as the first step for an adequate intervention on any of these variables, it is the evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate two brief measures on job satisfaction and leadership behavior.   Design/methodology/approach The sample was made up of 246 workers located in Bogota, Colombia. The study was an instrumental research. To collect validity evidence, the internal structure and the relationship with other variables were used. For the evaluation of equity, the differential item functioning was analyzed according to the sex of the participants. Reliability was estimated through the ordinal omega coefficient.   Findings Both brief measures presented a unifactorial structure, where job satisfaction was measured by five items and leadership behavior by four items. On the other hand, only one item of leadership behavior showed differential item functioning; however, its magnitude was trivial. Also, convergent and discriminant evidence was provided for both measures, and the reliability levels were adequate.   Originality/value The measures developed represents an effort to briefly measure job satisfaction and leadership behavior. Likewise, it constitutes two of the few instruments to measure job satisfaction and leadership behavior in Latin American, representing a good alternative for the measurement of the referred constructs in an organizational context.",,,International Journal of Organizational Analysis,,,,2021-08-19,2021,2021-08-19,2023-04-10,31,3,823-836,Closed,Article,"Acosta-Prado, Julio César; Tafur-Mendoza, Arnold Alejandro; Zárate-Torres, Rodrigo Arturo; Pautt-Torres, Geli Mercedes","Acosta-Prado, Julio César (School of Business Sciences, Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru and School of Management, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia); Tafur-Mendoza, Arnold Alejandro (Research Center (CIUP), Universidad del Pacífico, Lima, Peru); Zárate-Torres, Rodrigo Arturo (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administración, Bogota, Colombia); Pautt-Torres, Geli Mercedes (School of Management, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia)","Acosta-Prado, Julio César (University of the Pacific; Universidad Externado de Colombia)","Acosta-Prado, Julio César (University of the Pacific; Universidad Externado de Colombia); Tafur-Mendoza, Arnold Alejandro (University of the Pacific); Zárate-Torres, Rodrigo Arturo (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administración); Pautt-Torres, Geli Mercedes (Universidad Externado de Colombia)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140501816,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Results from genetic analyses indicated spdya conditional knockout mice are sterile, suggesting that this protein has essential functions in mammalian reproduction. There, however, are no published reports on the localization of spdya mRNA in the germline or in somatic cell lineages within the gonads from mollusks or other invertebrate species. Using a previously obtained transcriptome assembly from the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, an economically important hermaphroditic scallop species from Chile and Peru, there was identification of a complete coding sequence of the spdya mRNA. Phylogenetically spdya protein has sequence conservation homology with other scallops and mollusks. The relative mRNA transcript abundances at different gametogenic stages was assessed using quantitative PCR procedures. Results indicated there was an increase of spdya mRNA transcript abundance in testicular region samples at the late active stage, followed by a decrease in testis of reproductively mature individuals. To gain insight into the cellular localization of ap-spdya transcript within the gonads, specific RNA probes were synthesized for in situ hybridization analyses of gonad histological sections. Results indicated spdya mRNA is located exclusively in early germline (previtellogenic oocytes and spermatogonia) and somatic proliferative tissues of A. purpuratus ovarian and testicular regions. Overall, these results indicate there are putative functions of spdya in the early oogenesis and spermatogenesis of A. purpuratus and will contribute to furthering the understanding of gametogenesis in this species.","We are grateful to the Laboratorio Central de Cultivos from UCN for scallop procurement, and Sebastián Báez for the sampling.

This study aimed to develop a reliable model to evaluate the water quality, based on the sulphate concentration, in the Reocín Mine area (Spain) by using geostatistical algorithms. To this end, water samples were taken from the beginning of the flooding period in November 2004 until August 2020. The model showed that the sulphate concentration was highest between February 2009 and February 2012 and decreased as the flooding process progressed. The area with the highest concentration (2000 mg L−1) was the central part of the study area, where the mine is located, while in the northeast and southwest, the values from the beginning of the flooding period were lower, below 500 mg L−1. In the last obtained model, the values decreased considerably to 1300 mg L−1 in the central area and below 250 mg L−1 in the northeast and southwest areas. The modelling conducted to assess the water quality in the area of influence of the mine determined that the flooding process has little influence on the water in the rivers and streams in the area, since the sulphate concentration measured in the adjacent rivers and streams was less than 250 mg L−1, indicating that anomalous concentrations were only found in the open-pit area.

This research aimed to evaluate the influence of the introduction of solar heat and aeration to the waste grass exposed to the composting process. The compost piles studied were subjected to different processes: application of solar-heated aeration, only-aeration, solar heating with a greenhouse, and control. Solar-heated air was introduced to a compost pile of grass clippings and compared with a greenhouse compost system. The composting process of 70 days was monitored for temperature, oxygen, moisture, organic matter loss, and humification rate. Germination index has been used to evaluate the maturation of the composts produced. The highest temperature was obtained at the compost pile with the greenhouse. This system reached the highest temperature (68.2 °C) on day 15; the ambient temperature on that day was 20.6 °C. The decreases in the C/N ratios after day 70 of composting were 20% and 15% for the greenhouse and the system where solar-heated air was introduced, respectively. Although the temperature of the solar-heated air was higher than that of the greenhouse, thermophilic temperature levels could not be reached in the aerated compost pile, which indicated a cooling effect of excessive aeration even with the heated air. Composting of grass clippings resulted in a decrease in organic matter content and enhancement in seed germination and root growth, obtaining high GI levels, inferring no phytotoxicity. This study showed that composting of grass clippings with low C/N ratios and high humidity can still be possible by using solar energy.Graphical abstract",The authors would like to thank the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for providing invaluable equipment support.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Composting; Hot Temperature; Oxygen; Poaceae; Soil; Temperature,2021-01-26,2021,2021-01-26,2021-06,28,21,26807-26818,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Salihoglu, Guray; Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Coquimbo, Chile); Salihoglu, Guray (Environmental Engineering Department, Engineering Faculty, Bursa Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey); Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil (Environmental Engineering Department, Engineering Faculty, Bursa Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Salihoglu, Guray (Bursa Uludağ University); Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil (Bursa Uludağ University)",3,1,,0.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134892671,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences,13 Climate Action

This raises questions about how such productivity was achieved and sustained, and its social implications. Using isotopic data of well-preserved ancient plant remains from Atacama sites, we show a dramatic increase in crop nitrogen isotope values (δ15N) from around ad 1000. Maize was most affected, with δ15N values as high as +30‰, and human bone collagen following a similar trend; moreover, their carbon isotope values (δ13C) indicate a considerable increase in the consumption of maize at the same time. We attribute the shift to extremely high δ15N values—the highest in the world for archaeological plants—to the use of seabird guano to fertilize crops. Guano—‘white gold’ as it came to be called—thus sustained agricultural intensification, supporting a substantial population in an otherwise extreme environment.","We thank the National Geographic Society for Early Career grant nos.

                    This paper aims to identify psychosocial, demographic and health risk factors associated with depression in older people.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    A correlational study with 281 independent and autonomous persons of the community over 60 years old from Bogotá was conducted. The three instruments used to measure the variables included in the data analyses were Demographic and Health Data Questionnaire, Short version of 15 items of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA).
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Fifteen percent of the participants presented depression. Depression was associated with different demographic, low social support and health factors in this population group and was particularly high in women. Being a woman with poor social support networks and a previous history of depressive episodes should be considered as determining factors within a clinical risk profile for depression in older adulthood. It is essential to design prevention strategies focused on women and on the development of better social support in old age.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    Depression is a prevalent and highly disabling disease, when it is suffered by an older person it is associated with higher mortality, functional dependence, poor physical health, worse quality of life indicators and psychological well-being. In the elderly, the clinical diagnosis of depression is difficult, as it has a high comorbidity and is often confused with other health conditions prevalent during older adulthood.",,,Working with Older People,,,,2021-12-17,2021,2021-12-17,2022-04-28,26,2,109-119,Closed,Article,"Salazar, Ana María; Reyes, María Fernanda; Gómez, María Paula; Pedraza, Olga; Lozano, Angela Gisselle; Montalvo, María Camila; Fandiño, Juan Camilo Rodriguez","Salazar, Ana María (Faculty of Psychology Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, Colombia); Reyes, María Fernanda (Faculty of Psychology Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, Colombia); Gómez, María Paula (Faculty of Psychology Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, Colombia); Pedraza, Olga (Neuroscience Group, Interdisciplinary Memory Group, Hospital Infantil Universitario de San José (HIUSJ), Bogotá, Colombia, and the, Faculty of Medicine, Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud, Bogota, Colombia); Lozano, Angela Gisselle (Neuroscience Group, Interdisciplinary Memory Group, Bogotá, Colombia); Montalvo, María Camila (Faculty of Medicine, Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud, Bogota, Colombia, and Neuroscience Group, Interdisciplinary Memory Group, Hospital Infantil Universitario de San José (HIUSJ), Bogotá, Colombia); Fandiño, Juan Camilo Rodriguez (Faculty of Psychology, Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, Colombia)","Fandiño, Juan Camilo Rodriguez (El Bosque University)","Salazar, Ana María (El Bosque University); Reyes, María Fernanda (El Bosque University); Gómez, María Paula (El Bosque University); Pedraza, Olga (Hospital Universitario Infantil San José; Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud); Lozano, Angela Gisselle (Neuroscience Group, Interdisciplinary Memory Group, Bogotá, Colombia); Montalvo, María Camila (Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud; Hospital Universitario Infantil San José); Fandiño, Juan Camilo Rodriguez (El Bosque University)",2,2,,0.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143902259,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

At the same time of paying more attention to the quality of human life, it is also necessary to take into account the network security issues related to the power Internet of things. Therefore, this paper aims to study the full‐scene network security protection system based on ubiquitous power Internet of things, which is an important topic at present. This research investigates the effectiveness of the Internet of Things in the network security protection system in general scenarios by investigating the traditional network security risk index and analyzing the excellent performance of the Internet of Things, aiming at the security risks of traditional network servers. In actual application scenarios, the Internet of Things can protect the entire network system in an all‐round way anytime and anywhere. This powerful defense performance is unmatched by traditional networks. Big data intelligent monitoring system is used to monitor the actual operation of all‐weather and all‐scene network protection system. Experimental data show that in the ubiquitous power Internet of things environment, although there are still some risks in the operation of grid companies and other intelligent terminals, the number of security risks is significantly lower than that of the traditional Internet of things. The significance of “ubiquitous” power Internet of things is the all‐scene network security protection system that works all day and all the time. Integrated servers can better protect against security risks than single servers. Experimental data shows that the full‐scenario network security protection system in the Internet of Things effectively integrates the facility resources in the power system and the communication system, and it improves the company’s perception of the entire actual scene during the operation. At the same time, it also promotes the integration of corporate information and provides intelligent support for corporate decision‐making.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by The Doctoral Research Fund of Northeast Electric Power University started the project (BSJXM‐2019106).

In particular, in regions or countries with high biodiversity, strong dependence on natural resources, high informality, and low productive specialization. We employ a set of quantitative techniques within the theoretical framework of convergence and found the existence of per capita ecological footprint clubs. In addition, we estimate a set of logistic regressions to obtain the average marginal effect of the determinants of the convergence clubs. We found that economic complexity, the shadow economy, and natural resources significantly influence the formation of convergence clubs. The results indicate the existence of convergence in three clubs, while two clubs are divergent. Environmental policymakers in this region should collectively mitigate environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development goals, particularly among the countries that make up the convergence clubs.","The authors express their gratitude with the Club de Investigación de Economía.

To date, research on this topic remains scarce in Chile. We conducted a survey study describing sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex assigned at birth, onset age, nationality, education, sex work, having a partner, having children, sexual orientation, religiousness, gender identification, and gender affirmation pathways). A snowball sample of 377 self-identified transgender adults living in Chile (Mage = 31.88, rangeage = 18–67) was collected for the purpose of this study. According to their sex assigned at birth, 139 participants were female and 238 male. Results revealed that sex assigned at birth was significantly associated with almost all the sociodemographic variables. Eight gender self-identification categories were obtained based on self-declaration. These gender identification categories varied according to sex assigned at birth. Finally, four patterns (clusters) of gender affirmative actions were identified among participants. These patterns indicated that the longer the gender affirmation pathway time, the greater the invasiveness level of the medical procedures used. Sex assigned at birth moderated the association between gender affirmation pathways and gender identity categories. Results were discussed highlighting the heterogeneity found in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, gender identification, and gender affirmation pathways.","The authors would like to thank OrganizandoTrans Diversidades (OTD) for its contributions to this study.

In Galicia (Spain) alone, the canning industry produces over 150,000 metric tons of seashell waste per year. Most of this waste is still disposed of in landfills or open fields due to the lack of a technically feasible, environmentally sustainable, and economically profitable recycling alternative. This paper aims to study the feasibility of a new recycling alternative for seashell waste from industrial canning, based on the production of fireproof material suitable for construction use. The waste was pre-treated in order to remove salts and remaining organic matter and reduce particle size. According to international standards, physical, mechanical, and insulating properties were assessed for four compositions: 0, 40, 60 and 80% of gypsum substituted with pre-treated seashell waste. Results showed that substitution of up 60% gypsum was technically feasible. A Life-Cycle Assessment and a preliminary production cost analysis were performed by analysing a recycling case in Galicia. The case study found that 40-60% gypsum substitution obtained an environmental impact reduction of 0.4%-59% for 13 of the 18 impact categories considered compared with 0% substitution. Increases in the other 5 categories were analysed due to aquatic emissions released in the waste pre-treatment washing process. The locations of the fireproof material production facility and the waste source were a key factor. Production costs could be reduced by 20-31% by using 40-60% gypsum substituted with seashell wastes.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This work was supported by the Innovation Funds for competitiveness from the Regional Government of Coquimbo (Chile) [grant number BIP 40014353-0].,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Animal Shells; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Industrial Waste; Recycling; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Management,2021-05-29,2021,2021-05-29,2021-10,790,,148102,Closed,Article,"Peceño, B.; Alonso-Fariñas, B.; Vilches, L.F.; Leiva, C.","Peceño, B.

901,pub.1138764833,10.1016/j.dci.2021.104163,34118278,,New insight to the rol of α-enolase (Eno-1) as immunological marker in rainbow trout fry,"α-Enolase is an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway that has also been involved in vertebrate inflammatory processes through its interaction with plasminogen. However, its participation in the immune response of lower vertebrates during early life development is unknown. Opportunistic pathogens in salmon farming are the principal cause of mortality in the fry stage. For that reason, molecular indicators of their immunological status are required to ensure the success of the large-scale cultivation. Thus, the objective of this work was to analyze if ENO-1 is involved in the immune response of rainbow trout fry. For this purpose, the coding sequence of trout ENO-1 was characterized, identifying the plasminogen-binding domain that has been described for homologs of this enzyme in higher vertebrates. A peptide-epitope of α-enolase was used for producing mice antiserum. The specificity of polyclonal antibodies was confirmed by dot blot, ELISA and Western blot. Then, the antiserum was used to evaluate α-enolase expression in fry between 152 and 264 degree-days post-hatching after 2, 8, and 12 h of challenge with lipopolysaccharide from Pseudomona auroginosa. The expression of α-enolase at both transcriptional (RT-qPCR) and protein (ELISA) levels was significantly increased after 8 h post-challenge with lipopolysaccharide. These results were confirmed by proteomic analysis by 2D-difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). This work provides the first evidence of the involvement of α-enolase in the early immune response of salmonids. Future research will be required to understand the possible interaction of α-enolase with plasminogen in cells and tissues of the salmonid immune system.","This work was funded by grants from ANID-CHILE: MECESUP FSM0710, doctoral thesis grant 24110237, FONDECYT 11170244, and REDBIO0009 to P.A.A.; FONDECYT 1191763 to L.M.; and REDES 180203 to F.G.",,Developmental & Comparative Immunology,,,"Animals; Biomarkers; Fish Diseases; Fish Proteins; Immunity, Innate; Lipopolysaccharides; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Phosphopyruvate Hydratase; Plasminogen; Proteomics",2021-06-10,2021,2021-06-10,2021-10,123,,104163,Closed,Article,"Santana, Paula A; Álvarez, Claudio A; Sáenz-Martínez, Daniel E; Salinas-Parra, Nicolás; Guzmán, Fanny; Paradela, Alberto; Mercado, Luis","Santana, Paula A (Facultad de Ingeniería, Instituto de Ciencias Químicas Aplicadas, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, el Llano Subercaseaux 2801, San Miguel, Santiago, Chile.

Epigenetic mechanisms in plants to cold tolerance,"Main conclusionThe epigenetic could be an important, but seldom assessed, mechanisms in plants inhabiting cold ecosystems. Thus, this review could help to fill a gap in the current literature.AbstractLow temperatures are one of the most critical environmental conditions that negatively affect the growth, development, and geographic distribution of plants. Exposure to low temperatures results in a suit of physiological, biochemical and molecular modifications through the reprogramming of the expression of genes and transcription factors. Scientific evidence shows that the average annual temperature has increased in recent years worldwide, with cold ecosystems (polar and high mountain) being among the most sensitive to these changes. However, scientific evidence also indicates that there would be specific events of low temperatures, due it is highly relevant to know the capacity for adaptation, regulation and epigenetic memory in the face of these events, by plants. Epigenetic regulation has been described to play an important role in the face of environmental stimuli, especially in response to abiotic stress. Several studies on epigenetic mechanisms have focused on responses to stress as drought and/or salinity; however, there is a gap in the current literature considering those related to low temperatures. In this review, we focus on systematizing the information published to date, related to the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA-dependent silencing mechanisms, in the face of plant´s stress due to low temperatures. Finally, we present a schematic model about the potential responses by plants taking in count their epigenetic memory; considering a global warming scenario and with the presence or absence of extreme specific events of low temperatures.","Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH), supports program for postgraduate thesis in antarctic issues; proyect code DT_18_19.

This study evaluated the mediational role of connectedness with the gay men's and lesbian women's community on the relationship between two minority stressors (internalized homophobia and perceived sexual stigma) with anxiety-depressive symptomatology and life satisfaction. The sample consisted of 467 Chilean self-identified as gay men (57%) and lesbian women (43%). Results revealed that the two minority stressors were associated with anxiety-depressive symptomatology, but only internalized homophobia was associated with life satisfaction. The mediation hypothesis was partially supported by the relationship between internalized homophobia and life satisfaction. Unexpectedly, we found a negative association between connectedness with the gay men's and lesbian women's community and life satisfaction. This finding introduces a view that contrasts with the literature, which proposes that connectedness with the specific community would be a protective factor against sexual stigma.","Fabiola Gómez acknowledges support from Technology project CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2015-folio #21150018.

However, the physiological mechanisms involved in carbon drainage through its roots, as well as the gene expression involved in the biosynthesis of carboxylates and P uptake, have not been explored. In this work, we evaluated the relationship between carboxylate exudation rate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity in roots of E. coccineum seedlings grown in a nutrient-poor volcanic substrate. Second, we evaluated CR formation and the expression of genes involved in the production of carboxylates (PEPC) and P uptake (PHT1) in E. coccineum seedlings grown under three different P supplies in hydroponic conditions. Our results showed that the carboxylate exudation rate was higher in CR than in non-CR, which was consistent with the higher PEPC activity in CR. We found higher CR formation in seedlings grown at 5 μM of P supply, concomitant with a higher expression of EcPEPC and EcPHT1 in CR than in non-CR. Overall, mature CR of E. coccineum seedlings growing on volcanic substrates poor in nutrients modify their metabolism compared to non-CR, enhancing carboxylate biosynthesis and subsequent carboxylate exudation. Additionally, transcriptional responses of EcPEPC and EcPHT1 were induced simultaneously when E. coccineum seedlings were grown in P-limited conditions that favored CR formation. Our results showed, for the first time, changes at the molecular level in CR of a species of the Proteaceae family, demonstrating that these root structures are highly specialized in P mobilization and uptake.","Financial support was provided by ANID/FONDECYT/Postdoctoral Project number 3150187 (MD) and number 3160551 (ABB), and by the ANID/FONDECYT/Initiation project number 11170368 (MD).

The centre of a species' distribution might represent an optimum for the environmental factors influencing the species absolute fitness and, therefore, genetic diversity. In species with wide distribution, the geographical variation of biotic and abiotic variables is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of the CPH. We evaluated the CPH and specifically tested which environmental variables better explained the patterns of genetic diversity in the kissing bug Mepraia spinolai, one of the main wild vectors of Chagas disease in southern South America, distributed across three Mediterranean climatic ecoregions in Chile. We analysed 2380 neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate genetic diversity. Mean winter temperature, mean summer temperature, vegetation cover, population abundance, proportion of winged individuals and female abdomen area were measured for each kissing bug population to construct a model. Lower genetic diversity was detected in populations at the edge of the distribution compared to those in the centre. However, genetic differentiation was not higher in the periphery. Genetic diversity was related to climatic and biological variables; there was a positive relationship with mean winter temperature and a negative association with mean summer temperature and body size. These results partially support the CPH and identify biotic (abdomen area) and abiotic (winter/summer temperatures) factors that would affect genetic diversity in this restricted-dispersal species of epidemiological relevance.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We especially thank R.

The participants answered an adapted version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire to assess different violence forms. However, for the present study, only five items related to PV were considered. The results showed that a lifetime and the last 12 months' prevalence of PVwerevery high.

From monitoring social events to responding to criminal actions, officers’ abilities to cope to stress are in challenged constantly. Stressful events continuously impact officers’ physical and emotional well-being in detriment of acquiring healthy behaviors or of caring for their physical or mental hygiene. When police activities are neglected or receive negative social perceptions as it occurs in Mexico, it results imperative to explore strategies to overcome the development of illness intrinsically associated to the execution of work activities. This study contributes to the police well-being literature by assessing the appropriateness of using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) in Mexico. Working on data collected from police officers from northern Mexico, psychometric and statistical analysis were conducted to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of using the MBI on these professionals and (2) levels of burnout and their associations to gender and age. Results support considering the MBI as a valid and reliable tool to evaluate burnout symptoms in Mexican officers. Gender and age did not associate significantly to burnout symptomatology.

In the neotropical snake genus Philodryas, the systematics of these rear-fanged snakes has been controversial and debated in recent years. Here, we combine published datasets with new morphological (scale microdermatoglyphics, osteology, pholidosis and genital features) and molecular (mitochondrial and nuclear) data to reassess the phylogenetic positioning of rear-fanged snakes within the tribe Philodryadini. We identified putative synapomorphies and pronounced morphological variation in hemipenial features. Our results suggested a need to reclassify many species in order to clarify some relationships within the Philodryas radiation. We also redefined Philodryadini by resurrecting three genera and naming a newly discovered species.","We are thankful to Alexander Kupfer and two anonymous reviewers for providing suggestions that greatly improved the manuscript.

The experiments are common-pool resource (CPR)-games where participants undertake harvesting decisions under a baseline scenario and two subsequent treatments (communication and self-regulation). The data are analysed using different statistical models. We find that fishers under TURF tend to coordinate their efforts when no treatments are introduced into the experiment. However, once treatments are introduced, we observe that self-regulation outperforms communication in reducing harvest levels. This situation can be viewed as a consequence of the internal struggles between TURF fishers, highlighting the need for regulation. We conclude that a TURF designation on its own is not sufficient to shape the preferences of the users of a CPR and needs to be accompanied by regulation to encourage coordination among players.","One part of this research was conducted within the project Biodiversity conservation of Utria National Park through the sustainable management of buffer zones , executed by Mar Viva in cooperation with Word Wildlife Fund (WWF Colombia), Natural Heritage Fund (for Biodiversity and Protected Areas) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Therefore, these infrastructures have become a priority issue. This article identifies international trends in tailings research using Scopus database, from where 4415 published articles in the last decade were reported. Subsequently, a bibliometric analysis was performed by absolute counts using Bibliometrix R package and Vosyviewer software. We propose dividing the results into three levels: i) descriptive analysis of the publication, ii) scientific relevance, and iii) analytic co-ocurrence. As a result, there is a steady increase in the number of articles published, especially for the period 2015–2020, which can be explained by the ingrowth of work in areas such as Environmental Sciences and Engineering. The most cited articles were published during the years 2010–2015, and the most cited journals are Chemosphere, Science of The Total Environment and Journal of Hazardous Materials. In terms of co-ocurrence we identify the critical position of concepts associated with mining activity and its chemical processes, environmental monitoring, concerns about pollution, and bioremediation. Our work highlights the importance of research produced in countries such as China and Canada while exposing the low productivity in extractive countries in the global south (Chile, Peru, or Indonesia). At the same time, we emphasize the need to diversify research into the governance about mining tailings and their technological remediation.","This article was developed within the framework of the Fondecyt Project Nº11160601 “Ecological Modernization: The Chilean Case” and was supported by the Institutional Excellence Stimulation Program (PEEI) of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Chile through its Contest for Productivity Strenthening and Research Continuity (FPCI) 2019-I”.

Design/methodology/approach The study started from the elaboration of a diagnosis on learning styles in a student community at the undergraduate level in the area of biomedical and health sciences of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí (Mexico) (UASLP), through the application of the Honey-Alonso Learning Styles questionnaire (CHAEA), and by using such results it was possible to derive learning strategies for the achievement of digital information competencies that were effective in practice.   Findings According to the diagnostic results, the learning styles with the greatest presence in students in the area of Biomedical and Health Sciences were identified and from this, precise didactic strategies were derived to enhance information skills in the use of digital sources. For this case, the Big6 Model was used and its implementation was combined (face-to-face and virtual) in the academic community studied, integrating an information skills development program in the digital library of the Center for Information in Biomedical Sciences (CICBI) from the university itself.   Originality/value A practical experience is presented, which also offered concrete solutions, based on particular characteristics of the users. There is a low presence of studies of digital libraries’ users that consider aspects related to learning styles, especially applied from the perspective of information sciences and the digital library.",,,Digital Library Perspectives,,,,2021-02-08,2021,2021-02-08,2021-05-21,37,2,151-167,Closed,Article,"Méndez-Govea, Silvia; Mireles-Cárdenas, Celia; Tarango, Javier","Méndez-Govea, Silvia (Center for Information in Biomedical Sciences (CICBI), Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi, Mexico); Mireles-Cárdenas, Celia (School of Information Science, Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi, Mexico); Tarango, Javier (School of Philosophy and Letters, Autonomous University of Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico)","Tarango, Javier (Autonomous University of Chihuahua)","Méndez-Govea, Silvia (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí); Mireles-Cárdenas, Celia (Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí); Tarango, Javier (Autonomous University of Chihuahua)",3,2,,3.15,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135539482,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

In this context, post-divorce travel has been promoted as a positive strategy for alleviating this stress; in fact, some hotels offer special services and promotions for divorcees. In this study, using time series data from 1996Q1 to 2019Q4, a structural VAR model is used to document the effect of registered divorces on the number of tourist departures from Mexico. The results indicate that the number of registered divorces positively stimulates the growth in outbound tourism.

For the past six years, the Civic Imagination Project has been conducting world-building workshops with groups across America and around the world. Our workshops encourage participants to imagine together what the future might look like under the premise that before we can change the world, we have to be able to collectively imagine what a better world looks like. For this paper, our team draws tools from speculative fiction to create a process where communities come together and propose what an alternative world might look like. While it is still too early for any preliminary analysis, we anticipate being able to map responses from many different parts of the world, and in particular, across different regions in the United States.

Construct Validity of Two Brief Pictorial Scales With IRT and CFA Models,"The study's objective was to develop and validate the psychometric properties of two brief pictorial scales to evaluate the roles of bystanders and victims of bullying. A sample of 910 students was considered (49.6%, boys; 50.4%, girls) between the ages of 7 and 13 (M = 10, SD = 1.4). Both instruments present nine pictorial items representing two dimensions: physical bullying (items 1 to 4) and psychological bullying (items 5 to 9). An additional measure of anxiety was used to assess convergent validity. The Confirmatory Factorial Analysis shows that the two-dimensional oblique model, physical bullying and psychological bullying, presents a better fit to the bystander scale data (RMSEA = .040; CFI = .984; SRMR = .033) and in the victim scale (RMSEA = .051; CFI = .978; SRMR = .040) in comparison to other competitor models. From the perspective of the Item Response Theory (IRT), it was found that the items adequately discriminate the levels of the latent variable; therefore, items 1 (physical bullying) and 7 (psychological bullying) are the most accurate on the bystander scale, and items 3 (physical bullying) and 7 (psychological bullying), on the victim scale. It was also found that the degree of difficulty on both scales is lower for the psychological bullying dimension than for the physical bullying dimension. Both instruments demonstrated good psychometric properties; therefore, they can detect school bullying in classrooms.",,"FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Challenges Assistance Program Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities, Spain [RTI2018-093321-B-100] and Program of Grants for Special Actions of the Research of the University of Valencia, Spain [AE18-777619].",Psychological Reports,,,Adolescent; Anxiety; Bullying; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires,2021-08-02,2021,2021-08-02,2022-12,125,6,3238-3262,Closed,Article,"Vilca, Lindsey W.; Herrera, Rocio E.; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Tomás, José M.; Herrera-López, Mauricio","Vilca, Lindsey W.

In addition, considering other long-term neuroprotective mechanisms of these drugs, we hypothesized that this combination might exert some synergistic effects on neuropathic pain linked with its possible ability to prevent Wallerian degeneration (WD). The effects of individual and fixed-ratio of 1:1 combinations of orally administered amitriptyline and paracetamol were assayed in the two phases of the formalin test and in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model in rats. Isobolographic analysis was employed to characterize the synergism produced by the combinations. Amitriptyline, paracetamol, and fixed-ratio amitriptyline-paracetamol combinations produced dose-dependent antinociceptive effects mainly on the inflammatory tonic phase. Repeated doses of individual drugs and their combination decreased CCI-induced mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. ED30 (formalin) and ED50 (CCI) values were estimated for the individual drugs, and isobolograms were constructed. Theoretical ED30/50 values for the combination estimated from the isobolograms were 16.5 ± 3.9 mg/kg and 26.0 ± 7.2 mg/kg for the single and repeated doses in persistent and neuropathic pain models, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the actually observed ED30/50 values, which were 0.39 ± 0.1 mg/kg and 8.2 ± 0.8 mg/kg in each model, respectively, indicating a synergistic interaction. Remarkably, CCI-induced sciatic nerve WD-related histopathological changes were prevented by this combination compared to either drug administered alone.",Special thanks to Jorge Conde Garrido for advice on the correct use of the English language.

However, litter studies have primarily focused on marine environments, and the litter dynamics in rivers are still poorly understood. Herein, we explored the abundances, composition and sources of litter at the riversides and in surface waters of mountain rivers from continental Chile in two different years. Additionally, we evaluated whether different temporal, geographic, topographic, hydrologic or anthropogenic factors influence the abundances of litter. Anthropogenic litter was prevalent in Chilean rivers, both at the riversides and in surface waters. Average abundances of riverside litter, floating macrolitter, and small floating plastics were 1.8 items m-2, 10.1 items h-1 and 5.8 items h-1, respectively, and abundances were generally higher in northern Chile. Plastics dominated in all compartments, comprising 29% of riverside litter and more than 70% of small floating litter, but other litter categories were also present at riversides. Sources of litter in Chilean rivers were mostly local, such as recreational visitors, residents, and illegal dumping, and there were no clear effects of the different tested factors on the abundances of litter. Litter densities in surface waters were low compared to those in lowland slow-flowing rivers in other countries, suggesting that retention of litter is limited in the highly dynamic and rapidly flushing mountain rivers, and thus most litter (primarily plastics) is transported directly to the sea. The results suggest that to adequately address this problem in Chile, prevention measures should be aimed at the identified local sources, by means of education, public policies, legislation, and enforcement.","We are grateful to the EXPLORA-CONICYT program of Chile and the Lighthouse Foundation in Germany for funding the 2013 and 2017 samplings, respectively.

A Multilevel Test of the Ideological Motivators of Perceived Discrimination,"Although system-justifying beliefs often mitigate perceptions of discrimination, status-based asymmetries in the ideological motivators of perceived discrimination are unknown. Because the content and societal implications of discrimination claims are status-dependant, social dominance orientation (SDO) should motivate perceptions of (reverse) discrimination among members of high-status groups, whereas system justification should motivate the minimization of perceived discrimination among the disadvantaged. We tested these hypotheses using multilevel regressions among a nationwide random sample of New Zealand Europeans (n = 29,169) and ethnic minorities (n = 5,118). As hypothesized, group-based dominance correlated positively with perceived (reverse) discrimination among ethnic-majority group members, whereas system justification correlated negatively with perceived discrimination among the disadvantaged. Furthermore, the proportion of minorities within the region strengthened the victimizing effects of SDO-Dominance, but not SDO-Egalitarianism, among the advantaged. Together, these results reveal status-based asymmetries in the motives underlying perceptions of discrimination and identify a key contextual moderator of this association.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a PhD scholarship (#72170456) funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID; former CONCYT) awarded to the first author as well as a grant from the Templeton Religion Trust (#TRT0196) awarded to the second author.",Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,,,Ethnicity; Humans; Minority Groups; Perceived Discrimination; Social Dominance; Vulnerable Populations,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2022-07,48,7,1134-1148,Closed,Article,"Bahamondes, Joaquín; Sibley, Chris G.; Osborne, Danny","Bahamondes, Joaquín (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Sibley, Chris G.

Among all of the evaluated Ω-3 and Ω-6 fatty acids, DHA showed the highest antiproliferative potency and selectivity against the GC-derived cell line AGS. 10-100 μM DHA decreased AGS cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on non-tumoral GES-1 cells. To evaluate if the effects of DHA were due to apoptosis induction, cells were stained with Annexin V-PI, observing that 75 and 100 μM DHA increased apoptosis in AGS, but not in GES-1 cells. Additionally, levels of several proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulators were assessed by qPCR, western blot and activity assays, showing similar results. In order to evaluate DHA efficacy in vivo, xenografts in an immunodeficient mouse model (BALB/cNOD-SCID) were used. In these experiments, DHA treatment for six weeks consistently reduced subcutaneous tumor size, ascitic fluid volume and liver metastasis. In summary, we found that DHA has a selective antiproliferative effect on GC, being this effect driven by apoptosis induction. Our investigation provides promising features for DHA as potential therapeutic agent in GC.",We thank to Hervis Galleguillos for technical assistance and Dr. Arnaldo Gatica for helpful discussions.,,European Journal of Pharmacology,,,"Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Signal Transduction; Stomach Neoplasms; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Mice",2021-01-26,2021,2021-01-26,2021-04,896,,173910,Closed,Article,"Ortega, Lorena; Lobos-González, Lorena; Reyna-Jeldes, Mauricio; Cerda, Daniela; De la Fuente-Ortega, Erwin; Castro, Patricio; Bernal, Giuliano; Coddou, Claudio","Ortega, Lorena (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); Lobos-González, Lorena (Centro de Medicina Regenerativa, Facultad de Medicina-Clínica Alemana, Universidad Del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; Fundación Ciencia y Vida, Santiago, Chile.); Reyna-Jeldes, Mauricio (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Chile.); Cerda, Daniela (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); De la Fuente-Ortega, Erwin (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); Castro, Patricio (Laboratory of Physiology and Pharmacology for Neural Development, LAND, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Concepción, Chile.); Bernal, Giuliano (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); Coddou, Claudio (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain), Chile.

Upwelling areas offer opportunities to study the effects of hypoxia on benthic communities under natural conditions. We used a biological trait-based approach and estimated functional diversity indices to assess macrobenthic community functioning along a depth gradient associated with naturally increasing hypoxia and concentrations of organic matter in the upwelling zone of northern Chile (South-East Pacific) over two years. Our results highlighted the increasing dominance of opportunistic biological traits associated with hypoxia and high organic matter content. Habitat filtering was the main process affecting the studied communities. Functional diversity patterns were persistent overtime despite the occurrence of a pulse of oxygenation. This study contributes to our understanding of how natural hypoxia impacts macrobenthic communities, providing useful information in the context of increasing eutrophication due to human influence on coastal areas.","We thank Maritza Malebran, Diego Andrade and Evelyn Araya, who worked on many aspects of this project.

843,pub.1141794297,10.1109/tg.2021.3118273,,,An Adaptive System for Emerging Serious Games Using a Swarm Intelligence Algorithm,"An emerging serious game (SG) is a game designed and developed from an objective other than pure fun, so that the player can learn while playing, but where the game unfolds spontaneously, autonomously, and without explicit laws, adapting to the player. On the other hand, an emerging serious game engine (ESGE) must make explicit the possibility of emergence in an SG, from the coordinated handling of the game plot, adapted to the specific educational context where it is being used. In previous articles, an ESGE has been proposed, which allows the initial emergence of an SG. This article defines a new component of the ESGE, called the plot adaptive system (PAS), which allows the updating of an SG according to the theme that is being given in a smart classroom (SaCI). This component is based on an ant colony optimization algorithm that changes the plotsframes in the game to follow the desired theme in the SaCI. Thus, this new component manages a set of game plots that may be of interest in an educational context to dynamically modify an SG initially conceived for a subject taught in the SaCI, in order to adequate it to the current pedagogical context. The novelty of the approach is that it adapts the SG to the educational context where it takes place. Additionally, this article analyzes the behavior of the PAS in a case study, and presents three experiments with very encouraging results.",,,IEEE Transactions on Games,,,,2021-10-11,2021,2021-10-11,,14,4,598-609,Closed,Article,"Aguilar, Jose; Diaz, Francisco; Altamiranda, Junior; Garcia, Nelson Perez; Pinto, Angel Dario","Aguilar, Jose (CEMISID, Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;a, Universidad de Los Andes, M&#x00E9;rida, Venezuela); Diaz, Francisco (CEMISID, Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;a, Universidad de Los Andes, M&#x00E9;rida, Venezuela); Altamiranda, Junior (CEMISID, Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;a, Universidad de Los Andes, M&#x00E9;rida, Venezuela); Garcia, Nelson Perez (GITEL, Facultad de Ingenier&#x00ED;a, Universidad de Los Andes, M&#x00E9;rida, Venezuela); Pinto, Angel Dario (Escuela de Ingenier&#x00ED;a de Sistemas, Universidad del Sin&#x00FA;, Monter&#x00ED;a, Colombia)","Aguilar, Jose (University of the Andes)","Aguilar, Jose (University of the Andes); Diaz, Francisco (University of the Andes); Altamiranda, Junior (University of the Andes); Garcia, Nelson Perez (University of the Andes); Pinto, Angel Dario (Escuela de Ingenier&#x00ED;a de Sistemas, Universidad del Sin&#x00FA;, Monter&#x00ED;a, Colombia)",1,1,,0.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141794297,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

It is a mining-ritual landscape in the highlands of northwestern Argentina (Ratones Basin, Puna of Salta), mainly related to the expansion of the Inca Empire in the region. This evidence is discussed in the general framework of archaeological information from various sites in other areas of the Andes as well as from ethnohistorical and ethnographic information. The results allow us to link the archaeological evidence of the Ratones Basin with important aspects of an Andean worldview, such as the wakas mines, production rituals, the worship of ancestors and the sacralization of landscape elements. In turn, the analyzed record indicates the importance that rituals had as a form of symbolic domination by the Inca Empire for the control of mining activities. This case is an example of the symbolic/ideological domination developed by many empires.","To CONICET (National Scientific and Technical Research Council) and to our teammates (Sonia Araya, Juan Pablo Orsi, Silvina Seguí and Patricia Solá) for their valuable input.

Esta mina, tras ser explotada inicialmente durante el período Intermedio tardío, fue incorporada posteriormente al Tawantinsuyu, produciéndose una reorganización e intensificación de la producción minera. Las excavaciones realizadas en el campamento Inkawasi-Abra permitieron recuperar una amplia diversidad de restos vegetales provenientes de distintos ecosistemas y pisos ecológicos de la región, los cuales cumplieron roles primordiales al interior del espacio habitacional. Por una parte, sustentaron la subsistencia de los mitayos atacameños, incluyendo alimentación, combustible y materias primas, y por otra, formaron parte de contextos ceremoniales y de preparación de alimentos de carácter comunal relacionados al comensalismo político, las relaciones de reciprocidad y la ritualidad minera. Gran parte de las plantas analizadas provienen de las quebradas y oasis atacameños, incluyendo productos agrícolas, chañar ( Geoffroea decorticans ) y algarrobo ( Prosopis sp.), sumado a otras plantas silvestres y domesticadas provenientes de ambientes puneños, valles bajos y la costa pacífica. Lo anterior permite dibujar el mapa de relaciones y redes de abastecimiento de la mina durante el período incaico, así como aportar al conocimiento de los mineros que sustentaron la producción en San José del Abra. 
 This article presents the results of archaeobotanical research carried out in the San José del Abra mining district in northern Chile. This mine, after initially being exploited during the Late Intermediate period, was later incorporated into Tawantinsuyu, leading to a reorganization and intensification of mining production. The excavations carried out at the Inkawasi-Abra camp recovered a wide diversity of plant remains from different ecosystems and ecological zones of the region, which played essential roles within the living space. On the one hand, they provided the Atacameño mitayos with food, fuel, and raw materials. On the other hand, they were part of communal ceremonial and food preparation contexts related to political commensalism, reciprocal relationships, and mining rituals. Most of the analyzed plants come from the Atacameño streams and oases, including agricultural products, chañar ( Geoffroea decorticans ), and carob tree ( Prosopis sp.), as well as wild and cultivated plants from puneño environments, low valleys, and the Pacific coast. These results allow us to map relationships and supply networks for the mine during the Inca period, as well as contributing to our knowledge of the miners who carried out the production in San José del Abra.","La investigación se realizó en el marco del proyecto de profundización del conocimiento del Complejo Minero San José del Abra, financiado por SCM El Abra.

A case study examines the financial continuity of one such initiative in Sweden by exploring its cost structure, the relative importance of its revenue variables, and the variables that determine the economy of scale. The results show the potential of obtaining a viable business model and provide new insights into the economy of scale for city logistics. The paper presents a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the implementation of a six-month pilot programme for a city logistics initiative. The initiative combines the consolidation of transportation of goods for both private enterprises and municipalities, and shows that the relationship between goods volumes and profitability is not linear, but rather follows a logarithmic shaped curve.

Methods and results  A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, Scopus, Science Direct, and CINAHL Complete to identify studies assessing the association between polypharmacy and depression published until November 2020. A meta‐analysis was performed using random effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 ‐statistic. Nineteen studies were included in the meta‐analysis. We found that an increase in the number of drugs was associated with an increased risk of depression (OR = 1.55 [95% CI: 1.01, 2.36; I 2  = 62%, n = 2]). Further, polypharmacy defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications was associated with an increased risk of depression (OR = 1.73 [95% CI: 1.39, 2.14], I 2  = 83%, n = 8).

We evaluated the effects of OA as well as warming and cooling trend temperature on early reproductive traits of Lessonia trabeculata, a bio-engineer kelp species. Sori discs were maintained for an exposure time (ET) of 3 (T3) and 7 (T7) days to one of two contrasting pCO2 levels (450 and 1100 μatm). In addition, at each pCO2 level, they were subjected to three temperature treatments: 15 °C (control), 10 °C (cool) and 19 °C (warm). Subsequently, we compared sorus photosynthetic performance (Fv/Fm), the number of meiospores released (MR) and their germination rate (GR) after 48 h of settlement, with values obtained from sori discs not exposed (DNE) to the treatments. The Fv/Fm measured for DNE was lower than at T3 and T7 at 10 and 15 °C but not at 19 °C. Regardless of temperature, we found no significant differences between MR measured at T0 and T3. MR at T7 was significantly lower at 19 °C than at 10 and 15 °C. We found only a significant reduction in MR in response to elevated pCO2 at T3. The GR of meiospores released by DNE and then maintained for 48 h to 19 °C decreased significantly by ~33% when compared with those maintained for the same time at 10 and 15 °C. A similar, but more drastic reduction (~54%) in the GR was found in meiospores released by sori discs exposed for T3 and maintained for 48 h to 19 °C. We suggest that OA and warming trend will threaten the early establishment of this species with further consequences for the functioning of the associated ecosystem.","This study was supported by the following grants: “Climate driven Changes in the Habitat Suitability of Marine Organisms” (CLIMAR, ELAC2015/T01-0495), funded by the Network of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Countries on Joint Innovation and Research Activities; and FONDECYT No 1181609; both were awarded to PHM.

In co-culture experiments with different N concentration treatments, we evaluated kelp growth responses and changes in three specific molecular markers associated with the N cycle, both in epiphytic bacteria (relative abundance of nrfA-gene: cytochrome c nitrite reductase) and macroalgae (expression of NR-gene: nitrate reductase; GluSyn-gene: glutamate synthase). Both kelp populations responded differently to N limitation, with M. pyrifera-south sporophytes having a lower specific growth rate (SGR) under N-limiting conditions than the northern population; M. pyrifera-north sporophytes showed no significant differences in SGR when exposed to low-N and high-N concentrations. This corresponded to a higher GluSyn-gene expression in the M. pyrifera-north sporophytes and the co-occurrence of specific nrfA bacterial taxa. These bacteria may increase ammonium availability under low-N concentrations, allowing M. pyrifera-north to optimize nutrient assimilation by increasing the expression of GluSyn. We conclude that bacteria-kelp interactions are important in enhancing kelp growth rates under low N availability, although this effect may be regulated by the genetic background of kelp populations.","We thank those who participated in the development of this work, J.L.

Its assessment is important to identify older adults who experience greater loneliness and appropriate interventions can be carried out. The De Jong Gierveld Solitude Scale (DJGLS) is one of the most widely used, at least in the European context, to measure loneliness. Although the Spanish version of the DJGLS has shown reliability and validity in Spanish samples of older adults, there is no evidence of adequacy in the Latin American context. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the DJGLS in Peruvian older adults. Specifically, factorial validity, internal consistency and criterion-related validity were studied, based on a double analytical perspective: Classical Test Theory (SEM models) and Item Response Theory. The participants were 235 Peruvian older adults with ages ranging from 61 to 91 years old (Mean = 72.69, SD = 6.68) that assisted to Centers for the Elderly in the city of Trujillo, Peru. Together with the DJGLS, information from the three-item UCLA loneliness scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Brief Resilient Coping Scale and the Patient Health Questionnarie-2 was also gathered. The results support a one-dimensional structure of the DJGLS but with the presence of method effects associated to the negatively worded items. Additionally, the IRT multidimensional model applied also indicated the presence of a second dimension related to these negative items. Finally, other evidences of reliability and validity were adequate. In summary, the DJGLS may be considered a reliable and valid instrument to be used in the Peruvian (older adults) context.",,"This research was partially funded by Spanish Government, Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [grant number RTI2018-093321-B-I00].",The Journal of General Psychology,,,"Humans; Aged; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Peru; Loneliness; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Psychometrics",2021-04-30,2021,2021-04-30,2023-01-02,150,1,46-70,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Tomás, José M.; Hontangas, Pedro M.; Ventura-León, José; Burga-León, Andrés; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Peña-Calero, Brian Norman; White, Michael","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Universidad Privada del Norte); Tomás, José M.

Reptiles have successfully colonized desert environments, that is, extreme and arid conditions that constitute a strong selective pressure on organisms. Here, we studied genomic, physiological and morphological variations of the lizard Liolaemus fuscus to detect adaptations to the Atacama Desert. By comparing populations of L. fuscus inhabiting the Atacama Desert with populations from the Mediterranean forests from central Chile, we aimed at characterizing features related to desert adaptation. We combined ddRAD sequencing with physiological (evaporative water loss, metabolic rate and selected temperature) and morphological (linear and geometric morphometrics) measurements. We integrated the genomic and phenotypic data using redundancy analyses. Results showed strong genetic divergence, along with a high number of fixed loci between desert and forest populations. Analyses detected 110 fixed and 30 outlier loci located within genes, from which 43 were in coding regions, and 12 presented non-synonymous mutations. The candidate genes were associated with cellular membrane and development. Desert lizards presented lower evaporative water loss than those from the forest. Morphological data showed that desert lizards had smaller body size, different allometry, larger eyeballs and more dorsoventrally compressed heads. Our results suggest incipient speciation between desert and forest populations. The adaptive signal must be cautiously interpreted since genetic drift could also contribute to the divergence pattern. Nonetheless, we propose water and resource availability, and changes in habitat structure, as the most relevant challenges for desert reptiles. This study provides insights of the mechanisms that allow speciation as well as desert adaptation in reptiles at multiple levels, and highlights the benefit of integrating independent evidence.","Procedures with animals agreed ethical guidelines of the University of Chile (CICUA protocols 1734‐FCS‐UCH; 1946‐FCS‐UCH) and to the law regulations in Chile (SAG, Gobierno de Chile Res:6696/2017; Res:8078/2019).

Although beneficial microorganisms can improve host performance, their role in connecting environmentally induced maternal plant phenotypes to progeny (transgenerational effects [TGE]) is unknown. We evaluated fungal endophyte-mediated consequences of maternal plant exposure to ozone on performance of the progeny under contrasting scenarios of the same factor (high and low) at two stages: seedling and young plant. With no variation in biomass, maternal ozone-induced oxidative damage in the progeny that was lower in endophyte-symbiotic plants. This correlated with an endophyte-mediated higher concentration of proline, a defence compound associated with stress control. Interestingly, ozone-induced TGE was not associated with reductions in plant survival. On the contrary, there was an overall positive effect on seedling survival in the presence of endophytes. The positive effect of maternal ozone increasing young plant survival was irrespective of symbiosis and only expressed under high ozone condition. Our study shows that hereditary microorganisms can modulate the capacity of plants to transgenerationally adjust progeny phenotype to atmospheric change.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was financially supported by Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica—FONCyT grants PICT 2011‐1998 and PICT 2018‐1593.

773,pub.1138771230,10.1002/ajpa.24342,34115384,,Population history of Brazilian south and southeast shellmound builders inferred through dental morphology,"OBJECTIVE: The Southeast and South Coast of Brazil was inhabited during most of the Holocene by shellmound builders. Although there are cultural differences in the archaeological record between regions, it is still debatable how these differences may relate to different population histories. Here, we contribute to this discussion by exploring dental morphological affinities between several regional series.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental morphology of 385 individuals from 14 archaeological sites was analyzed using the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System. Fifteen traits were used to explore morphological affinities among series through Euclidean distance, Mean Measure of Divergence, and Principal Component Analysis. Mantel matrix correlation and partial correlation tests were used to examine the association between biological, geographic, and chronological distances.
RESULTS: Morphological affinities show that ceramic and nonceramic South Coast groups cluster and differ from most Southeast series. In contrast, Southeast coastal and riverine groups display high morphological variance, showing less biological coherence among them. These biological distances between regions are partially explained by geography, but not by chronology.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support that these coastal populations were low-mobility groups. Although interactions between individuals of different regions likely existed, gene flow occurred mostly among individuals from local or adjacent areas. The introduction of ceramic in the South Coast is not associated with changes in dental morphology patterns, suggesting its adoption is not exclusively associated with the arrival of different biological groups. Southeast coastal and riverine groups show high phenotypic diversity, suggesting a different history of human occupation and cultural development than observed in the South Coast.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study is funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, grants 2017/20637‐4 and 2019/18289‐3.

It blooms in thermally-stratified shelf waters in late summer in temperate to cold temperate latitudes. Despite its major contribution to shellfish harvesting bans, little effort has been devoted to study its population dynamics in Chilean Patagonia. In 2017-2018, mesoscale distribution of harmful algal species (75 monitoring stations) revealed the initiation (late spring) and seasonal growth of a dense D. acuta population in the Aysén region, with maximal values at Puyuhuapi Fjord (PF). Vertical phytoplankton distribution and fine-resolution measurements of physical parameters along a 25-km transect in February 16th identified a 15-km (horizontal extension) subsurface thin layer of D. acuta from 4 to 8 m depth. This layer, disrupted at the confluence of PF with the Magdalena Sound, peaked at the top of the pycnocline (6 m, 15.9 °C, 23.4 psu) where static stability was maximal. By February 22nd, it deepened (8 m, 15.5 °C; 23.62 psu) following the excursions of the pycnocline and reached the highest density ever recorded (664 × 103 cells L-1) for this species. Dinophysis acuta was the dominant Dinophysis species in all microplankton net-tows/bottle samples; they all contained DSP toxins (OA, DTX-1) and PTX-2. Modeled flushing rates showed that Puyuhuapi, the only fjord in the area with 2 connections with the open sea, had the highest water residence time. Long term climate variability in the Southern hemisphere showed the effects of a Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in positive mode (+1.1 hPa) overwhelming a moderate La Niña. These effects included positive spring precipitation anomalies with enhanced salinity gradients and summer drought with positive anomalies in air (+1 °C) and sea surface (+2 °C) temperature. Locally, persistent thermal stratification in PF seemed to provide an optimal physical habitat for initiation and bloom development of D. acuta.

These plants are pseudocereals that were very important for ancient civilizations. Their nutritional quality is higher than many cereals that make up the modern diet so they are gaining great prominence in the markets. Quinoa has high levels of protein, ascorbic acid and minerals, such as phosphorus and potassium. Amaranth is also a good source of protein and has high levels of lysine and sulphur amino acids. Encouraging the cultivation of these pseudocereals by small and medium-sized farmers represents an interesting strategy to promote food security in developing countries, since they adapt easily to different environmental conditions. This article presents a review of the literature on quinoa and amaranth, highlighting their morphological, agronomic, nutritional and socioeconomic aspects and their importance as functional foods, as well as their uses in animal and human nutrition.

To unravel the role of the Gondwanan heritage (late Paleozoic to Triassic) over the building of the Central Andes in northern Chile (Domeyko Range), we performed detrital U‐Pb zircon and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar muscovite geochronology along with structural analyses (kinematics and structural balancing). 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of detrital muscovite reveals contrasting cooling histories for the Paleozoic basement of Triassic rift sub‐basins, indicating that NW‐striking crustal structures segmented the Andean forearc since at least the middle Permian, likely related to an accretional fabric developed along SW Gondwana. These structures can be inferred based on scattered faults, gravimetric data, and basement age disruptions. During the Late Triassic, NS‐striking master faults and secondary NW‐ to NNW‐striking faults configured an oblique rift, primarily driven by subduction dynamics. We suggest that along SW Gondwana, the slab‐pull would have controlled the development of subduction‐related rift basins close to the trench whereas Triassic inland rifts were mainly driven by Pangea‐breakup stresses. Compressional tectonics began in the Late Cretaceous, yet the inversion of the Triassic rift would have started during the Eocene with the inception of the metallogenic‐fertile transpressional Domeyko fault system. Thus, the structural style of this range was determined by the architecture of the Triassic rift, where the inversion of deep‐seated faults accounted for west‐vergent thick‐ and thin‐skinned structures. Pre‐Andean NW‐striking structures also accommodated tectonic rotations during the Incaic orogeny (Eocene‐Oligocene) and may delimit the rupture zone of large earthquakes, suggesting an underestimated role of such ancient discontinuities in Andean neotectonics. 
Key Points    The synrift Domeyko Basin (Triassic) developed as an oblique rift driven by subduction and secondary far‐field Pangea‐breakup stresses   During rift inversion, the metallogenic‐fertile Domeyko fault system nucleated over the former Domeyko Basin master rift faults   Gondwanan NW‐striking structures controlled Paleozoic exhumation, synrift basin segmentation, and the main Domeyko Range structural style","This research was funded through the Fondecyt grant 1120715 (V.

The study focuses on last mile delivery activities, where numerous app-based delivery platforms have recently emerged. The paper provides an overview of the operational characteristics of these platforms based on an in-depth study of a sample of major crowdshipping services (state-of-practice) and a comprehensive review of the state-of-research. After comparing platform services and characteristics, we identified four core (typological) factors that differentiate services: platform (service) type, delivery type, delivery mode, and pricing strategy; and six categories for service challenges and opportunities. Moreover, the review of the state-of-research synthesized their findings with respect to the identified practical challenges to discover opportunities for future work. Overall, the study found that there is a mismatch between practical challenges and scientific solutions. The literature has not addressed all challenges identified in practice, such as couriers’ work conditions and pricing, which are still unresolved issues. The majority of articles were exploratory in nature with their findings based on hypothetical random instances. More research is needed with empirical case studies to evaluate the service net effects on each actor (e.g., senders, receivers, couriers, and platforms) in particular, and on the society in general, in terms of traffic externalities, quality of life, cost and revenue.

Additionally, it is also necessary to provide assistive care to visually impaired individuals who are prone to falls. Commonly used wearable sensors require on-body components, which may cause discomfort. More importantly, the forgetfulness of people in hospital or aged-care settings or their resistance in using the on-body units, undermine the effectiveness of a wearable-based monitoring strategy. The ideal monitoring system should not interfere with the individual’s privacy and daily routines and work continuously, without requiring any specific on-body devices. Here, we present a contactless sensing platform that can monitor and distinguish complex movements of human subjects, without requiring them to use wearable devices. The approach uses flexible Non-Contact Triboelectric Sensors (NCTS) (7 ×3.6 ×0.5 cm3) produced by attaching a negatively pre-charged PDMS film onto an aluminum (Al) foil. By exploiting the sensitivity to external electrostatic charges, near-field remote monitoring of human movements at distances as far as 1.5 m, is successfully achieved. Furthermore, The NCTS system differentiates activities such as walking, running, and jumping; and estimates walking speed, relative position, and direction of two people walking together in a contactless manner, which is not well examined in the literature of Non-contact Triboelectric Sensors, by analyzing the time domain and frequency spectrum of the output signal. Besides, the sensor is integrated with a portable accident prevention system designed to avoid visually impaired people’s collisions with obstacles. Falling detection tests provide promising results for their application in elderly safety. Finally, indoor navigation/position monitoring and direction recognition are achieved and demonstrated using multiple NCTS, for future potential applications in elder activity tracking and people counting in hospitals.","Vera, D. and Zhan K. equally contributed to the development of this work.

Such reliance introduces several practical limitations that hinder the pervasive deployment of existing solutions. To circumvent this prevalent reliance, we present MetaSense, a system that leverages antenna pattern diversity for fine-grained RF sensing. MetaSense incorporates the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) and the auxiliary-assisted ensemble multimask learning (AEMML) framework in its design. The DMA is a novel type of antenna that can provide a diverse set of uncorrelated radiation patterns in a low-cost and low-complexity manner. The AEMML is a quality-aware learning framework that can dynamically assess and aggregate the heterogeneous channel measurements from different antenna patterns to ensure high sensing accuracy. It also incorporates a transfer learning model that allows it to generalize to new sensing conditions with few training instances required. We prototype MetaSense and demonstrate its effectiveness on a writing motion recognition task using a custom-designed 2-D DMA. The results show that MetaSense achieves 92% to 98% accuracy in classifying ten miniature writing motions, outperforming a nontunable antenna by 20% in all scenarios. Moreover, when deployed in new sensing positions where limited training instances are available, MetaSense requires as few as five training instances per class to achieve over 90% accuracy.","The work of Wenjun Hu was supported in part by NSF under Grant CNS-1763212.

In the hyperarid Atacama Desert coast (Northern Chile), hunter‐gatherers‐fishers developed standardized stone‐built architecture during the Late Archaic period (∼5,700–4,000 cal years BP), interpreted so far as sedentary villages or long‐term campsites. Nevertheless, the lack of site formation process studies and systematic chronostratigraphies defy such functional interpretations. To address these issues, we reconstruct the lifecycle of a recently discovered semisubterranean structure at the Zapatero site (~25°S, Taltal). Combining stratigraphy, micromorphology, faunal and lithic analysis, as well as radiocarbon dating, we evidence a broad sequence involving different processes: shell midden formation; a stone‐structure; a prepared burial pit; a burning event; a short‐term occupational episode; and the entombment of the structure. We interpret this sequence as ritualized actions related to commemorative and place‐making activities. Our work stresses the need for new research programs at the Atacama Desert coast, based on geoarchaeological approaches, to understand hunter‐gatherer‐fisher middening and architectural practices from the very materiality involved in stratigraphy‐making processes.","We thank Josefina Urrea, Valentina Durán, Camilo Robles, and Fidel Cortés for their contribution during the Structure‐2 excavation process.

Muell. grown under dry environmental conditions in the southern Atacama Desert, Chile. After 18 consecutive dry seasons, considerable plant-to-plant phenotypic variation for all the traits was observed in the field. For example, leaf hydrogen cyanide (HCN) concentrations varied from 0 (two acyanogenic individuals) to 1.54 mg cyanide g-1 DW. Subsequent genome-wide association study revealed associations with several genes with a known function in plants. HCN content was associated robustly with genes encoding Cytochrome P450 proteins, and with genes involved in the detoxification mechanism of HCN in cells (β-cyanoalanine synthase and cyanoalanine nitrilase). Another important finding was that sugars, proline, and pigment content were linked to genes involved in transport, biosynthesis, and/or catabolism. Estimates of genomic heritability (based on haplotypes) ranged between 0.46 and 0.84 (HCN and proline content, respectively). Proline and soluble sugars had the highest predictive ability of genomic prediction models (PA = 0.65 and PA = 0.71, respectively). PA values for HCN content and flavonols were relatively moderate, with estimates ranging from 0.44 to 0.50. These findings provide new understanding on the genetic architecture of cyanogenic capacity, and other key complex traits in cyanogenic E. cladocalyx.","The authors are very grateful to the owner of Hacienda Caracas, at Los Vilos, Chile, Mr. Eduardo Collantes, for organizing and maintaining the experiment for many years.

For students of non-European language background, the challenge of acquiring INC is often complicated by the fact that IUPAC rules necessitate comprehension of European language elements. These include European nomenclature rules, prefixes, and suffixes. INC acquisition in Asia has traditionally occurred through undergraduate organic chemistry lecture courses. The present study demonstrates, in a South Korean context, that outcomes in such courses can sometimes be unsatisfactory, pointing to a need for reforms. To improve performance, a series of three nondidactic learning interventionsjigsaws, rule-based learning, and retrieval practicewere implemented over the course of a five-year period. Undergraduate focus groups were used to identify student-centered learning challenges, and this information was used to help inform the design of interventions. Performance outcomes were analyzed as the itemized competence in individual IUPAC rules when solving either name-to-structure or structure-to-name problems. These data demonstrate the combined implementation of all three interventions yielded substantial improvements for both question types. Concurrently, a context-specific learning attitudes survey showed most of the learning challenges identified in focus groups were mitigated through the reform process. Given that INC acquisition is a common challenge for students across the globe, the present study offers a compelling model for improving terminology competence across a wide range of diverse STEM contexts.","The author would like to thank the many students who donated their time, energy, interest, and honesty in helping characterize and improve this unique learning context.",,Journal of Chemical Education,,,,2021-03-30,2021,2021-03-30,2021-05-11,98,5,1503-1517,Closed,Article,"Fendos, Justin","Fendos, Justin (Global Biotechnology Department, Dongseo University, Busan, Sasang, 47017, South Korea)","Fendos, Justin (Dongseo University)","Fendos, Justin (Dongseo University)",5,1,,4.58,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136773962,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

However, previous isotopic studies have found limited evidence of its consumption by people in archaeobotanical assemblages. Hypothetically, if deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) were feeding on maize (Zea mays L.) in gardens prior to its adoption as a human dietary staple, this may indicate a niche construction process which would later lead to shifts in hunting strategies. This construction of garden spaces or niches has implications for decreased mobility and greater investment in garden crops. To evaluate this hypothesis in the Ohio River Valley, we measured stable nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) isotope compositions of bulk collagen in deer bones (N = 25) from archaeological sites spanning the Middle Woodland (200 BCE - CE 400/500) to Late Precontact (CE 1400-1630). Our hypothesis was not confirmed: little (one deer of 19) evidence for maize consumption occurred in the analyzed deer remains. Five deer of 19 did indicate the possibility of feeding in deeply wooded areas, reflecting canopy effect. Dog (Canis lupus familiaris L.) bone samples (N = 2) were also analyzed for these isotopes and one indicates some consumption of maize.","Funding for the isotope analysis for this paper was provided by the Association for Environmental Archaeology.

This study reports a 3-year monthly time series (2017-2020) of physical and biogeochemical parameters obtained from the Reloncaví Marine Observatory (OMARE, Spanish acronym) at the northernmost embayment and fjord system of Patagonia. The main objective of this work was to understand the land-atmosphere-ocean interactions and to identify the mechanisms that modulate the density of phytoplankton. A key finding of this study was the seasonally varying asynchronous input of oceanic and estuarine water. Surface lower salinity and warmer estuarine water arrived in late winter to summer, contributing to water column stability, followed by subsurface higher salinity and less warmer oceanic water during fall-winter. In late winter 2019, an interannual change above the picnocline due to the record-high polarity of the Indian Ocean Dipole inhibited water column stability. The biogeochemical parameters (NO3-, NO2-, PO43-, Si(OH)4, pH, and dissolved oxygen) responded to the surface annual salinity variations, and oceanic water mass contributed greatly to the subsurface inorganic nutrient input. The water column N/P ratio indicated that no eutrophication occurred, even under intense aquaculture activity, likely because of the high ventilation dynamics of the Reloncaví Sound. Finally, a shift in phytoplankton composition, characterized by surface chlorophyll-a maxima in late winter and deepening of spring-summer blooms related to the physicochemical conditions of the water column, was observed. Our results support the ecosystem services provided by local oceanography processes in the north Patagonian fjords. Here, the anthropogenic impact caused by economic activities could be, in part, chemically reduced by the annual ventilation cycle mediated by the exchange of oceanic water masses into Patagonian fjords.","We thank Paola Reinoso for her help in performing nutrient analysis at the chemical laboratory of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile.

643,pub.1134393329,10.1007/s10236-020-01431-y,,,Modelling the transport of sediment discharged by Colombian rivers to the southern Caribbean Sea,"The three-dimensional transport of sediments released by the main rivers in the Colombian Caribbean basin is investigated using numerical model simulations. Different types of sediments (fine sands, very fine sands and coarse silts) were tracked by implementing SedimentDrift software, a subclass of the OpenDrift open-source trajectory framework. The simulations were forced with climatological winds from ERA-5 and currents from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). In situ measurements from the area were utilised in the evaluation of the forcing fields. The diagnostic analysis of ERA-5 and CMEMS at the evaluated stations in the Colombian basin led to the conclusion that these datasets are reliable; hence, they can be used for several oceanographic and coastal engineering studies. The sediment transport of non-cohesive particles at each river mouth is subject to the variability of local hydrodynamics, morphological features and the grain size, which determines the settling velocities. These factors were considered and evaluated in detail. Given the lack of available in situ information, the performance of the Lagrangian model is evaluated by comparing the resulting simulations with previous studies reported in the area for river plume dynamics. However, this study presents an initial analysis of the pathways that sediments of different sizes follow, from the river mouth to the seafloor. This approach is convenient given that the Colombian rivers deliver large amounts of sediment of various grain sizes, there are insufficient in situ data to assess the seasonal cycle of sediment transport and many aspects of the sediment dynamics are not fully resolved. The resulting simulations provide evidence of the importance of high-resolution ocean current data, given that this is the main factor determining the trajectories and dispersion patterns at seasonal scales.","This study has been conducted using E.U.

                    The airline aviation industry is both capital-intensive and competitive. Hence, the evolution of the sector needs original marketing strategies. To study the relationships between corporate branding and corporate image, taking into account two views, namely, corporate strategy and corporate expression in airline identity, this paper aims to analyze the main indicators of the corporate branding that affect the outcomes of the corporate image.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    To inspect the theories, the foundational configural model was assessed through the perceptions of 395 employees in Indian aviation companies. By using complexity theory, this study matched the concept of equifinality and it examined the data via a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Findings show that corporate strategy positively influences the corporate image and corporate expression. Corporate expression offers the verbal and visual facets of a brand. Surprisingly, the paper shows that there is no link between corporate expression and corporate image. It also suggests that corporate expression, including corporate community, corporate promise and corporate personality, are all components of a corporate brand and do not influence the corporate image. Finally, the study highlights that corporate image positively affects superior business performance, which influences superior retailer preference.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The study identifies the corporate identity’s indicators (corporate strategy and corporate expression) that affect the corporate image, which results in stronger, superior business performance and retailer preference. It suggests that managers in the airline industry should follow the recommendations of this research by adopting more objective and fairer procedures to attain superior business performance and retailer preference. In addition, the continued growth and the financial impact of the airline sector require the use of pioneering branding strategies. Future study is needed in various nations to advance the generalizability of the research findings.

This study aims to explore the conceptual, moral and attitudinal dimensions of AL and its relationship with different styles of parental control.   Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey was applied simultaneously to a sample of parents with children between 5 and 16 years old in three Spanish-speaking countries: Mexico, Spain and Colombia. Participants from the three countries were recruited via online social media networks and were asked to fill in an online survey. A questionnaire, which has been adapted from previous literature to suit the mobile advertising context and the population of interest, was designed. Cross-country samples of varying sizes, with a predetermined quota of 200 participants for each country, were used. The total sample consisted of 1,454 participants.   Findings Four factors of mobile AL were found, which, to a greater extent, correspond to the dimensions of AL proposed in the literature. The following are the dimensions that were identified: cognitive, moral, attitudinal and an emerging factor is known as “children’s perceived mobile AL.” Differences in parents’ perceived knowledge of mobile advertising, parental control styles and AL levels in the three countries were identified. Parents with an authoritative style were identified to have more knowledge than those with an indulgent style. Differences were also identified between countries concerning the amount of exposure that children have to mobile advertising, while no significant differences were found in the moral dimension.   Practical implications Marketing practitioners and public policymakers must consider that parents differ in some dimensions of AL. Parents also seem to lack adequate knowledge about the advertising tools available to announcers that affect children and adolescents in a mobile communication environment. Therefore, government agencies should consider developing mobile digital media literacy programs for parents.   Originality/value This paper explores the dimensions of AL applied to the mobile context and identifies the level of parental mobile AL in three Spanish-speaking countries, as well as the differences between these sub-samples concerning parental mobile AL profiles and parental control styles, thus expanding the literature on AL with a cross-cultural approach.","Funding source: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.Authors’ contribution.ORP: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft.SRB: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – Review &amp; Editing, Study supervision.PNG: Methodology, Writing – Review &amp; Editing, Project administration.BMJ: Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – Review &amp; Editing.LGB: Methodology, Writing – Review &amp; Editing.",,Young Consumers Insight and Ideas for Responsible Marketers,,,,2021-11-19,2021,2021-11-19,2022-05-10,23,2,255-281,Closed,Article,"Robayo-Pinzon, Oscar; Rojas-Berrio, Sandra; Núñez-Gómez, Patricia; Miguélez-Juan, Blanca; García-Béjar, Ligia","Robayo-Pinzon, Oscar (School of Business Administration, Universidad Del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia, and School of Marketing and Branding, Institucion Universitaria Politecnico Grancolombiano, Bogota, Colombia); Rojas-Berrio, Sandra (Faculty of Economics, Management and Public Accounting School, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Núñez-Gómez, Patricia (Departamento de Ciencias de la Comunicación Aplicada, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain); Miguélez-Juan, Blanca (Departamento de Comunicación Audiovisual y Publicidad, Universidad del País Vasco/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Spain); García-Béjar, Ligia (Escuela de Pedagogía, Universidad Panamericana, Campus Guadalajara)","Robayo-Pinzon, Oscar (Universidad del Rosario; Politécnico Grancolombiano)","Robayo-Pinzon, Oscar (Universidad del Rosario; Politécnico Grancolombiano); Rojas-Berrio, Sandra (National University of Colombia); Núñez-Gómez, Patricia (Complutense University of Madrid); Miguélez-Juan, Blanca (University of the Basque Country); García-Béjar, Ligia (Escuela de Pedagogía, Universidad Panamericana, Campus Guadalajara)",4,4,,1.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143221008,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Mussels were exposed for 10-14 weeks to contrasting pCO2 (500 and 1400 μatm) and temperature (15 and 20 °C) levels, in the presence/absence of cues from one or two predator species. We compared mussel traits at sub-organismal (nutritional status, metabolic capacity-ATP production-, cell stress condition via HSP70 expression) and organismal (survival, oxygen consumption, growth, byssus biogenesis, clearance rates, aggregation) levels. OA increased the mussels' oxygen consumption; and OA combined with OW increased ATP demand and the use of carbohydrate reserves. Mussels at present-day pCO2 levels had the highest protein content. Under OW the predatory snail cues induced the highest cell stress condition on the mussels. Temperature, predator cues and the interaction between them affected mussel growth. Mussels grew larger at the control temperature (15 °C) when crab and snail cues were present. Mussel wet mass and calcification were affected by predator cues; with highest values recorded in crab cue presence (isolated or combined with snail cues). In the absence of predator cues in the trails, byssus biogenesis was affected by OA, OW and the OA × OW and OA × predator cues interactions. At present-day pCO2 levels, more byssus was recorded with snail than with crab cues. Clearance rates were affected by temperature, pCO2 and the interaction between them. The investigated stressors had no effects on mussel aggregation. We conclude that OA, OW and the NCEs may lead to neutral, positive or negative consequences for mussels.","This study was supported by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) Grant No 1181609 to PHM and CD, program managed by the National Agency of Research and Development (ANID, Chile).

The results highlight the benefit of incorporating EBO in the stock projection of critical components of EX5500 hydraulic excavators. In addition, by considering the typical concerns related to the topic, the model was evaluated based on the company’s annual budget restriction. Savings of 557,128 EUR compared to the stock investment of the current company policy (estimated at 5,273,511 EUR) at a service level of 98% and warehouse availability of 95% were found. Furthermore, by using a solver, the projection was optimized and adjusted to the annual budget, increasing the savings to 928,753 EUR, at a service level of 96.4% and warehouse availability of 93.7%. Although the EBO approach has been previously studied within the equipment availability context, the equipment operating conditions were not the same as they vary depending on the area in which they operate. Therefore, it is necessary to provide clear evidence of its effectiveness of application before adopting actions which rely on promising results developed in other contexts. This is even more crucial when dealing with excavators, which are critical, large-scale, capital intensive pieces of equipment.

                    across their distribution from Peru to northern Chile (12-30°S), to test the influence of host size variation on epibiont occurrence, individual spatial distribution, and body size. We analyzed the contribution of chiton body size to the pattern of abundance and distribution of occupancy of the epibiont limpet. We also examined the relationship between limpet shell size, coverage, and incidence probability function and chiton body size across latitudes. For some localities across the range edge of the host grazer’s distribution (i.e. 28-30°S), incidence and densities of the epibiont limpet were higher on larger chitons. Unoccupied host chiton proportions decreased at the poleward edge of the host-epibiont species range compared with sites located to the north. Increased variation in the epibiont limpet distribution on the host chiton plates suggests that limpets’ spatial segregation may have a role in lessening intraspecific interference competition with the host species at southern latitudes. Therefore, local and large-scale processes seem to contribute to modify the host-epibiont association pattern. Further studies are necessary to determine if this association shifts from commensalistic to antagonistic across the distributional range of both species.",,,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,2021-09-16,2021,,2021-09-16,674,,131-141,Closed,Article,"Ibáñez, CM; Bravo, J; Carrasco, SA; Carter, MJ; Aguilera, MA","Ibáñez, CM (Departamento de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Avenida República 440, Santiago, Chile); Bravo, J (Departamento de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Avenida República 440, Santiago, Chile); Carrasco, SA (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands (ESMOI), Coquimbo, Chile); Carter, MJ (Departamento de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Avenida República 440, Santiago, Chile); Aguilera, MA (Departamento de Ciencias, Facultad de Artes Liberales, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Av.

However, one of the major problems related to the production of these artefacts is the large consumption of natural raw material, which are the clays that are calcined and acquire appropriate technological properties. Brazil is a country that has great prominence in the production of ceramic blocks, used to reduce the existing housing deficit, however the great variability in the characteristics of the soils in the country makes this process very difficult. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics of four different soils collected in deposits in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, evaluating right after its technological parameters such as the flexural mechanical strength, water absorption and linear burning retraction of the calcined prismatic specimens at 750, 850 and 1100 °C. The results showed that the collected soils have adequate characteristics for the production of ceramic blocks at a temperature of 1100 °C.",,,Materials Science Forum,,,,2021-01,2021,2021-01,2021-02-10,1017,,123-132,Closed,Article,"Azevedo, A.R.G.; Klyuev, S.V.; Klimenko, V.A.; Marvila, M.T.; Fediuk, Roman","Azevedo, A.R.G.

This variability can be exploited in breeding programs to develop cultivars with high yield potential and resistant to biotic and abiotic stress. The aim of the present study was to quantify the genetic divergence in families of full-sibs of sour passion fruit and to select families for a new recurrent selection cycle. Thirty-five families of sour passion fruit in the second cycle of recurrent selection were evaluated. Thirty quantitative descriptors and thirteen qualitative descriptors were measured. Molecular information was obtained using 21 ISSR markers. The data were evaluated through multivariate analysis, using the Ward-MLM procedure. The thirty-five families showed high genetic variability. Four groups were formed, with genetic distances ranging from 267.99 to 4220.00. The greatest dissimilarities between families within groups were observed in group III. The 20, 15, 10 and 5 families with the greatest dissimilarities were selected for recombination in a new recurrent selection cycle. Genetic variability was affected by the number of selected families. The greater the intensity of selection applied, the greater the loss of alleles and the more intense the reduction of the Nei and Shannon indices. The quantification of the population’s genetic diversity by multivariate analysis was efficiently performed, providing enough information for selection based on genetic distance. For a new selection cycle, the greater the number of selected families, the less the genetic variability is or was affected.",The authors would like to thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) and the Research Support Foundation of Mato Grosso State (FAPEMAT) for granting a scholarship; and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and Research Support Foundation of Mato Grosso State (FAPEMAT) for financial support for the execution of the project.,,Euphytica,,,,2021-01-03,2021,2021-01-03,2021-01,217,1,11,Closed,Article,"Ferreira, Amanda Fernanda Nunes; Krause, Willian; Cordeiro, Maria Helena Menezes; Viana, Alexandre Pio; Santos, Eileen Azevedo; Vieira, Henrique Duarte","Ferreira, Amanda Fernanda Nunes (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil); Krause, Willian (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil); Cordeiro, Maria Helena Menezes (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil); Viana, Alexandre Pio (Center for Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, 28013-600, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Santos, Eileen Azevedo (Center for Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, 28013-600, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Vieira, Henrique Duarte (Center for Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, 28013-600, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","Cordeiro, Maria Helena Menezes (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil)","Ferreira, Amanda Fernanda Nunes (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil); Krause, Willian (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil); Cordeiro, Maria Helena Menezes (Postgraduate Program in Genetics and Plant Breeding, State University of Mato Grosso, 78300-000, Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso, Brazil); Viana, Alexandre Pio (Center for Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, 28013-600, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Santos, Eileen Azevedo (Center for Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, 28013-600, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Vieira, Henrique Duarte (Center for Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, 28013-600, Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)",5,4,,1.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134291706,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3008 Horticultural Production; 31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics",

Organisers in NAYO played a significant role conscientising and organising with the working people of South Africa’s Black urban landscape. The organisation was a space created for Black South African youth who were not based in secondary or tertiary education. Hence, it disproportionately attracted the working poor and what Marxists would call the lumpen-proletariat population. Their politicising under Black Consciousness and actions to spread NAYO’s gospel left an indelible mark on the South African liberation struggle during the 1970s and beyond. Lastly, NAYO and its various regional branches served as a recruiting ground for the various South African armed wings in exile during the 1970s.",,,South African Historical Journal,,,,2021-04-03,2021,2021-08-30,2021-04-03,73,2,515-532,Closed,Article,"Asheeke, Toivo","Asheeke, Toivo (Purchase College)","Asheeke, Toivo (Purchase College)","Asheeke, Toivo (Purchase College)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140747204,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and physiology of conilon coffee seedlings under foliar application of liquid tannery sludge as an alternative to fertilization. The experiment was conduced in a greenhouse. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with eight replications and seven treatments, which consisted of different concentrations of tannery sludge (6.20, 8.80, 11.47, 14.10 and 17.60 mL of sludge tannery diluted in 1 L of water), a conventional treatment with urea and a control treatment using only water. Growth and physiological characteristics were evaluated through gas exchange, fluorometric analysis and color analysis using the Colorimeter. The conilon coffee seedlings fertilized with 14.10 and 17.60 mL L−1 showed a satisfactory growth pattern. The doses of tannery sludge used in this study did not promote changes in color analysis and indices obtained by fluorimetry, except for flavonoids, in which the highest dose promoted greater synthesis of this secondary metabolite. Doses below 14.10 mL L−1 promoted changes in gas exchange, however, leaf photosynthesis was only compromised with doses equal to or less than 8.80 mL L−1.","The authors would like to thank the Espírito Santo Research and Innovation Support Foundation (FAPES) and the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Espírito Santo (IFES) for their financial and institutional support for research.",,Plant Physiology Reports,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,2021-12,26,4,722-728,Closed,Article,"Amaro de Sales, Ramon; Pereira Rossini, Franciele; Galvão, Eduardo Rezende; da Silva Berilli, Sávio; Pereira Rodrigues, Weverton; Rezende Barcelos de Andrade, Jeniffer; Amaro de Salles, Rodrigo; Cunha Siman, Felipe","Amaro de Sales, Ramon (Department of Plant Science, Federal University of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Pereira Rossini, Franciele (North University Center of Espírito Santo, Federal University of Espirito Santo, Espírito Santo, Brazil); Galvão, Eduardo Rezende (Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Espírito Santo - Campus Itapina, Espírito Santo, Brazil); da Silva Berilli, Sávio (Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Espírito Santo - Campus Itapina, Espírito Santo, Brazil); Pereira Rodrigues, Weverton (Agricultural Sciences and Technologies Center, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rezende Barcelos de Andrade, Jeniffer (Department of Exact Sciences, State University of Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Brazil); Amaro de Salles, Rodrigo (Center of Agrarian Sciences and Engineering, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Espírito Santo, Brazil); Cunha Siman, Felipe (Center of Agrarian Sciences and Engineering, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Espírito Santo, Brazil)","Amaro de Salles, Rodrigo (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo)","Amaro de Sales, Ramon (Universidade Federal de Viçosa); Pereira Rossini, Franciele (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo); Galvão, Eduardo Rezende (Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Espírito Santo - Campus Itapina, Espírito Santo, Brazil); da Silva Berilli, Sávio (Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Espírito Santo - Campus Itapina, Espírito Santo, Brazil); Pereira Rodrigues, Weverton (Agricultural Sciences and Technologies Center, State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rezende Barcelos de Andrade, Jeniffer (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais); Amaro de Salles, Rodrigo (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo); Cunha Siman, Felipe (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo)",1,1,,0.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142598346,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3001 Agricultural Biotechnology",2 Zero Hunger

 A photocatalyst foam is developed by growing high-density CdS microspheres on Ni 2 P nanolayer-modified Ni foam (NF) (termed CdS/NF–P) for efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic H 2 evolution. The in situ grown Ni 2 P thin layer on NF not only provides a large number of anchoring sites for the growth of high-density CdS microspheres for enhancing the visible light capture ability, but also offers active sites for catalyzing the H 2 evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the multiple heterojunction interfaces formed among NF, Ni 2 P, and CdS can greatly promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a consequence, the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam exhibits good photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation. The H 2 evolution rate reaches 4.82 mmol h −1 g CdS −1 over the best CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam, which is about five times that of CdS particles suspended in the reaction solution. More attractively, the photocatalyst foam can be easily recovered and recycled in the reaction solution by simple magnetic separation. In addition, the structural integrity makes the photocatalyst foam highly stable in the photocatalytic HER for 35 h. This work provides a new strategy for the design of efficient and practical photocatalyst foams that are easy to prepare on a large scale and compatible with device manufacturing for large-scale photochemical energy conversion.","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University (2021JCYJ01 and FWNX41), the Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province (2021AAC02016, 2021AAC03201, and 2021AAC03194), the Foundation of Academic Top-notch Talent Support Program of the North Minzu University (2019BGBZ08), the Leading Talents Program of Science and Technology Innovation in Ningxia Province (2020GKLRLX14), the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Projects for Returnees of Ningxia Province, and the Cooperative Scientific Research Project of Chunhui Plan of Ministry of Education of China (201900081).",,Sustainable Energy & Fuels,,,,2021-09-28,2021,2021,2021-09-28,5,19,4904-4912,Closed,Article,"Liu, Zhaoting; Wang, Fang; Zhang, Zhengguo; Min, Shixiong","Liu, Zhaoting (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, 750021, P.

We used panel data on a sample of 983 companies between 1995 and 2017. Our results indicate that positive discretionary accruals reduce leverage and increase debt maturity. These findings suggest that accounting manipulation activities favor managerial entrenchment and seek to avoid external supervision and liquidity risk. The institutional and financial development of countries promotes leverage and long-term debt issuances. However, its effects do not mitigate the impact of accounting manipulation activities on this policy. The IFRS adoption is an effective means of control that attenuates the effects of earnings management on capital structure. These results are relevant for investors and policymakers due to their implications for firms’ corporate governance and financial policy design.","We also appreciate the comments of those who attended the Annual Assembly CLADEA 2019 (Lima, Peru), International Finance Conference IFC 2019 (Córdoba, Argentina) and the Annual Meeting of Administration and Economics Schools ENEFA 2019 (Pucón, Chile).

A rather similar effect can be found in other finite fermion systems. For instance, ultra small metallic grains and metal clusters. The staggering in nuclei and grains is attributed primarily to pairing correlations. In clusters, it is originated by the Jahn–Teller effect [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3599 (1998)]. Here, we work with a simple, Lipkin-like, exactly solvable two-level fermion model.

Data were collected from retail store managers and frontline employees in Brazil in three different contexts (e.g., footwear, clothing, and furniture).

However, natural chromite is represented broadly as (Fe,Mg)O⋅(Cr,Al,Fe)2O3 to illustrate the common replacement of Fe2+ by Mg2+, and Cr3+ by Al3+ and Fe3+.

For that, cylinders of 2 cm diameter and 0.5 cm height were cut in two orientations according to vascular tissues: longitudinal and transversal. Then, they were frozen at −20°C for 53 hr and thawed at 6.1°C for 12 hr. After that, two indirect methods to measure tissue damage were analyzed: by electrical conductivity of drip loss and by mass transfer during drying of samples before and after freeze/thawing process. As results, cut orientation showed significant effect on eggplant damage, finding approximately 143% more drip loss using transversal cut, than longitudinal cut. Regarding, turnip and squash, they did not show damage differences by freeze/thawing process using different cut orientations. In addition, measuring drip loss electrical conductivity demonstrated to be a more suitable method to assess freeze damage than mass transfer evaluation. This work concludes that cut orientation is an approach that cannot be ignored during freeze/thawing processes evaluation.   Practical Applications This work demonstrated that the orientation how vegetables are cut can affect the freeze–thawing process. This simple consideration should be considered to avoid obtaining low quality vegetables after thawed them. Despite this could not be observed during industrial process, consumers, who are not used to apply controlled conditions, can note food damages after product thawing.",,,Journal of Food Process Engineering,,,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,2021-11,44,11,,Closed,Article,"Silva, Laurita; Ramirez, Karla; Gavidia, Francisco; Miano, Alberto Claudio","Silva, Laurita (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Ramirez, Karla (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Gavidia, Francisco (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru); Miano, Alberto Claudio (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)","Silva, Laurita (Private University of the North); Ramirez, Karla (Private University of the North); Gavidia, Francisco (Private University of the North); Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)",3,1,,0.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140803112,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering",

Therefore, the discharge of this wastewater can produce environmental problems. The aim of this work was to determine the optimal concentration of the reagents involved in a solar photo-Fenton process in the treatment of wastewater coming from juice. The process was analysed in a factorial design, as a function of H 2 O 2 (900, 1000, 1100 mg/L) and Fe 2+ (90, 100, 110 mg/L) concentration. The grape juice wastewater presents high organic content (20,500 mg/L COD and 5.4 mg/L polyphenols). Also, the presence of alcohols such ethanol, ethyl acetate and 2-metil-1-propanol was confirmed. The results showed that highest COD (>27%) and polyphenols removal (>36%) were obtained in experiments with 1100 mg H 2 O 2 /L and 100 mg Fe 2+ /L. In treatments with higher COD removal, 2-metil-1-propanol was detected as an intermediate of ethanol oxidation.

The present study corresponds to a narrative review. The inclusion criteria considered were that they should be interventions in the area of food and nutrition, have an experimental or quasi-experimental design, and have a comparison group to evaluate changes (pre-post intervention measurements or presence of a control group). The findings suggest that there are transversal characteristics in the interventions that reported positive effects; among them, the quantity and frequency of the sessions, the cultural adaptation of the content according to the idiosyncrasy of the territory of origin of the migrants, and the age of the target group to intervene in order to achieve significant learning. It is of vital importance to generate evidence in the Latin American context that allows for the contextualization of the health status of the migrant population and lays the foundation for future food and nutrition interventions",,,Journal of Behavior and Feeding,,,,2021-07-01,2021,2021-07-01,,1,1,72-77,Closed,Article,"Hun, Nelson; Urzúa, Alfonso; López-Espinoza, Antonio; Estrada, José Guadalupe Salazar","Hun, Nelson (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); López-Espinoza, Antonio (Instituto de Investigaciones en Comportamiento Alimentario y Nutrición, Universidad de Guadalajara); Estrada, José Guadalupe Salazar (Centro Universitario de los Valles, Universidad de Guadalajara, México)",,"Hun, Nelson (Catholic University of the North); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); López-Espinoza, Antonio (University of Guadalajara); Estrada, José Guadalupe Salazar (University of Guadalajara)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171228020,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,2 Zero Hunger

However, labour substitution from automation and robotics is increasing in a wide range of modern mining processes. Such labour replacement is likely to intensify in the coming years due to advances and cost reductions in technology. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic also adds to the impetus of relying less on human interaction for critical operational processes. In this paper, we provide some insights on the global trends of automation/robotics in mining and discuss the main economic impacts that increasing human labour substitution could bring to mining communities, regions, and nations. We focus on mining automation/robotics impacts on jobs, income (including taxes), and regional inequality. We conclude by discussing policy options that governments could consider for mitigating these impacts, including the reskilling of miners and tax transfers.",The author thanks the support of Juan Paez Cortes in data collection.

This is due to the strong dependence of nonlinear phenomena on numerous physicochemical factors. The feasibility of simultaneously employing the second harmonic generation (SHG) and upconversion luminescence (UCL) processes in BaTiO 3 :Ho 3+ ,Yb 3+ for optical temperature sensing is demonstrated for the first time. Under 976 nm laser excitation, the evolution of the SHG and UCL band intensity ratio is correlated with temperature and calibrated within the temperature range of 25–305 °C. The band intensity ratio between SHG and UCL exhibits a sigmoidal dependence on temperature, and, hence, it can allow the detection of phase transitions from non‐centrosymmetric to centrosymmetric systems, and vice versa. Most importantly, from the perspective of optical temperature sensing, this work provides a novel and effective strategy for nonlinear optical thermometry, with high sensitivity of up to 2.78% °C –1 .","Acknowledgements This work was financially supported by the Polish National Science Centre (Grant No. UMO‐2016/21/B/ST5/00110), by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain (MICIIN) under the National Program of Sciences and Technological Materials (PID2019‐106383GB‐C44 and PID2019‐107335RA‐I00) and Gobierno de Canarias (ProID2020010067) and EU‐FEDER funds.

Structures and optical properties of SiNWs fabricated through chemical etching are significantly affected by experimental as well as environmental conditions of etching. A comparative study of quantum confinement (QC) effect due to variation in nano crystallite size (NCS) of SiNWs samples, fabricated by SIE technique has been investigated here using ultraviolet visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. An enhanced optical band gap has been observed from the samples under UV excitation at room temperature due to QC effect. To improve the understanding of basic mechanism of QC effect present in samples has been analyzed through characteristic features of Raman line-shape like red shift, asymmetry ratio and broadening as compared to its bulk counterpart. The NCS of SiNWs present in the samples has been calculated by QC based Brus model, bond polarizability (BP) model and Raman line-shape fitting model.

The study sample comprised 116 students aged 13–17 years from government‐subsidized schools. The Child and Adolescent Assessment System (SENA) was used to measure the variables considered in this study. The results showed that learning and school problems were able to predict 16% ( F = 6.416; p = .000; R 2 a = 0.16) of self‐esteem variance. It seems that students who present difficulties in their learning process are more vulnerable to not appreciating their qualities and feeling less proud of themselves, which could decrease their self‐esteem. These findings should inform the design of future psychoeducational interventions that promote healthy self‐esteem. 
Highlights    Self‐esteem has a direct relationship with willingness to study.   Problems with school and learning difficulties were significantly associated with self‐esteem.   Self‐esteem has inverse associations with age, school problems and learning difficulties.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by ANID PIA CIE160007.

The approach is based on a slug injection of table salt (NaCl) as a tracer and specific conductance readings at different locations downstream of the injection spot. Observed specific conductance readings are fit using the advection‐dispersion equation with OTIS‐P, yielding estimates of cross‐sectional area and longitudinal dispersion coefficient for various stream reaches. Estimates of the D L are used to assess the accuracy of several empirical equations reported in the literature. This allowed the determination of complementary transport parameters related to transient storage zones. The empirical equations yielded rather high D L values, with some reaching up an order of magnitude higher to those obtained from tracer additions and OTIS‐P. Overall, the proposed approach seems reliable and pertinent for river reaches of ca. 150 m in length.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank T. Ceballos, D. Ocaranza, R. Cortés, P. Urrea, J. Oyarzún, E.

                  The yellow-shouldered bat, Sturnira parvidens (Phyllostomidae), is an abundant and widespread species in southern North America and Mesoamerica. Despite its important ecological role, no genomic resources exist for this species. Using low-coverage short Illumina 150 bp pair-end reads sequencing, this study reports the mitochondrial chromosome and nuclear repetitive elements, including microsatellites, in S. parvidens. The mitochondrial genome of S. parvidens is 16,612 bp in length and is comprised of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. Repetitive elements constituted ~67% of the nuclear genome while ~33% of the genome represented single- or low-copy sequences. A moderate proportion of repetitive sequences (31% putative families) could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements, the most ubiquitous repetitive elements belonged to Class I-LINE and Satellite DNA, which were considerably more abundant than Class I-LTR elements and Class II-DNA transposons (TcMar-Mariner and hAT-Charlie). A total of 193 microsatellites were identified.",JAB thanks Dr. Vincent P. Richards for bioinformatics support. We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

An expedition to Volcán Llullaillaco in 1996 discovered an unstudied high‐elevation lake (6,170 m a.s.l.) that probably was formed as a result of the past eruptive events or climatic processes such as glacial retreat in the lake basin.   This article describes an initial physical characterization of the lake and its microbial communities derived from two sampling expeditions in 2013 and 2016.    The microbial community in the lake, with an area between 1.2 and 1.4 ha and a depth of 6.8 m, was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Haloarchaea. In addition, 26 bacterial isolates were identified within the genera Subtercola , Xylophilus , Rhodanobacter , Mesorhizobium and Pseudomonas .    Lago Llullaillaco is one of the highest recorded lakes in the world, and this study highlights the unique microbial diversity of this aquatic ecosystem and the importance of its preservation to understand the complex biological processes under polyextreme conditions.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Cristian Ramirez from Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería, for discussions, Esteban Severino for improving the figures and Jonathan García for paper discussion.

These problems are significant from strategic levels to the productivity of a single construction project level, from energy to transportation and from infrastructure to residential buildings. A large number of publications in this field of study prove this significance. However, regarding the variety of applications, managerial decision levels, and the growing number of studies, it is important to comprehend the latest trends and conclude an appropriate research path in this field. This study is mainly focused on the application of MADM methodologies on locating problems by which many studies are carried out and have a high coincidence with the locating problem environment. Consequently, 425 studies are considered in this study, and 217 more relevant papers are selected for the subsequent reviews.

Dead individuals consisting of empty single and articulated valves were collected from vesicomyid clam beds, at 690 m depth by the remotely operated vehicle KIEL 6000, using scoop nets. Shell characters, such as equivalve, antero-posteriorly elongate shell, external surface smooth without periostracal hair, not gaped and hinge plate without teeth or crenulations, were observed and compared with the morphology of described species within the genus. Based on these morphological characters we tentatively assign the individuals belonging to Adipicola leticiae previously never found below 27°S in the SE Pacific.

Improper management of health-care waste places the urban community and society, urban residents, patients, and water resources at risk from the toxic effects of environmental pollution, which can bring up many social and environmental costs for municipalities. Location selection for sitting a landfill for health-care waste with a sustainable development perspective is a complicated decision making problem in the urban and social planning area. This study develops a novel integrated decision-making model for landfill location selection for the health-care waste system. In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS), Best-Worst Method (BWM), and Measurement of alternatives and ranking according to COmpromise solution (MARCOS) method under grey interval set considering sustainability factors. To generate the GIS suitability maps, location criteria are first calculated using the BWM model. The GIS suitability maps suggest eight potential locations for landfilling, which are prioritized using G-MARCOS in order to select the best alternative location. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study to integrate GIS, BWM, and G-MAROCS methods for sustainable landfill location selection problem for health-care waste. This paper investigates a real case of the municipality of Hamedan, Iran, to show the applicability of the developed methodology for urban planning problems. Sensitivity analysis tests are performed to establish the reliability and robustness of the results.

The objective of the study was to translate the WTLS into Spanish, assess its internal structure, reliability, and the correlates between WTLS and life satisfaction, resilience, and depression in older Peruvian adults. Method The participants were 235 Peruvian older adults (M = 72.69, SD = 6.68), evaluated between March to May 2019, selected through non-probability sampling. The WTLS, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) were administered. Data analysis included reliability by internal consistency and structural equation models, specifically confirmatory factor analysis (AFC), to test the one-dimensional solution of the WTLS and the convergent validity of the WTLS at the latent level, by specifying a four-factor model (will to live, life satisfaction, resilience and depression). Results Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the composite reliability index obtain values ​​of .93 and .94 respectively.

The aim of this study was to correlate the results obtained by disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays of antimicrobials used in fish farming using F. psychrophilum isolates recovered from Chilean farmed salmonids. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and MIC values of six antibacterial agents against 125 Chilean isolates of F. psychrophilum were tested on Diluted (1:5) Cation-Adjusted Mueller-Hinton (DCAMH) agar using a disk diffusion method and an agar dilution method, respectively. A moderate correlation for antimicrobials amoxicillin and florfenicol was observed (Pearson correlation indices of −0.6894 and −0.5857, respectively), whereas highly significantly high (p < .001) correlations were detected for oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, flumequine and enrofloxacin (Pearson correlation indices of −0.7901, −0.8386, −0.8151 and −0.7818, respectively), demonstrating that MIC and disk values were tightly associated (R2 ≥ 0.61). When isolates were categorized as fully susceptible Wild-Type or Non Wild-Type, the number of isolates differently categorized using each method varied between 8 and 23 for assayed antibacterials. The use of DCAMH without biological supplements was efficient to perform agar dilution tests with F. psychrophilum but its use to perform disk diffusion assays is questionable, due to some isolates exhibiting poor growth produced inhibition zones that are difficult to read.

Hence, the genetic damage among the Antarctic vascular flora, whose individuals frequently experience these abiotic stresses, might be recurrent among their populations. To respond this, the genetic damage associated with these stress factors was evaluated in Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica for the first time in the field and compared with those showed by plants grown at laboratory under less stressful conditions. Fifteen individuals per species from Admiralty Bay populations at King George Island (Maritime Antarctica) were used to semi-quantitatively estimate the genetic damage at the whole genome level by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, revealing by means of specific enzymatic treatments the damage generated by oxidative stress (oxidized purines and pyrimidines) and UV-B radiation (pyrimidine dimmers). Compared with laboratory control individuals, the basal genetic damage observed in both species was significantly higher under field conditions. However, while for C. quitensis, oxidative stress (Ox) was more relevant than UV-B radiation (field relative revealed damage: Ox = 29% vs. UV-B = 25%), in D. antarctica, it was UV-B radiation the most relevant genotoxic factor (Ox = 10% vs. UV-B = 33%). This first approach to the genetic damage of the Antarctic vascular flora suggests that the conditions experienced on their natural ecosystems would constitute a genotoxic environment for these species, yet with differential impact between them.","The successful implementation of the comet assay at Antarctic territory would not be possible without the invaluable logistic support of the Instituto Chileno Antártico INACH (ECA-56) and the amazing crew of the 43rd Polish Antarctic Expedition at “Henryk Arctowski” station.

Objective To evaluate the factors associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity in pregnant women with advanced maternal age (AMA) attending the National Maternal and Perinatal Institute of Peru during the period January to December 2018. Materials and methods An observational cross-sectional study was carried out at the National Maternal and Perinatal Institute of Peru during the 2018 period. Inclusion criteria were pregnant women aged 35 years and over that culminated in vaginal delivery or caesarean section. The variables studied were sociodemographic, obstetric, and perinatal factors. The multivariate logistic regression method and ROC curve analysis were used. Results The study included a total of 325 pregnant women with a mean age of 38.01 ± 2.66 years. Cohabiting civil status was 70.8%, primiparous 11.7%, and large multiparous 18.5%. Inadequate prenatal care was 47.7%, and intergenesic period- long 62.8%, and short 15.4%. Pre-pregnancy overweight was 38.6%, with caesarean 56.3%, and vaginal tear I°, 28%. Applying logistic regression, BMI ≥25 Kg/m2 gave an odds ratio (OR): 1.02 for severe pre-eclampsia; OR: 2.35 vaginal tear I°; and OR: 2.91 for foetal macrosomia. Inadequate prenatal control had an OR: 1. 31 for preterm delivery; and an OR: 1.48 for severe pre-eclampsia. Having a history of pre-eclampsia gave an OR: 3.03 for preterm delivery, and an OR: 10.90 for severe pre-eclampsia. ROC curve for the development of severe preeclampsia was 69.74%, complications in vaginal delivery 85.44%, and foetal macrosomia 72.78%. Conclusions Pre-gestational overweight in AMA is associated with developing severe pre-eclampsia, vaginal tear, and foetal macrosomia. Previous pre-eclampsia is strongly associated with developing preterm birth and severe pre-eclampsia, which should be thoroughly investigated during prenatal care.","Al Dr. Enrique Guevara Ríos, director del Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal de Lima-Perú, por haber autorizado la realización de la presente investigación.",,Clínica e Investigación en Ginecología y Obstetricia,,,,2021-01,2021,,2021-01,48,1,21-28,Closed,Article,"Peralta, F.D.

In three experiments, this study spawned adults of A. tonsa cultured at different salinities and temperatures. The eggs were collected to determine hatching success of fresh and cold-stored eggs (HS-C). Experiment 1: Adults spawned under four combinations of two temperatures (18 and 28 °C) and two salinities (18 and 30 PSU) to determine the HS-C from 0 (fresh eggs) to 4 weeks of storage. Experiment 2: Adults spawned under three combinations of temperatures (18, 23, and 29 °C) and 30 PSU to determine the HS-C (from 0 to 4 weeks of storage). Experiment 3: Adults spawned under 18 °C and 30 PSU to determine the HS-C (from 0 to 8 weeks of storage). All adults were distributed in triplicate in 2 L containers at 0.5 individual mL−1 and fed with the Rhodomonas salina microalgae at 2000 μg C L−1. In every experimental unit, the eggs were collected and stored at 3 ± 1 °C. In fresh eggs (0 weeks of storage), most of the treatments showed great hatching (> 90%). However, low salinity and high temperature resulted in a significantly (p < .05) lower hatch (81%) of the fresh eggs. The combination of 18 °C and 30 PSU produced better hatching (p < .05) in eggs stored for 2 and 4 weeks (85% and 73%, respectively), followed by 18 °C and 18 PSU (65% and 41%), 28 °C and 30 PSU (50% and 17%) and 28 °C and 18 PSU (11% and 2%). Stored quiescent eggs were strongly affected by the temperature and salinity of the culture environment. On the other hand, fresh (subitaneous) eggs do not depend so much of these variables. Therefore, the criteria to select what salinity and temperature combination is best to raise adults for egg production will depend on whether the eggs will be used for immediate-use (fresh) or storage.","Based on part of the dissertation by G.

                    Different mechanisms allow intellectual capital (IC) to affect performance. This paper aims to analyze the value of relations for the academic performance effect of IC and explore how the university’s reliance on digital technologies facilitates the contribution of IC to the overall academic performance.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The authors develop a model linking elements of IC to academic performance in the form of teaching, research and entrepreneurial activity. The model is centered on relational capital (RC) that is supposed to directly fuel performance and mediate the link between the other two IC dimensions and performance. From a methodological point of view, the authors base the empirical investigation on a sample of Italian public universities and applied structural equation modeling to test the mediation and a group comparison to disentangle the effect of universities’ digitalization.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The authors find a significant and positive effect of RC on performance. RC fully mediates the relationship between structural capital and academic performance, whereas it only partially mediates the link between human capital and academic performance. The authors also suggest that digital technologies guide the prominence of the relationship in the university’s ability to fulfill teaching, research and entrepreneurship missions through IC.

Design/methodology/approach This research is based on a qualitative research method. Interviews conducted with the 10 Limpopo Provincial Archivists and 25 community leaders based in the Venda area were conducted. The semi-structured interview was used to collect data.   Findings It is a South African constitutional mandate for each province to manage its archives. As the former Venda was now part of the Limpopo province, its archives were incorporated into the Limpopo Provincial Archives. The Venda archives incorporation to the Limpopo Provincial Archives did not consider the will of a community member to travel a long distance. Furthermore, challenges faced by archivists such as lack of skills and knowledge to process archival materials, lack of funding and participation in the incorporation of archives materials.

Redspotted catshark Schroederichthys chilensis is a coastal shark species associated with kelp forests of southern South America dominated by Lessonia trabeculata. Despite its common occurrence redspotted catshark the knowledge on its trophic ecology is rudimentary. This study aimed to assess the effects of presence/absence of kelp L. trabeculata on the isotopic niche of redspotted catshark through comparison of δ13C and δ15N in its blood and fin tissues (non-lethal samples). We found that males were characterized by higher trophic position and enriched carbon sources compared to females in locations where kelp was present. In contrast, males and females were characterized by similar isotopic niche in absence of kelp. These differences are most probably an effect of higher prey diversity associated with microhabitats generated by kelp forests that allow sexual segregation of isotopic niche. Therefore, extensive kelp harvest may cause significant effects in isotopic niche and nutritional status of adult redspotted catshark and may negatively affect its populations.","We are grateful to Mario George-Nascimento for constructive criticism.

Significant sources of geological uncertainty in mine planning include uncertainty in layout of geological domains and uncertainty in metal grades. These two sources of uncertainty cannot be modeled separately because the distribution of the grade is controlled usually by geological domains. Two approaches exist for combining these two sources of uncertainty: the joint simulation approach and the cascade approach. In this paper, these two approaches were compared using a real case study. To this end, uncertainty in iron grade (quantitative variable) and ore zones (qualitative variable) was modeled using both approaches. There were some considerable differences in the results obtained by each approach, which confirm the importance of choosing the most appropriate approach with consideration of the dominate features of a deposit.","The first and third authors are grateful to National Agency for Research and Development of Chile for grants CONICYT/FONDECYT/Nº 3180655 and CONICYT/PIA Project AFB180004, respectively.

Support for spatial contrasts and similarities in oceanographic dynamics comes from earlier work at both extremes of the region. Using a 12 kyr record derived from shell midden archaeological sites around Taltal Chile (25°S), we show that changes in the region are not necessarily consistent with a simple latitudinal gradient. Using δ13C and δ18O isotopic records from archaeological carbonate shells of the keyhole limpet Fissurella maxima we find that cold SST during the Early Holocene was associated with more negative δ13C values in agreement with observations from southern Peru. Warmer waters during the beginning of the Middle Holocene, had positive δ13C values, differentiating them from southern Peru and central-north Chile records. The rest of the Middle Holocene showed a decreasing SST accompanied by negative δ13C values, and after 4000 cal yr BP, the Late Holocene showed a progressive increase in SST and positive δ13C values. Finally, modern carbonate shells of F. maxima indicate a situation not observed throughout the Holocene period: warm SST is associated with negative δ13C values, in line with results on modern shells from southern Peru and modern oceanographic patterns that indicate an intensification of coastal upwelling with events of warm water intrusion. Our results show that the southern coast of the Atacama Desert experienced important fluctuations in SST and upwelling conditions during the Holocene, which may have affected the distribution of nearshore fisheries along the Northern Coast of Chile.","This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT 3170913, 1181300, 1151203) and Millennium nucleus MUSELS and UPWELL funded through ICM.

Additionally, for the DFT calculations, different superstructures were considered as models for TO (SnO2), FTO (Sn36O71F), and EFTO (EuSn35O70F2). Electrical and optical measurements showed that the EFTO films maintain the characteristics of a transparent conducting oxide (TCOs), i.e., high optical transparency and low electrical resistivity (ρ). The plasma wavelength for EFTO thin films was red-shifted when compared to FTO, which is related to the diminishing of free electron density (n e ) and the increase of ρ; such effects were promoted by the incorporation of Eu impurities which act as electron acceptors. Photoluminescence (PL) studies revealed that the EFTO films did not show electronic transitions related to Eu states in the visible part of the spectra (vis). On the other hand, the DFT calculations confirmed the experimental results related to the incorporation of Eu/F impurities in TO, such as cell expansion, the creation of direct bandgap TCOs, the appearance of the Burstein-Moss effect, the absence of emission lines in the vis, and the diminishing of n e due to the presence of Eu acceptor states.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Conacyt, Sener and IER-UNAM for funding through the Mexican Center for Innovation in Solar Energy (CeMIE-Sol), Project P-35.

To measure the impact, a fixed, three-year window of citations was considered for each article. 81% of the articles published appear in JCR journals outside the region, which accumulate 95% of the citations. The results confirm the existence of an accumulate advantage of articles published in JCR journals outside the region. When the number of articles in journals within the LAC region is doubled, the impact only increases 1.41 times. However, when the number of articles in JCR journals outside the region is doubled, the impact increases 3.60 times. The results constitute a warning to the committees of journals in the regions that compete with JCR journals located in the countries with the most developed economies, primarily the USA and the UK.

It is a common fact that COVID19 has brought the entire world to a standstill with most of the services and businesses put on-hold as every country forces its citizens to remain in their households under lockdown in a state of emergency. This paper uses literature to present the arguement that a virtual library service is the main alternative mode of operation that libraries may use to continue rendering their services to their clients. The study discovered that the virtual library is the main alternative in this case where libraries want to help to defeat the coronavirus outbreak and to avoid it from affecting their services to their clients. The study provides a framework for virtual library services that is believed any kind of library may reshape to suit their own environmental needs. Library may in a ways successfully render their services with or without covid 19 pandemic lockdown.

Here, we investigate the trophic impact of two predators of the Chilean rocky subtidal, the fish Graus nigra [F] and the octopus Robsonella fontaniana [O] on their shared prey, the porcelain crab, Petrolisthes violaceus. Manipulative laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate mortality and behavior of porcelain crab in different treatments, including prey alone; prey with single predator ([O] or [F]); and prey with combined predators ([F + F], [O + O], and [O + F]). Different prey densities (N = 3, 9, and 12 individuals) were used to explore density-dependent predation mortality for single and combined predators using an orthogonal (crossed) design that allows to tease apart the effects of predator taxonomic identity from prey density. Behavioral responses of interacting species were registered every 4 h for 2 consecutive days, and were used to identify predator foraging strategies and prey refuge use. Mortality values (proportional prey mortality and predator per capita consumption) were compared among treatments. Results indicated differences in mortality among treatments. The cause of increase of prey proportional mortality was due to an increase in prey availability outside the refuge in fish treatments at high initial prey densities, while it was density independent in octopus’ treatments. Changes in predator per capita consumption were registered depending on the predator combination and the initial prey density. These patterns may reflect contrasting predator foraging strategies and changes in refuge use by porcelain crabs, suggesting effects on prey mortality and predator impacts.","Authors would like to thank V.

Using the properties of the rotation matrix and associated operators, we show that it is possible to find an exact analytical solution to a number of problems where the differential equation of motion depends on the velocity. First, we apply our method to the well-known cases of a particle under the influence of the Lorentz force and Coriolis force, providing the complete analytical solution in each case for the motion of the particle in three dimensions. We also show that the complete solution can be obtained when the centrifugal force is included, showing the applicability to cases where there is simultaneous dependence on the position and velocity.

The main event occurred in the historical earthquake of the Mw 8.5 (1100) rupture zone. To understand and assess the aftershock activity, the Coulomb stress changes (CSC) are modelled along the plate interface. Generally, the magnitude and the number of aftershock activity decrease with time and follow the modified Omori’s law and the magnitude of aftershocks is less than one-unit magnitude and the largest aftershock takes place within 1 week. But the largest aftershock Mw 7.3 occurred on May 12, 2015, in the southeast of the mainshock region of the Gorkha earthquake after 17 days, slightly enhanced CSC region, in the high topographic gradient region in the Indian-Eurasian collision zone. The deviatoric stress ~ 98 MPa per unit area is produced by high gradient of gravitational potential energy (GPE) due to the Mount Everest region and its surrounding facilitates a distinctive aftershock of Mw 7.3 occurred on May 12, 2015, in the east of the mainshock.","The author would like to thank the editor-in-chief for handling the manuscript and anonymous reviewers for their critical comments and constructive suggestions to improve the quality of this manuscript.

The pigeon pea grains were hydrated using 0, 1, 1.5, and 2% m/m NaHCO3 solutions without and with ultrasound assistance (17 W/L; 40 kHz and 43 W/L; 40 kHz) at 27 °C. Cooking process was studied using softening kinetics. Grains were cooked in boiling water and their softening was evaluated with a texturometer. Both hydration and softening kinetics were fitted to suitable models and their parameters were used for evaluating the effect of ultrasound power and salt concentration. Ultrasound accelerated hydration kinetics but did not affect the cooking process. Soaking in NaHCO3 solution, delayed hydration kinetics, but accelerated the softening kinetics. The synergetic effect of ultrasound (17 W/L) and NaHCO3 solution (1% m/m) accelerated both hydration and cooking kinetics by approximately 3 h. In fact, hydration is a long process, which requires more than 6 h, and cooking requires boiling temperature, which increases energy use and cost. Using ultrasound technology and adding sodium bicarbonate in soaking water can improve grain processing. Studying other grains and salts solutions on hydration-cooking process in the future is recommended.",,,LWT,,,,2021-06,2021,,2021-06,144,,111191,Closed,Article,"Vásquez, Upali; Siche, Raúl; Miano, Alberto Claudio","Vásquez, Upali (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo (UNT), Trujillo, Peru); Siche, Raúl (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo (UNT), Trujillo, Peru); Miano, Alberto Claudio (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada Del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)","Vásquez, Upali (National University of Trujillo); Siche, Raúl (National University of Trujillo); Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)",13,9,,2.69,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135781367,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",

Few studies have explored the immune system during the early development of scallops. To gain new insights on this subject, the expression patterns of four genes potentially involved in different phases of A. purpuratus immune response (sensing, signaling, and effectors) were assessed at different larval stages (trochophore, D-veliger, veliger, and pediveliger) and early juveniles from fall and spring spawning seasons. A Toll-like receptor (ApTLR), an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (ApIκB), and two antimicrobial effectors (big defensin ApBD1 and ferritin Apfer1) were measured at each developmental stage. Gene expression was determined from control and challenged pools with V. splendidus VPAP18 (pathogenic strain) after 6, 15, and 24 h. Results revealed that expression patterns of all genes were consistent between the assessed spawning seasons. Regardless of the immune status, transcriptional levels of ApTLR, ApBD1, and Apfer1 gradually increased during ontogeny. ApIkB displayed a contrasted transcriptional pattern, with higher expression in the early ontogenic stages, suggesting its participation in other metabolic processes at earlier stages. Post-Vibrio challenge overexpression was observed mainly in the pediveligers and early juveniles for ApTLR and antimicrobial effectors, with ApBD1 showing the strongest and consistent response. Thus, ApBD1 protein availability was assessed by immunofluorescence. ApBD1 was present on every developmental stage (control and Vibrio challenged), but at a higher level in challenged pediveligers. Overall, results suggest a maturation of the immune system towards the late developmental stages (pediveligers and early juveniles) and a possible parental transfer of ApBD1. The present study contributes to scallop's early ontogeny immunobiology knowledge and for the establishment of the management disease process in hatcheries of A. purpuratus.","We would like to thank Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos of the UCN for providing the infrastructure for carrying out the experiments, especially to German Lira and Daniel Gonzalez for animal maintenance.

Design/methodology/approach Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to assess how the standards improve the importance and usability of the archives. A total of 34 participants were selected to participate in the study; the choice of the population was because they are responsible for records management decisions in various divisions, departments and units. Data was obtained through structured interviews and observation. The study has established that there was much dissonance concerning records and archives management standards. Ethics approval was obtained from both the WITS and the UNIVEN research department. Informed consent was obtained from university staff members.   Findings The research found that only the WITS adopted SANS 15489. This was shown by the availability of a classification system (file plan) and retention schedule while the UNIVEN did not value SANS 15489 standards to manage all records created.   Research limitations/implications Although South Africa has 26 public universities, this study is only confined to the UNIVEN and the WITS. The researcher only focusses on the classification of records and disposal of records elements of SANS 15489.   Practical implications The findings have practical implications in that they can be used for assessing the archives and records management programmes. Other related universities can also use the findings as a reference point in the planning of university archives and records management programmes.   Social implications The findings were to assist the university authorities as decision and policymakers to ensure that records and archives management practices adhere to SANS 15489.   Originality/value Few studies related to the assessment of records management programme in universities in South Africa is not yet fully conducted in South Africa public universities.

King, 1832) at King George Island","Laternula elliptica is a key bivalve species and widely distributed around the Antarctic continent. This bivalve has been the study subject in several studies centered on ecological, physiological, biochemical, and behavioral patterns. However, little is known about the chemistry and the biomechanical properties of the shells of this mollusk. Here, we present the first report of the intra-population variability in the organic composition and mechanical properties of L. elliptica shells. Further, we analyze different morphological traits and their association with the metabolism of a population of L. elliptica from King George Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula. The summer metabolic rates and the hepatosomatic index values indicate good health conditions of this clam’s population. Shell periostracum chemistry is quite similar to bivalves from temperate regions, but the relative amount of protein increased ca. five-fold in shells of L. elliptica. The microhardness is approximately 32% lower than in bivalves from temperate regions. Our characterization of the L. elliptica shells suggests that periostracum chemistry could be specially fitted to avoid shell carbon exposure to dissolution (e.g., in corrosive acidified seawater). In contrast, the reduction in shell hardness may result from prioritizing behavioral (burial) and shell repairing strategies to confront biological (predators) and physical disturbances (e.g., ice scouring). Similar studies in other Antarctic mollusks will help understand the role of shell structure and function in confronting projected climate changes in the Antarctic ocean.","We thank the members of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) station at Professor Escudero for support during the practical aspects of the work.

The tailings are kaolin-quartz and sodium montmorillonite-quartz mixtures in seawater at pH 8 at which all surfaces are anionic. The yield stress of both tailings decays exponentially with the dose of NaPA. Reducing the initial value of yield stress to a preset fraction ( 1 - 1 / e ) requires 52 g/ton NaPA for kaolin-quartz and 31 g/ton NaPA for montmorillonite-quartz tailing. At these dosages, in the linear viscoelastic range, both tailings respond similarly to the presence of NaPA, increasing their liquid-like character and suspension stability. The stabilizing action of NaPA is supported by a slight increase of the negative zeta potential and a clear shift of the particle size distribution to the finer sizes. The underlying stabilizing mechanism involves steric-electrostatic repulsion of the clay particles. These results suggest an alternative to improve the management of clay-rich tailings in processes that use raw seawater at natural pH.",We thank Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015. Ricardo I.

Currently, the soil microbiota and its genomic material (microbiome) have received increasing attention due to their role on sustainable nutrient availability. However, in agroforestry systems, little information is available on the effect of tree cover on natural microbial assemblies and its potential impact on soil health and production. From this perspective, we present the initial and novel results of the metagenomic-based characterization of microbial diversity in the soil of a Nothofagus-based silvopastoral system with three different shade conditions (open, semi open, and semi closed), that were obtained simultaneously by the massive sequencing of ribosomal genes for Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya, and of the ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS3-4) for Fungi. In the temperate SPS, the dominant bacteria phylum was Proteobacteria particularly from the order Rhizobiales, while the fungal community was dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. A low presence of archaea and eukaryotes was also observed. The semi open shade condition exhibited the highest diversity of microorganisms of all the treatments. This condition also promoted a greater specific production of grass. Our preliminary results not only represent the first multi-domain microbial inventory in the study area, but they also highlight the need to consider the microbial assemblies in the design and management of soil-based production systems, and the conservation of biodiversity in ecosystems.","We wish to acknowledge Mr. Cristóbal Fredes, for providing us valuable data on pasture growth and yield.

U kumela not only serves as an aspect of praise to royal leadership but also functions as an addressive device. Zwikumelo (‘referential praises’) often have no definite or rigid pattern and are uncensored. As such, the praise singer may start the way he or she wishes and utter whatever he or she likes. Hence, praise singers often utter somewhat humorous, sarcastic, hyperbolic and senseless phrases and sentences when bestowing honour upon royalty. Undergirded by the theory of ethnopragmatics, this study employs the qualitative method (descriptive and explanatory in nature) with the aim of generating the communicative translations and meanings of zwikumelo in Tshivenḓa culture. Abetted by the author’s intuitive knowledge, this study interpreted zwikumelo in MER Mathivha’s Tshivenḓa play, Mabalanganye. It was found that most zwikumelo in the play ascribe qualities such as immortality, sovereignty, unapproachability, bravery and generosity to the chief or king.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2021-01-02,2021,2021-04-27,2021-01-02,41,1,97-104,Closed,Article,"Sebola, Moffat","Sebola, Moffat (Department of Languages, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, South Africa)","Sebola, Moffat (University of Limpopo)","Sebola, Moffat (University of Limpopo)",3,1,,4.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137569831,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

Information on this host–parasite association is scant. This study describes population and reproductive features of R. overstreeti and its host. A total of 90 (9.97%) out of 903 individuals of C. islagrande collected from Tamiahua lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico, between April 2012 and October 2013, were parasitized by R. overstreeti. Parasite prevalence in male and female ghost shrimps was similar. However, no parasitized ovigerous females of C. islagrande were recorded, suggesting that R. overstreeti is a parasitic castrator. Host and parasite body sizes were positively correlated suggesting early host infestation by parasites and simultaneous growth of the host and parasite. Parasitic isopods frequently inhabited the same branchial chamber (n = 77) of ghost shrimps as adult male-female pairs. Females were occasionally found with supernumerary juveniles and cryptoniscus larvae in the same host individual, and rarely solitarily. Furthermore, the body size of paired adult male and female parasites was tightly correlated suggesting long-term ‘social’ monogamy in R. overstreeti. Fecundity in R. overstreeti varied between 1668 and 9884 embryos female−1 and increased with female body size.","The authors express their gratitude to Blanca Jaimes, Hugo Reyes and Luis Díaz for their support and enthusiasm during fieldwork; to R.

Interval sampling was used to select 385 articles that were published between 1993 and 2018. The results show that, overall, White male scholars dominated publications and nearly two in five articles originated from one university. A statistically significant shift featured in publications from Black male and female researchers, as well as articles from marginalized universities, although these changes only occurred towards the end of the study period. The study further confirms racial homogeneity in multi-authored publications, and that men are mostly responsible for quantitative research articles.

An economic assessment of PM2.5 concentration across Chilean communes,"Abstract  This paper addresses a serious environmental concern in Chile: PM 2.5 concentration, a health threat especially affecting the population living in the central and southern communes of Chile. Using housing data for 312 spatial units, along with interpolation techniques to predict air pollution for communes with missing information, we find that, on average, 1 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 produces a decrease of 4.1 per cent in housing rental prices. These estimates also show an important upward bias in the estimated coefficient when the endogeneity of air pollution is not addressed. An average Chilean household would be willing to pay US$12.31 per month for a one-unit reduction in PM 2.5 concentration. Similar monetary values have been found in previous studies for both México and Chile. As with PM 2.5 concentration, the average marginal willingness to pay exhibits marked differences across communes. From these results, the study addresses some policy implications and proposes avenues for future research.",The authors acknowledge financial support from CONICYT/Chilean Fondecyt 11170018 ‘City differences in the return to schooling’.,,Environment and Development Economics,,,,2021-01-08,2021,2021-01-08,2021-08,26,4,364-380,Closed,Article,"Gómez, Katty; Iturra, Victor","Gómez, Katty (Department of Economics-IDEAR, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Iturra, Victor (Department of Economics-IDEAR, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Gómez, Katty (Catholic University of the North)","Gómez, Katty (Catholic University of the North); Iturra, Victor (Catholic University of the North)",5,3,,2.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134452926,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
239,pub.1139172039,10.1016/j.mineng.2021.107033,,,Classification of indicators measuring environmental sustainability of mining and processing of copper,"In recent years, the demand for copper has increased considerably due to population growth, economic development, and the transition of the power sector to sustainable energy. Increases in copper production created an additional pressure on the environment resulting in a need for accurate assessment of environmental sustainability of copper extraction. However, environmental sustainability evaluation remains a challenge since it begins with the selection of methods and metrics used to measure it at different space scales and in different time periods, which it is not a trivial task. One alternative solution consists in using environmental sustainability indicators (ESIs), which provide clear and precise information about the conditions, trends, and changes in the environment. The growing importance of environmental sustainability resulted in emergence of huge number of indicators. The abundance of ESIs makes their use a quite challenging task. This research systematizes and analyzes a set of environmental sustainability indicators used to evaluate the environmental performance of copper production systems. The proposed methodology uses a systematic content analysis focused on the identification of environmental sustainability indicators intended to evaluate the performance of copper production systems. Classification of the main ESI characteristics identified in the references was carried out based on four general dimensions: 1) categories of environmental sustainability; 2) method/ technique used to calculate the indicator; 3) spatial and temporal scales used to quantify the indicator; and 4) types of data sources used to calculate the indicator. A total of 95 indicators were identified and results of the analysis show that the indicators related to energy and water consumption category are used the most often. Besides, we observed a clear tendency to use methodological approaches such as the life cycle assessment and eco-efficiency framework. The “present” timescale, along with the “global” spatial scale, was identified as the most frequent temporal scale analyzed in the documents.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2021-08,2021,,2021-08,170,,107033,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, Marcelo; Negrete, Moira; Herrera-León, Sebastian; Kraslawski, Andrzej","Fuentes, Marcelo (Departamento Gestión de la Construcción, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Negrete, Moira (Departamento Gestión de la Construcción, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Herrera-León, Sebastian (Departamento Ingeniería Quimíca, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; School of Engineering Sciences, Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM), Lappeenranta University of Technology, P.O.

However, they have focused on non-indigenous youth and have scarcely addressed the needs of those belonging to ethnic minorities, particularly in Latin America. The aim of this study was to assess the mediating relationship of resilience on the association between ethnic identity and life satisfaction in Aymara adolescents. Methods 968 students from 11 to 18 years old participated, from Public Schools in the city of Arica, Chile. To measure the variables in this study, the Satisfaction with Life Scale-Child (SWLS-C), the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12) and the Multi-Group Ethnic Scale (MEIM) were used. Results Although Aymara and non-Aymara students did not show significant differences in Resilience and Life Satisfaction scores, they did show differences in their ethnic identity scores (t = 6.08; p = 0.00), with Aymara students manifesting behavioral statements closer to a moratorium on ethnic identity. This study also provided evidence of the possible mediating relationship of resilience in the association between ethnic identity and life satisfaction (r = 0.211, CI = 0.132–0.293; p = 0.000). Conclusion It seems that strengthening ethnic identity and resilience strategies could increase students' life satisfaction.

Motivated by their socio-ecological importance, unique landscape qualities, and increasing vulnerability, scholars have developed a rich research agenda to better understand this ecosystem. We conducted an analysis of the various frameworks used to study bofedales through a systematic review of 119 key academic publications. We observed a range of bofedal naming terminologies, definitions, and descriptions of key threats that sometimes aligned with disciplinary, geographic, or linguistic distinctions between studies. Notably, though the majority of papers employed natural science methods, the social science and multidisciplinary studies were more likely to discuss the role of local communities in helping manage these ecosystems, though many researchers also highlighted the need for further study of these dynamics. This analysis, therefore, demonstrates the need to develop research modalities that are rooted in local contexts and which employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate and elucidate the complex human-environment dynamics that characterize these ecosystems. By documenting, we aim to support more robust research collaborations and to inform the development of research and conservation agendas that effectively support these landscapes and the myriad socio-ecological services they provide.",,,Wetlands,,,,2021-10-27,2021,2021-10-27,2021-12,41,8,102,Closed,Article,"White-Nockleby, Caroline; Prieto, Manuel; Yager, Karina; Meneses, Rosa Isela","White-Nockleby, Caroline (Program in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology & Society (HASTS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 70 Memorial Dr., 02142, Cambridge, MA, USA); Prieto, Manuel (Departamento de Ciencias Históricas y Geográficas, Universidad de Tarapacá, Av. 18 de Septiembre, 2222, Arica, Chile); Yager, Karina (School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University, 145 Endeavour, 11790, Stony Brook, NY, USA); Meneses, Rosa Isela (Programa de Doctorado en Antropología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Le Paige 380, 1410000, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)","Prieto, Manuel (University of Tarapacá)","White-Nockleby, Caroline (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Prieto, Manuel (University of Tarapacá); Yager, Karina (Stony Brook University); Meneses, Rosa Isela (Catholic University of the North)",9,7,,1.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142214831,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,

This syndrome may lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and increased academic dropout. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions to prevent it. The aim of this longitudinal study was to identify factors that may reduce students’ burnout and foster their well-being, and upon which effective interventions can be developed.MethodsA total of 1,117 medical students from eight Chilean universities were asked to complete a set of validated scales in 2015 and 2 years later, in 2017. The measures included distress, burnout, positive mental health, academic engagement, and dispositional mindfulness. Using logistic regressions and a two-wave latent change score model, the predictive power of these variables on burnout and flourishing (an optimal state of mental health) was studied, as well as their covariance across time.ResultsIn total, 639 (57.2%) students answered the questionnaires in T1 and T2; 54.4% reported burnout in T1 and 56.2% in T2. Levels of dispositional mindfulness (the ability to pay attention to one’s sensations, thoughts, and emotions in everyday life) predicted lower probabilities of burning out at 2 years, whereas having experienced burnout in T1 doubled these odds. Dispositional mindfulness, academic engagement, and flourishing at T1 predicted greater odds of flourishing 2 years later, while depression decreased these odds.ConclusionsDispositional mindfulness was the most powerful predictive factor of students’ burnout and flourishing. As dispositional mindfulness can be nurtured through practice, incorporating mindfulness training into undergraduate medical programs may help reduce burnout and promote students’ well-being as health professionals.",We thank all faculty and students who took part in this study.,,Mindfulness,,,,2021-10-19,2021,2021-10-19,2022-01,13,1,112-122,Closed,Article,"Zúñiga, Denisse; Torres-Sahli, Manuel; Rigotti, Attilio; Pedrals, Nuria; Echeverría, Guadalupe; Padilla, Oslando; Lagos, Alejandra; McColl, Peter; Trucco, Olivia; Cisternas, Marcela; González, Carolina; Bogado, Justo; Moraga, Ana María; Altamirano, Patricio; Durán, Esperanza; Mansilla, Marcela; Berríos, Carolina; Epstein, Ronald; Bitran, Marcela","Zúñiga, Denisse (Centro de Educación Médica y Ciencias de la Salud, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago, Chile); Torres-Sahli, Manuel (Centro de Educación Médica y Ciencias de la Salud, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago, Chile); Rigotti, Attilio (Departamento de Nutrición, Diabetes y Metabolismo, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Pedrals, Nuria (Departamento de Nutrición, Diabetes y Metabolismo, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Echeverría, Guadalupe (Departamento de Nutrición, Diabetes y Metabolismo, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Padilla, Oslando (Departamento de Salud Pública, Escuela de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Lagos, Alejandra (Departamento de Medicina Familiar, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); McColl, Peter (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Andrés Bello, Viña del Mar, Chile); Trucco, Olivia (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile); Cisternas, Marcela (Escuela de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); González, Carolina (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Los Andes, Santiago, Chile); Bogado, Justo (Departamento de Nefrología, Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Sede Oriente, Santiago, Chile); Moraga, Ana María (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile); Altamirano, Patricio (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile); Durán, Esperanza (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile); Mansilla, Marcela (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca, Chile); Berríos, Carolina (Departamento de Psiquiatría, Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Mayor, Santiago, Chile); Epstein, Ronald (School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA); Bitran, Marcela (Centro de Educación Médica y Ciencias de la Salud, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago, Chile)","Bitran, Marcela (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)","Zúñiga, Denisse (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Torres-Sahli, Manuel (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Rigotti, Attilio (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Pedrals, Nuria (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Echeverría, Guadalupe (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Padilla, Oslando (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Lagos, Alejandra (Catholic University of the North); McColl, Peter (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Andrés Bello, Viña del Mar, Chile); Trucco, Olivia (Universidad del Desarrollo); Cisternas, Marcela (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); González, Carolina (Universidad de Los Andes, Chile); Bogado, Justo (University of Chile); Moraga, Ana María (University of Concepción); Altamirano, Patricio (Austral University of Chile); Durán, Esperanza (Catholic University of the Maule); Mansilla, Marcela (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Berríos, Carolina (Universidad Mayor); Epstein, Ronald (University of Rochester); Bitran, Marcela (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",12,10,,4.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142004592,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being
238,pub.1141108987,10.1002/aqc.3717,,,"Phylogeography and demographic inference of the endangered sei whale, with implications for conservation","Abstract     The sei whale ( Balaenoptera  borealis  ) presents a disjointed geographic distribution. Significant genetic divergence between sei whales from the North Atlantic (NA) and North Pacific (NP) have been recorded; however, limited samples from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) have precluded a global analysis.    The largest recorded mass mortality event occurred in Golfo de Penas, southern Chile, providing a primary source of SH samples. A global mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic study was undertaken including 111 SH samples (98 from Golfo de Penas), and new sequences from the NP.    A marked phylogeographic structure was observed between the three ocean basins' populations, with the highest Φ ST values between NA–NP and NA–SH, and a lower but still significant value between SH–NP. This structure, and the haplotype distribution pattern, suggest a more recent separation between SH–NP and an absence of recurrent gene flow among all three populations. Only one potential migratory event was detected from SH to NA.    These results support an ongoing phylogeographic differentiation between all populations, highlighting the identity of each and the importance of independent management. Therefore, each population should represent a separate management unit, which is important in the development of conservation strategies.   Demographic analyses detected a recent reduction of population size in the SH and NA, but not in the NP. For all populations, estimated effective population sizes were higher than estimated census sizes. This suggests that most of the genetic diversity of pre‐whaling populations is still retained; however, continued reduction in population sizes could lead to future loss of genetic diversity.   This study highlights the necessity of local protection and systematic monitoring of the Golfo de Penas sei whale population. In such a remote area the use of remote sensing techniques could be a cost‐effective option for evaluating the threat, periodicity and magnitude of mortalities and their effect on the local whale population. The integration of genetic and demographic approaches improves the understanding of the dynamics of populations, which is particularly useful in endangered species.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank all of the colleagues who assisted with the collection of samples during Chilean Navy surveys to the Golfo de Penas.

238,pub.1142488519,10.1002/lno.11969,,,At the mercy of the winds: The seasonal dynamics of floating and stranded seaweeds at mid‐latitudes,"Abstract  Many seaweed species are particularly important for passive marine dispersal, yet relatively little is known about their floating and stranding dynamics. Here, we studied these dynamics for two kelp species over four consecutive years at mid‐latitudes (30°S). Floating kelps were found during all seasons, but Macrocystis pyrifera was always more abundant than Durvillaea incurvata . Highest floating biomasses were reached during summer and fall, whereas considerable stranded biomasses on nearby shores were only observed during summer. The proportion of fragments among the floating kelps was high throughout the entire study period and highest for M. pyrifera during summer. At the same time, blades of M. pyrifera that floated in nearshore waters in summer had a high blade index and thus were intact (i.e., not yet compromised by unfavorable environmental conditions). These results suggest that during summer, floating kelps become quickly resupplied from benthic sources, which compensates their frequent losses due to degradation and stranding. During fall, biomasses of floating kelps remain high because of reduced losses. Interestingly, increased wind speed was a good predictor for the biomass accumulations of the two kelp species, although the floating biomass of M. pyrifera was additionally influenced by oceanographic fronts. Our findings suggest that at mid‐latitudes the dynamics of floating seaweed stocks are dependent on the availability of benthic source populations (continuous throughout the year) and export due to degradation (high in summer/fall) and stranding (high in summer).",Acknowledgments We thank the members of the BEDIM lab and the crewmembers of R/V Stella Maris II for their help during the field surveys.

238,pub.1138946447,10.1002/rra.3823,,,"Assessment of a conservative mixing model for the evaluation of constituent behavior below river confluences, Elqui River Basin, Chile","Abstract  Fate and transport modeling of water‐borne contaminants is a data demanding and costly endeavor, requiring considerable expertise. As such, it becomes important to know when a complex modeling approach is required, and when a simpler approach is adequate. This is the main objective herein, where a conservative mixing model is used to characterize the transport of As, Cu, Fe, and SO 4 . The study area is divided into three sectors, corresponding to the upstream, middle, and downstream portions of the Elqui River Basin, Chile. In Sector 1, acidic conditions result in the conservative transport of constituents that are sourced from acid rock drainage. In Sector 2, pH increases and transport is influenced by pH‐dependent reactions and the subsequent settling of the particulate phase. In Sector 3, there are no additional constituent inputs, and the constituents are conservatively transported downstream. Conservative transport within Sector 3 is confirmed through the development of a regression model that provides monthly estimates of SO 4 load. Whereas SO 4 and Cu concentrations are adequately approximated by the conservative mixing model, estimates of As and Fe concentrations exhibit larger errors, due to the more reactive behavior of these constituents. The fact that the simple, conservative mixing model describes SO 4 transport is a valuable result, as this constituent is known to be one of the primary indicators of mining‐related contamination in rivers. The approach could also be a useful starting point for further evaluations of the effects of climate change and hydrological variability on the water quality of rivers.","This research was funded by ANID/FONDECYT/1180153, and ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

238,pub.1135339950,10.1002/aqc.3497,,,Comparing the stability of successional transient models in kelp forests and barrens (south‐east Pacific): Implications for conservation monitoring,"Abstract    Ecological stability based on statistical variability was contrasted with the asymptotical local stability of transient states during successional changes in community structure in kelp forests and barren grounds.   Simplified semi‐quantitative ecological models with different levels of complexity were constructed to represent transient successional states in kelp and barrens, and Routh–Hurwitz's criteria and Levins' criterion of local stability were also estimated.   The results suggest that ecological stability based on statistical variation does not match local (mathematical) stability, since although successional changes in kelp exhibited less variability (measured as percentage coefficient of variation), barren beds were more locally stable. The local stability criteria used in the current work could be a suitable technique for evaluating the likelihood of transient ecological states to resist or change, since it considers states at equilibrium to maintain their properties only against small disturbances.   These outcomes are relevant because the natural alternation between kelp and barrens could be disrupted by the intensive harvest of kelp species carried out over the last 10 years on the central‐north Chilean coast and in other temperate ecosystems.   Additionally, the negative effects of harvesting kelp species could have a synergetic relationship with other drivers such as climate change and coastal pollution. Thus, strict policy managements to limit the kelp harvest are deeply encouraged. A monitoring programme for assessing the current conditions of benthic–pelagic ecosystems along the Chilean coast is also required.",The authors thank the comments and suggestions of anonymous reviewers who considerably increased the manuscript quality.,,Aquatic Conservation Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,,,,2021-02-13,2021,2021-02-13,2021-06,31,6,1297-1310,Closed,Article,"Ortiz, Marco; Uribe, Roberto A.","Ortiz, Marco (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Instituto Antofagasta, Instituto de Ciencias Naturales AvH, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar y Recursos Biológicos, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Uribe, Roberto A.

Seawater was found to be a promising alternative, but it may pose significant operational challenges, for example, when it needs to be recovered from the tailings in thickening stages for subsequent recycling. This is mainly explained by the high saline environment and colloidal magnesium precipitates that are generated at highly alkaline conditions. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the affinity of the flocculant with colloidal magnesium precipitates and the main minerals that make up a mining tailing such as quartz and kaolinite. The results are contrasted with the in-situ characterization of aggregates through the Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM). Through X-ray diffraction, it was found that the magnesium precipitates are mainly composed of brucite crystals. The MD results allowed to explain the experimental results, mainly when solid magnesium precipitates appear at high pH, where the flocculant loses its effectiveness sharply. This is related to the undesired association among the flocculant with brucite. The adsorption is mainly carried out by the interaction between the deprotonated oxygen from the acrylic group of the polymer and the oxygen from the hydroxide of the brucite surface. There is also a significant contribution of hydrogen bonding between nitrogen from the acrylamide group and oxygen from the hydroxide.",We thank Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015. Ricardo I.

In particular, in the scalar–tensor Action Integral, we introduce the æther field with æther coefficients to be functions of the scalar field. This cosmological model extends previous studies on Lorentz-violating theories. For a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker background space, we write the field equations which are of second order with dynamical variables the scale factor and the scalar field. The physical evolution of the field equations depends upon three unknown functions which are related to the scalar–tensor coupling function, the scalar field potential, and the æther coefficient functions. We investigate the existence of analytic solutions for the field equations and the integrability properties according to the existence of linear in the momentum conservation laws. We define a new set of variables in which the dynamical evolution depends only upon the scalar field potential. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior and the cosmological history are investigated where we find that the theory provides inflationary eras similar to that of scalar–tensor theory but with Lorentz-violating terms provided by the æther field. Finally, in the new variables, we found that the field equations are integrable due to the existence of nonlocal conservation laws for arbitrary functional forms of the three free functions.","This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number 131604).

One primary criticism focuses on the artificiality of the results derived from its internal structure because of the ipsative nature of the forced-choice format. This study seeks to contribute to the resolution of this debate. A short version of Kolb’s LSI with a forced-choice format and an additional inventory scored on a Likert scale was completed by a sample of students of the University Católica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile. The data obtained from the two forms of the reduced version of the LSI were compared using principal component analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and the Thurstonian Item Response Theory model. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of four learning mode dimensions. However, they do not support the existence of the learning styles as proposed by Kolb, indicating that said reports are the product of the artificial structure generated by the ipsative forced-choice format .",,"FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article was financially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnológico of Chile, FONDECYT 11150182.",Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment,,,,2021-03-27,2021,2021-03-27,2021-08,39,5,593-609,Closed,Article,"Carvajal, Carlos Calderón; Gómez, Carmen Ximénez; Lay-Lisboa, Siu; Briceño, Mauricio","Carvajal, Carlos Calderón (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez, Carmen Ximénez (Faculty of Psychology, Autonomous University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain); Lay-Lisboa, Siu (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Briceño, Mauricio (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Carvajal, Carlos Calderón (Catholic University of the North)","Carvajal, Carlos Calderón (Catholic University of the North); Gómez, Carmen Ximénez (Autonomous University of Madrid); Lay-Lisboa, Siu (Catholic University of the North); Briceño, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North)",4,3,,1.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136724098,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology,

An economic assessment of the effects of air pollution on individual subjective well-being in Chile","Air pollution represents a serious environmental concern in both developed and developing nations, with harmful effects on human health and populations’ well-being. The literature documenting this topic focuses mainly on developed countries and has limited evidence in the Latin American context. This paper assesses the impact of particulate matter on Chile’s individual subjective well-being. It uses individual self-reported measures of subjective well-being along with interpolation techniques to obtain the particulate matter measurements of 305 Chilean cities in 2013. Using an instrumental variables strategy, the main findings indicate that air pollution decreases people’s well-being. Its negative effect is robust to several specifications and becomes larger when the parameters’ potential bias is reduced. On average, Chileans are willing to pay 7.46–11.98 USD per month to improve their air quality. The results are also valuable for policy makers, helping them to justify implementing policies aimed at controlling industrial emissions and traffic congestion and increasing the number of monitoring stations across Chile.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of CONICYT/Chilean Fondecyt 11170018: “City Differences in the Return to Schooling.” They would also like to thank the anonymous journal referees for their very helpful suggestions.,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,289,,125152,Closed,Article,"Ahumada, Gustavo; Iturra, Victor","Ahumada, Gustavo (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Iturra, Victor (IDEAR, Department of Economics, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Ahumada, Gustavo (Catholic University of the North)","Ahumada, Gustavo (Catholic University of the North); Iturra, Victor (Catholic University of the North)",26,14,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132676217,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

However, the performance of resource peripheries has remained unsatisfactory, also because numerous economic activities are concentrated in ‘gateways’ – that is, cities that interlink other places globally. Gateways appear to prosper at the expense of peripheral locations, whose role in the corresponding networks is reduced to basic functions. To guarantee better development outcomes for resource peripheries, an increasing number of scholars call for strict legislation on local content. The article engages with this literature. It analyses the interplay of Buenos Aires with the provinces of Neuquén and Río Negro, where large oil and gas deposits are exploited. Buenos Aires bundles especially corporate control and research-intensive activities, but there are several other obstacles to peripheral development. Local content policy is largely inadequate to solve these problems, as firms from the resource periphery still fail to upgrade to higher value-added tasks and jobs created by extractive industries are not sustainable. Skilled employees reject moving to peripheral locations. The business environment there is not suitable for corporate control.",The author is grateful to Raúl Vila for the support provided during the field research.,,Applied Geography,,,,2021-10,2021,,2021-10,135,,102554,Closed,Article,"Scholvin, Sören","Scholvin, Sören (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Scholvin, Sören (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140870579,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

However, this fruit is very perishable, which impairs its exploration and study. This work reported the convective drying of cambuci for the first time, as an approach to achieve stability. Moreover, it also evaluated for the first time the combination of ethanol and freezing pretreatments to convective drying. Pretreatments were performed by immersion of fresh and previously frozen and thawed cambuci slices in ethanol (5 min at 25°C). Pretreated samples were then convectively dried (50°C, 1 m/s). Drying time was reduced up to ~36% by combining the pretreatments, which was associated with the reduction in the external resistance to mass transfer, once the convective mass transfer coefficient increased up to 94%. In contrast, pretreatments that include freezing had a greater influence on reducing the internal resistance to mass transfer, increasing the effective diffusive coefficient. In addition, the thermal surface profile evidenced the temperature increased faster and reached high levels in pretreatments that include freezing, which could be correlated to their higher drying rates and structure modifications. The obtained results corroborate the modifications produced by freezing and the effects of ethanol on the surface of samples significantly accelerate the convective drying of cambuci.   Practical Applications The present investigation shows that convective drying is a feasible alternative for cambuci processing. Further, being this fruit very perishable, with short harvest and production far from the markets, freezing is a common practice to preserve them in the farms. Consequently, the impact of this unit operation was also evaluated. In addition, the proposed pretreatments (freezing and ethanol) have great application potential to improve the conventional convective drying of fruits. It has been shown that the combination of pretreatments accelerated drying, reducing the processing time by 36%.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research foundation (FAPESP, Brazil): projects n° 2014/12606‐3 and 2019/05043‐6; GR Carvalho post‐doctoral fellowship (2018/17844‐0); the “Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)”: BO Gomes (88887.485030/2020‐00), JS Guedes (88887.513566/2020‐00) and KC Santos (88882.378385/2019‐01) M.Sc. and Ph.D. Scholarships; the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil): BS Bitencourt (132297/2019‐1) M.Sc.

These materials are known to have a wide range of applications due to the outstanding optoelectronic, magnetic, and thermal properties that their scale provides. However, one of the current challenges associated with nanotechnology lies in how nanomaterials are generated. Within the new synthesis trends, biological routes have been proposed as an alternative that requires less polluting organic solvents and less energy consumption. The biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles is a Bottom-up method that requires precursors, which have mostly been described as pure solutions. However, in the present work and approaching the concept of ‘Bionanomining’, the use of a real effluent obtained from the leaching of sulfide ore tailings is studied for the biosynthesis of copper nanoparticles. For this purpose, the bacterial biomass of Pseudomonas stutzeri was used as a bioreducing agent. The leaching of the chalcopyrite-bearing tailings achieved a copper recovery of 50% in 8 h, thanks to sodium nitrate that acted as an oxidizing agent. The copper concentration was increased by solvent extraction, allowing a solution of 700 mg/L of copper to be achieved. In the biosynthesis of nanoparticles, the experiments were carried out at room temperature and pressure for 48 h, using two different copper precursor solutions. In the first stage, a pure solution was used to determine an adequate copper concentration and biomass dosage, which were 381 mg/L and 1050 mg, respectively. In an advanced approach, the solution obtained from the treated tailings was employed for the biosynthesis, obtaining nanoparticles in the two resulting streams: a solid dead biomass and sodium sulfate solution with 2.7% and 0.27% copper nanoparticles, respectively. These nanoparticles are spherical and with a size between 1 and 2 nm.","The authors thank ANID for the support by the PhD scholarship 21190433 and FONDECYT 11170616.

The labour reform states that firms must share profits with their employees when they have more than 20 fixed employees at the end of the year. This discontinuity provides an exogenous source of variation below and above the threshold and allows to implement a quasi-experimental method. At firm level, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) provided the data called the Annual Economic Survey (AES). The main findings of this study were that this law reduces the return on investment of a firm due to rent sharing, which implies that they make less investment and hire more non-permanent employees (not mandatory rent sharing), which decreases the level of productivity across firms. Therefore, according to regression discontinuity and difference in difference approaches, it is estimated that the labour reform policy reduced investment by 16.4% and 15.6%, respectively, given the cut-off threshold of 20 employees. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect on temporary employees induces firms to hire an average differential of temporary employees ranging from 14 to 40% among firms with more than 20 employees instead of less than 20 employees.",,,Journal of Industrial and Business Economics,,,,2021-09-07,2021,2021-09-07,2022-06,49,2,313-334,Closed,Article,"Tolentino, Edinson","Tolentino, Edinson (Economia and Negocios Internacionales, Universidad Privada del Norte, Andres Belaunde Avenure, Comas, Peru)","Tolentino, Edinson (Private University of the North)","Tolentino, Edinson (Private University of the North)",2,2,,1.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140944270,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Drew & R.Ross: characterization of biomass and production of exopolysaccharides,"Microalgae are successfully adapted to different environments where they metabolize inorganic and, in some cases, organic compounds. The modification of culture conditions can induce the synthesis of exopolysaccharides with potential health benefits. This study aims to adapt the autotrophic culture of the red alga Porphyridium purpureum to a heterotrophic culture in order to compare the biochemical composition of biomass and the production of exopolysaccharides (EPS). The adaptation of autotrophic to heterotrophic culture was carried out by progressively reducing the photoperiod and adding glucose. EPS extraction and purification were carried out. EPS were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antioxidant capacity of both biomasses was analyzed by the 2,2′-azino-bis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) method and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Results for both biomass and EPS showed significant differences in biochemical composition and antioxidant activity under the two growing conditions. Furthermore, the heterotrophic EPS (HT-EPS) seems to favor the accumulation of glucuronic acid. Our results are the first adaptation from autotrophic to heterotrophic culture of P. purpureum. These trophic variations show that P. purpureum can adapt to heterotrophic culture and present interesting differences in its biochemical composition, being an alternative in the increase of metabolites, mainly carbon compounds, of interest to the industry.","We want to thank Cell Culture Unit of the SCAI (Central Research Support Service) of the University of Malaga, for the technical assistance in the use of the laboratory.

These periods shortly enhanced vegetation growth and microbial activity, which must have utilized major nutrients such as phosphorus (P). However, any biological cycling of P involves an oxygen exchange with water, which should now reside in the hyperarid soils as tracer of life. In order to identify such evidences, we performed sequential P fractionation and analyzed the oxygen isotope composition of HCl-extractable phosphate (δ 18OHCl–P) in the surface soil (0–15 cm) of a climatic gradient along the rising alluvial fans of the Central Depression to the Precordillera, Chile. At the driest sites, the δ 18OHCl-P values were constant with depth and deviated from biologically-driven isotopic equilibrium. In contrast, we observed a considerable increase of δ 18OHCl-P values below the soil surface at less arid sites, where some isotope values were even within the range of full isotopic equilibrium with biologically cycled phosphate. For the latter sites, this points to most efficient biological P cycling right below the uppermost surface of the desert.

We used data on beached seabirds reported by news media to depict spatial and temporal patterns of fishery-related seabird mortality and correlated these data with the spatial and temporal fishing effort of the three main purse-seine fleets operating in south-central Chile (33 to 40°S). Between 2005 and 2019 we detected 97 mortality events reporting >19,000 beached seabirds attributed to bycatch. Mortality was recorded between 18 and 53° S (~3800 km of coastline), affecting 16 seabird species, with 90% concentrated between 33 and 40°S (800 km), exactly where purse-seine fleets operate. Sooty shearwater (Ardenna grisea) comprised 70% of all dead birds recorded. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) and guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax boungainvillii) were also affected. Mortality events of Sooty shearwaters was highest (P < 0.001) between February and May (54%) and October–November (36%), coinciding with the timing of the species migratory movements; shearwater mortality was particularly high at 36–37°S (50%) and 39–40°S (36%). Sooty shearwater mortality presented a very high spatial overlap (93%) and significant temporal correlation (0.64) with combined industrial and artisanal purse-seine fishing effort targeting on Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) and Araucanian herring (Strangomera bentincki). Our study shows when and where seabirds are more susceptible to mortality due to interactions with fisheries along the Chilean coast. This information could be used by authorities to regulate the fishing activity and focus conservation efforts to the most affected species at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales.","The following people provided information on seabird mortalities: R.

225,pub.1139183719,10.1111/bre.12580,,,Contraction and exhumation of the western Central Andes induced by basin inversion: New evidence from “Pampean” subduction segment,"Abstract In this study, we conducted an integrated analysis supported by previous regional and mesoscopic field observations, new U–Pb chronological data of synorogenic deposits and thermochronological data from syncontractional granitic rocks. The objective is understanding the main mechanism and timing of crustal uplift of the western Central Andes on the modern flat‐slab segment of northern Chile. The first‐order structural styles identified in several basins of northern Chile consisted mostly of large reverse‐reactivated Mesozoic normal faults, which formed large kilometer‐scale inverted anticlines and localized doubly verging basement reverse faults depending on the degree of tectonic inversion. The observations indicate that crustal shortening experienced in the region was distributed along with the pre‐orogenic half‐graben structures of the Triassic to Jurassic basement. The wide distribution of Upper Cretaceous–Paleocene synorogenic deposits over the syn‐rift Mesozoic deposits along inverted structures in both the Coastal and Frontal cordilleras indicate that the Andean orogenesis in the region was initiated during this period. Our field and geochronological interpretations suggest that basin inversion of the ancient Mesozoic half‐graben structures was frequently accompanied by the emplacement of Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene intrusive granitic bodies hosted in the core of the anticline and syncline folds. Their crystallization ages correlated with those reported by the synorogenic deposits, thereby suggesting that both basin inversion and magmatism occurred simultaneously. The thermal history of the intrusives also indicates that they were rapidly exhumed at 53‒57 Ma, possibly during the final episodes of the basin inversion.","This work was funded by the Fondecyt‐Chile research project “The crustal structure and timing of deformation along the Chilean flat‐slab subduction segment (27°–29°S), Central Andes” (grant 3140557).

Programmatic actors in the chilean and colombian policies of quality assurance in higher education,"Abstract Based on the Programmatic Action Framework (PAF), this article presents a comparative analysis of the Chilean and Colombian policies of quality assurance (QA) in higher education. Despite their instrumental commonalities, these policies actually reflect two contrasting approaches to quality: a flexible approach in Chile versus an excellence‐oriented approach in Colombia. The article shows that both policies were initially developed by groups of prestigious academics who shared most of the features of programmatic elites and that the contrast between the approaches to quality arises from the divergent evolution of the policy program of these groups: The policy of QA was subjected to an instrumental layering in Chile while, in Colombia, it followed a path‐dependent evolution. The study shows that sociological perspectives like the PAF can provide a more complete and dynamic understanding of the Evaluative State that takes into account the instrumental and the social dimensions of quality‐related activities.
Resumen Basado en el Marco de Acción Programática (PAF), este artículo presenta un análisis comparativo de las políticas chilenas y colombianas de aseguramiento de la calidad (QA) en la educación superior.

El artículo muestra que ambas políticas fueron desarrolladas inicialmente por élites programáticas formadas por prestigiosos académicos que compartían un programa de políticas común, y que los enfoques contrastantes de la calidad de estas políticas surgen de las evoluciones divergentes de los programas de política originales: la política de GC fue objeto a una estratificación instrumental en Chile mientras que, en Colombia, siguió una evolución dependiente de la trayectoria.

In these approaches, the geochemical elements are usually the sole quantitative variables used as inputs for geochemical population recognition. This means that the presence of other qualitative variables, such as geological information, is overlooked in the analysis. Hierarchical clustering, as an unsupervised machine learning method, is a common approach for dimensional reduction in the analysis of geochemical data. In this study, an alternative to this technique, known as geostatistical hierarchical clustering (GHC), is applied to identify geochemical populations in 3D in the Bondar Hanza copper porphyry deposit, Iran. In this paradigm, the qualitative geological variables can also be incorporated for geochemical population identification, in addition to qualitative geochemical elements. In this study, an innovative solution is presented to tune the weighting parameters of each variable in GHC, based on the associations that the clusters (i.e., geochemical populations) should have with the geological information. The results are compared with k-means and number–size fractal/multifractal (N–S) methods. As a result, GHC showed better agreement with alterations, rock types, and mineralization zones in this deposit.

                    This study measures the influence of educational programs oriented toward entrepreneurship (POE) on the prediction of the entrepreneurial intention (EI) of university students, based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB).
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/focus
                    The sample contains a total of 4,697 answers from university students, obtained through the 2018 Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey (GUESSS) project. A model of structural equations was used.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results show that educational POE have an impact on EI, mediated by the perceived university environment (UE) and entrepreneurial skills (ES). In addition, it was confirmed that the variable that best explains EI is the attitude toward entrepreneurship (ATE), followed by perceived behavioral control (PBC); these two variables are able to mediate the effect of subjective norm (SN) on EI.

Nevertheless, there is almost no information regarding their hydrogeological structure and functioning. This paper aims to characterize the thickness of the alluvial filling of one peat-accumulating wetland in North-Central Chile using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to assess its role as a water reservoir. To develop a quasi-3D understanding of the peatland’s structure, four ERT profiles were conducted. Results highlight a conductive basin shape of the peatland, with a thicker interface downstream than upstream between alluvial materials and the underlying bedrock or rock screes. Those results allow the estimate of the water column (1000–3400 mm) within the peatland alluvial filling. The second objective is to better understand the water exchanges between the peatland and the streamflow using discharge measurements and water stable isotopes. Water and isotopes budgets highlight a streamflow loss towards the peatland groundwater reservoir at the end of spring season. In addition, ten δ18O and δ2H surveys were used to characterize the distinct wetland water sources and their temporal variations. A peatland conceptual model is proposed to connect groundwater, rock glaciers, snowmelt, and hillslope flows. Andean peatlands provide a pivotal control on water delivery downstream, and therefore, understanding their structure and function is important, because they are unique structures providing ecological services at high elevations.",The authors would like to thank CEAZAMET and the Dirección General Del Agua for providing data as well as Andrés Hevia and Franco Cuevas for help in the field data collection.

225,pub.1132471660,10.1016/j.mineng.2020.106708,,,Temporal evolution of the structure of tailings aggregates flocculated in seawater,"Mineral processing produces large volumes of dilute tailings that are flocculated and thickened, returning water to the process. The drive towards more sustainable processing has seen seawater considered to replace fresh water usage and an increased focus on how flocculation conditions can influence the fractal-like aggregates formed. The fragility of such structures and the likelihood that they change with time makes their study challenging. A synthetic tailings slurry of quartz and kaolin in seawater was flocculated at different mixing times and flocculant dosages, with aggregate size monitored over time by focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) and hindered settling rates determined after set reaction times. A model relating hindered settling rate to size as estimated by FBRM was used to derive an aggregate fractal dimension (Df ) at each time. With flocculation at typical tailings solids concentrations rapid, aggregate breakage will normally dominate after very short reaction times. Under mild mixing conditions, settling rates are higher than expected from sizes measured in real time due to aggregate growth continuing after mixing ceases, leading to inflated Df estimates. An apparent decline in Df under more intense mixing was consistent with an increased presence of high aspect ratio (low effective porosity) aggregate fragments, supported by in situ aggregate imaging at different reaction times. In contrast, the observed trends for a reduction in Df with mixing intensity and an increase with dosage are both thought to represent the expected aggregate structure changes for the synthetic tailings. While estimating aggregate structural properties by relating FBRM sizes to settling rates can offer useful insights, it is important to recognise the aggregation state observed by FBRM under mixing applied to induce flocculation may differ from that which exists during hindered settling. Values of Df derived in this manner must therefore be viewed with caution.","Ricardo I.

Information on biomass, production, diet and consumption was needed. The magnitudes of relative Ascendency, relative Overhead and Redundancy values indicated that kelp planted on artificial reefs allocated on soft bottoms would be more highly developed and less resistant to perturbations than ecological systems on artificial reefs disposed on barren and natural systems inhabiting soft bottoms and kelp habitats. The relative Ascendency corresponding to each component of the ecological systems constructed on artificial reefs on both habitats was represented principally by detritus (~37%), M. pyrifera (between 22 and 26%) and phytoplankton (between 10 and 13%). The compartments of Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta Mesophyllum sp. and the sea star Heliaster helianthus accounted for the system complexity in terms of flow, exhibiting the lowest Average Mutual Information. The Finn cycling index – considered as a ecosystem maturity index – showed contradictory outcomes compared to Ascendency. However, the values of System omnivory index and Average path length quantified for the ecological systems constructed on both artificial reefs showed similar network topologies compared to natural kelp beds. Based on our findings, artificial reefs seeded with M. pyrifera could be used to restore perturbed local marine benthic ecological systems along the Chilean coast. Likewise, this work shows that the trajectory of local ecological systems can be modified, enhancing their global-system health.","This work was conducted as part of the doctoral thesis of the first author financed by the Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technical Development (CONICYT) (Grant 21100416) and the Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Aplicadas mención Sistemas Marinos Costeros at the University of Antofagasta, Chile.",,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,,,,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,252,,107266,Closed,Article,"Campos, Leonardo; Ortiz, Marco; Rodríguez-Zaragoza, Fabián","Campos, Leonardo (Centro Regional de Investigación y Desarrollo Sustentable de Atacama (CRIDESAT), Universidad de Atacama, Copiapo, Region of Atacama, Chile; Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Aplicadas Mención Sistemas Marinos Costeros, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

The goal of the present study was to determine the influence of environmental variables generated by the seasonal coastal upwelling on the fatty acid profile (FAP) of the winged oyster Pteria colymbus. Changes in fatty acid (FA) levels were determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), temperature, seston (POM and TPM) and upwelling index (UI) were measured monthly and correlated with the FAPs. Statistical analysis (MDS-ANOSIM) revealed significant differences between FAPs of the soft tissues in the upwelling and non-upwelling seasons. The FAs that mainly explained the variance in the FAPs during the non-upwelling season were 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 20:4n-6, 20:1n-11NMID, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. During the upwelling season, the FAs that explained the variance were 18:3n-3, 18:4n-3 and 18:2n-6, in addition to those that varied during the non-upwelling season. PCA analysis between FAs and environmental variables in the upwelling season showed that UI presented a direct relationship with acids 16:0, 18:4n-3 and 14:0 and an inverse relationship with 22:6n-3 and temperature. In the second component, chlorophyll a and POM were directly correlated with 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, and inversely correlated with 18:0, 22:6n-3 and temperature. In the non-upwelling season, temperature showed a direct relationship with 22:6-3 and an inverse relationship with 20:5n-3 and 14:0. POM, Chl-a and UI showed a direct relationship with 16:0 FA and an inverse relationship with 22:6n.3, 20:1n-11NMID, 20:4n-6, 18:0 and temperature. This study shows how dominant oceanographic conditions in the upwelling and non-upwelling periods modulate FA levels in P. colymbus.","This study was funded by the “Estación Hidrobiológica de Turpialito del Instituto Oceanográfico de Venezuela, Universidad de Oriente, Venezuela” and the “Centro de Monitoreo Ambiental y Producción de Semillas de Moluscos Bivalvos, Venezuela ” (Grant number FONACIT-UDO 2011000344).

As an extension, and with a distinct focus on selected political cartoons entrenched in the South African press, the current article details name-calling as a communicative tool in South African political discourse. The study adopted a triangulation theoretical framework, due to its espousal of multiple naming theories. The researchers opted for qualitative discourse textual analysis methodology coupled with exploratory-explanatory research design. Document collection and semiotic analysis were used in succession, as data collection strategies. From the accessible population of ten cartoons, purposive sampling strategy was employed in selecting five cartoons that served as the sample for the study. Name-calling constructs were sequentially extracted from linguistic and visual discourse segments, and were qualitatively analysed through the semiotic analysis, and the theoretical tools underpinning the study. The findings of the study revealed that most of the name-calling stemmed from political corruption. Disclosement and reaction instigation were found to be the most used naming-communicative strategies during name-calling. Additionally, ideological character and aggressiveness were the most common semantic-pragmatic inherent categories of political discourse reflected. To this end, the study submits that cartoons in the South African press employ various name-calling constructs to express viewpoint, persuade, reprimand and construct arguments.",,,Communicatio,,,,2021-10-02,2021,2022-03-30,2021-10-02,47,4,21-47,Closed,Article,"Nendauni, Lutendo; Sadiki, Masindi; Baloyi, Mafemani","Nendauni, Lutendo (Cape Peninsula University of Technology, South Africa); Sadiki, Masindi (University of Venda, South Africa); Baloyi, Mafemani (University of Venda, South Africa)","Nendauni, Lutendo (Cape Peninsula University of Technology)","Nendauni, Lutendo (Cape Peninsula University of Technology); Sadiki, Masindi (University of Venda); Baloyi, Mafemani (University of Venda)",1,1,,0.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146773711,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies; 4704 Linguistics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It is an ecosystem engineer that provides habitat, shelter, and food for invertebrates and fish. This fishery has been developed by a collection of stranded algae carried out by legally registered fishers and illegal collectors in open-access areas and management and exploitation areas for benthic resources. Due to the current high demand on the international market, the collection of dead plants is supplemented by direct extraction. In response, a management plan has been implemented to regulate extraction efforts and institute annual quotas. The dynamics of the L. trabeculata fishery in the Atacama region over 20years were evaluated using the conceptual framework of the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) approach. The fishing dynamics are strongly conditioned by price fluctuations, promoting the growth of fishing efforts (pressure) in response to economic indicators (driving forces). This often leads to a high volume of extractions of resources (impact) reflected in the increase in extractors and landings in spite of the establishment of quotas (responses), that generate intense pressure on local populations of algae and other commercially important fish and invertebrates (state). A lack of knowledge was detected regarding population aspects and its associated communities. Consequently, this kelp has been mismanaged without a specific focus on this species. Finally, the indicators included in the present DPSIR analysis enable a global understanding of the L. trabeculata fishery, and it should be considered as a basis for future studies and the implementation of resource management strategies.","This work was conducted as part of the Postdoctoral Fellowship Universidad de Atacama 2018–2020 Decreto Exento RA N° 366/506/2019 of the first and second author funded by the Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Postgrado de la Universidad de Atacama (VRIP), Chile.

This paper analyzes the soiling process for photovoltaic modules installed at the Atacama Desert. For this purpose, the dust deposited on photovoltaic modules and glasses (for one year) was characterized and the location's atmospheric parameters were monitored continuously. The dust samples were separated according to difference in solubility, obtaining three samples: soluble (recrystallized), insoluble (filtered), and original. Through x-ray diffraction measurements it was detected that the soluble part corresponds to gypsum and the other dust components are insoluble or low-solubility salts such as albite, anhydrite, calcite, quartz, and orthoclase. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy of the dust on photovoltaic glasses show the presence of gypsum with a monoclinic prismatic structure covered with smaller dust particles. These prismatic crystals are also observed after recrystallization of the soluble sample suggesting that gypsum, as a soluble hygroscopic material, has a key role in the cementation process. Atmospheric parameters of each season were characterized through wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity. All these parameters show large daily oscillation, which trigger a cementation process in which gypsum crystallization, after being completely or partially solubilized, causes the encapsulation of insoluble material.","The authors acknowledge ANID/FONDAP/15110019 “Solar Energy Research Center” SERC-Chile; the Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO) with contract No 17PTECES-75830 under the framework of the project “AtaMoS TeC”; the generous financial support provided by GORE-Antofagasta, Chile, Project FIC-R Antofagasta 2017 BIP code 30488824-0 and Unidad de Equipamiento Científico “MAINI” at Universidad Católica del Norte for its support in the preparation of samples, data analysis and generation through the XRD and SEM team, ANID/FONDECYT Project N°11190289 “Performance Analysis of Photovoltaic Materials and Devices exposed to the Ultraviolet Light of Atacama Desert”.

The development consisted of the typical pattern reported for the Majoidea, two zoeal stages and one megalopa. The complete larval development from hatching to first crab lasted 5–6 days at temperatures that ranged between 24–28 °C. Both zoeal stages of M. spinosissimus exhibited moderate reduction in the number of setae in the maxilla and maxillipeds, from the first to the second zoeal stage, when compared with other closely related species. Maguimithrax spinosissimus can be easily distinguished from other species belonging to the closely related genus Mithrax by the (i) setation of the endopod of the maxillule, maxilla and second maxilliped in both zoeal stages; (ii) setation of the scaphognathite of the maxilla in the first zoeal stage; (iii) setation of the basis of maxilliped I in the second zoeal stage and megalopa; (iv) morphology of the antennule and antenna in the second zoeal stage; and (v) setation of the antennule, coxal endite of maxilla, and exopod of second maxilliped in the megalopa. All these characters support the recent generic status of Maguimithrax within the Mithracidae. Additional morphological details, not available previously, are provided. This study will provide support for conservation strategies in this species.","All authors dedicate this work to the memory of our great friend Juan A.

In this paper, we present a brief description of each technology, and then a discussion about the main results when used for starch modification. Each technology has specific mechanisms of interaction with starch, resulting in different levels of starch modification and functionalities. Also, some techniques are more explored and ready for industrial implementation (e.g. ozonation), while others still need more studies (e.g. pulsed electric field). Limitations and future perspectives are also discussed, such as studies involving scale-up and combination of technologies.

Selecting fish with better growth performance and survival under long term thermal stress would require an understanding of the level of additive genetic variation for these traits. Moreover, disentangling the genetic co-variation between growth- and robustness-related traits is key to understand potential antagonisms between selection for an increased performance and survivability. Thus, this study aimed at: i) assessing levels of genetic variation for growth and survival under chronic heat stress, and ii) evaluating the genetic relationship between these two traits and a broad range of growth- and robustness-related traits to identify potential trade-offs in rainbow trout. Phenotypic and pedigree records (n = 65,298 animals) from a rainbow trout breeding population were used. Growth and survival under chronic thermal stress were defined as the final body weight (FWHT) and days to death (TSR), after the experimental chronic exposure to high temperature (between 18 and 22 °C). Other growth-related traits analyzed here were: body weight at smolt stage (SW), harvest weight (HW), weight at processing plant (WPP), fillet weight (FW), weight of the eviscerated fish (GUW) and body weight at low temperature (FWLT). Robustness-related traits evaluated here were: resistance against Piscirickettsia salmonis (PSR) and Flavobacterium psychrophilum (FPR), and susceptibility to Caligus rogercresseyi (CS). The heritabilites estimated were: FWHT = 0.41 ± 0.14; TSR = 0.13 ± 0.05; SW = 0.54 ± 0.01; HW = 0.63 ± 0.01; WPP = 0.19 ± 0.02; FW = 0.03 ± 0.03; GUW = 0.18 ± 0.02; FWLT = 0.59 ± 0.17; FPR = 0.35 ± 0.05; PSR = 0.30 ± 0.05; and CS 0.08 ± 0.02. In general, strong compensations were identified between the robustness- and growth- related traits with genetic correlations that ranged from −0.28 to −0.98, except for resistance to F. psychrophilum and growth-related traits, which showed correlation values from 0.28 to 0.46. Genetic improvement for growth and survival under chronic upper thermal exposure is feasible. Compensations between growth- and robustness- related traits have to be accounted for when simultaneously including performance and disease resistance traits in the breeding objective.","Declaration of Competing Interest None.

Who Really Benefits?,"The conventional model of intergenerational income mobility suggests child’s income is a function of his human capital investment determined by parental income, which neglects the role of public investment. This paper aims to distinguish whether and how public investment affects intergenerational income mobility and who are the actual beneficiaries. Data used for analysis is from China Health and Nutrition Survey, and is precisely matched to provincial public investment data. To mitigate the potential biases, average income of at least three waves is adopted. Through investigations, this study finds public investment could promote intergenerational income mobility obviously but unequally. Middle-distributed income groups are found to benefit more from public investment than the upper and bottom tail of the income distribution. The opportunities for the middle-distributed income groups are fairly better, while it seems harder for individuals of the bottom income distribution to have a breakthrough. Positional changes between middle income groups and top income groups contribute largely to the intergenerational income mobility during the sample period. Regions with higher public investment present higher mobility as well. To promote intergenerational mobility, public investment should target more precisely at lower income groups.",,not applicable,Social Indicators Research,,,,2021-05-14,2021,2021-05-14,2021-11,158,1,59-80,Closed,Article,"Song, Lijie","Song, Lijie (School of Public Administration, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China)","Song, Lijie (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)","Song, Lijie (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)",3,0,,1.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138068674,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society,

Although this implies a positive marginal impact on local finance, there is not enough empirical evidence to support that this improves the quality of life in these communities. This article attempts to bridge this knowledge gap via a unique experimental framework, specifically, the Chilean tax system and a mining law that allows certain municipalities above an exogenous threshold to keep the extra income. We use Regression Discontinuity Design to identify the causal effect on public education indicators and our results are robust and show that in the margin that the educational performance of mining municipalities is worse than that of the counterfactuals. In addition, the evidence suggests that despite the resource windfalls of the mining municipalities, it is not clear if these municipalities invest more resources in public education than other localities.",,,Resources Policy,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,70,,101207,Closed,Article,"Oyarzo, Mauricio; Paredes, Dusan","Oyarzo, Mauricio (School of Business Administration, Universidad de Concepción Campus Chillán, Avenida Vicente Méndez 595, Chillán, Chile); Paredes, Dusan (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Oyarzo, Mauricio (University of Concepción)","Oyarzo, Mauricio (University of Concepción); Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)",21,9,,11.11,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105042663,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,4 Quality Education

The massive magnetite (δ56Fe = 0.28–0.39‰, with average value of 0.35‰), the magnetite in the veined magnetite-apatite ores (i.e., veined magnetite; δ56Fe = 0.16–0.41‰, with average value of 0.26‰), the magnetite in scoriaceous ores (δ56Fe = 0.26–0.34‰, with average value of 0.28‰) and the magnetite found in degassing cavities (δ56Fe = 0.27–0.28‰, with average value of 0.28‰) yielded Fe isotope compositions consistent with the igneous magnetite in the host fresh andesites (δ56Fe = 0.13–0.46‰, with average value of 0.23‰). On the other hand, the veined magnetite also contains slightly higher δ18O (0.65–5.98‰) than the general igneous magnetite (δ18O = +1.5–+4.5‰), consistent with the O isotopes of massive magnetite as previously reported (δ18O = 4.3–5.0‰). Both the Fe and O isotopes of the magnetite demonstrate that the El Laco magnetite ores might be derived from a high-temperature ortho-magmatic origin. Additionally, the El Laco fresh andesites display δ18O values of 10.34–12.06‰, which might be not equilibrated with the magnetite in the ores. By combining the data of Fe-O isotopes with the geological features, we propose that the El Laco magnetite ores might not originate from the ore-hosting andesitic melt, but from a more mafic Fe-rich parental melt.","We thank Wenning Lu and Zhihong Li for their help in the Fe isotope analyses.

This requires a deep understanding and inclusion of diverse stakeholders. In marine environments, divers are among the largest groups of citizen science volunteers, compared to other marine users. However, little is known about how the diversity of divers can affect their interest and participation in citizen science. Using 229 structured face-to-face interviews we investigated differences in diving specialization levels among diver types (i.e. artisanal fishers, dive instructors, recreational divers, divers with scientific background, and others) and we evaluated the relationship between diving specialization level and actual participation in Marine Citizen Science. Findings show important differences in diving specialization levels among diver types. Recreational divers have the lowest levels of specialization and artisanal fishers the highest. High levels of scientific training favored participation in the citizen science project, but there was no relationship between diving specialization level and participation rate. We conclude that different diver types have particular strengths and requirements to participate in Marine Citizen Science, and that integrating a diversity of divers can create important synergies. Taking the heterogeneity of potential participants into account will help engage a greater diversity of volunteers in citizen science and thus contribute to generating better policies and stakeholder support for marine conservation and sustainable management.","We wish to thank all the divers who participated in this study and the diving clubs and fishing coves who helped us to promote the survey.

Its experts argue that the Global South will benefit from easing barriers to investment and trade, thus facilitating interaction between transnational corporations and local enterprises. Yet, there is growing scepticism regarding the prospects to develop in global networks. This article delves into their dark side. Following critical scholarship, the author suggests that integration into global networks is a process that creates winners and losers. It leads to uneven development. To analyse concrete mechanisms that underlie the process of failed development, he drafts a heuristic on exclusion, downgrading, and non-participation from/in global networks. This approach is tested against the backdrop of the hydrocarbon sector in Bolivia and Ghana. In Bolivia, indigenous suppliers suffer from downgrading, exclusion, and non-participation because of a recent shift to a turn-key model and sector-specific entry barriers. Ghana is marked by non-participation of local firms, mostly due to endogenous problems: corruption and institutional deficiencies, little industrialization, a high interest rate, and rent-seeking. These findings confirm that caution with regard to the possibilities to develop in global networks is justified, but they also indicate that not every development problem results from global network participation.",The author is grateful to Linus Kalvelage (University of Cologne) for helpful suggestions on an early draft of this article.,,Geografiska Annaler Series B Human Geography,,,,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,2022-04-03,104,2,146-162,Closed,Article,"Scholvin, Sören","Scholvin, Sören (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Scholvin, Sören (Catholic University of the North)","Scholvin, Sören (Catholic University of the North)",3,3,,2.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142744330,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The existence of major splay faults in these fault systems has been debated. To improve our undestanding of seismotectonic processes affecting the MP, we built a new catalog of aftershocks of the 1995 Antofagasta earthquake (Mw 8.1) recorded by the CINCA seismic network. In addition, we build a three-dimensional tomographic model to determine the physical properties of the upper plate using arrival times from our new catalog combined with other earthquakes catalogs derived from several networks deployments across the MP. We detected seismicity in the outer wedge of the upper plate. The seismicity is partially defined by a clear lineament between 22 and 5 km depth that we defined as a splay fault. The focal mechanisms indicate a rupture plane with NE orientation and SE dip. The seismicity in the upper plate and splay fault are located in the areas in which the Vp and Vs velocities are decreased and the Vp/Vs ratio is increased, suggesting a fractured fault zone within the outer wedge of the upper plate. We propose the presence of fluids in the fracture fault zone within the outer wedge because the decrease in Vs larger than that of Vp and repeating earthquakes clusters were detected. Our observations present clear evidence of the activation of the splay fault in the outer wedge of the North Chilean offshore forearc.","This work was funded by the PIA/CONICYT, Anillo de Investigación de Ciencia y Tecnología grant ACT172002.

The article probes the complexity of dealing with two interrelated wicked problems, namely informal, self-employed street vendors, and their experiences of littering. This paper describes the themes that emerged from 92 qualitative interviews to determine the perceptions of street vendors regarding reasons for littering on the streets where they operate as well as their experiences of working in these littered environments. By drawing on the themes emerging from semi-structured interviews with vendors, we suggest how stakeholders could engage with the concerns around street vending and littering by means of the use of adaptive management or co-management, engaging, and integrating diverse perspectives, the facilitation of self-organisation, and establishing safe boundaries to evade system thresholds. In this way, complexity-based strategies can promote people-centred urban governance that empowers and includes citizens in attempts to manage the wicked problems of growing cities inclusively.",,This research was funded by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) and the National Research Foundation (NRF) managed through the Council for Science and Innovation Research (CSIR).

This information is discussed together with osteometric and genetic data from wild and domesticated camelids to understand the use of different hunting and herding areas. The results show changes in the isotopic values dated to the Early and Middle Archaic (10,000–5300 years BP), associated with the environmental transformations registered within the study area. For the Late Archaic (5300–4000 years BP) and the Early Formative (3100–2400 years BP) the isotopic values show a similar distribution. Nevertheless, it is impossible to establish the use of specific herding areas due to the high size variability identified within the large size camelid group, which comprises llamas and guanacos. At the same time, the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions measured on the materials dated to the Tarajne phase (3700–3200 years BP) show little variability, a pattern that can be explained due to the use of delimited areas for wild camelid hunting and domestic camelid herding.","Trabajo financiado por la Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) a través de los proyectos FONDECYT N° 1130917 y FONDECYT posdoctoral N° 3190566.

Sediment and water sampling of the rivers in the 2000 s found exceptional As and metal levels in modern and old sediments. The studies also revealed that acid rock drainage (ARD) has been present in the district for nearly 10,000 years and the effect that the mining of the district had in terms of geochemical anomalies. The convergence of mineralogical, structural, and hydrologic conditions has generated a metal-rich ARD, a process followed by transference of metals to the fine sediments. In this context, the study also deals with the risk of metal and metalloid transfers from the sediments to the river waters as a consequence of eventual physical-chemical changes, due for example, to climatic-driven conditions. Water and sediment samplings were carried out to provide materials for selective extraction tests under acidic, acid-reducing, and acid-oxidizing conditions. The different behavior of metals and metalloids was revealed and highlighted the refractory character of As. Additionally, the study included the characterization of the sediment’s mineralogy, and allowed the detection of new geochemical anomalies of Cu, Zn, Co, and Y in the Incaguaz River, along with high dissolved Li concentrations in the Toro and Turbio rivers.","This work was developed within the framework of the ANID/FONDECYT/1180153, the Water Resources and Environment Program (PRHIMA, for its acronym in Spanish) of the Department of Mining Engineering of Universidad de La Serena, ANID/FONDAP/15130015, and ANID/FONDAP 15110020.

The protestors framed their arguments within the security-development context, arguing that without free education they were bound to be excluded from education and later from jobs and a good livelihood, hence endangering their security. The stalemate quickly resulted in the securitization of university spaces a development that was backed up with the brutal force of police and private security companies pushing the students to engage in extreme measures like burning buildings to be heard. Through the use of securitization theory, this paper explores the rationale for the securitization of university spaces. The Security-Development nexus perspective sheds more light on the motives behind the #Feesmustfall movement. The paper further explores whether the combination of the securitization of university spaces and the funding offered by President Zuma were enough to quell the protest. The paper further delves into the new reality of private security companies expanding their role in the securitization of South Africa and the waning role of the police in the protection of public spaces. Key findings of the study are that both the students and universities had different interests during the fees must fall and without a mediator, the use of force ensued. Although the South African government has invested more money into universities, the relationship between the university management and the students remains fractured. Plus the lack of trained police unit to deal with student protests leaves the police unable to maintain law and order without resorting to extreme violence.",,,Africa Review,,,,2021-11-11,2021,2021-11-11,,13,1,40-60,Closed,Article,"Sempijja, Norman; Letlhogile, Resego Reamogetse","Sempijja, Norman (School of Law, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain); Letlhogile, Resego Reamogetse (Department of Political Science and International Relations, North West university, Potchefstroom, South Africa)",,"Sempijja, Norman (University of Navarra); Letlhogile, Resego Reamogetse (North-West University)",6,3,,4.99,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128995232,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This region, located in northern Chile, consists of the easternmost part of the Coastal Cordillera, the Pampa del Tamarugal, and the western Domeyko Cordillera (or Chilean Precordillera). On the surface, a series of N–S-oriented folds alternating between monoclines and narrow anticline and syncline folds containing Mesozoic, Upper Cretaceous, and Cenozoic rocks form part of the main structural styles, which are frequently bound by west-verging reverse faults that form the basement of the deeper structural levels of the upper crust. The interpretation of a regional seismic grid composed of N–S, NE–SW, and WNW–ESE-oriented 2-D seismic profiles revealed the presence of several blind west-verging inversion anticlines that define the orogenic front of the Central Andes at this latitude. These anticline folds are related to the partial and/or total positive reactivation of ancient east-dipping Jurassic normal basement faults bounding half-graben structures and sub-basins developed within the Tarapacá Basin. Our results suggest that the thrust belt front in this region is preferably located under the Pampa del Tamarugal, and not along the topographic culmination of the western Precordillera as traditionally proposed. New tectonic restorations of 2-D structural models suggest that, during tectonic inversion, between 3 and 4 km of crustal shortening were accommodated by vertical motion along the inverted normal faults. The presence of Upper Cretaceous synorogenic deposits covering the Jurassic syn-rift deposits on the inversion anticlines indicates that both basin inversion and formation of the western thrust belt front began during the Late Cretaceous, and not during the Eocene “Incaic” tectonic phase as previously suggested by regional studies developed in the area.","This work was mainly supported by the “National Research and Development Agency of Chile (ANID)” through a Ph.D. scholarship awarded to the second author.

This article traces Shembe’s evangelism prior to the emergence of the Nazaretha to show that his spiritual autobiography and earliest religious communities offered few indications of an ethnic framework for belonging. Instead, claims about healing helped to integrate Shembe as an outsider in Natal, South Africa, and led to the emergence of the Nazaretha as a new denomination. Nazaretha strategies for acquiring space to enact their healing mission pushed the congregation towards greater engagement with the resources of Zulu-ness in the 1910s and 1920s. At the same time, their healing mission encouraged them to welcome anyone who sought God’s healing. This led to sustained engagement with Indians in particular, some of whom attributed their restored health to Shembe and converted to the Nazaretha faith. Healing, then, drove complex – and seemingly contradictory – processes; using it as a lens more fully accounts for how Shembe himself and, later, members of the Nazaretha Church understood shifting parameters of belonging.","Many thanks to Jilly Kelly, Karin Shapiro and T.J.

We analyzed the pollen assemblages of 31 fossil rodent middens to reconstruct precipitation change during the most recent millennium in the highlands of the Atacama Desert (22°S), on the western foothills of the Altiplano. Variations in low and high elevation pollen types reveal reduced (increased) precipitation between 930 and 550 BP (510 and 440 BP) (BP = before present; taken as Common Era 1950). Variable pollen assemblages prevailed from 390 to 90 BP, followed by a drying trend that persists until present times. Similarities with proxy records from the Altiplano, the tropical Andes and the equatorial Pacific suggest that centennial‐scale wet/dry phases in the Atacama highlands were associated with changes in the strength of the South American monsoon system, most likely influenced by changes akin to modern El Niño Southern Oscillation variability.
Plain Language Summary Fossilized rodent middens are able to preserve plant remains for millennia, representing glimpses of ancient vegetation and climates. Pollen recovered from 31 fossil middens in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile allowed us to reconstruct vegetation and rainfall changes over the most recent millennium. Upslope shifts of low elevation pollen types in middens dated between 930 and 550 years before the present (BP; taken as Common Era 1950) indicates dryer conditions, while downslope shifts of high elevation types suggest wetter climates between 510 and 440 BP. We interpret these dry/wet phases as resulting from changes in regional precipitation associated with the strength of the South American summer monsoon system. A comparison of our midden record with precipitation reconstructions from the Altiplano, the tropical Andes and the equatorial Pacific suggests a pattern of variability similar to that imposed by El Niño/La Niña today. Our reconstruction further suggests that the drivers controlling present‐day precipitation variability may have also influenced decade‐to‐century‐long trends over the last 1,000 years, with the implication that future long‐term changes in El Niño Southern Oscillation behavior will more likely impact precipitation regimes in Atacama Desert and Altiplano.
Key Points    Pollen analysis of fossil rodent middens from the Atacama Desert allows reconstructing precipitation trends over the last 1,100 years   Shifts in key pollen types suggest relatively dry conditions during the first half of the last millennium   A tropical driving mechanism is suggested by similarities with records from the Altiplano, the tropical Andes and the equatorial Pacific",Acknowledgments The authors thank Eduardo Godoy and Esteban Honores for their assistance during the midden collection campaign.

This knowledge gap is problematic because these windfalls should cover the negative externalities that exist in host zones. Additionally, these communities have different fiscal responsibilities due to the mining industry's environmental, economic, and social costs. This article estimates the subnational crowd out of mining windfalls on local tax collection by considering different levels of fiscal responsibility. We employ panel data for 322 Chilean municipalities between 2008 and 2019 using an exogenous rule for assigning mining windfalls in order to attribute causality. Our results confirm the crowding out hypothesis. First, a US$1.0 increase in mining windfalls results in a US$0.2 decrease in the property tax collected. Second, subnational crowding out is twice as high in municipalities with a high level of fiscal responsibility; a US$1.0 increase in windfalls crowds out US$0.4 in non-resource revenue. Third, considering the influence of nearby neighborhoods and the spatial interdependence, crowding out is four times higher than non-spatial estimations. These results call for local policies that consider the fiscal capacity of a municipality in order to disincentivize undesirable behavior from extra resource revenues.",The authors acknowledge the financial support from Chilean Fondecyt grant 1191162 ‘Do mining tax windfalls crowd-out other local revenues?

Potato slices were treated by immersion in ethanol for up to 30 min and then dried by convection (40 °C, 1 m/s). Different treatments were conducted to evaluate the effect of pre-treatment with ethanol and/or drying on the potato tissue and starch structure and properties. Potato microstructure, rehydration capacity, and drying kinetics were evaluated. After pre-treatment, drying, and rehydration, the starch was extracted and evaluated in relation to both structure and properties. Ethanol pre-treatment promoted structural changes on potato tissues and cells: the cells became withered, with thinner walls, lose turgidity, and changed the initial shape becoming more distorted and compacted. These permanent structural modifications impacted the subsequent mass transfer: the drying time was reduced in ∼56%, and the initial rehydration rate increased ∼25%. There were no changes in the starch molecular profile and only minor imperfections in the surface of the granules. The starch pasting and gel properties were only slightly altered by the drying process. In conclusion, drying and its pre-treatment with ethanol can be a simple technology for preserving potatoes focused on starch extraction.","The authors are grateful to the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil) for funding the project nº 2019/05043-6; this study was financed in part by the “Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brazil (CAPES)” – for the JS Guedes (88882.378356/2019-01) and KC Santos (88882.378385/2019-01) M.Sc. scholarships; to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) for the JS Guedes M.Sc. scholarship (131235/2020-6) and the productivity grant of PED Augusto (306557/2017-7); and to the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica (FONDECYT, Peru) from the “Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT.",,Food Structure,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,29,,100202,Closed,Article,"Guedes, Jaqueline S.; Santos, Karoline C.; Castanha, Nanci; Rojas, Meliza L.; Matta, Manoel D.; Lima, Dâmaris C.; Augusto, Pedro E.D.","Guedes, Jaqueline S.

As with all ensemble methods, the central idea is to assemble a voting scheme where a set of weak interpolation functions are combined, by using an aggregation function, to produce a strong ensemble response. In the presented scheme, voter interpolation functions are weak because they deal with a minimal portion of sample data extracted from spatial random partition elements, while the ensemble as a whole uses all the available information as much as possible. The random partitions scheme behaves as a bootstrapping strategy applied in a spatial context. Experiments show that the proposed framework has the promising ability to produce robust interpolation functions that can both scale to handle large sample data sets and deal with uncertainty quantifications, although weak voter interpolation functions are deterministic or highly data-consuming.","The authors acknowledge funding from the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) PIA-Project AFB180004.

To achieve this goal, first, simple geometry rock elements are tilted and results interpreted according to analytical formulations. Then, more complex geometry engineered rock blocks, including some whose centers of gravity do not project on the center of the base element, are tested and results properly interpreted. Eventually, the 3-D-printed version of the rock boulder is produced from 3-D point clouds recovered in the field by means of a combination of photogrammetry and laser scanner techniques. Analytical formulations and numerical calculations have been used in order to validate the proposed approach, to explain the physical phenomena involved, and to allow for possible extension of the physical modelling results to different scenarios, such as those considering the influence of water or seismic loading on stability.","The last author acknowledges the Spanish Ministry of Universities for funding of his work in the project, awarded under Contract Reference No. RTI2018-093563-B-I00, partially financed by means of ERDF funds from the EU.",,Engineering Geology,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,282,,105994,Closed,Article,"Pérez-Rey, Ignacio; Muñiz-Menéndez, Mauro; González, Javier; Vagnon, Federico; Walton, Gabriel; Alejano, Leandro R.","Pérez-Rey, Ignacio (Laboratorio de Geotecnia, CEDEX, Madrid, Spain); Muñiz-Menéndez, Mauro (Laboratorio de Geotecnia, CEDEX, Madrid, Spain); González, Javier (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Vagnon, Federico (Department of Earth Science, Università degli Studi di Torino, Torino, Italy); Walton, Gabriel (Department of Geology and Engineering Geology, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, USA); Alejano, Leandro R.

The semiarid region of north-central Chile (30–34°S) has experienced a mega-drought over the last decade, with a partial recovery during the 2015 El Niño year. To characterize the vegetation response to climate variability, we analyzed the seasonal precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, temperature extremes, and high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data at five altitudinal floors above 2500 m. We considered the bi-monthly maximum NDVI in austral summer (NDVIx) and the difference between NDVIx and that of two months prior (NDVId) to reflect the primary productivity throughout the growing season. We observed positive linear correlations between NDVIx and winter precipitation and negative ones with autumn/winter maximum temperatures at lower altitudes (the latter likely led to the negative correlation between NDVIx and potential evapotranspiration). The NDVIx showed clear latitudinal and altitudinal variability, with the southern region exhibiting an opposite NDVIx climate correlation pattern at altitudes greater than 3500 m. The NDVId correlations were more spatially uniform and showed similar patterns to those of NDVIx at lower altitudes. Precipitation declined at a rate of −45%/decade, which contributed to the −1.5%/decade and −5%/decade decline in NDVIx and NDVId, respectively. The positive NDVIx trends (1.5%/decade) above 3500 m in the southern region led to an early snowpack retreat, which was consistent with the temporal increase in autumn maximum temperature of 1.23 °C/decade. Our results suggest that ongoing climate change will have a negative impact on the high-altitude ecosystems of the semiarid Andes.","NDVI data separated in altitudinal floors have been gently provided by Prof. Roberto Chávez, at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile.

Fishes are the most important herbivores in many shallow coral reef environments, where they control algal successional processes and promote coral reef resilience. Nowadays, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) is suffering a severe decline in its nearshore fish populations due to overfishing. In this study, we used artificial underwater settlement plates with different levels of herbivore exclusion, and underwater visual censuses, for eight consecutive months to examine the functional role of herbivorous fishes in the coastal benthic community of Rapa Nui. Fishes effectively controlled fleshy erect algae growth along the west and north coast of the island. In total exclusion treatments, Codium spp. dominated settlement plates, showing a likely late successional stage when no herbivory occurred. Significant differences in fish biomass were observed across sites, suggesting a possible fishing gradient. The results of this study can help to inform various spatial and temporal management strategies to increase the protection of nearshore fishes at the recently created Rapa Nui multiple-use marine protected area.","We would like to thank ORCA diving center for their help during the whole field period of this research, as well as to Jose Tuki and Lonto Hereveri; to C.

Given that monogamous species are known to live in heterosexual pairs and exhibit a low degree of sexual dimorphism, it is expected that burrowing shrimps are not monogamous. We tested this hypothesis using the burrowing shrimp Lepidophthalmus bocourti as a model. Against expectations, shrimps were found living not only individually but also in homosexual and heterosexual pairs and trios within their respective burrows. The social structure in L. bocourti seemed to be an ontogenetically defined strategy, since most solitary individuals were juveniles of both sexes, while the heterosexual combinations were composed by adult shrimps. Sex distribution of pairs and trios suggested that female-female and male-female-female associations might be stable over time. Only 7% of the inhabited burrows were occupied by a heterosexual pair, and ovigerous females were found dwelling either in solitary or in heterosexual combinations, indicating that this species is not monogamous. Most of the male-female associations occurring both in pairs and trios were dominated by females larger than males. We observed sexual dimorphism in the size of the major cheliped, being larger in males than in females. Ontogenetic pattern of burrow occupation allied to considerable sexual dimorphism argue in favour that L. bocourti is not monogamous and suggest that the major cheliped might have an important role during the male-male competition for receptive females.Significance statementBurrowing shrimps (Axiidea and Gebiidea) are characterized by their solitary habits and by marked sexual dimorphism both in body size and chelipeds. The way these shrimps occupy their burrows and how common sexual dimorphism occurs remains unknown for most species. This is particularly important since the predominance of certain mating system (i.e. monogamous versus polygamous) can be inferred from the social structure and morphological differences of characters among the sexes of a species. We described the burrow use pattern and sexual dimorphism of the burrowing shrimp Lepidophthalmus bocourti to infer the mating system in this species. L. bocourti showed a complex social structure composed of both solitary shrimps and homosexual and heterosexual pairs and trios of shrimps. This burrow use pattern is allied with sexual dimorphism both in body (when it came to male-female associations) and in cheliped size.","The authors are thankful to Ana E.

Biofloc accumulation deteriorates the water quality and can negatively affect the production rates of the farmed river shrimp. This study describes and characterizes the settling velocity distribution of bioflocs generated with the addition of two carbon sources (molasses and chancaca) when applying the BFT for the rearing of the river shrimp Cryphiops caementarius. This study revealed that bioflocs generated with different carbon sources have different settling velocity curves. Regarding the mass fraction settling velocities, there were significant differences (P < 0.05) for mean solids fraction at similar withdrawn times between molasses and chancaca. The average settling velocities for bioflocs were 0.1044 ± 0.1224 cm s−1 for molasses and 0.1131 ± 0.1225 cm s−1 for chancaca. Therefore, a settling device operating with a given overflow rate will more efficiently remove bioflocs generated with chancaca than with molasses. The settling velocity curves obtained in this research contain valuable information to select appropriate devices for bioflocs and suspended solids removal in aquaculture systems with BFT.","This work and publication were developed with the support of the project FONDEF ID15I10353 and CONICYT-National Academy Insertion Contest, 2017 Call-Code 79170111.

Alternate modes of operation are fundamental to the development of effective DES frameworks to model and monitor system performance in response to unexpected changes (e.g. ore feed attributes). The decision to switch between modes is governed by operational policy and is triggered as critical thresholds are crossed. Hundreds of operating days can be simulated to identify potential deficiencies, bottlenecks, or other operational risks. DES is thus useful to support strategic decision-making in the design, development and sustained operation of any mining system. Based on current mining trends, tailings storage facilities are growing in both size and number, resulting in alarming tailings accumulations worldwide. Coupled with a large number of abandoned legacy mines and artisanal mining operations, tailings and other waste materials pose a significant threat to human health and safety, as well as the environment. Cost-effective tailings management strategies to mitigate these risks through site remediation are required. Research on potential uses for discarded tailings is divided between secondary metallurgical processing for extractive purposes, and incorporation into industrial materials. The current framework has been adapted to integrate geostatistical variability into DES in order to assess the potential operational risks related to secondary mining of tailings for a conceptual cement production operation. A case study loosely based on data from a tailings dam in Taltal, northern Chile, is presented. Sample calculations are provided that demonstrate the framework as a valuable tool to evaluate and mitigate potential risk factors in the development of tailings retreatment applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This element is essential for diverse markets such as steel production, dietary additives, fertilizers, cells, fine chemicals, and some chemical reagents. Interestingly, there are large mineral reserves in the ocean's depths, where marine nodules are an attractive option due to their high manganese content (between 16 and 24%). The dissolution of MnO2 from manganese nodules needs a reducing agent. Iron is a feasible alternative with a low cost and can even be recycled from scrap or industrial waste like smelting slag, tailings, or scrap steel. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Manganese acid-reducing processes from marine nodules using different iron-reducing agents that include FeS2, Fe2+, Fe0, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4. Fe0 has displayed the best performance in terms of dissolution kinetics and Mn extraction. This review further confers the chemistry and reactions involved in the reductive leaching and stresses the critical parameters that could be considered for optimization. In this sense, the concentration of reducing agent and temperature are highlighted as the most influential, making other parameters (e.g., particle size, stirring speed, acid concentration, and leaching time) almost irrelevant. Finally, it is concluded that the best way to extract Mn from marine nodules is to reuse steel scraps, working with high Fe0/MnO2 ratios (2/1), low concentrations of sulfuric acid (0.1 mol/L), and short times (5 min), achieving extractions of 90%.",Pedro Robles thanks the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for the support provided.,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,163,,106748,Closed,Article,"Toro, Norman; Rodríguez, Freddy; Rojas, Anyelo; Robles, Pedro; Ghorbani, Yousef","Toro, Norman (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Almirante Juan José Latorre 2901, Antofagasta 1244260, Chile; Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

Nevertheless, within our nations, there exists an emerging body of expertise concerning the innovation of educational material utilizing Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The objective of this study is to explain how the use of augmented reality in school journalism affects the development of communication skills in virtual environments within the context of public secondary education in Latin America. This quasi‐experimental research study was conducted on two separate groups: an experimental group and a control group. The approach was a mix of qualitative and quantitative methodology. The results differed markedly between the two groups. The students in the experimental group developed the four communication skills in virtual environments at an average level of 95%, and they created an augmented reality magazine. Meanwhile, the control group did not even create a printed publication. It is concluded that the use of augmented reality makes a significant pedagogical contribution to the teaching/learning process of school journalism and that with the help of educational policies, this pedagogical contribution can be replicated in other schools.",,,The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,,,2021-01-04,2021,2021-01-04,2021-07,87,4,,Closed,Article,"Fernández‐García, Carlos","Fernández‐García, Carlos (Universidad Privada del Norte, Comas, Peru)","Fernández‐García, Carlos (Private University of the North)","Fernández‐García, Carlos (Private University of the North)",4,2,,2.02,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134314669,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,4 Quality Education
211,pub.1134310052,10.1111/rsp3.12391,,,"One country, two populist parties: Voting patterns of the 2018 Italian elections and their determinants","The results of the elections have increasingly brought to the forefront the long‐standing issue of lagging regions—also labelled as “places that don't matter”—since they had a great influence on the electoral outcomes. In this paper, we focus on the municipal results of the Italian senate elections, held in March 2018. Italy is a peculiar country where two non‐traditional parties, namely “Lega” and “Movimento 5 Stelle” (M5S), ended up forming the government coalition running until August 2019 and competing for different shades of populism. Our aim is to investigate the regional characteristics which underlie the local preferences for the two non‐mainstream parties. First, we find that the spatial distribution of their votes is associated with territorial socio‐economic and institutional differences, and hence that Lega and M5S are characterized by a different electoral base (e.g., Lega capitalized its traditional support in the North, while M5S won especially in the South). Second, beyond these expected regional patterns, our evidence also highlights a sharp urban‐rural contrast. Los resultados de las elecciones han puesto en primer plano cada vez más el viejo problema de las regiones rezagadas, también calificadas como “lugares que no importan”, debido a la gran influencia que tuvieron en los resultados electorales. En este artículo, nos centramos en los resultados municipales de las elecciones al Senado de Italia, celebradas en marzo de 2018. Italia es un país peculiar en el que dos partidos no convencionales, a saber, la ""Lega"" y el ""Movimento 5 Stelle"" (M5S), acabaron formando la coalición de gobierno vigente hasta agosto de 2019 y compitiendo por diferentes matices de populismo. El objetivo de este trabajo es investigar las características regionales que subyacen a las preferencias locales por los dos partidos no convencionales. En primer lugar, se encontró que la distribución espacial de sus votos está asociada a diferencias socioeconómicas e institucionales territoriales, y que por tanto la Lega y M5S se caracterizan por una base electoral diferente (p. ej. la Lega capitalizó su apoyo tradicional en el Norte, mientras que M5S ganó especialmente en el Sur). En segundo lugar, más allá de estos patrones regionales esperados, la evidencia obtenida pone también de manifiesto un fuerte contraste entre las zonas urbanas y las rurales. 選挙の結果は、選挙がもたらした結果に大きな影響を与えたため、「重要ではない場所」というレッテルも貼られた、遅れている地域の問題をより前面に押し出している。本稿では、2018年3月に実施されたイタリア上院議員選挙の自治体の結果に焦点を当てる。イタリアは、2つの新興政党、すなわちLega (同盟)とMovimento 5 Stell(M5S:五つ星運動)が、最終的に2019年8月まで続く連立政権を形成して様相の異なるポピュリズムを争ったという特異な国である。本稿の目的は、この2つの非主流政党に対する地域の選好性の根底にある地域の特性を調べることである。第一に、彼らの得票の空間的分布は、領土的な社会経済的および制度的差異と関連しており、それゆえLegaとM5Sは異なる選挙基盤(例えば、Legaは北部での伝統的な支援を活用し、M5Sは主に南部で勝利した)によって特徴づけられるという知見が得られた。第二に、これらの地域の予想パターンを越えて、我々が得たエビデンスからは都市対農村のコントラストが強いことが明らかにされる。",,,Regional Science Policy & Practice,,,,2021-01-28,2021,2021-01-28,2021-04,13,2,397-413,Closed,Article,"Faggian, Alessandra; Modica, Marco; Modrego, Félix; Urso, Giulia","Faggian, Alessandra (Social Sciences, Gran Sasso Science Institute, L'Aquila, Italy); Modica, Marco (Social Sciences, Gran Sasso Science Institute, L'Aquila, Italy); Modrego, Félix (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Urso, Giulia (Social Sciences, Gran Sasso Science Institute, L'Aquila, Italy)","Modica, Marco (Gran Sasso Science Institute)","Faggian, Alessandra (Gran Sasso Science Institute); Modica, Marco (Gran Sasso Science Institute); Modrego, Félix (Catholic University of the North); Urso, Giulia (Gran Sasso Science Institute)",8,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134310052,,

Particularly for newly cultured species where information may be limited, optimization of culture practices relies on an understanding of the physiology and ecology of a species. The cojinoba (Seriolella violacea; Centrolophidae), a coastal pelagic marine fish, is a species of growing importance for aquaculture production in South America. Although methods for breeding and larval to juvenile rearing have been established, little is known about the physiology of this species. Therefore, measures of metabolism, swimming capacity and efficiency, red:white (R:W) muscle ratios, and associated aerobic and anaerobic biochemical parameters, such as plasma glucose and lactate, and muscle enzyme activities (i.e., pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, electron transport system [ETS]), were measured. For cojinoba at 15 °C with mean body length (BL; total length) of 22 cm, critical swimming velocity (U crit) was approximately 80 cm/s or 3.8 BL/s, and optimal swimming velocity (U opt) was 50 cm/s or 2.3 BL/s. Aerobic scope for metabolism was approximately 300 mg O2/kg/h, with Mo2 max 3.4 fold greater than standard metabolic rate. Swimming was facilitated by linear increases in tail beat frequency until burst and glide swimming initiated near U crit. At low velocities, large (~20% BL) pectoral fins were used for propulsion and maneuverability/maintaining equilibrium; beat frequency diminished rapidly with increasing velocity. Red:white muscle ratios at 50% BL and 75% BL (caudal peduncle) were comparable to other ectothermic species, with a greater proportion of red muscle in the caudal peduncle presumably corresponding to facilitation of sustained pelagic swimming. Plasma glucose and lactate were elevated at U crit by 20% and 45% respectively, indicating mobilization of anaerobic energy sources at fatigue. Aerobic enzyme activities were much higher in red muscle, the ratio of anaerobic:aerobic enzyme activity was higher in white muscle, and ETS activities decreased at fatigue in both red and white muscle. The cojinoba has a moderate metabolic rate compared to other pelagic species, displays shoaling behavior, is maneuverable at low velocities due to pectoral fin use, but has optimal swimming efficiencies at higher velocities. These factors are beneficial for designing culture systems to promote exercise benefits for growth and welfare.","Funding for this project was provided by grants from Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)-Chile FONDECYT11180042 to CAA; and CORFO 17PDT2-88940 and FONDEF ID17I10247 to HF.

Using detailed, individual information of Chilean workers, the study finds a strong evidence of a wage penalty for women as body size increases, whereas men seemingly enjoy a wage premium for being overweight. Several hypotheses are tested for explaining this finding and results suggest that the gender wage gap between obese and non-obese workers is not related to observed productivity differences, risk aversion, or health limitations. For women, the wage penalty is mostly explained by occupational crowding and the “beauty premium” in high-skilled occupations. Finally, this study outlines possible avenues that future research should address. HIGHLIGHTS Women are more likely to experience a weight penalty in labor markets than men. Heavier women earn less per hour than thinner coworkers in Chile. Overweight men experience a wage premium. Wage differences between obese and non-obese women cannot be explained by observable endowments. The wage penalty is larger in occupations requiring more social interactions.

Underemployment and Subjective Well-Being Across Chilean Workers,"Underemployment has gained attention in recent years because of its effects on health and well-being (life satisfaction), it is a widespread phenomenon in the labor force that affects not only workers, but also households, companies and governments. This paper explores the relationship between underemployment and subjective well-being for a representative sample of Chilean workers using an ordered probit model. Also, by using different underemployment definitions and a latent class ordered probit model we analyze the observed and unobserved heterogeneity in this relationship. Finally, we assess the monetary valuation of well-being costs by estimating the amount of money that a worker is willing to accept in order to bear the potential negative effects of underemployment on well-being. Our results find a negative relationship between underemployment and subjective well-being, as the average worker is willing to accept an increase of CLP$64,009 (roughly 30.5% of the minimum wage) in her/his monthly wage for being underemployed. If we take into account the observed and unobserved heterogeneity, our results identify a group that is not sensitive to underemployment, while others are willing to accept an increase of CLP$146,622 in her/his monthly wage for being underemployed. Our work highlights the importance of well-being in the workplace and has implications for labor flexibility legislation and the empowerment of workers. Heterogeneous responses to underemployment imply that one-size-fits-all policies to regulate working hours might not suffice.",,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Applied Research in Quality of Life,,,,2021-04-08,2021,2021-04-08,2022-04,17,2,885-912,Closed,Article,"Rodríguez-Puello, Gabriel; Arcos, Ariel; Jara, Benjamin","Rodríguez-Puello, Gabriel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena, Colombia); Arcos, Ariel (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Jara, Benjamin (GSSI, Gran Sasso Science Institute, L’Aquila, Italy)","Rodríguez-Puello, Gabriel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)","Rodríguez-Puello, Gabriel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Arcos, Ariel (Catholic University of the North); Jara, Benjamin (Gran Sasso Science Institute)",3,0,,1.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137026673,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology,

The proposed algorithm follows a hierarchical workflow and relies on the calculation of the down-the-hole distance between every drillhole data and the closest geological boundary (primary variable) together with the omnidirectional distance between each node of the interpretive model and the closest boundary (covariate). The level of influence of the latter on the former can be controlled by tuning their cross-correlation so that one can increase or reduce the effect of the geological interpretation in the simulation, depending on the confidence of the expert in such an interpretation. The key parameters for a successful implementation of the proposed approach are the choice of a binary tree to control the topological relationships between the simulated geological units, of a spatial correlation model to control the geological continuity and the boundaries regularity, and of a coefficient to control the trustworthiness given to the soft data. The specification of these parameters can be assessed by geological considerations and by cross-validation techniques. The proposal was applied to a synthetic and a real case study, where it was shown that incorporation of soft data allowed reproduction of geological zonations in areas with few drillhole data. Some implementation issues and possible improvements to the method are also discussed.","This research was partially supported by the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile (ANID), under Grant ANID PIA AFB180004 (R.F., X.E. and F.N.) and by BHP where the case studies were conducted.

Theory predicts that, under warmer temperatures, fish grow to a smaller size, undergo a reduction in dispersal ability and increase speciation rates. However, evaluations of such predictions are hampered owing to the lack of empirical data spanning both wide temporal and geographical scales. Here, using phylogenetic methods, we show that smaller clupeiform fish (anchovies and herrings) occurred historically in warmer waters, moved the shortest distances at low speed and displayed the lowest speciation rates. Furthermore, fish moved faster and evolved rapidly under higher rates of temperature change but these historical rates are far lower than current warming rates. Our results predict a future where smaller clupeiform fish that have reduced ability to move will be more prevalent; this, in turn, may reduce future speciation.","We thank C.

We address this issue in a particular marine coastal ecosystem at SE Pacific: although kelp forests and urchin barrens are conspicuous benthic systems in rocky habitats, only a few studies have been focused on studying their successional patterns (especially following disturbances). In this work, we present successional pathways from micro-periphyton to macro-organisms observed during a 14-month period in kelp forests and urchin barrens in the Antofagasta Peninsula, Chile. The community composition and structure showed habitat-specific successional pathways with different dominant organisms in these two communities. Likewise, during their successional trajectories, both communities showed different number of discrete temporal stages. Kelp forests displayed a longer successional pathway of 7 discrete stages, while the barren bed succession pathway was composed only of 4 stages. We argue that this difference would be due to self-organising processes. This finding may have relevant implications for conservation and monitoring, since the intensive harvest of kelp species will not only increase the dominance of urchin barrens, but it would also facilitate its own, self-determined, more efficient (with few steps) successional pattern and the consequent persistence.","RAU was sponsored by GRANT MECESUP/MECE ANT0711 (Chile).

Even though monads are technically language-agnostic, they are mostly associated with the Haskell language. Indeed, one could argue that the use of monads is one of the defining characteristic of the Haskell language. In practical terms, monadic programming in Haskell relies on the standard mtl package library, which provides eight core notions of computation: identity, error, list, state, reader, writer, RWS, and continuations. Despite their widespread use, we are not aware of any empirical investigations regarding which monads are the most used by developers. In this paper we present an empirical study that covers a snapshot of available packages in the Hackage repository—covering 85135 packages and more than five million Haskell files. To the best of our knowledge this is the first large-scale analysis of Hackage with regards to monads and their usage as dependencies. Our results show that around 30.8% of the packages depend on the mtl package, whereas only 1.2% depend on alternative, yet compatible implementations. Nevertheless, usage patterns for each specific monad remain similar both for mtl and alternatives. Finally, the state monad is by far the most popular one, although all of them are used. We also report on the distribution of packages that use mtl, regarding their category and stability level.",This work is partially funded by FONDECYT Postdoctoral Project 3150672.

203,pub.1141414871,10.1111/exsy.12830,,,Multi‐start iterated local search metaheuristic for the multi‐mode resource‐constrained project scheduling problem,"Abstract In this paper a multi‐start iterated local search (MS‐ILS) algorithm is presented as a new and effective approach to solve the multi‐mode resource‐constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP). The MRCPSP is a well‐known project scheduling NP‐Hard optimization problem, in which there is a trade‐off between the duration of each project activity and the amount of resources they require to be completed. The proposed algorithm generates an initial solution, performs a local search to obtain a local optimum, subsequently, for a certain number of iterations, makes a perturbation to that local optimum and performs a new local search on the perturbed solution. This whole process then restarts with a different initial solution for a certain number of restarts. The algorithm was tested on benchmark instances of projects with 30, 50 and 100 activities from well‐known libraries. The obtained results were compared to recent benchmark results from the literature. The proposed algorithm outperforms other solution methods found in related literature for the largest tested instances (100 activities), while for smaller instances it shows to be quite competitive, in terms of the average deviation against known lower bounds.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was supported by Universidad Panamericana [grant number UP‐CI‐2020‐GDL‐07‐ING].

To address this issue, we use a measure of competition that captures three major characteristics of market competition in a spatial context: the number of competitors, based on distance buffers; the size of competitors, measured by the enrollment of voucher schools; and the geographical distance among public schools and their competitors. To control for the potential endogeneity of our measure of spatial competition on public schools’ efficiency, we use an instrumental variable based on the discontinuites generated by admissions municipality boundaries . We do not find evidence that public schools’ efficiency increases or decreases as the result of the increment of voucher schools located near to public schools, an increase in the enrollment of existing voucher schools, or both factors simultaneously. This result is robust to: (1) the limit of education market or other measures of spatial competition; (2) the methodology used to compute the efficiency measures; and (3) whether we explain efficiency or educational performance.",,,Journal of Education Policy,,,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,2023-01-02,38,1,115-140,Closed,Article,"Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo; Cortés, Yasna; Sarrias, Mauricio","Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Cortés, Yasna (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Sarrias, Mauricio (Facultad de Economía y Negocios, Universidad de Talca, Talca, Chile)","Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo (Catholic University of the North)","Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo (Catholic University of the North); Cortés, Yasna (Catholic University of the North); Sarrias, Mauricio (University of Talca)",1,1,,0.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140779161,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

Here, individuals of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus from two different geographical populations exposed to contrasting environmental conditions (i.e. estuarine versus open coastal conditions) were used in a reciprocal transplant and a laboratory experiment with the aim of determining the grade of of local adaptation to their native sites, as well as their sensibility to ocean acidification. After characterizing environmentally the coastal habitats, a set of life-history traits and a phenotypic plasticity index were determined for both mussel populations. From the reciprocal transplant experiment, we observed that mussels originally coming from the estuarine habitat exhibited a distinctive performance pattern usually associated with physiological stress (i.e. higher metabolic rates, lower calcification and growth rates) leading to important physiological trade-offs and higher levels of phenotypic plasticity. Alternatively, mussels originating from the open coastal site showed lower physiological phenotypic plasticity suggesting a high grade of local adaptation to their habitat. In addition, both populations responded very similarly to lower pH conditions (i.e. increased metabolic rates with no important effects on growth and calcification, and lower physiological phenotypic plasticity). The study results indicated that overall estuarine conditions more than isolated pH changes would be modulating the performance and the level of phenotypic plasticity of the two P. purpuratus geographical populations studied. Our study also emphasizes the necessity of characterizing phenotypic plasticity under multiple-driver environments to cast more accurate predictions about the susceptibility of marine biota to future climate stressors such as ocean acidification.","We thank to Luis Prado, Paula Salgado, Sylvana Galaz and Araceli Rodríguez-Romero for their help during the experiments.

202,pub.1138776477,10.1016/j.quaint.2021.06.005,,,A multi-proxy reconstruction of depositional environment of a Late Pleistocene submerged site from the Central Coast of Chile (32°): Implications for drowned sites,"Site GNL Quintero 1 (GNLQ1), located on the central Chilean coast (32°S), remains the only submerged fini-Pleistocene landscape reported for the southeastern Pacific coast to date. This unique site is characterized by a high frequency and diversity of extinct terrestrial faunal remains supported within a fine-grained sedimentary matrix. Several studies have been performed on the faunal assemblage; however, the sedimentary environment in which the site was formed still remains unclear. In this work, stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical analyses conducted on two marine cores are combined with seismic data to determine the depositional conditions affecting the formation of this exceptional shallowly buried submerged landscape. Previous results indicated that site GNLQ1 formed, at least between 28 and 21 ka, in an aquifer-fed freshwater lagoon that developed on a fluvial plain. Here, we show a three-stage sedimentological evolution. In the first stage, a shallow restricted freshwater lagoon formed under relatively arid conditions. Subsequently, the lagoon expanded and deepened under the humid climatic conditions that affected central Chile during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Finally, around 8.5-8 ka, the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT) submerged the site, probably eroding the Late Pleistocene – Early Holocene part of the sequence. Currently, the site lies at ca. 13 m b.s.l. within the shoreface of present-day Quintero Bay, 650 m from the current shoreline. This enhanced understanding of GNLQ1's evolution offers a new perspective on resource availability on the coastal shelf of western South America during the Late Pleistocene, as well as highlighting the unexpected paleontological potential of this area and encouraging future archaeological research of potential prehistoric evidence within these drowned landscapes.","This research was funded by grant FPCI 28-0817 from the Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad de Chile.

These findings offer a unique opportunity to investigate the mineral-forming and depositional processes in fumarolic environments. Chemical and mineral characterization was performed using XRD and SEM-EDS techniques, whereas petrologic and microthermometry methods, in addition to Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, were conducted to the physicochemical characterization of fluid inclusions. Characterizations of these fluid inclusions show high‑boron concentrations associated with crystalline phases of sassolite and boron-rich aqueous solutions in fluid inclusions. Analyses based on fluid inclusions reveal two potentially fluid sources: (i) a deep source with higher temperatures (up to 220 °C) and saline fluids (>8 wt% NaCl equivalent), in the presence of CO2, H2S, SO2, and CH4; and (ii) a shallower source with lower temperatures (between 113 and 163 °C) and salinities (<6 wt% NaCl equivalent). Those fluids from the shallower source were affected by dilution processes within the hydrothermal system of the Guallatiri volcano. Concentrations up to 30 wt% B(OH)3 were found in fluid inclusions from the deeper source. The mineralogical and petrological evidence suggests that sassolite was formed by direct deposition of the gas phase. In contrast, sulfate minerals were formed from condensation, leaching, and precipitation processes before being deposited at the surface. These results are a significant contribution to the knowledge of boron-rich fluid inclusions associated with active magmatic-hydrothermal systems.","We would like to thank the “Unidad de Equipamiento Científico” (MAINI) team at the Universidad Católica del Norte for allowing us to use the XRD equipment, and José Sepúlveda for their support in the fieldwork.

In the subtropical Andes of north-central Chile and adjacent areas, this paucity has been detected in radiocarbon ages between 8000 and 6000 cal BP. A systematic programme of cave excavations with detailed chronologies in the Combarbalá area in the Andean western foothills at 31°S allows questioning the role these spaces and ecosystems played for hunter-gatherers throughout the Holocene. The elusive record of dateable material has been addressed by excavating deposits under rock-shelters which tend to trap sedimentary material. This dataset has been compared with the available climate records and shows a collation between the onset of various site chronologies during the early-to-middle Holocene and periods of extreme aridity. The organization of mobility and the role of Andean foothills for hunter-gatherer settlements is reviewed. Resource availability in the area, namely fresh water supply, good-quality toolstones, faunal resources, and shelters, attracted mobile populations to these environments as indicated by our records as well as others in the broader region.","We are grateful for the collaboration of the following colleagues and students: Donald Jackson, Mario Rivera, Víctor Lucero, Andrés Troncoso, Víctor Méndez, Cristián González, Javiera Mardones, Bárbara Thompson, Felipe Gutiérrez, Macarena Fernández, Daniela Villalón, Boris Santander, Macarena Barrera, Joaquín Crisóstomo, Pedro Fuentes, and Tamara Chacón.

Even, many tectonic models supported by surface geological data have ignored how is the continuity of these structures in the subsurface, and also their possible relation with ancient preorogenic structures, thus difficulting the understanding of the main tectonic mechanisms that acted during the Andean uplift. To solve this problem, we discussed in this study the geometry and timing of the basement‐involved contractional structures present in the Pre‐Andean basins of northern Chile. We present field and seismic evidences of different basement‐involved structural styles, including reverse faults, inverted normal faults, basement thrust ramps, and rotated and reworked basin margins, and use it them to produce three large structural cross‐sections showing the geometries and distribution of structures along the inner forearc region. The structures are interpreted to have resulted from basin inversion, which was followed by large reverse faulting accumulating 43 km in the Salar de Atacama, 10 km in the Salar de Punta Negra, and 27 km in the Salar de Pedernales. Major reverse faults are predominantly located along the western and eastern edges of the basins, whereas inverted normal faults, basement thrust ramps, and other structures are confined to the central sections. In this context, large basement thrust ramps and reverse faults are the most effective structures for generating crustal thickening. Previous analyses (U‐Pb dating) of synorogenic deposits over inverted structures and apatite fission track data from Paleozoic basement prerift rocks suggest that contraction in the region began in the Late Cretaceous‐Paleocene and continued throughout the Cenozoic; however, basement rocks experienced rapid cooling due to tectonic uplift during the Eocene. Further, the results indicate that basement‐involved contractional structures are not only generated by flat‐slab subduction processes, but also observed in other regions of northern Chile (e.g., Frontal Cordillera). Finally, we conclude that the observed structural complexity predominantly results from the initial distribution of preorogenic extensional structures.
Key Points    We present the first restoration of three regional cross‐sections that show the distribution, geometry, and kinematics of contractional structures along the inner forearc region at northern Chile   Late Cretaceous basin inversion   Basement‐involved contractional faults and folds are strongly controlled by the reactivation of previous zones of crustal weakness in the upper crust","This study presents the initial results of the research project PCI‐2019/133349‐8, supported by ANID‐Chile “Tectono‐stratigraphic evolution of intermontane basins related to forearc tectonic settings using the Chilean Pre‐Andean Depression of the Central Andes as a case study.” This project was developed through international cooperation between the Universidad Católica del Norte and the University of Sao Paulo‐Brazil.

Collective emotional gatherings strengthen social cohesion, enhance personal and collective self-esteem, positive affect, and positive shared beliefs among participants, through processes of emotional synchrony. Furthermore, perceived emotional synchrony is associated with experiencing qualitatively different self-transcendent and enjoyment emotions. In Study 1 we compared the effects of participating in Sunday Mass and other secular Sunday activities on enhancement of transcendence beliefs and collective self-esteem and tested the mediational role of perceived emotional synchrony and self-transcendent and enjoyment emotions. In Study 2 serial mediational analyses supported a model in which perceived emotional synchrony increases self-transcendent and enjoyment emotions, which subsequently foster enhancement of positive outcomes (controlling for the baseline) of participation in ritualized folkloric event. The results are discussed from the perspective of neo-Durkheimian model of ritual, emphasizing the role of perceived emotional synchrony over self-trascendent emotions, and from a socio-cultural approach to well-being.",,"This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [under Grants PSI2014–51923-P / PSI2017–84145-P], the Basque Government [under Grant IT-1187-19], the University of the Basque Country [under Grant IT-666-13, Postdoctoral ESPDOC18/33] and FONDECYT Iniciación 11190980 granted to Anna Wlodarczyk.",Current Psychology,,,,2021-05-11,2021,2021-05-11,2023-02,42,6,4754-4771,Closed,Article,"Wlodarczyk, Anna; Zumeta, Larraitz; Basabe, Nekane; Rimé, Bernard; Páez, Dario","Wlodarczyk, Anna (Escuela de Psicología, Casa Central, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

This process has been previously reported in rivers of the Atacama Desert impacted by mining. The removal of waste in these rivers is a complex environmental scenario that involves (i) mining operation plans, (ii) the spatio-temporal variability of precipitation events and, (iii) the sediment-transport pathways within the drainage network. This work presents how flash floods triggered by extreme storm events determine the redistribution and the variation of elemental concentrations of the suspended load fraction in a river with several historical and actual mine wastes situated in the Atacama Desert. The concentrations of Cu, Pb, As and Hg measured in two sampling stations of a mining segment of the Copiapó River after flash floods are lower compared to the concentrations measured in the period before these hydrometeorological events. However, the concentrations of these metals and metalloids increased in areas distant from the mine clusters, where the values observed before the flash floods were lower. The redistributions of the element concentrations can be explained by the occurrence of two major flood events triggered by the extreme storm events of March 2015 and May 2017. The combination of the element concentrations with calculated geo-accumulation indexes shows the potential source of geochemical anomalies for these elements. Cu and Hg anomalies are induced by historical mining activities in the Copiapó River while Pb and As concentrations agree with the regional background. Some Pb and As anomalies would be associated with the geology of the zone where the main cluster of mine exploitations are present. The fact that flash floods result in Cu, Pb, As and Hg concentrations in sediment load more in line with the local background, suggests that this type of hydrometeorological events probably represent the natural processes of geochemical recovery of arid river impacted by metal mining.","This work was supported by the Basal Project of the Advanced Mining Technology Center financed by ANID Project AFB0004, Government of Chile.

However, traditional FCMs have the limitation of not representing the indeterminacy situations presented in many decision-making problems. To overcome this limitation, neutrosophic cognitive maps (NCMs) were proposed as a new extension of traditional FCMs. Nevertheless, the way that NCMs reported in the bibliography handle the indeterminacy is still insufficient since they cannot quantify the degree of indeterminacy. Moreover, there are decision-making problems in which decisions should be considered as a sequence of decisions hardly interconnected in sequential order. This situation is presented in scenarios such as projects evaluation characterized by the existence of multiple interconnected processes (diagnosis, decision, and prediction). The lack of a suitable FCMs topology for modeling this kind of decision-making problems constitutes another challenging issue of FCMs. This paper presents a new neutrosophic cognitive map based on triangular neutrosophic numbers for multistage sequential decision-making problems (MS-TrNCM). In the proposed model, all the map’s connections are represented by triangular neutrosophic numbers, making it possible for decision makers to express their preferences considering the truth, indeterminacy, and falsity degrees. Furthermore, a new topology for representing multistage sequential processes is introduced. The suggested MS-TrNCM is applied to make diagnoses, decisions, and predictions during the evaluation of 1011 projects records from project evaluation database ”uci-gp-eval-201903051137” provided by the University of Informatics Sciences. In validation process, the superiority of the proposed MS-TrNCM over the NCMs and traditional FCMs has been demonstrated.",,,International Journal of Fuzzy Systems,,,,2021-02-05,2021,2021-02-05,2021-04,23,3,657-679,Closed,Article,"Al-subhi, Salah Hasan; Papageorgiou, Elpiniki I.; Pérez, Pedro Piñero; Mahdi, Gaafar Sadeq S.; Acuña, Luis Alvarado","Al-subhi, Salah Hasan (Grupo de Investigaciones en Gestión de Proyectos, Universidad de las Ciencias Informáticas, Carretera a San Antonio km 2 1/2, 54830, La Habana, Cuba); Papageorgiou, Elpiniki I.

Most of this extension has been produced by normal faulting along submeridian branches of the Atacama Fault System (AFS). During the Late Quaternary, several of these faults have built conspicuous metric-scale normal faulting scarps in alluvial deposits; the construction of these scarps has been related, in some cases, to M~7 normal faulting paleoearthquakes. On the contrary, shortening during this time span has only been locally reported. Until now, no metric-scale reverse faulting scarps have been documented along submeridian strands of the AFS. This study presents novel evidence corresponding to reverse fault scarps produced during the Late Quaternary by three NNE and NNW trending faults in the outer forearc between 22.5°S and 23°S: the El Toro (ETF), Caliche (CF), and Sierra Valenzuela (SVF) faults. These scarps, with up to 2.5 m height, developed in basement rocks, pre-Quaternary, and/or Quaternary alluvial deposits. Based on their characteristics and the evidence suggesting that similar fault scarps in the Andean forearc have a seismogenic origin, we interpret that these neotectonic landforms were produced by single reverse faulting paleoearthquakes. Considering the maximum scarp height as a proxy for the coseismic slip and fault length as a proxy for surface rupture length, we have estimated magnitudes between M6.2 and M6.9 for the causative rupture events. To discuss how reverse crustal faulting may be related to the interseismic and/or coseismic stages of the subduction cycle, we perform elastic dislocation models to calculate the horizontal displacement fields (at 0 and 20 km depth) induced by the interplate locking distribution in the area (over a seismic cycle) and three megathrust earthquakes (Antofagasta, 1995, Tocopilla, 2007, and a synthetic rupture). Modeling results suggest that the studied faults may experience reverse slip during both stages of the subduction cycle. We propose that the ETF, CF and SVF are faults capable of producing moderate-to-large earthquakes in the future. Finally, we reinforce the need to address the earthquake potential of the studied faults, and others similar to them, to acquire a complete assessment of the seismic hazard in the northern Chile outer forearc.","Research undertaken by the first author is financed by the 11180509 Fondecyt Iniciación project.

Currently, there is a growing appreciation of the perception of the social and natural environment as a valuable tool for the management of tourist beaches, as the opinions of users are essential to evaluate beach management proposals and policies. Chile has one of the longest coastlines in the world, where sandy beaches are one of the most interesting coastal habitats for the tourism industry. Based on traditional knowledge of a socioeconomic stratification of users along Playa La Herradura (Coquimbo), we studied the perception of the level of quality of different indicators and the degree of satisfaction of beach users in three different sectors through semistructured interviews. The analysis showed a not good enough evaluation by all users, a higher demand at the highest socioeconomic levels and a series of factors that require urgent attention from the municipality, such as litter in the sand, the growing accumulation of stranded algae and the presence of stray dogs. To advance beach management, we propose the development of a “management ecosystem” for sandy tourist beaches, including a central government that promotes decentralization of management, a municipality with high governance power, academic institutions with high public involvement and a civil society that mobilizes bottom-up processes.","The study of the perception of environmental quality was carried out as a requirement to obtain the title of Marine Biologist at the Universidad Católica del Norte by the second author.

A large number of archaeological sites from this period have been found along the borders of the Imilac and Punta Negra (24.5°S) high‐altitude basins (ca. 3,000 masl). By combining the results of proxy data obtained from geomorphological, sedimentological, and paleoecological (rodent middens) archives and the spatial location of archaeological sites and radiocarbon series analyses, this paper examines the links between human activities and paleoenvironmental dynamics at different times during CAPE II in the southern Atacama Desert. This is done at a finer spatial and temporal scale than previous studies. The first archaeological sites (ca. 12,000–11,200 cal years BP) are concomitant with increased paleowetland occurrence frequency. An occupational hiatus is recorded between 11,200 and 10,800 cal years BP, synchronous with a drop in precipitation and wetland development. This is followed by a displacement of the archaeological sites toward the south‐east of the Punta Negra Basin and concomitant again with a second peak of wetland development in the area (10,800–10,400 cal years BP) before the final abandonment of the salt flat margins.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank CONAF (Corporación Nacional Forestal) and the National Park Service Antofagasta for their support of our work at the Llullaillaco National Park.

Currently, there is particular concern for the Galapagos Sailfin Grouper (Mycteroperca olfax), a regionally endemic species showing signs of severe decline and targeted by the white-fin fishery, a multi-species coastal fishery of high market value. Within this context, the Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD) and local NGOs have designed a policy consistent in a product certification scheme aiming to shift fishing efforts from depleted coastal fisheries to healthier pelagic stocks, whilst supporting artisanal fisher’s livelihoods. Using a discrete choice experiment and accompanying survey data, the goal of this research is to analyze the preferences and tradeoffs made by individuals across attributes when purchasing certified fish in the Galapagos. In particular, we account for pro-environmental attitudes within a WTP space model specification and estimate the expected price premiums that tourists would be willing to pay for yellowfin tuna in the area in light of specific characteristics of its local value chain. We find that tourists visiting the Galapagos hold pro environmental attitudes as measured by the New-ecological paradigm and that there is a considerable increase in consumer’s utility from a certification scheme. Tourists care about the level of bycatch associated with their consumption, food safety, quality, and whether is locally sourced, and would be willing to pay for these attributes. This evidence, driven by location specific characteristics of consumers and tourists, supports the design of market-based mechanisms for sustainable yellow fin tuna fisheries in the Galapagos","We thank researchers from the Fisheries project at the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park for their valuable comments and input; we also thank Dr. Andrés Vallone and the Environmental Economics seminar at the University of Hamburg for helpful suggestions.

Here we address these problems using 15 lower crustal xenoliths from the Diavik A-154 kimberlite, Slave craton, Canada. Iron‑magnesium exchange geothermometry on small biotite and amphibole inclusions in garnet indicates that the Slave craton lower crust was at a temperature of ≤500 °C at the time of kimberlite eruption (~55 Ma). The ambient lower crustal temperature was likely lower than 500 °C because the thermometers record the closure temperature of diffusional Fe2+-Mg exchange between touching mineral pairs. New measurements of K, U and Th concentrations in the constituent minerals, together with xenolith modes, allow reconstruction of the heat-producing element (HPE) K, U, and Th budget of the Slave craton lower crust. Metasedimentary granulites have an average heat production of 0.29 ± 0.01 μW/m3 (n = 3) whereas mafic granulites have an average heat production of 0.13 ± 0.03 μW/m3 (n = 12). Our new data clearly show that plagioclase abundance in both lithologies has a major influence on overall lower crustal heat production, being an important reservoir of all three HPE. Combining the heat production of mafic and metasedimentary granulites in their observed 80:20 proportions results in an average heat production value for the Slave craton lower crust of 0.16 ± 0.03 μW/m3. Using these heat production estimates, modeled Moho temperatures beneath Diavik of ~450–470 °C are broadly consistent with maximum lower crustal temperatures indicated by geothermometry. The low HPE contents predicted for cratonic lower crust must result in lower temperatures in the deep crust and mantle lithosphere, and in turn higher estimates for the thickness of mantle lithosphere. This effect becomes larger as the thickness of the low-HPE lower crustal layer increases. In the specific case of the central Slave craton, we find that model estimates of the diamond potential of the mantle lithosphere, as judged by the proportion of lithospheric mantle in the diamond stability field, are not strongly affected by small variations in lower crustal heat production and Moho temperature.",We thank Matthew Hardman for useful discussions and assistance in preparing the manuscript.

Evidence for OECD countries,"The false hope that economic development would lead to a decrease in fossil sources’ energy consumption can be an obstacle to fighting global warming. Is it realistic to expect that more knowledge will lead public policymakers to take more decisive action to mitigate climate change’s adverse effects? This research attempts to answer both premises using data for developed countries with high human capital levels: 27-member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-OECD during 1980–2015. Access to energy and that it is non-polluting is raised as a goal of the Sustainable Development Goals. We combine linear and non-linear models: we specifically employ threshold regressions and second-generation cointegration techniques, FMOLS, and causality. Our results are disappointing for the first premise: economic development does not reduce energy consumption from fossil sources. However, human capital does decrease the consumption of non-renewable energy. In order to capture current trends in economies, we include the globalization index, the urbanization rate, and services. The results of the cointegration tests suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables. Our results indicate that the human capital index and globalization are the last hope to promote the transition to a more sustainable energy matrix in developed countries.","The authors express their gratitude with the Club de Investigación de Economía.

In this study, diel changes in MBI structure (species composition, density, and biomass) and functions (trophic groups and isotopic diversity indices) were examined on coral reefs at Rapa Nui (27° S, 109° W). Diurnal and nocturnal surveys (March 2016) revealed that echinoderms were the dominant invertebrates throughout the diel cycle in terms of density, biomass, and their trophic role. The density and biomass of MBI were higher at night than during the day. Significant diel changes were detected in the structure of MBI and trophic groups, where the diurnal assemblages were mostly herbivores and the nocturnal assemblages were mostly detritivores. Moreover, the isotopic uniqueness index indicated that nocturnal MBI were trophically more redundant than their diurnal counterparts; consequently, the high nocturnal biodiversity did not necessarily increase trophic diversity. This time and trophic partitioning of MBI could have important consequences for energy transfer on the reefs and must be considered in future monitoring programs. Endemic taxa represented approximately a quarter of the species (26%), but had low density and biomass during both time periods, suggesting a modest influence on energy transfers on these coral reefs. However, their restricted geographic distribution and current low abundances could make these species vulnerable to extinction; therefore, management and conservation actions in the new multiple-use marine protected area of Rapa Nui should include these species.","Our thanks go to Ricardo and Pedro Hitorangi, Victor Icka, and Enrique Hey from Rapa Nui for their collaboration in the field; to Sergio Rapu and the Rapa Nui Heritage Foundation for providing land and facilities for our on-island laboratory; to Tortuga and Orca dive centers for scuba diving support; to Amelia Fowles for her collaboration during the field work; to Jorge Avilés and Camila Henriquez from Sala de Colecciones Biológicas UCN (SCBUCN) for their help with the curation of voucher specimens, and Kaitlin McConnell for an early English revision of the manuscript and for their comments.

Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABR), a TURF system implemented in Chile, offers the opportunity to test this hypothesis. The management in these areas is based mainly on the assessment of the resources population status, with low or no consideration of the ecological - environmental effects that condition their productivity. In this study, we evaluate ecological trophic dynamics of the rocky subtidal community configuration in four periods along 20 years of the highly productive Choros Island MEABR – MPA, including one pre-implementation period. In this TURF, the carnivore gastropod Concholepas concholepas (locally known as “loco”) is the main targeted resource. The performance of ecosystem indexes of this TURF increased during the MEABR regime as compared with the pre MEABR implementation. Nevertheless, the most conspicuous increase occurred in 2013, primarily in response to changes in environmental conditions and their direct and indirect effects on community interactions. The analysis of interactions between guilds indicated that the main drivers were the interaction between the primary productivity, prey abundance and the top predator loco. This produces a long-term dynamic of the system modulated by the interplay of environmental variability, which at benthic community level increases prey populations thus sustaining increased loco productivity. In turn, intensified predation of loco reduces its prey. This produces natural productivity fluctuations, which counteract the expected outcome of management actions, impeding to achieve stable landings in the long term.",This research was supported from Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT).

193,pub.1135361504,10.1002/aqc.3499,,,Local and remote physical processes driving variability of the planktonic system in the Juan Fernández Archipelago: A multidisciplinary framework providing conservation insights,"Abstract    The Juan Fernandez Ridge, a vulnerable marine ecosystem located far off the coast of central Chile and formed by several seamounts, guyots and three islands (Robinson Crusoe, Santa Clara and Alejandro Selkirk), has recently been declared a Coastal Marine Protected Area of Multiple Uses with several National Parks embedded in it.   Recent studies have highlighted the influence of remote and local oceanographic structures on the hydrographic dynamics of this ridge. However, there is still a gap in understanding how they affect the structure and dynamics of the surrounding insular planktonic communities.   A hydroacoustic and oceanographic survey was conducted during the austral spring (October 2016), including hydrographic and zooplankton sampling around Robinson Crusoe Island. Oceanographic features were identified and tracked using satellite data (chlorophyll‐a (Chl‐a) and sea surface temperature) and modelling results.    Two events of Chl‐a increase relative to a threshold (>0.45 mg m −3 ) were forced by different physical processes, both affecting the western side of Robinson Crusoe Island. In event A during the cruise period, Chl‐a subsurface maxima were associated with the arrival of a coastal meander originating on the continental shelf off Chile (remote process); the zooplankton was dominated by copepods and salps, with an evident coastal–oceanic gradient. In event B, Chl‐a maxima were linked to a local upwelling forced by the intensification of a localized SSW wind. No influence of remote eddies or local Von Kármán vortices on Chl‐a distribution was observed.    These findings highlight the influence of remote and local physical processes on the structure of planktonic communities around Robinson Crusoe Island. Understanding the variability of these mechanisms and their effects at the base of the pelagic food web is critical in adopting an ecosystem‐level approach.","We greatly appreciate the support of the Chilean Navy for facilitating cruise permissions and support for the logistics at sea at RC Island.

We engage the topic from a stance examining the coloniality of knowledge in educational leadership by centering Indigenous knowledge systems in the academy as a means to disrupt Euro-colonial hegemonic knowledging. We ask: How do we challenge the “grammar of coloniality” of Western knowledge and affirm the possibilities of a reimagining of “new geographies” and cartographies of knowledge as varied and intersecting ontologies and epistemologies that inform our human condition as “learning experiences, research, and knowledge generation” practices? The paper highlights epistemic possibilities of multicentricity, that is, multiple ways of knowledge as critical to understanding the complete history of ideas and events that have shaped and continue to shape human growth and development.

However, little is known about these fisheries, the spatial heterogeneity in which they are found, and the factors that explain this heterogeneity. In Chile, the distinct environmental regimes driven by the Humboldt Current System can contribute to a high diversity in the species targeted by small-scale fisheries. Through a Chilean case-study, we aimed to characterize how environmental and socio-economic conditions influence small-scale benthic fisheries in 15 coves, straddling two biogeographic regions along 24 degrees of latitude (ca. 2600 km) and administered by a nation-wide management framework. We compiled and analyzed a long-term database generated by a standardized monitoring protocol in order to determine how fishing techniques, benthic resource diversity, effort and fishers’ income vary along the coastline. Our results highlighted that small-scale fisheries are strongly influenced by the variations in the environmental conditions, which determine variations in landings along the coast. Our analyses also illustrated how fishers seek to ensure their livelihoods by dealing with regional and local environmental conditions, ecology of marine resources, socio-economic context and a management system that is not able to accommodate fisheries’ heterogeneity. Our results suggest that future changes to the Chilean management system should integrate the spatial variation observed among small-scale fisheries to ensure sustainable livelihoods of the fishers and conservation of the marine resources. Fishery management rules should be shaped according to the region where they are applied, moving from homogeneous nation-wide systems, or systems adapted from administrative divisions to differentiated co-management systems based on biogeographic units.","We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of GIS manager Oscar Gallo and all the field coordinators and scientific observers from Arica to Carelmapu from the National Fisheries Support Institute (IFOP).

191,pub.1133879313,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125589,,,"Ecological footprint, air quality and research and development: The role of agriculture and international trade","With economic development, there is a growing demand for food and manufactured products that put direct pressure on air and soil quality, limiting sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations establish 17 objectives that guide public policies within countries. The achievement of the SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG12, SDG14 and SDG15 goals, which are totally or partially related to environmental quality, depends mainly on the ability to generate new processes and industrial products friendly to the environment. Innovation arising from research and development (R&D) can be decisive in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of R&D on environmental degradation as measured by ecological footprint and air quality, including the role of agriculture and trade. The theoretical framework that supports the methodological strategy is the environmental Kuznets curve. To capture the role of geography, we used the World Bank classification of regions. Using second-generation cointegration techniques and panel data for 77 countries during 1996–2016, we found a cointegration relationship between R&D and environmental degradation, agriculture, and trade. The results of the FMOLS model suggest a heterogeneous impact of research and development on environmental degradation. Likewise, our results show that there is bidirectional causality between air quality R&D and between the ecological footprint and R&D. In East Asia and the Pacific region, there is a two-way causality between air quality and R&D, and a one-way causal relationship ranging from the ecological footprint to R&D. In the Middle East and North Africa, we find a one-way causal relationship ranging from the ecological footprint to R&D. Finally, we find that there is one-way causality from R&D to ecological footprint in North America, Europe, and Central Asia. The investigation ends with a call for policymakers to use R&D, agriculture, and trade as mechanisms to mitigate air and soil degradation.","The authors express their gratitude with the Club de Investigación de Economía.

Commercial salmon farming requires a significant level of certainty regarding fish count, average weight measurement, live weight distribution, and other production indicators. A reliable control system for assessing the biomass of farmed Atlantic salmon is essential for sustainable and cost-effective precision aquaculture. A study was done in four production sea-cages in a Chilean Atlantic salmon marine grow-out farm to estimate the average weight and frequency distribution utilizing the Vaki Biomassdaily® diode frames as an alternate technology to manual weight measurement. From post-smolt reception to fish harvest, diode frames were put in each sea-cage in a secure position for 15 months. There were no significant changes in length or average weight between manual sampling and frame estimate. The mean degree of accuracy for the average weight estimation was 98.83 % for the frames utilized in the four sea cages. The diode frames also achieved a high degree of precision in predicting the frequency distribution of fish. There were no statistically significant variations between the distribution variances of the diode frame measurements and the distribution variances of the fish received at the fish processing facility (FPF). The maximum difference between the average weight calculated by the frames and the average weight of the fish received in the processing facility was 2.4 %, with 99.66 % being the highest accuracy with only 19 g of difference. We determined that diode frames might replace manual weight assessments with greater reliability for growth monitoring and production management. To assure the optimal performance of the diode frames in terms of accuracy and precision for future commercial-scale validations in the salmon farming business, the development of a standard best practice manual is necessary.","This research was generated as part of a Master’s thesis titled “Validation of the Biomassdaily® biomass estimation technology for weight and growth control of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in a commercial production site from the Aysén Region, Chile”.

184,pub.1139604700,10.4314/jlt.v51i1.1,,,Translating the Test of Academic Literacy Levels into Sesotho,"This article reports on an initiative at the Vaal Triangle Campus (VTC) of North-West University (NWU) towards the active encouragement of functional multilingualism in tertiary education. More specifically, in an effort to support the potential use of Sesotho (Southern Sotho) and isiZulu in the teaching-learning environment at this campus, it was decided that an important first step should be an accurate and reliable determination of students’ levels of academic literacy (AL) in these two languages. Such a measurement would provide an  indication of student readiness to make productive use of any extra learning support offered in these languages. Since there are no measuring instruments available to assess students’ academic literacy levels in Sesotho and isiZulu at tertiary level, it was decided thattranslating an existing test may be the most productive option in this case. The test selected for translation into Sesotho and isiZulu was the Test of Academic Literacy Levels (TALL), a test that has consistently shown high reliability measures in the assessment of students’academic literacy levels in English. Because Sesotho is the home language used by the majority of students (other than English and Afrikaans) at the VTC, it was decided that Sesotho would be treated as priority in terms of the completion of the project. The article  therefore documents the translation process for Sesotho, and discusses primarily positive findings regarding the creation of a conceptually and functionally adequate Sesotho version of the TALL through a process of translation.",,,Journal for Language Teaching,,,,2021-07-05,2021,2021-07-05,,51,1,1-35,Closed,Article,"Butler, Gustav","Butler, Gustav ()",,"Butler, Gustav ()",1,1,,1.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139604700,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Cerro Overo maar was formed <77 ka ago by explosive-effusive eruptions, including phreatomagmatic activity, while La Albóndiga lava dome (Pleistocene) is the result of magmatic explosive-effusive activity alone. Cerro Overo and La Albóndiga are characterized by deposits composed of pyroclastic rocks and dense coherent lava blocks. At Cerro Overo, these deposits are located around the crater rim, while at La Albóndiga, they form coherent in situ lava dome features. Cerro Overo also displays thin ash- and lapilli-dominated deposit layers presumed to be pyroclastic surge deposits, which include juvenile pyroclasts exhibiting cauliflower textures, numerous exotic accidental lithics, and ballistically transported lapilli, bombs, blocks, and bomb sags. These fragments include recycled, juvenile pyroclasts, as well as material from older volcanic and intrusive rocks from the stratigraphic units immediately below. These small-volume volcanoes represent two of the less silicic volcanoes (~54 wt.% SiO2) in the northern Chilean Pleistocene to Holocene volcanic provinces. They are characterized by a fine grain size (mainly fine lapilli), olivine phenocrysts with skeletal textures, ignimbritic, dioritic, and granitic xenoliths, and quartz xenocrysts, with high concentrations of incompatible trace elements and light rare earth elements. The general magmatic evolution of the Cerro Overo and La Albóndiga systems has been controlled by fast ascent (e.g., skeletal olivine phenocrysts) of mantle-derived magma associated with mixing, fractional crystallization, and a low degree of crustal assimilation during turbulent ascent processes. Such eruptions provide evidence that various factors play an essential role in the transition from explosive-effusive magmatic (Cerro Overo and La Albóndiga) to phreatomagmatic (Cerro Overo) volcanic eruption styles.","The authors wish to thank Dr. J.

Moreover, the magnesium compounds are themselves vital in agricultural, pharmaceutical, construction and broad industrial applications. Leaching is a critical step in the recovery of magnesium from magnesium-bearing ore, and the most common leaching agents are organic and inorganic acids, as well and ammonium salts, the efficacy of which depends on the mineral feed. Organic acids are used with minerals having fast leaching kinetics; these acids have less dissolving power but are more selective and are less destructive to the equipment. In contrast, inorganic acids have more dissolving power and are easier to source. However, the inorganic acids are less selective and cause more damage to equipment, as they complicate pH control. The objective of this work has been to review studies on the kinetics of magnesium mineral extraction, and the effects of critical parameters depending on the feed mineral and the reagents. Several works are presented on the leaching kinetics of natural and calcined dolomite and magnesite, and hydrated magnesium salts, as well as ferromagnesian silicates and serpentinite, which are important sources of magnesium. It has been shown that the most influential parameters in dissolving magnesium are the temperature and the reagent concentration, which have a direct effect on magnesium extraction rates. However, there is a point at which increases in these parameters result in more impurities and/or have insignificant effects on magnesium dissolution. Particle size has an inverse relationship to magnesium extraction since the area of contact with the leaching surface is greater with smaller particles. The effect of the agitation speed is insignificant with magnesite feeds, given that the process is controlled largely by surface chemical reactions, while the leaching kinetics of serpentinite is controlled by diffusion through the product layer.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.,,Hydrometallurgy,,,,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,201,,105573,Closed,Article,"González, Yessica; Navarra, Alessandro; Jeldres, Ricardo I.; Toro, Norman","González, Yessica (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Chile); Navarra, Alessandro (Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada); Jeldres, Ricardo I.

The salt flats of the Altiplano are hydrogeological and ecological systems highly dependent and sensitive to seasonal, interannual and inter-decadal variations in humidity; they may be markedly affected by anthropic activities. We focused on Ascotán and Carcote, two nearby salt flats located at more than 3,600 m of elevation at the border of Chile and Bolivia, to determinate the relationship between the depositional environments and recent hydrological conditions, which can be used as sensors of the particular climatic conditions of the Altiplano and anthropic activities in these systems. Results of analysis of sediment properties (mineralogical, geochemical and magnetic), the water (elemental composition) and diatom communities of the different springs in the salt flats showed that the water and sediments of Ascotán and Carcote salt flats were heterogeneous in granulometric, chemical, mineralogical and magnetic grain composition, both intra- and inter-salt flat. The content of saline facies tended to increase in zones furthest from the edge and close to the depocenter of the basin, whose sediments were composed mainly of finer size grains. Diatom diversity and species richness differed between salt flats, which were associated with characteristics of the brine composition, grain size and magnetic properties and were mostly affected by local abiotic factors of each spring. Four sub-environments were identified based on the variables measured: alluvial, marsh, lacustrine and evaporitic, mainly defined by the recharge of water input dominated by summer rainfalls and snow melt. Our results suggest that Ascotán and Carcote salt flats constitute excellent sensors of the air moisture from the Amazon Basin, both current and through the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene. Therefore, further studies using Ascotán and Carcote as model systems may be focused on identifying hydro-geo-ecological changes in millennia-term variability of humid periods, in addition to short-term pressure from mining activity.","This study was supported by authorities of I.

Under natural conditions most nutrients have a lithogenic origin, however, in agroecosystems their contents and distribution can be greatly altered by anthropogenic additions. To assess the origin and contribution of lithogenic and anthropogenic nutrient sources, we studied the rock-soil–water-fruit interfase in four vineyards of Central Chile located in the sites of Casablanca, San Antonio, Santa Cruz and San Javier, which are characterized by contrasting geological, geomorphological, and mesoclimatic conditions as well as the magnitude of anthropogenic influence. Detailed mapping and soil characterization were carried out at each vineyard. Additionally, parent rock, soil, berries, rain, irrigation water and groundwater were sampled and the distribution and behavior of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Na were studied. For berries, others elements such as N, S, B and Cl were considered. The geochemistry of soils was concordant with its lithological origin. However, Zn and Cu were dominantly anthropogenic due to atmospheric deposition and the use of agrochemicals. This was evidenced by their greater bioavailability in topsoil and by the chemistry of irrigation and rainwater. Across sites, berries displayed similar nutrient patterns by cultivar; K and S were concentrated in cv. Carmenere, while Ca, Mg and P were enriched in the cv. Pinot Noir. However, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu had a particular distribution at each plot, reflecting the unique interaction between environment, lithology, soil properties and viticultural practices. Factor Analysis showed a good correlation between soils and berries for K and ± Na, Fe, Cu and Mg, which implies that soil composition was reflected in the composition of the berries. Since geochemical, geological and environmental influences on the chemistry of berries were recognized, it is proposed that interdisciplinary critical zone studies should be undertaken to improve the sustainability of vineyard management strategies.",This work was performed through the CORFO 12CTI-16788 Project financed by the Government of Chile and the Consorcio I+D Vinos de Chile (Wines of Chile Research and Development Consortium).

As a center of strong physical and biological coupling processes, polynyas of the Amundsen Sea could act as sentinels of changes in atmosphere–ice–ocean interactions, offering a unique perspective into its sensitivity to climate variability. Here, we present a new, multiproxy-based high-resolution sedimentary record from the Amundsen Sea polynya, which provides new insights into environmental conditions of the region over the last 350 years and their linkages to climatic factors. Our results show that the polynya witnessed step-wise environmental shifts in parallel with the phases and strength of large-scale climate patterns, i.e., the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Notably, intersite correlation of on-shelf Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusion signals at different locals suggests that the CDW may have gained increased access to the shelves at the time of a strong coupling of positive SAM and El Niño states. We tentatively speculate that anomalous large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns over the Southern Hemisphere, forced by increasing greenhouse gas levels, were strongly involved in the mid-20th century CDW invigoration, which may be greater in scale that goes well beyond the Amundsen Sea region. This result is relevant to the current debate on spatial heterogeneity in the timing and phasing of major climatic events in Antarctica, underscoring an unambiguous connection of the Antarctic climate state to the large-scale ocean–atmosphere reorganizations. Our study also extends a growing evidence that today's global warming trend is expected to have a severe effect on future configuration of Antarctic continental ice-shelf environment.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

183,pub.1138899042,10.1108/ebr-11-2020-0261,,,An institutional approach to the development of business angel networks in Latin American emerging countries,"Purpose The purpose of the paper is to analyze the development of business angel networks (BANs) in emerging countries such as Chile and Colombia to understand how institutions affect their development.   Design/methodology/approach This is a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive study based on a comparative analysis between countries, with the BANs in Chile and Colombia as the unit of observation. The comparative analysis was made in relation with the creation, operation and sustainability of the BANs. The study interviews the partners/managers of the active networks in each of the countries, as well as key informants, totalling 12 interviews.   Findings BAN activity in Chile and Colombia is quite recent, and the countries are on a similar level of development. However, in the long term, depending on how the cultural aspects evolve in both countries and the interest that the State may have in developing business angel activity, the results could be indeed different.   Originality/value Business angel activity in Latin America is quite recent; nevertheless, this activity is increasing in the region. In that sense, this comparative analysis between Colombia and Chile contributes to a better understanding of business angel markets in Latin America and also to obtain better insights into the core challenges that these markets face in emerging countries due to the existence of institutional voids. This paper is a contribution for further knowledge of BANs in emerging countries’ economies from an institutional perspective.",,,European Business Review,,,,2021-06-10,2021,2021-06-10,2021-12-10,33,6,918-941,Closed,Article,"Martins, Izaias; Romaní, Gianni; Atienza, Miguel","Martins, Izaias (Universidad Eafit, Medellin, Colombia); Romaní, Gianni (Departamento de Administración, Centro de Emprendimiento y de la Pyme (CEMP), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Martins, Izaias (EAFIT University)","Martins, Izaias (EAFIT University); Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)",3,2,,1.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138899042,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Misalignment to the way of life of fishers,"Political and economic transformations in the 1980s in Chile produced an increase in exports of valuable fishery resources over the last 30–40 years. In order to improve or resolve problems, the state implemented diverse interventions and changes in the administrative and cultural processes in artisanal or small-scale fisheries. Nevertheless, the results were not as expected, and diverse problems become evident. This study tries to explain the failures of state interventions in artisanal fisheries, studying the motivations of small-scale fishers to start, stay or abandon the activity. Based on 473 structured interviews in the Regions of Antofagasta, Atacama and Coquimbo (ca 1800 Km of coast) in Chile, we evidenced that fishers’ main motivation to carry out small-scale fishing, is the way of life it allows, mainly the independence and the dynamic relation with the environment and their fishery resources. This logic does not adjust to the logic of state interventions, which pursue increased production, to serve unlimited international markets with the aim of economic profit. The intention to transform the way of life of fishers will put at risk the global sustainability of the system. The failures of state interventions are understandable and welcome because they should make way to a necessary discussion about policies that favor the conservation of the logic of the way of life of the majority of fishers, that properly adjust to environmental dynamics, leading to a conservative use of fishery resources.","We acknowledge the collaboration of all fishers, their organizations, their directives and specially those interviewed for allowing us to do this study. This study was part of project FIC-R 30134215-0 funded by the Regional Government of Antofagasta, Chile and by own resources of our laboratory (Ecolmar - Grupo de Ecología y Manejo de Recursos, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile) which allowed to extend the study to the Atacama and Coquimbo regions. Also, to Carlos Araya who supported in fieldwork logistics in Antofagasta region, to the group of researchers of the School of Anthropology at Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, who assisted interviewing in Atacama and Coquimbo regions: Javiera Mahan, Dominique Constancio, Jorge Castillo, Nicolás Sepúlveda, Camila Aravena, Nicole Schibli and Fernanda Zamora.

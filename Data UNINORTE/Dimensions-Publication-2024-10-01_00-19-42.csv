7385,pub.1033127598,10.1097/rhu.0b013e3182a21dfb,23965483,,Report From the Latin American Spondyloarthritis Society for Education and Research in Immunology and Medicine Organization 2012 Workshop,"The first annual meeting of the Latin American Spondyloarthritis Society for Education and Research in Immunology and Medicine (LASSERIM) was held in Bogotá, Colombia, in September 2012 and was attended by key opinion leaders, researchers, and rheumatologists. The meeting included presentations and discussions from renowned speakers during 2 days and a coaching leadership exercise led by an expert in the field followed by an open forum. Two groups defined a priori discussed the establishment of a professional network and organization to be involved in the identification, assessment, and effective resolution of health care issues in Latin America.A broad spectrum of topics were discussed but focused on the following: pharmacoeconomics in general rheumatology, spondyloarthritis and chronic back pain, therapeutic interventions in rheumatoid arthritis, ultrasonography in spondyloarthritis, impact of social media in medicine and global trends in leadership, quality of life, and innovation. A special workshop on coaching in health care and coaching as a tool to implement LASSERIM goals was part of the 2-day conference.LASSERIM will be working in the future on education, research, and innovation in the field of rheumatology and immunology. A special focus will be on spondyloarthritis, by promoting research, open discussions, and by conducting carefully planned research studies to impact on the quality of life of patients and doctors from Latin American countries.",,,JCR Journal of Clinical Rheumatology,,,"Biomedical Research;

This article describes the data used to develop the Colombian FRAX model and illustrates its features compared to other countries. Hip fracture cases aged 50 years or more who were referred to all hospitals serving the city of Barranquilla were identified prospectively over a 3-year period (2004–2006). Age- and sex-stratified hip fracture incidence rates were computed using the 2005 census. Present and future numbers of hip fracture cases in Colombia were calculated from the age- and sex-specific incidence and the national population demography. Mortality rates for 1999 were extracted from nationwide databases and used to estimate hip fracture probabilities. For other major fractures (clinical vertebral, forearm, and humerus), incidence rates were imputed, using Swedish ratios for hip to other major osteoporotic fracture, and used to construct the FRAX model. Incidence of hip fracture increased with age, more markedly in women than in men. Over all ages, the female to male ratio was 1.7. By extrapolation, there were estimated to be 7,902 new hip fracture cases (2,673 men, 5,229 women) in Colombia in 2010, which was predicted to increase to 22,720 cases (7,568 men, 15,152 women) in 2035. The 10-year probability of hip or major fracture was increased in patients with a clinical risk factor, lower BMI, female gender, a higher age, and a decreased BMD T score. The remaining lifetime probability of hip fracture at the age of 50 years was 2.5 and 4.7 % in men and women, respectively, which were lower than rates in a Mexican population (3.8 and 8.5 %, respectively) and comparable with estimates for Venezuela (2.4 and 7.5 %, respectively). The FRAX tool is the first country-specific fracture-prediction model available in Colombia. It is based on the original FRAX methodology, which has been externally validated in several independent cohorts. Despite some limitations, the strengths make the Colombian FRAX tool a good candidate for implementation into clinical practice.",We are grateful for the collaboration of the group of hospitals that provided the data for this study.,,Calcified Tissue International,,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colombia; Female; Hip Fractures; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Prospective Studies",2013-03-08,2013,2013-03-08,2013-07,93,1,15-22,Closed,Article,"Jaller-Raad, J.

METHODS: Y-SNPs were typed in samples from six communities, including Palenque (renowned for its African linguistic and cultural heritage).
RESULTS: Findings reveal a high diversity of Y-haplogroups. With the exception of Palenque, the sum of European male lineages uniformly exceeded 57%. In Palenque, African lineages accounted for 57.7% of its chromosomes, with European male lineages constituting a mere 38.5%. In Pinillos, a significant proportion (23.8%) of the chromosomes belongs to the Native American haplogroup Q1a3a*-M3. Genetic differentiation analyses reveal significant divergences in most pairwise comparisons among the Bolivar municipalities, and the same holds between Bolivar and other South American populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous patterns of admixture reveal a genetic substructure within the Department of Bolivar. On the paternal side, five out of the six communities studied exhibit a predominantly European gene pool.

However, little is known about the quality of CPGs in this field. The aim of this study was to appraise the methodological quality of published acne vulgaris CPGs. We performed a systematic review of published CPGs on acne vulgaris therapy from July 2002 to July 2012. Three reviewers independently assessed each CPG using the AGREE II instrument. A standardized score was calculated for each of the six domains. Our search strategy identified 103 citations but just six met our inclusion criteria. Agreement among reviewers was very good: 0.981. The domains that scored better were: “scope and purpose” and “clarity and presentation”. Those that scored worse were “stakeholder involvement”, “rigor of development”, and “applicability”. The European and the Malaysian CPGs were the only recommended with no further modifications. In addition, the Mexican, Colombian and the United States guidelines were recommended with provisos, with lower scores regarding stakeholder involvement, rigor of development and applicability. Only two guidelines clearly reported outcome measures for evaluating efficacy or included quality of life outcomes. CPGs varied regarding the consideration of light/laser therapy or consideration of complementary/alternative medicines. None of them included cost considerations of drugs such as systemic isotretinoin. In conclusion, published acne vulgaris CPGs for acne therapy vary in quality with a clear need to improve their methodological rigor. This could be achieved with the adherence to current CPGs development standards.",,,Archives of Dermatological Research,,,"Acne Vulgaris; Adolescent; Adult; Consensus; Dermatology; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality Improvement; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2013-08-08,2013,2013-08-08,2014-04,306,3,269-277,Closed,Article,"Sanclemente, Gloria; Acosta, Jorge-Luis; Tamayo, Maria-Eulalia; Bonfill, Xavier; Alonso-Coello, Pablo","Sanclemente, Gloria (Group of Investigative Dermatology (GRID), School of Medicine, University of Antioquia, Carrera 20 # 2 Sur 185, Cons 1002 Clinica El Rosario, El Tesoro, Medellín, Colombia; PhD Program in Salud Pública y Metodología de la Investigación Biomédica of the Departament de Pediatria, d’Obstetrícia i Ginecologia i de Medicina Preventiva, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain); Acosta, Jorge-Luis (Public Health Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Tamayo, Maria-Eulalia (Pediatrics Department, School of Medicine, University of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Bonfill, Xavier (Iberoamerican Cochrane Center, IIB- Sant Pau, CIBERESP, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain); Alonso-Coello, Pablo (Iberoamerican Cochrane Center, IIB- Sant Pau, CIBERESP, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain)","Sanclemente, Gloria (University of Antioquia; Autonomous University of Barcelona)","Sanclemente, Gloria (University of Antioquia; Autonomous University of Barcelona); Acosta, Jorge-Luis (Universidad del Norte); Tamayo, Maria-Eulalia (University of Antioquia); Bonfill, Xavier (Cochrane Iberoamérica); Alonso-Coello, Pablo (Cochrane Iberoamérica)",52,11,2.45,10.93,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043319653,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Unlike the current approaches to asynchronous BCI systems that make use of windowed versions of the EEG data combined with static classifiers, the methods proposed here are based on discriminative models that allow sequential labeling of data. In particular, the two methods we propose for asynchronous BCI are based on conditional random fields (CRFs) and latent dynamic CRFs (LDCRFs), respectively. We describe how the asynchronous BCI problem can be posed as a classification problem based on CRFs or LDCRFs, by defining appropriate random variables and their relationships. CRF allows modeling the extrinsic dynamics of data, making it possible to model the transitions between classes, which in this context correspond to distinct tasks in an asynchronous BCI system. On the other hand, LDCRF goes beyond this approach by incorporating latent variables that permit modeling the intrinsic structure for each class and at the same time allows modeling extrinsic dynamics. We apply our proposed methods on the publicly available BCI competition III dataset V as well as a data set recorded in our laboratory. Results obtained are compared to the top algorithm in the BCI competition as well as to methods based on hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs), hierarchical hidden CRF (HHCRF), neural networks based on particle swarm optimization (IPSONN) and to a recently proposed approach based on neural networks and fuzzy theory, the S-dFasArt.

This study aimed to study the prevalence of G6PDd and its association with malaria occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the male population to estimate the prevalence of G6PDd and malaria infection. G6PD deficient samples were genotyped to identify the deficient variant. Number of previous malaria episodes and need for blood transfusion during malaria episodes were recorded by applying a standardized questionary.
RESULTS: From a sample of 1478 male individuals, 66 were detected as G6PD deficient, resulting in a prevalence of of 4.5% (95% CI = 3.44-5.56%). Fifty six G6PD deficient individuals (3.8%; 95% CI = 2.82-4.77) presented the G6PD A-variant mutation, while 10 individuals (0.7%; 95% CI = 0.42-0.97) severely deficient were genotyped as carriers of the G6PD Mediterranean variant. After adjusting for age, G6PD deficient individuals were less likely to report the occurrence of malaria episodes, and the protective effect was related to the enzyme activity, with carriers of the GG6PD A-variant presenting a 88% reduction (AOR: 0.119; 95% CI = 0.057-0.252; p < 0.001) and carriers of the Meditarrenean variant presenting 99% lower risk (AOR: 0.010; 95% CI = 0.002-0.252; p < 0.001) when compared to non-deficient individuals. On the other hand, G6PD deficient subjects reported higher need of transfusion during malaria episodes (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: G6PD enzyme activity was directly related to susceptibility to malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, where P. vivax predominates. Severe G6PDd was associated with considerable higher risk of malaria-related transfusions.","Authors&#x27; contributions: MSS, MFC, VS, MVL and MGA conceived the study; MSS, MVL and MGA designed the study; MSS, WMM and AMS analyzed the data; MSS, WMM, AMS and MVL interpreted the data; MSS, WMM, AMS and MVL drafted the manuscript; AMS, MFC, VS, MVL and MGA critically revised the manuscript for intellectual content.

The main objective is to show that risk analysis and intervention is only viable when the cultural values of the communities that face a particular kind of vulnerability are taken into account. We present the results from a study of a representative sample of vulnerable communities in Barranquilla, Colombia, in which various techniques of data collection were applied to identify the perception of risk and its relationship with the cultural typologies developed by Cultural Theory. We explain the causes and effects of perception and response when faced with risk in different contexts.","The current article presented the results from a project conducted in 2010–2011 with the support from the Direction of Research, Development, and Innovation of the Universidad del Norte named “A culture of risk in vulnerable communities: The case of Barranquilla, Colombia, in the context of globalized (in) security.” We especially thank Dr. Jaime Ortiz for his work in helping develop this special issue, World Vision-Colombia for giving us permission to use the results of their probabilistic analysis of risk perception, the peer reviewers who provided very helpful comments, and the communities that participated in this study.",,Human and Ecological Risk Assessment An International Journal,,,,2013-03-04,2013,,2013-03-04,19,2,423-442,Closed,Article,"Restrepo, Gabriel Orozco; Campis, Eliana Sanandres","Restrepo, Gabriel Orozco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Campis, Eliana Sanandres (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Restrepo, Gabriel Orozco (Universidad del Norte)","Restrepo, Gabriel Orozco (Universidad del Norte); Campis, Eliana Sanandres (Universidad del Norte)",2,0,,0.21,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015086946,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,

Aim of this paper is to report on the first magnetic survey carried out on environmental samples from Bogotá, Colombia, which is the fifth most populated city of Latin America. We studied three kinds of samples in order to evaluate their potential as pollution markers: soils, urban dust and leaves of the Sauco (Sambucus nigra) tree. Standard magnetic methods were used to analyze the three groups of samples, with special emphasis on leaves investigated here for the first time for environmental purposes. Samples were collected along two perpendicular transects in an area of the city presumably unpolluted, with two different systems of public transportation. Thermomagnetic curves obtained from soils and atmospheric dust show clearly defined ferrimagnetic phase (probably magnetite) as the main magnetic carrier. Curves of acquisition of isothermal remanent magnetization confirm the ferrimagnetic character of magnetic particles. Frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility was found between 0 and 10%, suggesting less-important contribution of ultrafine super-paramagnetic magnetite. The apparent contradictory results between soils and the rest of samples may reflect different accumulation period for magnetic particles, being shorter for leaves and urban dust than for soils.",,,Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica,,,,2013-08-14,2013,2013-08-14,2013-10,57,4,741-754,Closed,Article,"Reyes, Bertha Aguilar; Mejía, Victoria; Goguitchaichvili, Avto; Escobar, Jaime; Bayona, Germán; Bautista, Francisco; Morales, Juan C.; Ihl, Thomas J.","Reyes, Bertha Aguilar (Laboratorio Interinstitucional de Magnetismo Natural, Instituto de Geofísica, Unidad Michoacán, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; Laboratorio Universitario de Geofísica Ambiental, Instituto de Geofísica, Unidad Michoacán — Centro de Investigaciones en Geografía Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico); Mejía, Victoria (Laboratorio de Física, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales, Colombia); Goguitchaichvili, Avto (Laboratorio Interinstitucional de Magnetismo Natural, Instituto de Geofísica, Unidad Michoacán, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; Laboratorio Universitario de Geofísica Ambiental, Instituto de Geofísica, Unidad Michoacán — Centro de Investigaciones en Geografía Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico); Escobar, Jaime (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte (Uninorte), Bogotá, Colombia); Bayona, Germán (Corporación Geológica ARES, Calle 44A N. 53-96, Bogotá, Colombia); Bautista, Francisco (Laboratorio Universitario de Geofísica Ambiental, Instituto de Geofísica, Unidad Michoacán — Centro de Investigaciones en Geografía Ambiental, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico); Morales, Juan C.

On the contrary, Marie Antoinette used her body as a subjective territory to recuperate her autonomy. Through fashion, Marie Antoinette created a narrative program that expressed both her wish for recognition and her need for independence. This article reconstructs, from the perspective of the Semiotics of passion, Marie Antoinette's passionate journey as it is narrated by Sofia Coppola, showing how fashion allowed her to challenge the French court and expressed her subjectivity. By using the fashion system as a defensive strategy of legitimization, Marie Antoinette contributed to undermine the political structures that supported the aristocratic order. Simultaneously, she strengthened her individuality and confronted those who denied her recognition. From this perspective, Marie Antoinette appears as a contemporary character, as a subject other, a teenager, a foreigner, a woman who, in an inhospitable space, seeks beauty to construct a public image that expresses her identity.",,,Fashion Theory,,,,2013-11,2013,2015-04-21,2013-11,17,5,605-622,Closed,Article,"Flores, Pamela","Flores, Pamela (Pamela Flores is an Associate Professor at, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, PhD in Cultural Studies, Sevilla University, Spain, .

In generalizations by feature lines, instead of dissimilarities with objects, we have dissimilarities with feature lines. One drawback of such generalization is the high amount of generated lines that increases computational costs and may provide redundant information. To overcome this, the selection of lines based on the length of the line segments has been considered in previous works, showing good results for correlated data. In this paper, we propose a new supervised criterion for the selection of feature lines. Experimental results show that the proposed criterion obtains competitive or better results than those obtained by previous criteria, especially for data with high intrinsic dimension, spherical data and data with outliers. As our proposal provides better results for small representation sets, it allows one to obtain a good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational efficiency.",,,Digital Signal Processing,,,,2013-05,2013,,2013-05,23,3,902-911,Closed,Article,"Plasencia-Calaña, Yenisel; Orozco-Alzate, Mauricio; García-Reyes, Edel; Duin, Robert P.W.","Plasencia-Calaña, Yenisel (Departamento de Reconocimiento de Patrones, Centro de Aplicaciones de Tecnologías de Avanzada, CENATAV, 7a #21812 e/ 218 y 222, Rpto.

Lately, the elevated electricity consumption of data center facilities have lead to the development of energy-efficient hardware and software. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) have been redesigned to predict power consumption of queries and guide plan selection towards energy reduction goals. In this article, a power consumption comparison between different large join query optimization approaches will be presented. For that purpose, three large join query optimization algorithms will be used, the PostgreSQL genetic algorithms GEQO, a simulated annealing approach SAIO and an automata theory based meta-heuristic DSQO our previous work.

The aim of the research was to identify the usage patterns of electrical equipment, the energy efficiency of refrigeration, and the advance on the replacement of critical refrigerants. As important results, we found that although all the effort of environmental agencies to replace critical substances, small markets keepers still use equipment for cooling products with refrigerants that generate negative impacts on the environment. Also, market keepers do not apply energy efficiency plans to control the use of energy or guarantee the quality of products. We identified the need of a special plan focus on the habits of population in the Caribbean Region of Colombia.

The objective of this proposal is to provide support to professors in detecting plagiarism in student homework assignments in introductory computer programming courses. The developed tool, CODESIGHT, is based on a modification of the Greedy String Tiling algorithm. The tool was tested in one theoretical and three real scenarios, obtaining similitude detections for assignments ranging from those that contained code without modifications to assignments containing insertions of procedural instructions inside the main code. The results verified the efficiency of the tool at the first five levels of the plagiarism spectrum for programming code, in addition to supporting suspicions of plagiarism in real scenarios. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our total energy results show that the most stable positions of a Ni adatom on the reconstructed 2×2-T4 GaN(0001) surface are at the H3a0 and T4 adsorption sites. We found that the Ni adatom diffusion energy barrier between the H3a0 and T4 sites is around 0.16eV, which is an indication of a significant Ni adatom diffusion on this surface. In addition, calculating the relative surface energy of several configurations, we constructed a phase diagram showing the energetically most stable surfaces as a function of the Ga chemical potential. Based on these results, we found that Ni adsorption is energetically more favorable compared with Ni incorporation in the Ga-substitutional and interstitial sites.

We employ density-functional theory within the generalized-gradient approximation to study such effects. First-principles total energy calculations reveal that the most stable positions of a Zr adatom on the reconstructed 2×2-T4 AlN(0001) surface are at the S1 and Sp substitutional sites. In addition, calculating the relative surface energy of several configurations, we constructed a phase diagram showing the energetically most stable surfaces as a function of the aluminium chemical potential. Based on these results, we find that incorporation at Al-substitutional sites is energetically favorable compared to adsorption on the top layers. In particular, we find that Zr-S1 and Zr-Sp structures are stable over the entire chemical potential range. This effect can lead to the formation of a non-reactive interfacial ZrN(111) layer on the AlN(0001) surface, which can offer a good interfacial combination between AlN substrate and other metal contacts, i.e. zirconium.",AcknowledgmentsThe calculations reported in this paper were performed using computing facilities of the HIPERLAB-cluster of Universidad del Norte.

We found a stable ferromagnetic state in Cu0.0625In0.9375N with a total magnetization of 1.98μB per supercell, indicating Cu orders ferromagnetically in InN. The results indicate that the ferromagnetic ground state originates from the hybridized Cu(3d)–N(2p)–In(5p)–N(2p) chain formed through p–d coupling. Formation energy and ground state calculations have been performed for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states of CuxIn1−xN (x=0,0625 and 0,125) by LDA+U and LDA formalisms. A weak ferromagnetic behavior for CuxIn1−xN (x=0,125) was found. The results predicted an AFM ground state for cases where the Cu atoms are closer. For longer Cu–Cu distances a stable FM ground state was found. This ferromagnetic behavior in CuxIn1−xN (x=0,125) could be tuned with In or N vacancies.",AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by DIDI-Universidad del Norte.

Adsorption and diffusion of Zr atoms on AlN(0001)‐2 × 2 surface is examined and it is shown that Zr atoms preferentially adsorb at the T4 sites at low and high coverage (from 1/4 up to 1 monolayer). We found that the Zr adatom diffusion energy barrier between the T4 and H3 sites is around ∼0.4 eV, which is an indication of a significant Zr adatom diffusion on this surface. In addition, calculating the relative surface energy of several configurations and various Zr concentrations, we constructed a phase diagram showing the energetically most stable surfaces as a function of the Zr and Al chemical potentials. Based on these results, we find that incorporation of Zr adatoms in the Al‐substitutional site is energetically more favorable compared with the adsorption on the top layers. This effect leads to the formation of a non‐reactive interfacial ZrN(111) layer on the AlN(0001) surface, which can offer a good interfacial combination between AlN substrate and other metal contacts, i.e. zirconium.",The calculations reported in this paper were performed using computing facilities of the HIPERLAB‐cluster of Universidad del Norte.

This test method covers the determination of the tensile strength of cylindrical concrete specimens with a centered internal hole where a radial internal fluid pressure is applied until failure occurs. This loading condition induces tangential stresses on the specimen; the maximum fluid pressure sustained by the specimen is affected by appropriate geometric factors to obtain a measurement of the tensile strength. Preliminary experimental data suggests that the tensile strength measured with the proposed method is about 17% greater than the tensile strength obtained from splitting tensile tests. Additionally, results of the tensile pressure strength were on average 11% of the compressive strength.",The authors are grateful to Colciencias for having supported this research through Contract 2012-16586.,,Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,,,,2013-05-08,2013,2013-05-08,2014-04,26,4,776-780,Closed,Article,"Cantillo, Victor; Guzmán, Andrés","Cantillo, Victor (Associate Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 via Pto.

The aim of this research was to register the visual effects of pollution on three types of insulators, and analyze a set of images to record the number of hot spots and flashover arc during 14-day periods. Identification of hot spots on insulators was conducted by segmenting the images with machine vision techniques, which helped to determine the states of insulators for maintenance activities. Finally, the software tool performance was tested for different insulators subjected to polluted conditions in the Colombian Caribbean Region. As results, we obtained a visual tool to evaluate the effects of pollution on electric insulators, the visual verification of the behavior of electric insulators in polluted-environments after the rain and manual washing, and the threshold to obtain video segmentation of insulators and other elements of the power grid for automatic recognition.","Authors would like to thank to COLCIENCIAS and the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, for their financial support to conduct this research.

The concern of protecting this information is also increasing due to the capabilities than an eventual attacker could have if the location information is obtained. Some protection techniques have been proposed in the literature; for example, location obfuscation which slightly alters the location to hide the real one. However, this technique could be filtered out with time series-based mechanisms. In this work, the Pinwheel obfuscation technique is proposed in order to reduce the possibility of EMA-based filtering based on high variability and asymmetry of the induced noise. The results show that the level of filtered noise is reduced from 35% in N-RAND and 30% in $\Theta$-Rand obfuscation techniques, to 15% in Pinwheel, with asymmetric scenarios, while preserving a long final average distance from the original path after a filtering attack.","This work was supported by the Young Researcher program from Colciencias 2012-2013 and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

Depending on the application and geographical area, they may become a key disruptive and energy starving system. The research discussed in this paper describes a CFD-based approach for robust HVAC system design aimed at reducing variability in the conditioned area by adjusting operating parameters. Since robust design techniques aim at minimum variance (via S/N ratio), the solutions obtained allow the selection of operating parameters leading to more uniform distribution. Three variables were used: air velocity (to control energy transfer from people to the surrounding air), Unit usage (a ratio to consider the air conditioning system inertia compared to air conditioning requirements), and room temperature set point (representing the relation between the machine and the conditions room). Embedded codes with field functions in the CFD software allow the simulation of a very basic operation strategy, and demonstrate a quasi-dynamic operation for different cooling capacities and air velocity. Results allow allocating operating parameters that lead to a more uniform temperature and relative humidity distributions, therefore, this approach can be adequately combined with statistical design of experiments for better conditions.Copyright © 2013 by ASME",,,,Volume 6A: Energy,,,2013-11-15,2013,2014-04-02,2013-11-15,,,v06at07a068-v06at07a068,Closed,Proceeding,"Arias, Luis F.; Silvera, Antonio J.

These calculations are based on density functional theory, within local density approximation, and generalized gradient approximation for the exchange and correlation potential. Given that the binary precursor compounds ScAs and InAs crystallize in rock-salt and zinc-blende, respectively, we made calculations for the ternary alloys in these two phases. The effect of composition x on structural parameters, band-gap energies, and mixing enthalpies was analyzed for x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1. The effect of atomic composition on lattice constant, bulk modulus, and band-gap energy shows nonlinear dependence on concentration x. Deviations of the lattice constant from Vegard’s law and deviations of the bulk modulus and gap-energy from linear concentration dependence were found. We have found a metallic character for rock-salt Sc1−xInxAs alloys, while the zinc-blende Sc1−xInxAs alloys are semiconductors. Our results show that the band-gap undergoes a direct ($$X \rightarrow X$$)-to-direct ($$\Upgamma\rightarrow \Upgamma$$) transition at a given indium composition. The physical origin of the band-gap bowing in zinc-blende Sc1−xInxAs alloys was investigated. To study the thermodynamic stability of Sc1−xInxAs alloys, a regular-solution model was used. This resulted in lower mixing enthalpies for zinc-blende Sc1−xInxAs alloys.",This study was supported by DIDI-Universidad del Norte.

Description of erosion processes in Spratt Bight (San Andrs Island, Colombia) using Sequential End Point Rates (EPR). San Andrs is a coral island located in the Colombian Caribbean, 700 km northwest of the main land. Twelve kilometers in length and three kilometers in width, it is one of the most populated islands with 2.612 inhabitants per square kilometer. Its economy is based on tourism. Despite being protected from storms and hurricanes by a chain of reefs that stretches across the north and east of the island, beaches suffer significant erosion. Spratt Bight is the biggest and the most important beach of the island. Temporal evolution of Spratt Bight was analyzed and the End Point Rate for several periods (from the year 1984 to 2010) has been calculated. Although beach nourishment between 1984 and 1990, erosive processes are dominant all over the beach. Erosion rates reach up to 35 m with an average of 1.3 m/year, in its central part. The other erosive sector is placed in the half north of the beach, with a maximum of 20 m and an average of 0.7 m/year. Detected erosion can be attributed to the construction of two perpendicular structures to the shoreline and a promenade located on top of the upper beach.

Adsorption and incorporation of Ti atoms on GaN(0001) surface is examined and it is shown that Ti atoms preferentially adsorb at the T4 sites at low and high coverage. In addition, calculating the formation energy of multiple-impurity configurations, we constructed a surface phase diagram showing the energetically most stable structures as a function of Ti and Ga chemical potentials. Based on these, we find that incorporation of Ti atoms in the Ga-substitutional site is energetically more favorable compared with the Ti surface adsorption on the top layers. This effect leads to the formation of an interfacial crystalline titanium nitride (TiN) compound on the GaN(0001) surface, which can offer a good interfacial combination between Ti and GaN substrates.",,,Japanese Journal of Applied Physics,,,,2013-04-19,2013,2013-04-19,2013-05-01,52,5R,055601,Closed,Article,"Ortega-Lopez, César; López-Perez, William; González-Hernández, Rafael","Ortega-Lopez, César (Grupo Avanzado de Materiales y Sistemas Complejos–GAMASCO, Universidad de Córdoba, Montería, Colombia); López-Perez, William (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González-Hernández, Rafael (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Ortega-Lopez, César (University of Córdoba); López-Perez, William (Universidad del Norte); González-Hernández, Rafael (Universidad del Norte)",2,0,,0.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1073836930,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

As the architecture employs a modified PLL as a divider of another PLL, a stability analysis is presented to demonstrate suitable operation. The BRN-PLL close-to-carrier output noise is dominated by the PFD/CP of the inner PLL and the far-from-carrier output noise is dominated by the LO of the outer PLL. The PFD/CP noise can be reduced by approximately 20 dB when the output is disconnected from the VCO during idle states, and a low noise floor is achieved using a passively biased double-switching pair LC VCO. Additionally, to maintain lower integrated phase noise, the proposed scheme uses a high-$Q$ MEMS-based VCO to effectively smoothen the transition of the response between the two dominant noise sources. Absolute figures equal to ${-}105$ dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and ${-}155$ dBc/Hz at 10 MHz are measured from a 104 MHz clock-cleaner.","This work was supported by Integrated Device Technology, San Jose, CA, USA.",,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I Regular Papers,,,,2013-10-08,2013,2013-10-08,2014-03-01,61,3,653-662,Closed,Article,"Pardo, Mauricio; Ayazi, Farrokh","Pardo, Mauricio (Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ayazi, Farrokh (School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332-0250, USA)","Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Ayazi, Farrokh (Georgia Institute of Technology)",3,0,,0.81,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061567825,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

However, there is still very little information regarding the mechanical properties and response of the corneal tissue, information required to perform adequate numerical simulations. Taking this issue into account, stress relaxation displacement controlled tests and creep stress controlled tests were performed in order to characterize the time–dependent, viscoelastic behavior of corneal tissue. Vertical strips were obtained from porcine corneas and were subjected to uniaxial tensile tests under different stress-strain levels. A time dependent, viscoelastic behavior was initially observed for high stress levels and an empirical constitutive model is proposed based on the experimental data. Creep and relaxation tests at low stress levels, within physiological conditions, were also performed. Results indicate that the corneal tissue viscoelastic behavior may be neglected for low stress levels which considerably simplifies the constitutive model to be implemented in computational simulations.",,,IFMBE Proceedings,"V Latin American Congress on Biomedical Engineering CLAIB 2011 May 16-21, 2011, Habana, Cuba","José Folgueras Méndez, Tania Y.

The calculations are based on full‐potential linearized‐augmented plane wave (FP‐LAPW) method, within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange‐correlation effect is treated by both local‐density approximation (LDA) and generalized‐gradient approximation (GGA). In the latter approach, both Perdew‐Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and Engel–Vosko (EV) functionals of the exchange‐correlation energy were used. Given that the binary precursor compounds ScAs and AlAs crystallize in rock‐salt and zinc‐blende, respectively, we made calculations for the ternary alloys in these two phases. The effect of composition x on structural parameters, band‐gap energies, mixing enthalpies, and phase diagrams was analyzed for  0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1. The effect of atomic composition on lattice constant, bulk modulus, and band‐gap energy shows nonlinear dependence on composition x . Deviations of the lattice constant from Vegard's law and deviations of the bulk modulus and gap‐energy from linear concentration dependence (LCD) were found. We have found a metallic character for rock‐salt Sc 1−x Al x As alloys, while the zinc‐blende Sc 1−x Al x As alloys are semiconductors. Our results show that the band‐gap undergoes a direct (  )’to‐indirect (  ) transition at a given aluminium composition. The physical origin of the band‐gap bowing in zinc‐blende Sc 1−x Al x As alloys was investigated. To study the thermodynamic stability of Sc 1−x Al x As alloys, a regular‐solution model was used. The calculated excess mixing enthalpy is positive over the entire aluminum composition range. \end Newabstract",This study was supported by DIDI‐Universidad del Norte.

The parameters involved in the welding process were related to the variation of the yield strength and microhardness. A transient thermal analysis was developed to model the problem in a numerical form using Finite Element Method (FEM) and these results were compared with experimental data showing good agreement. It was observed that the amount of energy absorbed by the base material determines the maximum temperatures reached by the aluminum and microstructural changes produced by high metal temperatures, significantly influence the properties of the alloy. For a case with 120A, 18.0V and 5.26mm/s in travel speed, the reduction of yield strength was 45.1% and for Vickers microhardness was 45.2%. For another case with 140A, 20.5V and 5.36mm/s in travel speed, the reductions were 40.9% and 38.4% for yield strength and Vickers microhardness respectively.

Dysfunctional experiences emerge when human beings experience (implicitly or consciously) different existential dilemmas and are unable to make consistent decisions and confront the experience of anxiety that results from such contact. In this sense, dysfunctional experiences are not developed simply from the consciousness of existential givens, as suggested by Yalom (1980), but by the dialectical and paradoxical relationship with the following human dilemmas: life versus death, freedom versus determinisms, isolation versus intersubjectivity, meaning versus insignificancy, individuation versus adaptation, and sense of power versus impotence. This idea implies that anxiety and dysfunctional experiences could emerge, in daily life, from the need to take concrete decisions when faced with several possibilities or dilemmas, and not only from the awareness of those possibilities.",,,The Humanistic Psychologist,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,,41,4,371-383,Closed,Article,"De Castro, Alberto","De Castro, Alberto (Programa de Psicología, Universidad del Norte)","De Castro, Alberto (Programa de Psicología, Universidad del Norte)","De Castro, Alberto (Programa de Psicología, Universidad del Norte)",6,2,,0.88,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058345209,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

The model was validated with experimental data reported in literature and the results were satisfactory. A general correlation for estimating the autoignition time of gaseous fuels in function of cylinder temperature, and pressure, equivalence ratio and methane number of the fuel was carried out. Livengood and Wu correlation is used to predict autoignition in function of the crank angle. This criterium is a way to predict the autoignition tendency of a fuel/air mixture under engine conditions and consider the ignition delay. A chemical equilibrium model which considers 98 chemical species was used in this research in order to simulate the combustion of the gaseous fuels at differents engine operating conditions. The effect of spark advance, equivalence ratio, methane number (MN), charge (inlet pressure) and inlet temperature (manifold temperature) on engine knocking is evaluated. This work, explore the feasibility of using syngas with low methane number as fuel for commercial internal combustion engines.Copyright © 2013 by ASME",,,,Volume 6A: Energy,,,2013-11-15,2013,2014-04-02,2013-11-15,,,v06at07a001-v06at07a001,Closed,Proceeding,"Forero, Jorge Duarte; Diaz, German Amador; Castillo, Fabio Blanco; Martinez, Lesme Corredor; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez","Forero, Jorge Duarte (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Castillo, Fabio Blanco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez, Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Forero, Jorge Duarte (Universidad del Norte); Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte); Castillo, Fabio Blanco (Universidad del Norte); Martinez, Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092783040,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

To reach the spectrum, it is necessary to pass the acquired signal at the spectrometer by a bank of filters known as Raman signal­­­­­­'s preprocessing system, which should eliminate all noise components accompanying the signal. The behavior of these noise components, and even the signal itself, are information that can be useful in order to optimize the system and to study the signal itself. This paper proposes a statistical model of Raman signal as the pre-processing system receives it, the signal­­­­­­'s noise components and their statistical behavior, including its mathematical representation are presented. Additionally, it shows the results of the implementation of the simulation model leaving the door open for the validation, on which work is being done. The implementation of this model may be useful as an input signal for the optimization of the filter banks, since there are not always sufficient Raman signals for detailed study and development of filters for a specific signal under study. The model could also be used as a base for the study for systems using Raman spectroscopy to recognize substances.",,,,"Symposium of Signals, Images and Artificial Vision - 2013: STSIVA - 2013",,,2013-09,2013,,,,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Gutierrez, Carlos A.; Garcia, Xavier; Zurek, Eduardo E.; Salazar, Augusto","Gutierrez, Carlos A.

A thermodynamic model was developed in Matlab® to find out the effect of pressure ratio, ammonia mass fraction at the absorber and turbine efficiency on the total exergy destruction of the cycle. The contribution of each cycle component on the total exergy destruction was also determined. The results showed that total exergy destruction decreases when pressure ratio increases, and reaches a maximum at x ≈ 0.5, when ammonia mass fraction is varied at absorber. Also, it was found that the absorber, the boiler and the turbine had the major contribution to the total exergy destruction of the cycle, and the increase of the turbine efficiency reduces the total exergy destruction. The effect of rectification cooling source (external and internal) on the cycle output was investigated, and the results showed that internal rectification cooling reduces the total exergy destruction of the cycle. Finally, the effect of the presence or absence of the superheater after the rectification process was determined and it was obtained that the superheated condition reduces the exergy destruction of the cycle at high turbine efficiency values.",,,Applied Thermal Engineering,,,,2013-10,2013,,2013-10,60,1-2,164-171,Closed,Article,"Fontalvo, Armando; Pinzon, Horacio; Duarte, Jorge; Bula, Antonio; Quiroga, Arturo Gonzalez; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez","Fontalvo, Armando (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pinzon, Horacio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Duarte, Jorge (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Quiroga, Arturo Gonzalez (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Universidad del Norte)","Fontalvo, Armando (Universidad del Norte); Pinzon, Horacio (Universidad del Norte); Duarte, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Quiroga, Arturo Gonzalez (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Universidad del Norte)",69,7,,6.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041393194,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

These two different strategies have been proposed to explain the perceptions of stability of self-continuity over time. Essentialism predicates self-continuity on some fundamental, unchanging aspect of the self. In contrast, narrativism is an understanding of self-continuity as a result of one's cumulative experiences and decisions. Previous research using interview methods have found that these two strategies are mutually exclusive expressions of self-continuity. The current study sought to test this conceptualization using a questionnaire that assessed the underlying structural relation between essentialism and narrativism. The analyses supported a two factor model with measurement invariance across samples allowing for a comparison of mean differences across language and cultural barriers.

The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared, using listening tests, with the performance of a recent voice conversion algorithm based on HMM but requiring phonetic labeling. The proposed algorithm was found to achieve equivalent identity conversion scores while improving the perceived quality of the converted speech. Thus, the proposed algorithm was found as a viable alternative for conversion applications where phonetic labeling is not practical.","Note: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1116475.

This paper analyzes the presence of gender, socioeconomic, and institutional disparities based on the outcome of two national standard tests in Colombia: SABER-PRO, a national test that assesses the quality of education in civil engineering programs and SABER-11, a test applied to senior high school students. The results suggest that there are no significant gender differences in topics evaluated by SABER-11, except for physics (favoring males) and verbal skill (favoring females). However, according to SABER-PRO test scores, in all topics under evaluation, men perform better than women, except verbally. This may mean that, in Colombia, the civil engineering educational process is biased toward males, or that the instrument, a standardized multiple choice test, favors men. Moreover, the SABER-PRO test is strongly influenced by institutional and socioeconomic factors, suggesting the existence of gaps related to income, age, gender, and the educational quality of the university in which students are enrolled.",,,Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice,,,,2013-11-26,2013,2013-11-26,2014-04,140,2,04013012,Closed,Article,"Cantillo, Víctor; García, Lucy","Cantillo, Víctor (Associate Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia 081007 (corresponding author).

METHODOLOGY: Single-rooted premolars were selected and root filled using gutta-percha cones and one of the following sealers: Endofill, Sealer 26, Fillapex or AH Plus. Root canals filled only with gutta-percha were used as control. Scans of teeth using a small-volume CBCT were performed, and the images acquired were evaluated by two calibrated observers (k > 0.75). Artifacts were identified as streaks and dark bands on root dentine in axial slices with 2 voxel sizes (0.076 and 0.2 mm). Fisher's exact test (P < 0.05) was used to compare the presence/absence ratio of artifacts considering the factors 'sealer' and 'voxel size'.
RESULTS: For the 0.20 mm voxel size, Sealer 26 had significantly more artifacts than Fillapex (P = 0.006) or AH Plus (P = 0.017). No differences existed between the sealers when the 0.07 mm voxel size was used. Sealer 26 (P = 0.042) and Endofill (P = 0.035) had significantly more artifacts in the 0.20 mm voxel size than with the 0.076 mm voxel size, whilst no difference was noted for other filling conditions.

The state-of-the-art research proposes semi-automated detection methods for tracking of construction workers and equipment. Considering the number of active equipment and workers on jobsites and their frequency of appearance in a camera's field of view, application of semi-automated techniques can be time-consuming. To address this limitation, a new algorithm based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Colors (HOG+C) is proposed. Our proposed detector uses a single sliding window at multiple scales to identify the potential candidates for the location of equipment and workers in 2D. Each detection window is first divided into small spatial regions and then the gradient orientations and hue–saturation colors are locally histogrammed and concatenated to form the HOG+C descriptors. Tiling the sliding detection window with a dense and overlapping grid of formed descriptors and using a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each resource enables automated 2D detection of workers and equipment. A new comprehensive benchmark dataset containing over 8000 annotated video frames including equipment and workers from different construction projects is introduced. This dataset contains a large range of pose, scale, background, illumination, and occlusion variation. Our preliminary results on detection of standing workers, excavators and dump trucks with an average accuracy of 98.83%, 82.10%, and 84.88% respectively indicate the applicability of the proposed method for automated activity analysis of workers and equipment from single video cameras. Unlike other state-of-the-art algorithms in automated resource tracking, this method particularly detects idle resources and does not need manual or semi-automated initialization of the resource locations in 2D video frames. The experimental results and the perceived benefits of the proposed method are discussed in detail.","The authors thank Arsalan Heydarian, Ao Chen, Moshe Zelkowicz, Fabian Capra, Rafael Suriel, and other members of the RAAMAC lab for their help with data collection.

Municipalities in “hotspots” show: (1) a high degree of flooding, as they are located on the Magdalena and Atrato River floodplains, and (2) high social vulnerability, suggested by low values of the ICV (national living conditions index).",AcknowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Mark Brenner for proof reading the article and the comments provided by the editor and two anonymous reviewers.,,Applied Geography,,,,2013-05,2013,,2013-05,39,,16-25,Closed,Article,"Hoyos, N.; Escobar, J.; Restrepo, J.C.; Arango, A.M.; Ortiz, J.C.","Hoyos, N.

However, commercial platforms have limited access to modify network parameters in order to test or improve network performance. The paper shows one prototype WSN for temperature monitoring implemented with inexpensive, Off-The-Shelf electronic components (OTS-WSN). The network has five nodes programmed using C language. Each node employs HopeRF RFM12B radio transceiver and Microchip PIC 16F783A microcontroller. This hardware combination is not reported in the literature. Tests performed on OTS-WSN nodes show similar energy use to commercial devices. Our nodes use 14 mA for reception, 3 mA with radio off and 26 mA for transmission with 0dBm power. OTS-WSN features inexpensive, easy to build hardware platforms. The prototype obtained 5% packet loss with a very simple MAC protocol, thus creating space for improvement and protocol testing in a platform where researchers have access to every detail of hardware and software implementation.",,,,2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA),,,2013-09,2013,,,,,327-332,Closed,Proceeding,"Chain, Eduardo; Sara, Ruben; Arias, Juan; Escorcia, Enrique; Calle, Maria","Chain, Eduardo (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sara, Ruben (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arias, Juan (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Escorcia, Enrique (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Calle, Maria (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Chain, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Sara, Ruben (Universidad del Norte); Arias, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Escorcia, Enrique (Universidad del Norte); Calle, Maria (Universidad del Norte)",2,0,,0.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094861496,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The features of the most important have been studied in this paper. The gasifiers considered are the British Gas Lurgi, Siemens, General Electric, Conoco Phillips and Shell; principal parameters have been taken into account such as the cold gas efficiency, the production capacity, oxygen, electricity and steam consumption, effect of coal type, syngas produced for the desired final product, capital, operation costs, and environmental performance. From assessment of the latter features for each gasifier, one can conclude that although the BGL has the lowest production capacity with 1000 tons/day, it represents the best technology option due to its highest cold gas efficiency of 89%, the lowest oxygen and electricity consumption and the lowest capital costs with 50 million dollars per unit.Copyright © 2013 by ASME",,,,Volume 6A: Energy,,,2013-11-15,2013,2014-04-02,2013-11-15,,,v06at07a028-v06at07a028,Closed,Proceeding,"Ramirez, Orlando M.; Corredor, Lesme","Ramirez, Orlando M.

In this regard, solar radiation maps are generated for five different cases: total radiation on a south facing fixed surface tilted at the latitude angle; total radiation on a surface tilted at the latitude angle with East–West tracking; total radiation on a surface tilted at the latitude angle with azimuth tracking; direct beam radiation on a horizontal surface with East–West tracking; and direct beam radiation on a surface with two axis tracking. The first three cases are generally applicable to photovoltaic (PV) power plants while the last two are generally used for concentrating solar power (CSP) plant design.

These recordings further support project managers to take corrective actions on performance deviations and in turn improve operational efficiency. Despite these benefits, manual stopwatch studies of previously recorded videos can be labor-intensive, may suffer from biases of the observers, and are impractical after substantial period of observations. This paper presents a new computer vision based algorithm for recognizing single actions of earthmoving construction equipment. This is particularly a challenging task as equipment can be partially occluded in site video streams and usually come in wide variety of sizes and appearances. The scale and pose of the equipment actions can also significantly vary based on the camera configurations. In the proposed method, a video is initially represented as a collection of spatio-temporal visual features by extracting space–time interest points and describing each feature with a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The algorithm automatically learns the distributions of the spatio-temporal features and action categories using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This strategy handles noisy feature points arisen from typical dynamic backgrounds. Given a video sequence captured from a fixed camera, the multi-class SVM classifier recognizes and localizes equipment actions. For the purpose of evaluation, a new video dataset is introduced which contains 859 sequences from excavator and truck actions. This dataset contains large variations of equipment pose and scale, and has varied backgrounds and levels of occlusion. The experimental results with average accuracies of 86.33% and 98.33% show that our supervised method outperforms previous algorithms for excavator and truck action recognition. The results hold the promise for applicability of the proposed method for construction activity analysis.","The authors would like to thank the Virginia Tech Department of Planning, Design and Construction, as well as Holder and Skanska construction companies for providing access to their jobsites for a comprehensive data collection.

1594,pub.1092851845,10.1115/imece2013-62584,,,Technology Outlook and Sustainability of the Synthetic Natural Gas Production Process Derived From Coal,"Natural gas is the most environmental friendly fossil fuel with a high energy content and has a promising future within the energy consumption outlook. For this reason, its production from coal is gaining a significant interest, converting the most abundant, stable, and low price fossil fuel to synthetic natural gas (SNG). In this paper a technology outlook and a sustainability assessment of the technical, economical, and environmental factors is developed. It was found that the sustainability of the process depends mainly on the local price of coal and natural gas, as well as, emerging SNG technologies, also known as direct methanation. The conventional methanation process, the indirect methanation, has high capital costs but it is currently the only proven large scale technology. Although the emerging technology has not yet been tested at a commercial scale, it has a better technical performance with an net efficiency increase of more than 10 percent as results of the process stage reduction which should lead to lower capital costs requirements. Regarding the environmental performance, the conventional process produces large amounts of CO2, approximately 1.3 kg CO2 for each kg of coal, that has to be compressed and sequestered to meet the environmental targets.Copyright © 2013 by ASME",,,,Volume 6A: Energy,,,2013-11-15,2013,2014-04-02,2013-11-15,,,v06at07a016-v06at07a016,Closed,Proceeding,"Ramirez, Orlando M.; Corredor, Lesme","Ramirez, Orlando M.

Previous algorithms tend to focus on modeling the spatial relationships between objects and actors, but ignore the evolving nature of this relationship through time. Our algorithm captures the dynamic nature of human-object interactions by modeling how these patterns evolve with respect to time. Our experiments show that encoding such temporal evolution is crucial for correctly discriminating human actions that involve similar objects and spatial human-object relationships, but only differ on the temporal aspect of the inter-action, e.g. answer phone and dial phone We validate our approach on two human activity datasets and show performance improvements over competing state-of-the-art representations.",This work was funded by a Google Research Award.

Se determinaron mutaciones por secuenciación directa de PTEN; amplificaciones de EGFR, PI3K, AKT por PCR en tiempo real; niveles de expresión de PI3K, AKT, BcL2 y BAX por PCR en tiempo real; el nivel de fosforilación de AKT y PTEN mediante Western Blot.ResultadosNo se encontraron mutaciones en el gen PTEN. EGFR se encontró amplificado en el 12,5% de los gliomas de bajo grado y en el 31,8% de alto grado (p=0,099). PI3K se encontró amplificado en el 50% de los gliomas de bajo grado y en el 40,9% de alto grado (p=0,36). AKT se encontró amplificado en el 25% de los gliomas de bajo grado y en el 13,6% de alto grado (p=0,64). AKT se encontró sobreexpresado en gliomas de alto grado con respecto a los de bajo grado; la expresión de PI3K fue similar en los de bajo y alto grado; los niveles de expresión de Bax fueron menores en gliomas de bajo grado con respecto a los de alto grado, mientras que los niveles de Bcl2 estaban incrementados en gliomas de alto grado en comparación con los de bajo grado.

In particular, a methodology was applied to evaluate the effects of the coating thickness and the interlayer on diamond coating delaminations. In the coating thickness effect research, substrate surface preparations, prior to diamond depositions, were common chemical etching using Murakami solutions. On the other hand, to study the interlayer effect, Cr/CrN/Cr and Ti/TiN/Ti, were deposited to WC–Co substrate surfaces (no chemical etching) by using a commercial physical vapor deposition (PVD) system in a thickness architecture of 200nm/1.5μm/1.5μm, respectively. Diamond films were synthesized by using a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) reactor at a fixed gas mixture with varied deposition times.Scratch testing was conducted on the fabricated specimens using a commercial instrument. It is noted that the onset of coating delamination can be clearly identified by high-intensity acoustic emission (AE) signals and high tangential force fluctuations when such events occur, which can be used to determine the critical load for coating delaminations. Scratched track morphology was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy and white light interferometry.The results show that the adhesion of diamond coatings on WC–Co substrates increases with the increased coating thickness, with a nearly linear relation. The trend is consistent with the findings from a previous study that experimentally evaluated the coating thickness effect on the diamond-coated tool performance. Scratched tracks were characterized by diamond coating cracking and coating delaminations once the adhesion critical load is reached. For the two types of interlayer materials tested, neither of them seems to be effective and the diamond coating with the Ti-interlayer shows poor adhesion compared to the Cr-interlayer coatings.","AcknowledgmentsThis research is supported by NSF, CMMI 0928627 — GOALI/Collaborative Research: Interface Engineered Diamond Coatings for Dry Machining, between The University of Alabama, General Motors and University of South Florida.

A job shop equipped with one batch processing machine (BPM) and several unit-capacity machines has been considered. Given a set of jobs, their process routes, processing requirements, and size, the objective is to schedule the jobs such that the makespan is minimized. The BPM can process a batch of jobs as long as its capacity is not exceeded. The batch processing time is equal to the longest processing job in the batch. If no batches were to be formed, the scheduling problem under study reduces to the classical job shop problem with makespan objective, which is known to be nondeterministic polynomial time-hard. A network representation of the problem using disjunctive and conjunctive arcs, and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm are proposed to solve the problem. The solution quality and run time of SA are compared with CPLEX, a commercial solver used to solve the mathematical formulation and with four dispatching rules. Experimental study clearly highlights the advantages, in terms of solution quality and run time, of using SA to solve large-scale problems.",,,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2013-03-08,2013,2013-03-08,2013-10,68,9-12,2383-2391,Closed,Article,"Rojas-Santiago, Miguel; Damodaran, Purushothaman; Muthuswamy, Shanthi; Vélez-Gallego, Mario C.","Rojas-Santiago, Miguel (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Damodaran, Purushothaman (Industrial and Systems Engineering, Northern Illinois University, 60115, Dekalb, IL, USA); Muthuswamy, Shanthi (Department of Technology, Northern Illinois University, 60115, Dekalb, IL, USA); Vélez-Gallego, Mario C.

Recientemente se demostró (Kepp et al. Cancer metastasis reviews. 2011;30:61–9) que las quimioterapias con antraciclinas son particularmente eficaces cuando hay activación de la respuesta inmune ya que hay tanto erradicación del tumor primario como de células residuales gracias a la inducción de muerte inmunogénica (MI). Esta muerte celular se caracteriza por externalización de calreticulina (CRT), movilización de la proteína high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) y secreción de ATP. Por otro lado, aunque la autofagia se ha asociado en algunos modelos con progresión tumoral, recientemente se ha mostrado que es necesaria para la secreción de ATP e indispensable para la MI (Michaud et al. Science. 2011,334:1573–7). Previamente, nuestro grupo, estudiando los efectos citotóxicos y antitumorales de una fracción rica en galotaninos obtenida de Caesalpinia spinosa (P2Et), encontró que se podía inducir apoptosis en diversas líneas celulares tumorales y en el modelo de carcinoma mamario murino metastásico (4T1), favorecer la externalización de CRT, la movilización de HMGB1 y ejercer actividad contra el tumor primario y las metástasis (Urueña, 2012).ObjetivoEste trabajo evalúa el efecto del P2Et en la inducción de autofagia y MI sobre la línea celular B16F10 de melanoma murino metastásico y su efecto antitumoral.Materiales y métodosEl efecto citotóxico de la fracción P2Et se determinó por ensayos de rojo neutro y recuentos con azul de tripano.

Un grupo fue tratado vía s.c con PBS y el otro con 75mg/kg de P2Et, tres veces por semana desde el día de la inoculación de las células tumorales.ResultadosSe encontró que el P2Et es citotóxico sobre células B16F10 (concentración inhibitoria 50 de 63,5μg/ml) e induce autofagia, translocación de la CRT y movilización de HMGB1.

San Pedro de Atacama (SPA) in Northern Chile is the archaeological zone with the highest incidence of snuffing implements in the world. Snuff trays from SPA have been studied under a variety of prisms but their provenience, in particular that of the wood used in their manufacture, has not yet been addressed. The delicate nature of trays and their excellent state of preservation call for the use of non-invasive analytical methods. Wood density was used to demarcate a possible range of species and hence as a broad provenience marker, and its value determined for 169 trays from the museum at San Pedro de Atacama. The results showed that although some of the SPA snuff trays studied may have been manufactured with local wood, most of them used exogenous wood as raw material. At this point, it is not possible to ascertain the precise origin of such wood, but Bolivia and NWA appear as likely candidates. Three distinct styles have been defined for SPA trays: Tiwanaku, San Pedro, and Circumpuneño (encompassing the area around the Puna de Atacama and including SPA). The effect of style on density points to different sources of wood in Tiwanaku style trays and trays in San Pedro and Circumpuneño styles. As expected from geographically and temporally dynamic patterns of interaction of SPA with neighboring regions, diachronic differences in wood density distributions were found. Tray manufacturing technique was not dependent on wood density, suggesting that the skill of artisans and the quality of their tools allowed them to use any type of wood for their art work, independent of its complexity.","AcknowledgmentsThis work was funded by the program Proyectos de Investigación Asociativa, Anillos en Ciencia y Tecnología ACT N° 096 (http://www.cienciaymemoria.cl).

Police reform has taken a high place on the Brazilian political agenda due to their low legitimacy, inefficacy in the execution of their duties, and constant allegations of police corruption and abuses of power. Education is seen as an important instrument for improving policing in Brazil. In an exploratory study, in-depth interviews were conducted with training participants in order to understand the political and organizational issues involved in implementing new guidelines for high-level officer training. The continuing issues facing this reform agenda item include a culture fostered during the authoritarian military era, the lack of police legitimacy in the eyes of the public and elites alike, and the inadequacy of its organizational models for a democratic context.

The simply substitution of components, software, hardware, and/or their adaptation by parameters resetting are an attractive option to face this challenge. Short product life cycles are an undeniable consequence and evidence of this. For this reason, to develop products or services profitably in the product manufacturing field, it is common to use the product family concept, which involves sharing components, functional features, and manufacturing process, both to make a cheaper product development process and to obtain customized products. A new generation of manufacturing systems that deploy characteristics such as adaptability and flexibility responding to the market dynamics called reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are required by market according to manufacturing experts. The manufacturing systems with modular architecture are the best way to meet flexible and adaptable RMSs because they allow reconfiguration by a simple module substitution or by resetting module operation parameters. This paper presents a design methodology developed to obtain modular RMS. The method integrates the utilization of modular architecture principles, selection algorithms (analytical hierarchical process), clustering algorithms (average linkage clustering algorithm), family product features and functional system analysis in the classical product design process. The methodology proposed allows defining the most adequate modular system architecture and the modular definition of the reconfiguration variables that are needed to reach the flexibility required. A real study case about a heat exchanger assembly machine is presented where this methodology is applied in order to present an evidence of its usefulness.",,,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2013-11-16,2013,2013-11-16,2014-02,70,9-12,2199-2210,Closed,Article,"Mesa, Jaime; Maury, Heriberto; Turizo, John; Bula, Antonio","Mesa, Jaime (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Sede Monteria, Monteria, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Turizo, John (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte)","Mesa, Jaime (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte); Turizo, John (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte)",18,3,,4.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038845153,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Success in these applications requires defined and controlled geometric incorporation of the wires into the various platforms. Therefore, establishing the ability to tailor the growth ZnO nanowires to produce specified sizes, surface densities, and orientation will be important. In the reported work, the effects of the seeding layer on these factors were accessed. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to produce thin films of ZnO under varying growth and post-processing conditions. These films were fully characterized, including their thickness, surface roughness, and crystalline orientation. Using these well-defined films as the seeding layer, ZnO nanowires were grown and subsequently characterized in terms of morphology and crystalline properties. It was shown that the resulting nanowire properties are dependent upon the nature of the seeding layer, and careful production of the seeding layer allows for some control over these properties.",AcknowledgmentThis research was partially supported by NSF Grant # 0854023.,,Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids,,,,2013-11,2013,,2013-11,74,11,1578-1588,Closed,Article,"Ladanov, Mikhail; Algarin-Amaris, Paula; Villalba, Pedro; Emirov, Yusuf; Matthews, Garrett; Thomas, Sylvia; Ram, Manoj K.; Kumar, Ashok; Wang, Jing","Ladanov, Mikhail (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA; Nanotechnology Research and Education Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA); Algarin-Amaris, Paula (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA); Villalba, Pedro (Nanotechnology Research and Education Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA; Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Emirov, Yusuf (Nanotechnology Research and Education Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA); Matthews, Garrett (Department of Physics, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA); Thomas, Sylvia (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA); Ram, Manoj K.

In this paper, a freight transport model, including external cost, is developed and applied to the Colombian intercity intermodal strategic network involving equilibrium between the phases of distribution and traffic assignment. Each link on the network includes internal costs: time and operation, and external costs: congestion, accidents, air pollution and CO2 emissions. Marginal costs on the freight transport network are calculated using two approaches. First, it is assumed that an additional unit of demand does not affect the equilibrium of the transport network, and then the marginal cost is estimated as the sum of marginal costs on the shortest path links. The second approach assumes that an additional unit of demand changes the network equilibrium and, consequently, the marginal costs are estimated by calculating the difference between the two equilibrium scenarios. Both approaches are applied to seven selected route corridors covering the most important national freight transport corridors. It was found that both methods produce similar results. Average external costs were rated equal to 0.014 US$/ton-km for highways, 0.000105 US$/ton-km for inland waterway transport and 0.0016 US$/ton-km for rail. In highways, external costs are equivalent to 37% of internal costs, in railways 12%, and in inland waterways they represent only 1%.","We are grateful to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation Colciencias through Contracts COD. 1215-5022-7963 CT 755-2011 and 754 09 and the Colombian Transport Ministry for having supported this research.",,Transportation Planning and Technology,,,,2013-08,2013,,2013-08,36,6,529-546,Closed,Article,"Márquez, Luis; Cantillo, Víctor","Márquez, Luis (School of Transport and Highways Engineering, Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia, Avenida Central del Norte, Tunja, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)",22,3,,4.74,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007710882,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 3 Good Health and Well Being

This experience transforms the urban space in a lived city and makes possible the encounter with the other and with the self.

Despite their extensive use over the last decades, the way emoticons affect subsequent emotional/cognitive processing is not fully understood. Here we conducted a masked priming experiment that explored the time course of the masked affective priming effect while recording event-related potentials. Type of prime (emoticon vs. word) and prime valence (positive vs. negative) were manipulated to assess their influence in the processing of positive/negative target words. Results showed a masked affective priming effect in early (N2) and late temporal windows (LPC). This effect was observed in early components for negative target words and in later components for positive target words. Furthermore, it was restricted to those targets preceded by emoticon primes. Thus, the processing of emoticons seems to be privileged when compared with the words to which they refer.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Maite Carrillo for allowing us to use the facilities of the Psychophysiology Lab at the University of Santiago.

The data was processed using centrality values calculation and statistical analysis through the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results showed moderate levels of nodality, proximity and intermediation degrees regarding small, closed networks with an unsatisfied high demand for support resources. Quality of life showed medium performance levels, with inverse relationships between mental health ( p = .009 < .05) and vitality ( p = .011 < .05) and intermediation. Positive feedback related significantly to general health ( p = .041 < .05), while negative interactions showed inverse relationships to physical functioning ( p = .012 < .05), physical role ( p = .005), mental health ( p = .001 < .05), and emotional role ( p = .009 < .05). In conclusion, among the highly cohesive personal networks, there were less observations of social support that fosters increased energy and psychological health, given that access to this support is limited to a small number of members of the personal network.

Since using relatively resistant cultivars may reduce the number of sprayings as well as postpone the development of the resistance to pesticides, the present study focused on evaluating the damage of T. absoluta on eleven 45-day-old tomato cultivars under greenhouse condition. Larval mines on the leaves as well as the terminal bud damage were considered. Damaged leaves, active mines and damaged terminal buds were significantly different among the cultivars. Cluster analysis using SPSS software resulted in grouping the cultivars into four categories as relatively resistant, partially resistant, partially susceptible and susceptible. The host plant’s growing characteristics (height and leaflet number) were assessed and likewise the weight of the resulted pupae. Differences in vulnerability of the cultivars showed that tomato cultivars possess resistant traits and the identification and utilisation of these traits can give rise to resistant varieties.","We thank Miss Mohammadi and Miss Hakimi for their laboratory help, University of Maragheh for supporting this project and Mr Mardan, manager of the greenhouse in the Khosroshah.",,Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection,,,,2013-07-11,2013,2013-07-11,2014-02-25,47,4,429-436,Closed,Article,"Gharekhani, G.H.; Salek-Ebrahimi, H.","Gharekhani, G.H.

Here we outline the ecological, economic and policy benefits of very large-scale MPAs and show their disproportionate value to global marine conservation targets. In particular we point out that very large-scale MPAs are a critical component of reaching the Aichi targets of protecting 10% of global marine habitats by 2020, because in addition to encompassing entire ecosystems, they will bring forward the expected date of achievement by nearly three decades (2025 as opposed to 2054).

This study aims to offer new perspective on these questions through biomechanical analyses of human skeletal remains from a probable key site in these networks, San Pedro de Atacama (SPdA). Groups that were more intensively involved in long distance trade are expected to have been more habitually mobile, and thus to show greater robusticity and less circular lower limb bone cross-sections. Lower limb biomechanical properties of elite and non-elite Middle Horizon groups (MH, AD 500–1000) were compared with subsequent transitional MH-Late Intermediate Period (LIP, AD 1000–1450) and LIP groups from SPdA, and with LIP groups from Pica-8 and the Azapa Valley. The results indicate that MH populations from SPdA had less robust lower limbs and were by inference less mobile than their successors, with no differences between elite and non-elite, while robusticity was elevated in the MH-LIP transition group. Alternative explanations for the results, such as changes in herding activities, cannot be entirely discounted based on current evidence, but the results are consistent with hypotheses that SPdA may have served as a hub on long distance trade networks during the MH, before residents became more actively involved in long distance trade following the collapse of key links with the Tiwanaku polity. The results also indicate similar levels of robusticity among LIP populations at SPdA, Pica-8 and in the Azapa Valley, implying they may have been involved in trading activities to a similar extent, and perhaps to a greater extent than SPdA MH groups, as regional intergroup relationships changed.","AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by PhD funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK), a current research fellowship at Newnham College, Cambridge, and fieldwork funding from the Chile Projects Competition and Abbey Santander Travel Grants from the Centre of Latin America Studies, University of Cambridge; the Worts Travelling Scholars Fund, University of Cambridge; and the Robert Sloley Fund, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Our purpose is to evaluate how OR/MS research in DOM has evolved in the last years and to what extent the gaps identified by Altay and Green (2006) have been covered. Our findings show no drastic changes or developments in the field of OR/MS in DOM since the publication of Altay and Green (2006). Additionally to our comparative analysis, we present an original evaluation about the most common assumptions in recent OR/MS literature in DOM.

Computed tomography (CT), a non-destructive analytical technique useful in the analysis of archaeological objects in which physical tampering is not desirable, was used to study provenience of wood, quality of craftmanship, taphonomic processes and nature of gemstone inlays in a group of snuff trays. While wood used in the manufacture of trays was mostly exogenous to SPA, gemstones used in inlays were likely of local origin. These findings support the active exchange of goods proposed for the south-central Andes region.

Archaeological contexts associated with paints and pigments, as well as information available from historical times, allow us to suggest hypotheses about their importance in sharing networks of late prehispanic times (A.D. 900—1550) and after Spanish contact. In these times, the production and circulation of pigments would have closely connected the Upper Loa region to the Lípez region in south-western Bolivia and other regions of the Atacama Desert.

The renal coccidium (Margolisiella haliotis) has often been observed concurrent with WS infection. The red abalone Haliotis rufescens is a very susceptible species to WS and is also infected by the coccidium M. haliotis. In contrast, the Japanese abalone Haliotis discus hannai is not infected by these parasites. Interspecific hybridization is a method for improving important traits in animal husbandry. The objective of this study was to determine susceptibility to WS-RLO and M. haliotis infection in the hybrid generated from a cross between red and Japanese abalones. Juveniles from both species and the interspecific hybrid were challenged by exposure to effluent from red abalone adults infected with both parasites. The animals were analyzed by histology at 130days post-challenge. A 33% prevalence WS-RLOs was observed in the red abalone H. rufescens, whereas a 20% prevalence was observed in the hybrid. Infections were graded on a scale of 0-3. Of these red abalones infected, 53% presented grade 1 infection intensity, 10% had grade 2 infections, and 50% had grade 3 infections. However, the hybrids only presented intensities at the extremes of the scale; of those infected 33% showed grade 1 infections and 66% had grade 3 infections. The coccidium prevalence was 7% in red abalone individuals and 13% in the hybrid abalone. In contrast, the Japanese abalone did not present infections with either parasite. As with the prevalence, the infection intensities for the coccidium were higher in the hybrid abalone; of those infected 25% had grade 2 infections, and 75% had grade 3 infections, but the red abalone presented only grade 2 infection intensities. Therefore, the hybrid did not inherited non-susceptibility or resistance characteristics of the parental H. discus hannai and possessed biological conditions that could foster development of both parasites. Development of a culture based on this hybrid abalone should consider its susceptibility to infection by coccidian, WS-RLOs and the potential for developing the WS disease.",AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to the Centro de Producción de Abalón de la Universidad Católica del Norte (CPA-UCN) for their invaluable contribution in providing all the necessary facilities required to undertake this study under controlled conditions.

Se presenta el caso de un hombre de 82 años que mostró una destrucción aguda de las articulaciones de las caderas, rodillas y hombros. Recibió una artroplastia total de cadera derecha en 1992, pero en ese momento su enfermedad de base no fue diagnosticada. En 2007 se documenta, además de hipertensión arterial, prostatismo y valvulopatía cardiaca, la presencia de degeneración macular, espondiloartrosis y discopatías degenerativas cervicales. El paciente fue sometido a varios estudios diagnósticos que evidenciaron una artropatía aguda destructiva con fragilidad morfológica, fibrosis y pigmentación oscura de hueso y cartílago. Solo hasta el año 2010 se logra confirmar el diagnóstico de artropatía ocronótica, debido a la baja prevalencia de esta enfermedad en nuestro medio, poniendo en evidencia las dificultades para lograr un acertado método diagnóstico y terapéutico, para lo cual es indispensable un alto nivel de sospecha clínica.AbstractAlkaptonuria is a hereditary disease that can be associated with homogentisic acid accumulation and cartilage weakening (ochronotic arthropathy). The case is presented of an 82 year-old male who showed an acute destruction of the hip joints, knees and shoulders. He received a total hip arthroplasty on his right side in 1992, and was not diagnosed with ochronosis. In 2007 he was diagnosed with hypertension, prostatism and cardiac valvulopathy, with macular degeneration, degenerative disc disease and cervical spondylarthrosis, also being present. The patient underwent multiple clinical, radiological, and pathological studies, which showed acute destructive arthropathy with morphological fragility of the cartilage, fibrosis, and dark pigmentation of the bone and cartilage. He was finally diagnosed with ochronotic arthropathy in 2010. Due to the low prevalence of this condition in our environment, which also reflects the difficulties in achieving a successful approach to a proper diagnosis and treatment, the orthopedic surgeon should have a high level of clinical suspicion provided by the knowledge of the existence of this disease.",,,Revista Colombiana de Ortopedia y Traumatología,,,,2013-09,2013,,2013-09,27,3,171-176,Closed,Article,"González, Mauricio Villegas; Sarmiento, Carlos García; Galván-Villamarín, Fernando; Castiblanco, Claudia Medina","González, Mauricio Villegas (Residente de 4.o año de Ortopedia, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Sarmiento, Carlos García (Ortopedista, Hospital Central de la Policía Nacional.

Their morphology was studied in detail using light and scanning electron microscopy. Paratypes of R. paski and museum specimens of R. congolensis Campana-Rouget, 1961 from six other host species were examined for comparison. Based on these studies and the available literature data, Rhabdochona congolensis, R. aegyptiaca El-Nafar & Saoud, 1974 (emend.) and R. vesterae Boomker & Petter, 1993 are considered to be junior synonyms of R. paski. The occurrence of this widely distributed African nematode in many fish species belonging to different families and orders suggests that most of them are probably not definitive hosts of this parasite, but only serve as paratenic, paradefinitive or postcyclic hosts (sensu Odening, 1976). True definitive hosts of R. paski appear to be characiform species belonging to some genera (e.g., Alestes, Brycinus, Hydrocynus) of the family Alestidae.","The authors thank David Lotuliakou and John Malala, Kenya Marine and Fishery Research Institute, Kalokol Field Station, for their assistance in the field.

Neuston samples were collected at 48 sites, averaging 50 nautical miles apart, using a manta trawl lined with a 333 μm mesh. The transect bisected a predicted accumulation zone associated with the convergence of surface currents, driven by local winds. The results show an increase in surface abundance of plastic pollution as we neared the center and decrease as we moved away, verifying the presence of a garbage patch. The average abundance and mass was 26,898 particles km(-2) and 70.96 g km(-2), respectively. 88.8% of the plastic pollution was found in the middle third of the samples with the highest value of 396,342 particles km(-2) occurring near the center of the predicted accumulation zone.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for the contributions of all crewmembers aboard the Sea Dragon, specifically Garen Baghdasarian, Jeff Ernst, Clive Cosby and Dale Selvam, and Pangaea Explorations for providing their vessel for this work.

The purpose of this study is to validate a standard measurement instrument in the form of a questionnaire to report the evolutionary outcomes of a specific open technique to repair incisional hernias.MethodsProspective study follows up a cohort of 82 consecutive patients submitted to elective intraperitoneal open hernioplasty of midline incisional hernias. The follow-up consisted in an interview and physical examination 30 days after surgery, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years. Primary outcome measure was reporting the outcomes of hernia repair according to a standardized scale obtained from a questionnaire.ResultsThere was no correlation between complications suffered by patients and score results (p = 0.722). The length of hospital stay was 6.5 ± 4.3 days, and a prolonged hospital stay was related to complications (p = 0.002) and did not influence the score results (p = 0.365). The final score demonstrated that patients had a very good impression on this procedure 1 month after surgery (p = 0.003). This impression shifted to an excellent perception 1 year after surgery remaining similar until the last control (p < 0.0001).ConclusionsIn this series, the intraperitoneal hernioplasty was a procedure associated with minor morbidity and without recurrences 4 years after the operation.

Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in modern and fossil species assemblages of Lago Petén Itzá were used as indicators of changes in the balance between evaporation and precipitation, past lake level and carbon source. Ostracode taphonomy was used to detect past periods of strong currents, high-energy environments, and possible partial or full mixing of the lake. The modern lake water isotopic composition displays clear seasonal differences that are independent of lake level fluctuations. Modern benthic species displayed lower δ18O and δ13C values than nektobenthic species, with differences of 3.0‰ and 5.3‰, respectively. Valves of nektobenthic species display higher values of δ13C because these ostracodes live in shallower environments among abundant algae and aquatic plants, where productivity is high. The benthic species Limnocythere opesta Brehm, 1939 displayed the smallest average offset from δ18O water (+0.3‰) and the largest offset from δ13CDIC values (−4.1‰) among studied ostracode species. Nektobenthic species Heterocypris punctata Keyser, 1975 displayed the smallest difference relative to the δ13CDIC values (−0.1‰).Late Pleistocene–early Holocene climate conditions and water levels in Lago Petén Itzá can be summarized as follows: 1) high lake levels and cold conditions (Last Glacial Maximum [LGM], ∼24–19 ka), 2) fluctuating lake levels and cold conditions (Heinrich Stadial 1 [HS1], ∼19–15 ka), 3) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (Bølling-Allerød [BA], ∼15–13 ka), 4) low lake levels and dry conditions (Younger Dryas [YD], ∼13–11.5 ka) and 5) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (early Holocene, ∼11.5–10.0 ka). Average lake level fluctuation in Lago Petén Itzá during the late Pleistocene–early Holocene was as much as ∼25 m. Ostracode analyses suggest that the LGM was characterized by relatively low δ18O (+4.7 to +6.0‰), and δ13C values (−7.1 to −6.4‰) in ostracode valves, high inferred water depths and high percentages of broken adult and juvenile valves (>66%), suggesting a high-energy environment, strong currents, partial to full mixing, downslope transport, colder water temperatures and wetter conditions. An increase in the relative abundance of the benthic species L. opesta and higher numbers of broken valves suggest heavy precipitation events during the LGM (∼23.7, 21.7, 20.8 and 20.1 ka). HS1 was predominantly dry, but we identified times when lake levels were slightly higher, at the onset of the deglacial and a brief period (∼17–16 ka) between HS1b and HS1a. All studied climate proxies indicate wetter and warmer conditions and lake system stability during the BA.

The number of Spanish and Portuguese people who settled in the region during the first century of colonization was rather unimpressive (less than 350,000 between 1500 and 1600) (Munck 2003). In contrast, African slaves in Latin America numbered in the millions by the end of the colonial era and were nearly 20 times the number brought to the United States (Gates 2011). Migration from Europe to Latin America dramatically increased after the 17th century and, most significantly, after the wars of independence in the late 1800s (Nugent 1996). Latin America emerged as a land of opportunity and open‐door policies by the dawn of the 20th century.",,,,The Encyclopedia of Global Human Migration,Immanuel Ness,,2013-02-04,2013,2013-02-04,,,,,Closed,Chapter,"Gouveia, Lourdes","Gouveia, Lourdes ()",,"Gouveia, Lourdes ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050003852,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society",

Some authors defend a curriculum with more basic courses, such as mathematics, physics and chemistry, in order to create a solid foundation. Moreover, there is a growth of academic exchange programs all around the world, which require a common learning core. Since 1960, the importance of mathematics in Computer Science (CS) undergraduate curricula has been decreasing, particularly, because new fields in CS have risen and they were assimilated in the curricula. Despite its of reduction, mathematics still has its role in CS's curricula. The goal of this paper is to analyze the amount of the courses related to mathematics in different CS undergraduate curricula. In this work is analyzed the lecture hour load dedicated to mathematics courses on eleven Brazilian CS undergraduate programs: The Federal Universities of Ceará, Minas Gerais, Campina Grande, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, State Universities of São Paulo (two programs) and Campinas and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul. These programs were selected among others due their 5-stars rating in the Guia do Estudante 2012 Ranking, published by Editora Abril. To allow this comparison, a definition was established of what was considered to be a lecture hour of mathematics. For a reference point, such programs were compared with two reference curricula in the area: The Brazilian Computer Society curriculum (SBC) and the Computer Science Curriculum 2008 made by the IEEE Computer Society and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) joint task force. The curricula presented in the official websites of the selected universities in 2012 were analyzed and it was possible to conclude that more than half of the programs don't achieve the minimum amount of mathematics study hours necessary during undergraduate studies according to IEEE/ACM's or SBC's reference curricula.",,,,2013 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,,2013-10,2013,,,,,1571-1575,Closed,Proceeding,"Campos, Pedro Paulo Vezza; Souza, Jackson; Olguin, Giuliano","Campos, Pedro Paulo Vezza (Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Souza, Jackson (Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Olguin, Giuliano (University of Campinas, Faculty of Education, Campinas, Brazil; Polytechnic School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil)",,"Campos, Pedro Paulo Vezza (Universidade de São Paulo); Souza, Jackson (Universidade de São Paulo); Olguin, Giuliano (State University of Campinas; Universidade de São Paulo)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093186178,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education

Abundances and types of small plastic debris have only been reported for some isolated beaches in the SE Pacific, but these data are insufficient to evaluate the situation in this region. The citizen science project ""National Sampling of Small Plastic Debris"" was supported by schoolchildren from all over Chile who documented the distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on Chilean beaches. Thirty-nine schools and nearly 1000 students from continental Chile and Easter Island participated in the activity. To validate the data obtained by the students, all samples were recounted in the laboratory. The results of the present study showed that the students were able to follow the instructions and generate reliable data. The average abundance obtained was 27 small plastic pieces per m(2) for the continental coast of Chile, but the samples from Easter Island had extraordinarily higher abundances (>800 items per m(2)). The abundance of small plastic debris on the continental coast could be associated with coastal urban centers and their economic activities. The high abundance found on Easter Island can be explained mainly by the transport of plastic debris via the surface currents in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre, resulting in the accumulation of small plastic debris on the beaches of the island. This first report of the widespread distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on Chilean beaches underscores the need to extend plastic debris research to ecological aspects of the problem and to improve waste management.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank all the teachers, schoolchildren and local advisors who participated in the present study; without their enthusiastic participation this project would not have been possible.

1025,pub.1042143500,10.1016/j.polymer.2012.11.039,,,Analysis of structural changes during plastic deformations of amorphous polyethylene,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to analyze yielding and stress-softening processes during stepped simple tensile loading of bulk amorphous polyethylene (PE) at temperatures (Tdef) well below the glass transition temperature (Tg). Specimens formed by 20 linear chains of 1000 beads each (2 × 104 coarse grained -CH2- units), with energetics described by a united atom potential, were deformed at Tdef = 100K. Configurations at axial strains (εxx) ranging from 0% to 30% were allowed to reach steady state equilibration. Subsequently, configurations in a time period of 5 ps were saved for analysis of their local structure. Local structural characteristics were analyzed using three methods: (i) a geometric description by computing the evolution of self and inter-chain entanglements, the number of bead contacts and the free volume, (ii) the method of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) to obtain a reduced description of the displacement field at each strain level and the vibration of each bead around its equilibrium position, and (iii) Hardy's method to compute the time averaged local stress tensor to obtain a detailed description of the distribution of internal forces. It was found that at early stages of deformation (εxx < 13%) the inter-chain entanglement continuously decreases while the self-entanglement showed no significant variation and no distinct patterning. Also the energy content in each eigenmode of the normalized displacement correlation matrix used in the EOF analysis is almost the same for a large portion of the frequency range regardless of the imposed axial strain level. Furthermore, distribution of the local pressure presented a positive expected value at the initial (εxx = 0%) configuration; the expected value continuously decreases toward the point where the axial stress peaks (εxx = 13%). The evolution of the number of loosely packed regions (quasi-defects), identified by a negative value of the local pressure, showed three distinct regimes: εxx(0%–5%), εxx(5%–13%) and εxx(13%–30%). The first regime corresponds to the fast nucleation of quasi-defects while the last one showed an inversion in the trend during the stress-softening regime with a moderate decreasing tendency. The three analyses show that the plastic deformation in this amorphous material commences with the nucleation of stress-induced defects without significant changes in the molecular degrees of freedom. Despite the chemical nature and inherent internal structure of the material under study, our findings support Argon et al.’s theory [1–4] as well as that of subsequent investigators [4,5] in that local structural rearrangements exist at locations where particles (beads) forming the material are loosely packed; these regions are termed the local shear transformation zones (STZ).","AcknowledgmentsA.

The country which stands out as the cradle of desalination is Chile. In saying this one must acknowledge that this is true in terms of today’s perspective. In fact the areas of the Antofagasta Desert, where the installation and operation of desalination units started in the middle of the nineteenth century and which are analyzed in this paper, were at first part of Bolivia. Land based applications of desalination stepped up their pace in the late nineteenth century in several parts of the world, but it is only in the stretch of desert along the Pacific coast of Peru, Bolivia and Chile, where there is documented evidence that desalination was already applied in several sectors using all the evaporative processes known at the time, such as single effect and possibly MED machines, and the first wind and solar driven desalination plant known. This latter plant is the famous Las Salinas solar desalination plant, built in 1878, which operated continuously for about 50 years. Early applications, documented starting from 1851, were of several types. For instance desalination ensured fresh water supplies to the ports of Cobija, Tocopilla, Mejillones and Antofagasta along the Atacama Desert through tens of ‘resacadoras’ (distillers), guaranteed continuity of fresh water supplies to steam engines of locomotives along the routes of the rapidly expanding railway network, allowed mining activities in places where it would have been difficult to do so otherwise, like in the guano islands off the coast of Peru, and provided the Chilean army with a strategic advantage in the War of the Pacific. This paper is describing and analyzing these early applications of desalination one and a half centuries after they occurred, at a time when the whole of the Latin America region, but in particular the Atacama Desert again, is experiencing a revival of desalination applications and is attracting the attention of the global desalination community.",,,IDA Journal of Desalination and Water Reuse,,,,2013-12,2013,2014-01-09,2013-12,5,2,91-98,Closed,Article,"Gabbrielli, E.","Gabbrielli, E.

Living human populations indigenous to high altitudes in the Andes exhibit a number of biological responses to high-altitude environmental stressors. Delayed growth, short adult stature, and small body weights are developmental responses to undernutrition at high altitudes. Enlarged chests and lung volumes are the result of both developmental acclimatization and long-term genetic adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. Living highland Andeans also adapt to cold stress via small limb proportions in a pattern predicted by Allen’s rule. The longevity of human settlement in the Andes suggests that biological adaptations to high altitudes also should characterize highland Andeans in the ancient past. I synthesize previous work (Weinstein 2005, 2007) that compares body size and proportions and thoracic morphology in human skeletons (N = 347) from highland and lowland archaeological sites in the Andes to identify high-altitude adaptations in Andean prehistory. Variation in intralimb proportions in these skeletons suggest that cold stress was not uniformly experienced throughout the highlands. Highland individuals have smaller body sizes than lowlanders, a difference attributed to poorer quality diets in the highlands. Some of the highlanders have thoracic skeletal morphology indicative of enlarged chests and lungs, features that may have developed in response to high-altitude hypoxia. Dietary practices, ambient temperatures, hypoxic stress, and gene flow differentially affected the biology of ancient highland Andeans and demonstrate that specific biological responses to high altitudes are dependent on population history at high altitudes and the severity of the environmental conditions. Future investigations of biological responses to high altitudes in ancient populations of the Tibetan Plateau and highland Ethiopia will shed further light on the development and evolution of human biological variation at high altitude.","I thank the following institutions and their staff for access to human skeletal samples: The Department of Anthropology, Field Museum, Chicago, Illinois; The Division of Anthropology, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; Departamento de Arqueológica y Museo, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile; and Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo R.P.

The numerical simulation of sea surface directional wave spectrum and other wave parameters for several parameterizations and its relation with the drag coefficient was carried out. The simulated data were compared with in-situ NOAA buoy data. For most of the buoys, WAVEWATCH III™ presented the best statistical comparisons for the main wave parameters, such as significant wave height and peak period. The SWAN model tends to overestimate the maximum values for significant wave height for some buoys and the peak period for almost all the buoys. Both models tend to overestimate the value of peak direction, presenting an area of greater energy to the south. The WAVEWATCH III™ model performs best for buoys located in right forward quadrant, which generally has higher winds and waves. This indicates a better spatial representation of wave parameters in the higher energy areas for the WAVEWATCH III™ model. Results based on the quadrant location for most of the analyzed cases, are in agreement with the results from other sources such as the Scanning Radar Altimeter (SRA).","AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank NOAA that made the main data employed in this research freely available.

Tem como objetivo analisar as representações sociais que os professores/as das disciplinas profissionalizantes tecem sobre o público jovem e adulto que chega à escola em busca de avanço na sua escolarização. Para tanto investigou por meio de entrevistas a formação básica (graduação) e continuada desses educadores e sua percepção sobre o Proeja e alunos deste programa. A partir desses dados, buscou problematizar os reflexos nas representações sobre esses estudantes. Ainda que os professores reconheçam a importância do programa, constatou-se a necessidade de serem criados fóruns para estudos e reflexões coletivas com a finalidade de repensar a sua práxis. Essas ações são importantes uma vez que persiste uma lacuna na formação básica e continuada desses educadores. Tal fato implica na incompreensão dos fundamentos epistemológicos e filosóficos que teorizam a prática docente para essa modalidade.

In the former, national identity is considered a part of the political reasoning with underlying concepts and explanations of a social-geographical and logical content. In the latter, national identity is viewed as a facet of the self, linking the individual (or not) to others with whom s/he shares her/his sense of membership of the group or groups, as it is the case for those exposed to more than one culture. These are often considered pertaining exclusively to their family's country of origin.

990,pub.1092847174,10.1115/es2013-18023,,,Application of Mechanisms for the Control of Autoignition in High Power Internal Combustion Engine Fueled With Natural Gas,"In this paper, a thermodynamic model of a spark ignition internal combustion engine fueled with natural gas is developed in order to estimate the air-fuel-unburned gas temperature at before top dead center (BTDC). This temperature is used as controlled variable in a control loop in order to avoid the autoignition phenomena when the engine operates with a fuel with different methane number from the methane number requirement of the engine. The model formulation is based on a polytropic compression proccess whose coefficient was determined experimentally in a turbocharged internal combustion engine fueled with natural gas. To make feasible the use of differents gaseous fuels from natural gas, it was necessary to design two control strategies to avoid the knocking phenomenon and choose the best one. The ambient temperature is the disturbance considered, whose changes are significant in different places in the world. The first control strategy that was implemented is called “Robust”, which employs a conventional feedback control loop with a robust controller which is designed. The response of this control loop is compared to the response of the second control strategy called “Feedforward control”. The results obtained reveals that Feedforward control strategy has better performance than robust control strategy for this application. The control strategy and the model proposed will allow increase the range of application of gaseous fuels with low methane number (MN) leading to guarantee a safe running in internal combustion engines that currently are fueled with natural gas.Copyright © 2013 by ASME",,,,ASME 2013 7th International Conference on Energy Sustainability,,,2013-07-14,2013,2013-12-22,2013-07-14,,,v001t13a002-v001t13a002,Closed,Proceeding,"Forero, Jorge Duarte; Diaz, German Amador; Garcia, Jesus Garcia; San Juan Mejia, Marco; Martinez, Lesme Corredor","Forero, Jorge Duarte (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Garcia, Jesus Garcia (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); San Juan Mejia, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez, Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Forero, Jorge Duarte (Universidad del Norte); Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte); Garcia, Jesus Garcia (Universidad del Norte); San Juan Mejia, Marco (Universidad del Norte); Martinez, Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092847174,"40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 4017 Mechanical Engineering",

Students (N = 1066) from Cape Town, South Africa, filled out questionnaires at three different time points. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that self-efficacy did not predict behavior directly but indirectly via intention. Knowledge of how to use a condom and how STIs are transmitted directly predicted behavior when modeled as hypothesized by the IMB model, but indirectly when the factors attitude, subjective norms and self-efficacy were included as mediators, as hypothesized by the ICM. It is concluded that the ICM and IMB are similar in terms of model fit and explained variance, but that the ICM had a higher proportion of significant pathways.","We would like to thank all partners involved in the SATZ project.

Twenty patients with active RA underwent a year of treatment with MTX (12.5 mg/week) associated to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or prednisone (5-10 mg/day) were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n=10), that received the extract supplementation (900 mg/day) or preceding usual treatment (n=10) during 180 days. RA activity was evaluated using the tender and swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, disease activity score-28 (DAS 28), visual analogue scale (VAS) and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). Treatment's efficacy was demonstrated with ACR criteria. Only the patients of MTX-Vimang group revealed statistically significant improvement in DAS 28 parameters with respect baseline data but no differences were observed between groups. ACR improvements amounted 80% only in MTX-Vimang group at the 90 days (p<0.001). In MTX-Vimang group, 100% of patients decreased NSAIDs administration (p<0.01) and 70% of those eradicated gastrointestinal side effects (p<0.01) ensuing of the preceding treatment. Other adverse effects were not reported.","Acknowledgements Special thanks to Jorge Conde Garrido for the advice on correct use of the English language.

966,pub.1032293085,10.1007/s13762-013-0314-0,,,Methoxychlor bioremediation by defined consortium of environmental Streptomyces strains,"Methoxychlor is an organochlorine pesticide used worldwide against several insect pests, resulting in human exposure. This pesticide mimics endocrine hormone functions, interfering with normal endocrine activity in humans and wildlife. For this reason, it is imperative to develop methods to remove this pesticide from the environment, and though, bioremediation using microorganisms results as an excellent strategy. Five Streptomyces spp. strains previously isolated from organochlorine-polluted sites and capable to grow and remove methoxychlor were combined as different mixed cultures to increase methoxychlor removal. From the 39 consortia tested, one consortium (Streptomyces spp. A6, A12, A14, M7) was selected because of its high pesticide removal and specific dechlorinase activity to be assayed on slurry and soil systems. This consortium showed higher biomass values (8.3 × 106 ± 5.7 × 105 CFU mL−1) and methoxychlor removal (56.2 ± 2.3 %) on enriched slurry than in non-enriched slurry (7.3 × 105 ± 1.2 × 105 CFU mL−1 and 45.6 ± 7.4 % of pesticide removal). In soil systems, Streptomyces consortium showed higher growth (1.0 × 1011 ± 5.0 × 1010 CFU g−1) than in enriched slurry, although differences in methoxychlor removal between both culture conditions were not statistically significant. Therefore, the selected Streptomyces consortium may be suitable for the development of in situ (soil) and ex situ (slurry bioreactor) bioremediation methods because of their potential to remove methoxychlor from different systems.","This work was supported by Consejo de Investigaciones de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (CIUNT), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) and Fundación Bunge y Born.

Cardiopulmonary variables were recorded in vivo, with and without SOC blockade by 2-aminoethyldiphenylborinate (2-APB), during basal or acute hypoxic conditions. 2-APB did not have effects on basal mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), cardiac output, systemic arterial blood pressure, or systemic vascular resistance in both groups of neonates. During acute hypoxia 2-APB reduced mPAP and pulmonary vascular resistance in LA and HA, but this reduction was greater in HA. In addition, isolated pulmonary arteries mounted in a wire myograph were assessed for vascular reactivity. HA arteries showed a greater relaxation and sensitivity to SOC blockers than LA arteries. The pulmonary expression of two SOC-forming subunits, TRPC4 and STIM1, was upregulated in HA. Taken together, our results show that SOC contribute to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in newborn sheep and that SOC are upregulated by chronic hypoxia. Therefore, SOC may contribute to the development of neonatal pulmonary hypertension. We propose SOC channels could be potential targets to treat neonatal pulmonary hypertension.","We are grateful to Carlos Brito, Gabino Llusco, and Enrique Pérez for excellent technical assistance.",,American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,,,"Altitude; Altitude Sickness; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Boron Compounds; Disease Models, Animal; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypoxia; Infant, Newborn; Ion Channels; Persistent Fetal Circulation Syndrome; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Circulation; Sheep, Domestic; TRPC Cation Channels; Vasoconstriction",2013-02-15,2013,2013-02-15,2013-04-15,304,8,l540-l548,Closed,Article,"Parrau, Daniela; Ebensperger, Germán; Herrera, Emilio A.; Moraga, Fernando; Riquelme, Raquel A.; Ulloa, César E.; Rojas, Rodrigo T.; Silva, Pablo; Hernandez, Ismael; Ferrada, Javiera; Diaz, Marcela; Parer, Julian T.; Cabello, Gertrudis; Llanos, Aníbal J.; Reyes, Roberto V.","Parrau, Daniela (Laboratorios de Fisiología y Fisiopatología del Desarrollo, y de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular de la Hipoxia, Programa de Fisiopatología, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas (ICBM), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile;; Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; and); Ebensperger, Germán (Laboratorios de Fisiología y Fisiopatología del Desarrollo, y de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular de la Hipoxia, Programa de Fisiopatología, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas (ICBM), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile;); Herrera, Emilio A.

Concrete specimens were used to analyze the polarization history of the embedded sacrificial anodes under galvanostatic load and in yard slabs as a function of anode service aging. The results were used to develop a characteristic time-dependent potential-current function (PF) of each anode type. Typically, the performance function showed relatively little anodic polarization from an open-circuit potential at low current levels, followed by an abrupt increase in potential as the current approached an apparent limiting value. Aging of the anodes was manifested by significantly steeper PF as time and total charge delivered increased. Modest to poor steel polarization levels were achieved when coupled with point anodes in yard slabs tests. There was marked performance function variability among replicate units of one anode type. The results are used for cathodic prevention performance modeling in a companion (Part 2) paper.","This investigation was supported by the State of Florida Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

In the present study, 1,070 pedagogy students from the northern, central and southern regions of Chile answered the MVS. This sample was randomly divided in two. Using the first sub-sample (N = 539), an exploratory factorial analysis was carried out, from which a structure of nine items was grouped into two factors called “Social Success” and “Personal Happiness”, which presented adequate reliability. Later, with the second sub-sample (N = 531), the factorial structure indicated above was put to the test through a confirmatory factorial analysis. The data from the model show that the scale contains 8 items in total, grouped into two dimensions.

Larval cultures from untreated and treated rearing tanks exhibited percentages of copiotrophic bacteria resistant to florfenicol ranging from 0.03% to 10.67% and 0.49-18.34%, respectively, whereas florfenicol resistance among oligotrophic bacteria varied from 1.44% to 35.50% and 3.62-95.71%, from untreated and treated larvae, respectively. Florfenicol resistant microbiota from reared scallop larvae mainly belonged to the Pseudomonas and Pseudoalteromonas genus and were mainly resistant to florfenicol, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and co-trimoxazole. This is the first study reporting antimicrobial resistant bacteria associated to a shellfish hatchery and the results suggest that a continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance even in absence of antibacterial therapy is urgently required to evaluate potential undesirable consequences on the surrounding environments.",AcknowledgementsThis study was financially supported by the Science and Technology National Council (CONICYT) of Chile by the Project Grant No. 1090793.

In marine systems, the impact of tissue loss on the growth rates of habitat-forming algae is poorly understood. We quantified the grazing damage by an isopod Amphoroidea typa on two species of large kelps, Lessonia spicata and Macrocystis pyrifera, in temperate Chile to test whether non-lethal grazing damage could reduce kelp growth rates and photosynthetic efficiency. For L. spicata, grazing damage was widespread in the field, unevenly distributed on several spatial scales (among individuals and among tissue types) and negatively correlated with blade growth rates. In field experiments, feeding by A. typa reduced the concentration of photosynthetic pigments and led to large reductions (~80 %) in blade growth rates despite limited loss of kelp biomass (0.5 % per day). For M. pyrifera, rates of damage in the field were lower and high densities of grazers were unable to reduce growth rates in field experiments. These results demonstrate that even low per capita grazing rates can result in large reductions in the growth of a kelp, due the spatial clustering of herbivores in the field and the selective removal of photosynthetically active tissues. The impacts of small herbivores on plant performance are thus not easily predicted from consumption rates or abundance in the field, and vary with plant species due to variation in their ability to compensate for damage.","We thank L.

Seabirds play a key role in transporting resources of marine origin to insular ecosystems. We report tree-growth patterns showing how the effects of El Niño rainy events on tree species in a southern Pacific island depend on the presence of local seabird colonies. We performed manipulative experiments in order to assess the mechanisms underlying these patterns. Tree ring data showed that, in normal years, the growth of all tree species (Aextoxicon punctatum, Cryptocarya alba, and Pinus radiata) was significantly lower in seabird sites compared to adjacent patches without seabirds (control sites). In contrast, in El Niño years, trees formerly hosting seabird colonies grew more than those in control sites. Experiments showed that (1) pine plants on soil from seabird sites grew more than those on soil from control sites, (2) pine individuals with seabird feces on their leaves grew less than those sprayed with an aqueous solution, and (3) soil moisture had little effect on plant growth. The stress produced by massive cormorant nesting on trees, which impairs tree growth and physiological performance, is relieved during El Niño events because of seabird migration due to decreased prey availability and pouring rains that flood nests. Soils enriched by the seabird guano, together with the increased water availability associated with El Niño, foster the growth of trees from seabird sites. We suggest that El Niño may be a key determinant of tree performance in forest communities from island and coastal ecosystems of the Pacific Ocean.",We thank Karina Ruiz‐Carrasco and Susana Gómez‐González for their valuable assistance in the fieldwork.

High densities of AMD were found in coastal waters and on local shores of a large bay system in northern-central Chile. No seasonal pattern in AMD densities was found, but there was a trend of increasing densities over the entire study period. While plastics and Styrofoam were the most common types of AMD both on shores and in coastal waters, AMD composition differed slightly between the two environments. The results suggest that AMD from coastal waters are deposited on local shores, which over time accumulate all types of AMD. The types and the very low percentages of AMD with epibionts point to mostly local sources. Based on these results, it can be concluded that a reduction of AMD will require local solutions.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to all the members of the BEDIM lab who helped with the collection and sorting of marine debris, and the crew of RV Stella Maris for their good company during the research cruises.

SNNs offer the possibility to implement embedded neuromorphic circuits, with high parallelism and low power consumption compared to the traditional von Neumann computer paradigms. Nevertheless, the lack of modularity and poor connectivity shown by traditional neuron interconnect implementations based on shared bus topologies is prohibiting scalable hardware implementations of SNNs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical network-on-chip (H-NoC) architecture for SNN hardware, which aims to address the scalability issue by creating a modular array of clusters of neurons using a hierarchical structure of low and high-level routers. The proposed H-NoC architecture incorporates a spike traffic compression technique to exploit SNN traffic patterns and locality between neurons, thus reducing traffic overhead and improving throughput on the network. In addition, adaptive routing capabilities between clusters balance local and global traffic loads to sustain throughput under bursting activity. Analytical results show the scalability of the proposed H-NoC approach under different scenarios, while simulation and synthesis analysis using 65-nm CMOS technology demonstrate high-throughput, low-cost area, and power consumption per cluster, respectively.",,,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,,,,2013-10-28,2013,2013-10-28,,24,12,2451-2461,Closed,Article,"Carrillo, Snaider; Harkin, Jim; McDaid, Liam J.; Morgan, Fearghal; Pande, Sandeep; Cawley, Seamus; McGinley, Brian","Carrillo, Snaider (Intell.

A second goal was to evaluate the effects of these resources on the students' teacher training process. 110 subjects belonging to the Special Education and Physical Education groups of the Primary Education degree agreed to participate. Students were asked to systematically construct different pieces of equipment. At the end of the project, they were invited to complete a 40-item questionnaire with two subscales. The final results showed that this group of future teachers believes that self-made materials can involve students in their own learning process. Special Education students highlighted that this type of materials can really attend schools' diversity. They are also perceived as a valuable teaching tool.

This article examines Islas Choros-Damas Marine Reserve, a small marine protected area located in a highly productive and biologically diverse coastal marine ecosystem in northern Chile, and the interactions between human, institutional, and ecological dimensions beyond those existing within its boundaries. Through documents analysis, surveys, and interviews, we described marine reserve implementation (governing system) and the social and natural ecosystem-to-be-governed. We analyzed the interactions and the connections between the marine reserve and other spatially explicit conservation and/or management measures existing in the area and influencing management outcomes and governance. A top-down approach with poor stakeholder involvement characterized the implementation process. The marine reserve is highly connected with other spatially explicit measures and with a wider social–ecological system through various ecological processes and socio-economic interactions. Current institutional interactions with positive effects on the management and governance are scarce, although several potential interactions may be developed. For the study area, any management action must recognize interferences from outside conditions and consider some of them (e.g., ecotourism management) as cross-cutting actions for the entire social–ecological system. We consider that institutional interactions and the development of social networks are opportunities to any collective effort aiming to improve governance of Islas Choros-Damas marine reserve. Communication of connections and interactions between marine protected areas and the wider social–ecological system (as described in this study) is proposed as a strategy to improve stakeholder participation in Chilean marine protected areas.","We thank Ignacio Petit for his assistance in implementing field surveys, Rosa Garay-Flühmann for inspiring some aspects of this research, fishermen leaders of the Municipality of La Higuera for agreeing to be interviewed, and editor Andy Thorpe and three anonymous reviewers whose comments significantly improved the manuscript.

Additionally, the high cost of robotic systems makes it difficult to financially justify the use of this technology. The purpose of this paper is to present a new design process that gathers conceptual, kinematic and dynamic design, finite elements method (FEM), functional design and virtual reality control. Furthermore, kinematic and dynamic design can be obtained by traditional theory or standard computer tools (SCT) to accelerate the design. Through SCT fitted mathematical models and non‐mathematical virtual models may be acquired.   Design/methodology/approach  This paper investigates the design process of a robot. First, the entire methodology is presented (including two new techniques for solving the kinematic and dynamic questions via SCT). Second, a case study using Autodesk ® Inventor™ has been analysed to assess the feasibility of the method and techniques.    Findings The more stages of the design process are considered, the more successful solutions become. Designers can obtain a mathematical solution for an analytically unsolvable robot fitting a mathematical model by SCT. To obtain a rapid design, designers must consider using SCT and following just in need (JIN) philosophy to find a non‐mathematical virtual model.

In this paper we present an approach to the phenomenon of traumatic amputation from a qualitative perspective and humanist, combining methodologies such as ethnography and combining them with the clinical psychology practice. Objectives. We propose to describe the suffering and coping strategies of amputees and to analyze the appearance of the concept of resilience in the speeches of the amputees and explain the importance of psychological support at various phases. Methodology. Qualitative ethnographic study. The main unit of analysis is lower limb amputees living in the Region of Murcia (Spain) and data were collected through semi-structured interview techniques such as the biographical method and participant observation. Results and discussion. It describes the main results of the study divided into experiences of suffering, coping strategies and psychotherapeutic applications. Conclusions. The amputees suffering is defined very different ways. Coping strategy determines that there is a more or less suffering before the amputation. Resilience can face and overcome the problems of amputees, and psychotherapy prevents and treats the aspects that influence the adaptation of the amputee.",,,Revista de PSICOLOGÍA DE LA SALUD,,,,2013,2013,,2013,1,1,23-44,Closed,Article,"Díaz, José Luis; Costa, César Leal; Gómez, Magdalena","Díaz, José Luis (Dr. en Ciencias Sociosanitarias por la UCAM); Costa, César Leal (Dr. en Psicología por la UMH); Gómez, Magdalena (Dra. en Psicología por la UMU)",,"Díaz, José Luis (Dr. en Ciencias Sociosanitarias por la UCAM); Costa, César Leal (Dr. en Psicología por la UMH); Gómez, Magdalena (Dra. en Psicología por la UMU)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101713946,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Despite the strong cultural influence of Tiwanaku and numerous other groups evident in interactions with Atacameños, the role of immigration into the oases during this period is unclear. While archaeological and bioarchaeological research in the region has shown no evidence that clearly indicates large groups of foreign immigrants, the contemporary increase in interregional exchange networks connecting the oases to other parts of the Andes suggests residential mobility and the possibility that movement of people both into and out of the oases accompanied these foreign influences. Here, we analyze biodistance through cranial non-metric traits in a skeletal sample from prehistoric San Pedro de Atacama to elucidate the extent of foreign influence in the oases and discuss its implications. We analyzed 715 individuals from the Middle Period (AD 400-1000) and later Regional Developments Period (AD 1000-1450), and found greater phenotypic differences between Middle Period cemeteries than among cemeteries in the subsequent period. We argue that this greater diversity extends beyond the relationship between the oases and the renowned Tiwanaku polity and reflects the role of the oases and its different ayllus as a node and way station for the Middle Period's myriad interregional networks.","The authors thank Blair Daverman, Laura King, and William Pestle for their invaluable contributions during data collection and analysis as well as express our appreciation for the time and library resources provided by a Summer Fellowship at Dumbarton Oaks (CTR).

In shrimps from the family Lysmatidae, Bauer's historical contingency hypothesis (HCh) suggests that SH evolved in an ancestral tropical species that adopted a symbiotic lifestyle with, e.g., sea anemones and became a specialized fish-cleaner. Restricted mobility of shrimps due to their association with a host, and hence, reduced probability of encountering mating partners, would have favored SH. The HCh is a special case of the TGh. Herein, I examined within a phylogenetic framework whether the TGh/HCh explains the origin of SH in shrimps. A phylogeny of caridean broken-back shrimps in the families Lysmatidae, Barbouriidae, Merguiidae was first developed using nuclear and mitochondrial makers. Complete evidence phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) demonstrated that Lysmatidae+Barbouriidae are monophyletic. In turn, Merguiidae is sister to the Lysmatidae+Barbouriidae. ML and BI ancestral character-state reconstruction in the resulting phylogenetic trees indicated that the ancestral Lysmatidae was either gregarious or lived in small groups and was not symbiotic. Four different evolutionary transitions from a free-living to a symbiotic lifestyle occurred in shrimps. Therefore, the evolution of SH in shrimps cannot be explained by the TGh/HCh; reduced probability of encountering mating partners in an ancestral species due to its association with a sessile host did not favor SH in the Lysmatidae. It is proposed that two conditions acting together in the past; low male mating opportunities and brooding constraints, might have favored SH in the ancestral Lysmatidae+Barbouridae. Additional studies on the life history and phylogenetics of broken-back shrimps are needed to understand the evolution of SH in the ecologically diverse Caridea.","AcknowledgmentsJAB was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the SMSFP and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI).

The geology of the site and the performance of alternative support designs are described. Field observations are analysed to identify the causes of the observed swelling. It was found that long-term swelling in Lilla tunnel was the result of gypsum crystal growth in discontinuities. The phenomenon was a consequence of a few contributing factors: significant presence of anhydrite, existent or activated discontinuities, and the circulation of water. These conditions were present in the highly tectonised Tertiary claystone in Lilla. The original horseshoe cross-section was transformed into a circular one, and a reinforced concrete lining was built to resist swelling pressures. Long-term monitoring of the reinforced tunnel provided valuable data on the evolution of swelling pressures against the lining, and on the stresses developed in the resisting structure. The highly heterogeneous distribution of swelling pressures against the lining explains the low strains measured in reinforcement bars despite the very high maximum swelling pressures recorded.","The authors are grateful to ADIF (the Spanish agency for railway infrastructure) for their financial and continuous support during the development of the work described in the paper.

556,pub.1068925143,10.2113/econgeo.108.6.1397,,,"Structural Geologic Evolution of the Butte District, Montana","The Butte district contains two porphyry Cu-Mo deposits and the younger zoned Main stage base metal lode deposits that formed in the period from 66 to 62 Ma, synchronous with Laramide compressional thrust faulting and folding in southwest Montana. New geologic mapping of the Butte district reveals three distinct episodes of deformation: Stratigraphic relationships, isotopic ages, hornblende barometry, and fluid inclusion data indicate that exposures of the Butte Granite, which hosts mineralization, crystallized at ~6- to 9-km depth and that early porphyry Cu-Mo deposits formed at similar depths of 5 to 9 km. A period of rapid uplift and erosion removed about 7 km of rock from above the ore deposit between 66 to 64 Ma and 53 Ma, but was mostly completed by 59 Ma. Estimated exhumation rates range from 0.5 to 2 mm/yr, and uplift was likely most rapid between ~63.5 and 62 Ma during Main stage mineralization, which occurred at depths of 2 to 6 km. The Butte Granite and Boulder batholith were emplaced at 79 to 76 Ma into thrust fault ramps, which later became inactive near Butte as Laramide crustal shortening moved eastward in the Helena salient. The accelerated period of uplift and unroofing is attributed to renewed deformation along the Montana disturbed belt south of Butte that uplifted the south end of the Boulder batholith and produced ~20° of gentle NE tilting (episode I) in the district. The exhumation history of the deposit is therefore broadly contemporaneous with ore formation, and is consistent with the general transition from lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions that is evident from the telescoping of early porphyry Cu-Mo ores cut by the Main stage lode veins. Within a 5-m.y. period, the Laramide compressional regime near Butte evolved into an extensional environment characterized by normal faulting. The normal faults were synchronous with eruption of the 53 to 48 Ma Lowland Creek Volcanics, which directly overlie the Main stage veins in the northwest part of the district. Structural reconstruction of the district at the time of mineralization produces orientations of quartz porphyry dikes, porphyry Cu-Mo veinlets, Main stage veins, and alteration zonal patterns that are steeply dipping and symmetrical, similar to observations from other upright or restored porphyry copper deposits. Early porphyry Cu-Mo veins and dikes are oriented E-W and likely originated as tensile hydrofractures above a ductile magma carapace during Laramide shortening. Additionally, during the Laramide compressional phase, two conjugate fault systems occupied by Main stage veins are normal oblique-slip faults that record minor E-W and vertical shortening and N-S extension. These normal faults with minor offset likely resulted from brittle failure caused by doming above a volatile-rich and buoyant granitic magma chamber and cupola at depth. The structural evolution of the Butte district therefore reflects the interaction of a far-field compressive stress regime with local buoyant magmatic forces.","This research was supported by grants from the Tobacco Root Geological Society to Houston, and by NSF grants EAR-9614683 and EAR-0001230 to Dilles and Cyrus Field of Oregon State University.

This bias is computed at three geographical scales, using several fixed baskets and across different expenditures quartiles. Our results show a significant substitution bias for small geographical units. The choice of the base basket is also relevant for the bias estimation. Finally, the spatial substitution bias is larger for upper side of the expenditure distribution due to the heterogeneity in the consumption basket. This exercise shows that the spatial dimension affects the construction of a price index and that the approach of fixed baskets should be carefully considered in the estimation of spatial price differentials.",,,Papers of the Regional Science Association,,,,2013-03,2013,,2013-03,92,1,103-118,Closed,Article,"Araya, Dusan Paredes; Rivera, Victor Iturra","Araya, Dusan Paredes (Department of Economics, Universidad Catolica del Norte, 0610 Avenida Angamos Antofagasta Antofagasta, 1240000 Chile); Rivera, Victor Iturra (Department of Economics, Universidad Catolica del Norte, 0610 Avenida Angamos Antofagasta Antofagasta, 1240000 Chile)",,"Araya, Dusan Paredes (Catholic University of the North); Rivera, Victor Iturra (Catholic University of the North)",21,2,,6.61,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052006981,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,

Survival, weight and length curves were calibrated, and feed consumption and feed conversion rate curves were constructed. Revenues, costs and investments were also estimated. It was found that operational net present values per batch are maximized when fishes are harvested on approximately day 300 after stocking, in contrast to 180 days, which is the actual time of harvest at present. Thus, culture performance can be improved significantly if recommendations arising from the model are followed. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the model demonstrated that tilapia cultures can withstand unfavorable variations in critical parameters.","We acknowledge the support of the Project NS 100046 of the Iniciativa Científica Milenio of the Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Turismo, Chile.",,Aquaculture International,,,,2013-04-17,2013,2013-04-17,2014-04,22,2,339-359,Closed,Article,"Zuniga-Jara, Sergio; Goycolea-Homann, Mauricio","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Goycolea-Homann, Mauricio (Escuela de Ciencias del Mar, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)","Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Goycolea-Homann, Mauricio (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)",14,3,,1.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011008419,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the institutional framework of a region or country to assess whether this framework is compatible and whether it will promote or potentially hinder the implementation of new management strategies. This paper explores the possibilities and constraints of institutional frameworks (represented by legislation) concerning the possible implementation of ecosystem-based management of the Chilean coast. We evaluated the functional fit between a conceptual ecosystem defined by stakeholders (and based on ecosystem services, threats and uses/activities) and Chilean legislation related to coastal and marine resource planning and management. First, we measured the functional fit between the defined ecosystem and legislation through a quantitative analysis based on text revision and network analysis. Second, we evaluated different management, conservation and planning instruments existing in Chilean legislation, with respect to their suitability for the implementation of ecosystem-based management. We found that Chilean legislation rarely accounts for relationships defined between the different components of the ecosystem model. We observed low functional fit potential and many gaps in legislation. However, we found that certain existing instruments in the current legislation can be used as a foundation for implementing management based on the principles and criteria of ecosystem-based management (e.g., Multiple-Use Coastal Marine Protected Areas).","We thank J.

In South Africa in the early 1970s activists elaborated the radical ideas of the 1960s and as international movements for social justice lost their momentum in other countries, opposition to state power resurfaced in South Africa.

399,pub.1010068350,10.1016/j.linged.2013.09.004,,,Monolingualism in a historically Black South African University: A case of inheritance,"The advent of the 11 official language policy in South Africa presented institutions of higher learning with opportunities to become multilingual universities in line with trends elsewhere. On the one hand, a number of historically White universities (HWUs) started introducing university-wide language policy initiatives and discussions, which are, however, still in their infancy. On the other hand, historically Black universities (HBUs) seem to have almost regressed by going for English-only default policy practices, regardless of the widely reported low literacy rates among their student populations. In this paper, we present a case study of a historically Black university with a specific focus on its non-policy situation to draw generalizations that apply to other HBWs in South Africa. Using the concept of “multilingual universities” and its typologies that are grounded in Bourdieu's cultural capital framework, we show disparities between what is feasible under the university's linguistic profile and the present monolingual default practices. While highlighting the literacy “costs” of missing the multilingual capital, we argue for the benefits of a trifocal language policy practice where the university can serve as a catalyst for best multi-literacy development practices. In conclusion, we offer recommendations for multilingual development in higher education and possible areas for further research.",,,Linguistics and Education,,,,2013-12,2013,,2013-12,24,4,406-414,Closed,Article,"Makalela, Leketi; McCabe, Rose-marie","Makalela, Leketi (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa); McCabe, Rose-marie (University of Limpopo, South Africa)","Makalela, Leketi (University of the Witwatersrand)","Makalela, Leketi (University of the Witwatersrand); McCabe, Rose-marie (University of Limpopo)",13,3,,5.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010068350,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

This review combines published information on cranial trauma and settlement patterns, which often align and clarify each other, to make an initial assessment of how severely Andean populations were affected by war over time and space. The data speak to a number of major topics in the archaeology of warfare, such as the origin of war, contrasts in state militarism, and changes in the practice of war related to social organization. Although there is considerable regional variation, two large-scale “waves” of escalated conflict that are clearly supported by the cranial trauma and settlement pattern data occurred in the Final Formative (late Early Horizon, 400 BC–AD 100) and the Late Intermediate period (AD 1000–1400).","The authors thank the numerous scholars who gave permission to cite conference papers and articles in preparation, and provided clarification or more detailed data, including Valerie Andrushko, Robert Benfer, Kevin Darcy, Julie Farnum, Catherine Gaither, Danielle Kurin, Ken Nystrom, Elsa Tomasto, Marla Toyne, and John Verano.

It is known that elevated concentrations of solutes in these solutions have a negative effect on the microbial population leading to decrease the dissolution of copper containing ore. To study the effect of the ionic load on the microbial oxidizing activity, a regression model was built using the systematic data obtained for the concentrations of sulfate, aluminum, chloride and manganese in solutions, during five years of operation. Then, this model was used to support a design of experiment (DOE). The DOE revealed an important effect on the microbial activity produced by sulfate and/or aluminum, decreasing the activity to minimum values, but the effect of chloride and manganese were not significant on the microbial oxidizing activity.

This is especially relevant for bio-mining operations where not only the source but the water quality can be a decisive factor for its successful utilization. This research evaluates the metallurgical and microbiological performance of an adapted chloride and copper-resistant mixed culture during the leaching (laboratory scale columns) of a secondary copper sulfide at different chloride concentrations. Up to 6 g/l chloride all columns established Eh potentials over 750 mV with complete oxidation of ferrous iron in the PLS showing well established microbial activity. Copper recovery in solution, along with a high redox potential, was established faster in the mesophilic column but leveled off quickly over time. Copper extraction showed that the 6 g/l chloride column has the highest metallurgical performance (83% CuT) with 4 extra points of copper recovery over the 1.5 g/L and 3 g/l Cl- columns. These results are a good indication that comparable copper recovery rates –to the ones achieved using fresh water- can be reached in the presence of important chloride concentrations by way of using the use of a suitable and well adapted microbial population. The related process and chloride-resistant culture have been patented under the following ID N°: EP2313534/US0201095.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,292-295,Closed,Article,"Davis-Belmar, Carol S.; Cautivo, Dina; Rautenbach, George; Demergasso, Cecilia","Davis-Belmar, Carol S.

The design of the heap considers seven lifts of eighteen meters height each. Nowadays, the heap is being operated with ore loaded in the second and third lifts. The amount of acid required for the process can be increased by increasing the height of the heap and also by the characteristics of the ore. This effect can be attributed to the increase of contact time between ore and solution. The goal of this work was to assess the effect of using raffinate solution with elevated concentration of acid on a microbial culture obtained from process solutions. Reactor tests of culture grown in industrial raffinate solution were performed and DNA and RNA were extracted for qPCR and RT-qPCR analyses, respectively. A design of experiment (DOE) was considered to determine the number of replicates in order to assess the effect of two concentrations of sulfate (80 and 100 g/L) and two incubation temperatures (30 and 45 °C). In addition, analysis of the Most Probable Number (MPN) of iron and sulfur oxidizing organisms and oxidation tests were used to determine the microbial activity in the tests. The results obtained from the DOE showed that acid, temperature and the interaction of temperature and energy source had a significant effect on the microbial activity. Both iron and sulfur oxidizing activities decreased when acid was added at elevated concentration. By other hand, molecular analyses showed differences in levels of specific concentrations of microorganisms and the expression of 16S rRNA gene of the different species thriving in the culture tests.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,348-351,Closed,Article,"Zepeda, Victor J.; Cautivo, Dina; Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Salazar, Camila N.; Velásquez, Antonio; Pinilla, Carlos; Demergasso, Cecilia","Zepeda, Victor J.

Bioleaching solutions during SX treatment are exposed to important concentrations of organic extractants, a step that has a detrimental impact on microbial activity. The following work studies and determines the effect of this exposure on the re-establishment of growth and activity of different bioleaching microorganisms after contact and phase separation. Different bioleaching iron and sulfur -oxidizing microorganisms were tested. After contact with an industrially utilized organic extractant (LIX 84IC as extractant and Oxform SX12 as solvent), cultures were grown and their substrate utilization monitored. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans showed only a slight increase in doubling time without significant latency period. On the contrary, for both Sulfobacillus species studied, S. thermosulfidooxidans and S. thermotolerans, were strongly impacted showing important lag phases before growth could take place. Additionally, the SX reagent showed disruption of cell walls and protein liberation during contact with all the different strains studied.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,340-343,Closed,Article,"Davis-Belmar, Carol S.; Acosta, Mauricio; Schoen, Valerie; Rautenbach, George; Demergasso, Cecilia","Davis-Belmar, Carol S.

These challenges must be addressed in the design, operation and post-closure phases, but the design phase affords the greatest opportunity to reduce the impact of operations and increase profits. One of the most important challenges is the efficient use of water, especially in arid and semiarid regions.Approximately 40-60% of the water loss in copper concentration plants is attributed to the water retained in tailings slurries. This work presents a method of designing dewatering systems using hydrocyclones and thickeners as dewatering equipment. Mathematical models were generated to determine the maximum water recovery and the system structure for known equipment sizes and to determine the minimum cost of the equipment and the system structure for a known water recovery. Several case studies were considered and compared with an experimental study of dewatering in a copper concentrator.","AcknowledgementFinancial support from CONICYT (Fondecyt 1120794), CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.",,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,23rd European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2013,2013,,2013,32,Minerals Engineering182005,907-912,Closed,Chapter,"Cruz, Ronald; Cisternas, Luis A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Cruz, Ronald (Lappeenranta University of Technology, Finland Chem. & Mineral Process Eng.

However, relatively little is known about their activities in cold environments. Some natural ecosystems present in the Andes Mountains, such as the Chilean Altiplano, meet environmental conditions for the growth of psychrotolerant leaching microorganisms. In this work, we obtained enrichment cultures of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms from an acid river in the Chilean Altiplano. Molecular identification was performed using PCR products of bacterial 16S rRNA clone libraries, and the sequences analysis revealed the presence of a microorganism related to the recently described psychrotolerant Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans. The Acidithiobacillus strain was able to grow at temperatures ranging between 4 and 30°C, and pH values ranged between 1.7 and 2.5. According to the energy sources, this microorganism was able to grow using ferric iron, sulfur, thiosulfate and tetrathionate. Optimal growth was observed in presence of ferric ion, where the culture reached a potential redox value of 600 mV and a cellular number of 3×107 cells/mL. Molecular analysis of variants of gene encoding for rusticyanin showed that rusB gene was amplified from A. ferrivorans strain and no PCR product was obtained for the rusA gene. Our description is consistent with data previously reported for A. ferrivorans strains. Finally, results of this study highlight the importance and potential of novel native bacterial species proficient in mineral oxidation under low-temperature conditions.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,74-78,Closed,Article,"Barahona, Sergio; Dorador, Cristina; Remonsellez, Francisco","Barahona, Sergio (Universidad Católica del Norte, Laboratorio de Bioprocesos y Medio Ambiente, Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Antofagasta, Chile); Dorador, Cristina (Universidad de Antofagasta, Laboratorio de Complejidad Microbiana y Ecología Funcional , Centro de Bioinnovación, Antofagasta, Chile); Remonsellez, Francisco (Universidad Católica del Norte, Laboratorio de Bioprocesos y Medio Ambiente, Departamento de Ingeniería Química, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Barahona, Sergio (Catholic University of the North); Dorador, Cristina (University of Antofagasta); Remonsellez, Francisco (Catholic University of the North)",4,1,,0.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008507610,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

Recent molecular analyses showed that L. ferriphilum was one of the most abundant organisms in the process during year 2012. In order to study the biological dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in the process, the expression levels of thirteen genes of L. ferriphilum were analyzed by RT-qPCR. The 16S rRNA and alaS genes were used as reference, and two relative quantification methods (ΔΔct and and Pffafl) were applied to estimate the relative expression levels of metabolic genes. On the day 110 of operation, a significant increment in the expression level of one gene involved in the cycle of tricarboxilic acids (2-oxoglutarate-acceptor oxidoreductase, oorA) was detected. By other hand, the expression level of two genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (glgP, Glycogen phosphorilase, and glgA, Glycogen synthase) gradually increased, as the operation time progressed. The expression levels of genes involved in the fixation and assimilation of nitrogen increased at later stages of the process. A significant increase of the expression level of the gene annotated for Nitrogenase iron protein (nifH) was detected on the day 185 of operation. The opposite trend was observed for the gene annotated as Ammonium transporter protein (amt), as an elevated expression level was observed in earlier stages to suddenly decrease on the day 185 of operation, suggesting a change of the nitrogen source. In agreement with molecular quantitative analyses, this work confirmed that L. ferriphilum was an active member of the community during the period studied. This work gives new insights into biological dynamics of carbon and nitrogen, and suggests the potential guidelines to enhance the efficiency of biological components in industrial heap bioleaching processes.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,162-165,Closed,Article,"Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Music, Visnja; Acosta, Mauricio; Salazar, Camila N.; Quatrini, Raquel; Shmaryahu, Amir; Holmes, David S.; Velásquez, Antonio; Espoz, Cristian; Pinilla, Carlos; Demergasso, Cecilia","Galleguillos, Pedro A.

Currently, heap bioleaching is the most convenient technology to treat low grade copper sulphide ores bearing chalcopyrite, chalcocite and covellite. Covellite is a secondary copper sulphide occurring in copper sulphide deposits and it is also formed by acidic dissolution of chalcocite. In leaching processes, the main factors influencing the dissolution of covellite are the electrochemical potential (Eh) and temperature.This work aimed at assessing the effect of different concentrations of total iron (3.0 and 6.0 g/L) and temperatures (30 and 50°C) in the bioleaching of covellite contained in a low grade copper ore and the same ore after a previous process of bioleaching at ambient temperature. Initial composition of low-grade ore was chalcocite (0.58%), chalcopyrite (0.56%), covellite (0.30%) and pyrite (2.73%), while the processed ore contained chalcopyrite (0.47%), covellite (0.28%), chalcocite (0.10%) and pyrite (3.32%). Covellite was mostly dissolved (>90%) in both unprocessed and processed ore, independently of the temperature and total iron concentrations. However a higher total copper recovery was achieved in tests performed at 50°C due to higher dissolution of primary ores, especially in unprocessed ore. The microbial activity was confirmed by Most Probable Number (MPN) analyses of iron and sulfur oxidizing microorganisms. The microbial population was dominated by Acidithiobacillus spp. in tests operated at 30°C, while in tests operated at 50° Sulfobacillus spp. were the most abundant organisms.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,262-265,Closed,Article,"Zepeda, Victor J.; Cautivo, Dina; Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Soto, José; Contador, Yasna; Demergasso, Cecilia","Zepeda, Victor J.

However, the bioleaching process at Escondida is a system, which presents many challenges to modelling. The main challenges relate to heap's design and mineral characteristics, the complex interactions between biological and physicochemical parameters, and the unexpected changes in the heap's operational conditions. The heap is sampled periodically and more than 20 variables, including 16S rRNA gene copy number for 16 different microorganisms, are recorded. The data exhibit complex behaviour, including variable dynamics between strips, systematic differences between lifts of the heap, and spatial and temporal correlations. In this work, we develop a non-linear descriptive model for the microbial population trajectory along the leaching cycle and across the different strips. The parameterisation of the model considers the different dynamics between lifts, and strip specific parameters characterise the behaviour of data from individual strips. The parameterisation also allows for spatial correlation by incorporating the effect of adjacent strips on the microbial population trajectory. The model is found to provide a good fit to the data and captures its behaviour across strips. Residuals showed no systematic patterns of departure between the observed and modelled response. The R2 values ranged from 0.53 to 0.71, indicating a reasonable level of predictive power.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,233-237,Closed,Article,"Soto-Rojo, Susana; Glonek, Gary; Soto, Pamela; Demergasso, Cecilia; Solomon, Patty","Soto-Rojo, Susana (University of Adelaide, School of Mathematical Sciences, Adelaide, Australia, SA 5005); Glonek, Gary (University of Adelaide, School of Mathematical Sciences, Adelaide, Australia, SA 5005); Soto, Pamela (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Antofagasta, Chile, Avenida Angamos 0610); Demergasso, Cecilia (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Antofagasta, Chile, Avenida Angamos 0610); Solomon, Patty (University of Adelaide, School of Mathematical Sciences, Adelaide, Australia, SA 5005)",,"Soto-Rojo, Susana (University of Adelaide); Glonek, Gary (University of Adelaide); Soto, Pamela (Catholic University of the North); Demergasso, Cecilia (Catholic University of the North); Solomon, Patty (University of Adelaide)",2,0,,0.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002745692,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Recently, genetics-based approaches have been employed to characterize mineral-processing bacteria. In these approaches, data analysis is a key issue. Consequently, it is of fundamental importance to provide adequate mathematical models and statistical tools to draw reliable conclusions. The present work relates to current studies of the consortium of organisms inhabiting the bioleaching heap of the Escondida mine in Northern Chile. These studies aim to describe and understand the relationship between the dynamics of the community and the performance of the industrial process. Here, we consider a series of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments performed to quantify six different microorganisms at various stages of the bioleaching cycle. Establishing the reliability of the data obtained by real-time PCR requires the estimation of the error variance at several different levels. The results obtained show that the sampling component of the error variance is the dominant source of variability for most microorganisms. An estimate for the proportional reduction in residual standard deviation from the use of extraction and real-time PCR triplicates was found to range from 3% to 27% for the different organisms.

Despite this, long-distance dispersion into Antarctica could be particularly complex for terrestrial biota. To compare the levels of genetic diversity between Antarctic and South American populations of the Antarctic pearlwort, Colobanthus quitensis , we conducted the first estimation of genetic diversity in this species using amplified fragment length polymorphism. Four populations across the Drake Passage were selected and their genetic composition was characterized. Differences among the levels of genetic diversity were found between the populations analysed as well as between their allelic identities. However, interestingly, their spatial distribution across the Drake Passage suggests a north-to-south gradient of increasing genetic diversity.","This work was funded by the INACH T-14-08 project of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH).

Several strains of At. ferrooxidans were isolated and studied and, some time later, questions arise about whether it was a species with a wide metabolic variation or a group of closely related species. Advances in molecular biology, phylogeny and genomics have shed some light on At. ferrooxidans strains and allows their grouping according to their relations. However, significant challenges remains to be met, such as understanding how a particular strain faces environmental challenges and how a particular kind of adaptive response affects the growth and activity of the strain. The purpose of this study was to identify differential expression signals between At. ferrooxidans strains −with different abundances and dynamics− present in the bioleaching system at Escondida mine. Culture characterization and DNA macroarrays techniques provided some answers. Analysis of growth curves showed that IESL 32 had the highest anaerobic growth rate, while aerobic growth was similar for all strains. It was shown that though the phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences suggested a close relation between IESL 32 and the type strain ATCC 23270, the growth curves and the expression profile showed that the type strain and strain D2 had the closest similarity. Growth experiments under different conditions, together with the comparative analysis of gene expressions in At. ferrooxidans, could be a springboard for future investigations of strain characterization to broaden our knowledge about adaptation, metabolic strategies, regulation and microbial diversity in industrial processes.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,166-171,Closed,Article,"Araya, Gonzalo; Acosta, Mauricio; Demergasso, Cecilia","Araya, Gonzalo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Centro de Biotecnología, Antofagasta, Chile, Avda.

This discussion isolates features of the music that render it a refracted image of South African black folk music. The purpose is to trace the remoulding of such popular black music in the ZCC in order to pin down its identifiable functions. Aspects by which this kind of music belongs at least to sections of the black nation reflected overwhelmingly in the membership of the AIC (African Initiated Church) are also explored.

Copper is widely used as cofactor in proteins but high concentrations of copper are toxic. Cells require certain mechanisms to maintain the copper homeostasis and avoid toxic effects of high intracellular concentration. The molecular response of A. ferrooxidans strain D2 grown in the presence/absence of copper was examined using a A. ferrooxidans whole-genome DNA microarrays. Roughly 23% of 3,147 genes represented on the microarray were differentially expressed; about 9% of them were upregulated in the presence of copper. Among the upregulated genes, those encoding for the copper efflux protein (CusA) and for the copper-translocating P-type ATPase (CopA) were upregulated. The expression of genes encoding proteins related to iron transport was repressed. Similarly, genes related with assimilative metabolism of sulfur (L-cysteine biosynthesis) cysB, cysJ, cysI, CysD-2 and cysN were upregulated. Our results show that when A. ferrooxidans strain D2 was challenged with high copper concentrations, genes related to copper stress response were upregulated as well as others that have not been reported to be related to that mechanism. In addition, some genes related to other metabolic pathways were repressed, probably because of the energy cost of the stress response.",,,Advanced Materials Research,,,,2013-10,2013,2013-10,2013-12-20,825,,157-161,Closed,Article,"Salazar, Camila N.; Acosta, Mauricio; Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Shmaryahu, Amir; Quatrini, Raquel; Holmes, David S.; Demergasso, Cecilia","Salazar, Camila N.

Interracial tension still characterises much of the public discourse. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu's vision of a harmonious Rainbow Nation has not yet been realised. One question emerging out of this context concerns the ways in which white South Africans could or could not relate with integrity to black concerns. African Indigenous Christianity remains one aspect of the black social context which is largely unfamiliar to whites. In the interest of nation building there is a strong incentive for increased awareness regarding the lives of others across the various dividing barriers. However, due to the unequal nature of past intercultural interactions, bridging this gap is not easy.

This is in a good qualitative agreement with the inhomogeneity of the heavy‐element distribution over the Galactic disk derived by Luck et al. (2006) from Cepheids.

Design/methodology/approach – The research examines two areas of study: social identification theory and word-of-mouth communication in the virtual environment (eWOM). Based on these theories an explicative model has been proposed applying structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis to a sample of SNS users buying travel services. Partial least squares was chosen as a method to conduct an SEM analysis.   Findings – First, the results support the central role of social identification in SNS communication. Second, the results show that SNS users give greater importance to the transmission of communication than to its reception. This fact supports the idea that SNS is used more as a tool for highlighting and maintaining social status than as a channel for information.   Originality/value  – The study highlights the role of social identification as the core element which drives SNS. It then analyses the development of eWOM communication in the new context provided by SNS. In addition eWOM communication is studied from two perspectives: from the standpoint of the communicator, but also the receiver. Finally, it seems appropriate to differentiate between virtual communities discussing tourism (e.g. www.TripAdvisor.com ) and the SNS (e.g. www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com).

These environments are considered a terrestrial analogue to certain ancient Martian terrains and a source of new material for biotechnological applications as bioleaching at high ionic strength conditions and biological systems for precipitating metal sulfides. The aim of this study is to describe the occurrence of redox couples that support prokaryotic life in the system and to obtain representative cultures of predominant microorganisms/metabolisms. Mapping of the area of interest and geochemical analysis of sediments, bedrock and water samples were performed. The original microbial community and enriched cultures were studied by direct count and culturing dependent and independent techniques. In the distal part of the alluvial fans some ponds are found with acidic brines (up to pH 1) of the Cl-SO4-Na (-Mg) type that are surrounded by yellow efflorescences. Other ponds towards the basin center progressively increase in concentration due to capillary evaporation. Brines are rich in aluminium and boron with lower concentration of manganese, lithium, iron and arsenic. An advanced hydrothermal argillic alteration affecting the country rocks, native sulfur associated to active solfataras, alunite and jarosite occurrences in sediments and chloride and sulfate efflorescent salts were evidenced. The microbial community in brines and sediments (105 and 106 cells/mL, respectively) was dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and by Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, respectively. Sulphur and iron oxidation activity were detected depending on the salinity of the samples. Culture enrichments that respire and reduce As (V) and sulfate have been only obtained from sites with the highest pH (4-5). Microbial assemblages in those heterotrophic cultures were closely related to the Gamma and Betaproteobacteria, meanwhile, Rhodanobacter and Shewanella were the only microorganisms detected in the autotrophic cultures supplemented by Na2S and by H2.

The component to be separated is usually distributed at different concentrations and different particle sizes, resulting in different levels of recovery in terms of the particle size and concentration. Typically, more than one value component must be selectively removed by exploiting the differences in the components' floatability at different values of the pH, pulp potential and particle size. Several methods for the design of these circuits are available in the literature, but comparatively few articles present circuit analysis tools.In this work, global sensitivity analysis was used to analyze and design separation circuits. The effect of each stage on the general circuit was studied and the relationships between the recovery at each stage and the global recovery of the circuit were identified. The effects of uncertainties in the kinetic constants, the residence time and the number of cells were also analyzed. The Sobol' and Morris methods were applied using the software SimLab 2.2. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and the two methods are compared with local methods (which were previously published by the authors); application of the two methods to the design of mineral separation processes is also discussed.

We argue that this general decrease is most likely due to observational biases; however, similar-mass systems – like common for O-type stars – seem to vanish toward later B-types. Within the sample of F stars we observe an increasing multiplicity fraction with primary mass (∼50% – 80%); simultaneously there is a decrease of single stars toward the A-type regime. Closer inspection of spectroscopic binaries – either by spectral disentangling or by common proper motion studies – reveals higher-level systems in each mass range.",,,EAS Publications Series,,"K.

Achieving robust gender classification “in the wild,” i.e. in images acquired in real settings, is still an open problem. Face pose variations are a major source of classification errors. They are solved using sophisticated face alignment algorithms that are costly computationally. They are also prone to getting stuck in local minima thus providing a poor pose invariance. In this paper we move the alignment problem to the learning stage. The result is an efficient pose-aware classifier with no on-line alignment. Our efficient procedure gets state of the art performance even with facial poses “in the wild.” In our experiments using “The Images of Groups” database we prove that by simultaneously predicting gender and pose we get an increase of about 5% in the performance of a linear state-of-the-art gender classifier.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis,"João M.

322,pub.1055607729,10.1021/ie402099n,,,Particle Size Effect on the Efficient Use of Water and Energy in Mineral Concentration Processes,"Mining operations are major greenhouse gas producers and energy consumers. In arid and semiarid regions, mining operations are major consumers of water. For example, in the Antofagasta region of Chile, mining consumes 65% of the available water. The mineral industry is seeking ways to reduce the impacts of its mining and mineral processing operations. Members of this industry face several challenges in designing sustainable mineral operations with lower environmental and social impacts while remaining profitable. These challenges must be addressed in the design, operation, and postclosure phases of mining operations. Several of the most important challenges involve the efficient use of water and energy. Increasing the amount of grinding increases energy consumption and affects subsequent water recovery during the dewatering stages. This manuscript examines these and other effects through process simulation of a flotation plant for copper ores. On the basis of the simulation of a copper concentration process, it was determined that the particle size has a significant effect on the process economics (recovery and grade), energy consumption, and water consumption. This effect makes it possible to explore the trade-off between energy, economics, and water recovery. There are opportunities for energy- and water-efficient design and operation. Energy, water, and greenhouse gas emissions need to be accounted for and optimized.","Financial support from CONICYT (Fondecyt 1120794), CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.",,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,,,,2013-11-25,2013,2013-11-25,2013-12-11,52,49,17686-17690,Closed,Article,"Donoso, Marcela; Robles, Pedro A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Donoso, Marcela (Department of Chemical and Mineral Process Engineering, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Robles, Pedro A.

Despite this, the sites that supported these activities have rarely been a source of interest to archaeologists, and comparative analysis between mines and quarries and their features has been exceedingly rare. Mining and Quarrying in the Ancient Andes focuses on the primary extraction of a variety of materials that, in many cases, were used by cultures like the Inca, Wari and Tiwanaku in well-studied sites. The book delves into the broader mining practices that link diverse materials for a fascinating tour of the social and economic life of the prehispanic period, and of ancient technologies, some of which are still in use. Through the politics of the societies, the practical engineering issues of mineral extraction, and the symbolic nature of the locations, readers are given a broader context of mining and quarrying than is usually seen in the literature. Here, too, is a wide variety of sites, materials, and time periods, including: Technological and social aspects of obsidian procurement focusing on the Quispisisa source. Variation in Inca building stone quarry operations in Ecuador and Peru. Clay and temper mining practices in the Lake Titicaca Basin. Pigment extraction from Chile to southern Peru from the early Holocene through the Early Intermediate Period. The Huarhua rock salt mine: archaeological implications of contemporary salt extraction practices. Later pre-Hispanic (including Inca) mining with consideration of technical, ceremonial and political context. Shifts in architectural stone quarrying during state expansion at Tiwanaku Mining and Quarrying in the Ancient Andes will find an interestedaudience among archaeologists, geologists, anthropologists, historians, researchers studying Latin America, and scholars in the physical sciences with an interest in the history of mining and how mining is embedded in the wider social realm.",,,Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology,,"Nicholas Tripcevich, Kevin J.

First is that the three national campuses which made up UBLS were in academic terms in the 1970s and 1980s equal if not superior to the better known and better resourced campuses over the border in South Africa. Thus it is suggested was a product of the rich international and high-quality mix of the faculty, the diverse and politicized make-up of the student bodies and the innovative and progressive nature of the curriculum. Second is that the three campuses became in the course of the intensifying regional struggle against the apartheid regime significant sites of struggle involving both faculty and students, many of whom paid a heavy price for their involvement.

The crystal phases were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction. The Raman spectra as well as the magnetic properties were also investigated. The photoluminescence emission spectra confirm that the samples were efficiently excited by near-UV light. All spectra were dominated by a red emission band due to the electric dipole transition 5D0 →7F2. The dependence of the Raman spectra and optical and magnetic properties on the amount of Eu3+ incorporated into the phases was also investigated. The number of magnetic domains increased with the concentration of Eu3+ added.The stabilization of the tetragonal phases was also observed in Eu3+-doped samples, and their ferroelectric properties were also maintained, making these phases interesting multifunctional materials for applications in device design.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been partially financed by FONDECYT Grant under Contract No. 1110555.

An important sector affected by the new regulations is the building sector. Buildings construction and use represent the 30% of the total CO2 emissions of the world. It is one of the most important sectors to regulate. EPBD directive of the European Union is one of the actions already token in this way. Low emissions buildings construction only will be a goal if an appropriate policy will be structured world-width. Latin-American area is an important region of the world respect to growth and development. For this reason, it is very important to consider the implementation and discussion of the local energy efficiency norms. This paper reviews actual norm in Chile and discuss critically the effectiveness of the past policy. Future ways to improve the contribution of the construction sector reducing emissions are suggested, by comparison among policies of other Countries, especially the policies of Spain and Brazil. Special attention is focused on the dynamical simulation by software, which is the base of the energy label certification in many Countries. Examples of the Lider-Calener Spanish certification are presented and used to justify the possible future emissions reduction scenario for Chile.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Sustainability in Energy and Buildings,"Anne Hakansson, Mattias Höjer, Robert J.

It has a 41′ × 27′ field of view (FoV) and is equipped with B and V broad band filters and three narrow band filters at 670, 680, and 690 nm. This makes the BMT ideally suited to perform photometric reverberation mapping of the Hα emission line of active galactic nuclei, where the line is redshifted into the narrow bands, and to monitor bright stars which would be saturated with large telescopes. As a complement to our Robotic Bochum Twin Telescope (RoBoTT) with 2°.7 FoV and 14 filters, the BMT is an efficient instrument to accurately study the variability of individual sources, provided that its smaller FoV covers a sufficient number of suitable comparison stars. Here we describe the telescope and its fully robotic operation, and present science verification data demonstrating the performance of the BMT. (© 2013 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Conflicting results may be explained by the influence of the erosion threshold and daily variability of runoff on long-term erosion. However, there is a lack of data documenting these erosion factors. Here we report suspended-load measurements, derived decennial erosion rates, and 10Be-derived millennial erosion rates along an exceptional climatic gradient in the Andes of central Chile. Both erosion rates (decennial and millenial) follow the same latitudinal trend, and peak where the climate is temperate (mean runoff ∼500 mm yr−1). Both decennial and millennial erosion rates increase nonlinearly with slope toward a threshold of ∼0.55 m/m. The comparison of these erosion rates shows that the contribution of rare and strong erosive events to millennial erosion increases from 0% in the humid zone to more than 90% in the arid zone. Our data confirm the primary role of slope as erosion control even under contrasting climates and support the view that the influence of runoff variability on millennial erosion rates increases with aridity.",,,Geology,,,,2013-02-01,2013,2013-02,2013-02-01,41,2,195-198,Closed,Article,"Carretier, S.; Regard, V.; Vassallo, R.; Aguilar, G.; Martinod, J.; Riquelme, R.; Pepin, E.; Charrier, R.; Hérail, G.; Farías, M.; Guyot, J-L; Vargas, G.; Lagane, C.","Carretier, S.

The observed flux is compared to a blackbody fit of the continuum. Our search strategy reveals 20 stars with strong Hα emission (EW > 10 Å), eight of them being new detections. All Hα stars display infrared excess corroborating their youth. On the other hand, the region contains a number of infrared excess objects that do not show Hα emission. Our results support the picture that accretion – as witnessed by Hα emission – is a highly variable phenomenon. Therefore, Hα surveys can only trace the temporarily active objects. In contrast, infrared excess is a more robust tracer that reveals most of the population of young stellar objects in a star forming region. Our analysis of the general stellar content of the region yields a reliable distance of 450 pc for the Circinus cloud. Moreover, we find a ratio of total‐to‐selective extinction of R  V  = 2.8 suggesting that smaller‐than‐normal dust grains may be present. (© 2013 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This process has been shown in taxa from roughly half the red algal orders and in the Codium species, a green alga. Field observations indicate that common and dominant kelps along central Chile exhibit a fused holdfast. We evaluated whether such fusions are true coalescence processes in Lessonia spicata and Lessonia berteroana. To this end, we characterized the ultrastructural event involved in holdfast fusion in the laboratory. Additionally, coalescence in natural populations was quantified by measuring the frequency of individuals with genetically heterogenic stipes within the same holdfast. Results indicate that coalescence appears as a frequent process in laboratory, mostly restricted to intraspecific fusions. During fusion, the meristodermatic cells located in the contact area modify their morphology and reduce the number of plastids, mitochondria, and cell inclusions. The cell wall becomes much thinner and develops plasmodesmata, enhancing communication with equivalent cells of the other coalescencing individual. Stipe genotyping indicates that there is a widespread occurrence of chimerism in both species and genetic heterogeneity is increasing directly with the increasing number of stipes. The combination of results suggests that kelp frequently coalesce in the field, and the histological response observed approaches that of red algae. Since kelps are part of the dominant vegetation in low intertidal and shallow subtidal beds, the adaptive values of coalescence in these species should be evaluated. It is concluded that coalescence and chimerism are evolutionary convergent processes, occurring in all three major groups of seaweeds.",The authors appreciate the laboratory help by G. Peralta and F.

This was done through a broader analysis of official reports and reports derived from empirical studies on this theme. The results from both the broader analysis and selected case studies show that there is still racial inequality in the staff profile at South African universities. Whites dominate in senior positions while Africans dominate in Historically Black Universities (HBUs). This leads to the conclusion that the Historically White Universities (HWUs)/HBUs dichotomy continues to paint the higher education sector in South Africa in a bad light.

We analyzed two isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) by HPLC in three local ecotypes of quinoa seeds from three different geographical and genetic regions in Chile: (a) Extreme North, with prevailing conditions of high temperature and dryness (local ecotype R49); (b) Center, with milder climate (local ecotype UdeC9); and (c) South, with cold, humid environment (local ecotype BO78). Genetic-driven differences among cultivars were tested by homogenizing the culture conditions of the three seed sources. In addition, seven commercial samples of quinoa purchased at local food markets were analyzed and compared to our experimental harvested seeds. In all samples daidzein content was higher than genistein (P<0.05). The northern ecotype R49 exhibited higher content of isoflavones compared with the other two (UdeC9 and BO78), all grown under the same experimental conditions. Daidzein ranged from 1.15 (R49) to 0.70 (BO78) mg/100g, while genistein varied from 0.25 (R49) to 0.05 (UdeC9) mg/100g. Ecotype R49 had 1.6 and 1.7 fold higher daidzein contents than UdeC9 and BO78, respectively (P<0.05). In the commercial samples, the daidzein/genistein ratio ranged from 25.2 to 3.9, daidzein ranged from 2.05 to 0.78mg/100g, and genistein ranged from 0.41 to 0.04mg/100g. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the contents of daidzein and genistein in quinoa seeds. The study demonstrates that, besides its well-recognized nutritional value, quinoa possesses an excellent potential as a source of these health-promoting bioactive compounds.","AcknowledgementsFinancial aid was provided by INNOVA CORFO 04CR9PAD04, FONDECYT 1060281, and CIDAF, Universidad de Valparaíso.",,Industrial Crops and Products,,,,2013-08,2013,,2013-08,49,,117-121,Closed,Article,"Lutz, Mariane; Martínez, Angelica; Martínez, Enrique A.","Lutz, Mariane (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo de Alimentos Funcionales CIDAF, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile); Martínez, Angelica (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo de Alimentos Funcionales CIDAF, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile); Martínez, Enrique A.

The conflicting views around African time is whether it is two-dimensional (past and present) or a three-dimensional phenomenon (past, present and future). It is therefore the objective of this study to reflect on African time with a view to illuminate it in its proper perspective. The basic contention that the Basotho time retrogresses from the present to the past distinguishes itself from the argument that the Basotho also involves a future-dimension. The article also reflects the Basotho time as reflective of the life-view and the socio-cultural situation of the Basotho communities. The basic Basotho temporal categories are operationalized to establish the relevance of time to one of the written Sesotho drama texts, namely Khaketla’s Moshoeshoe le Baruti (Moshesh and the Missionaries). This initiative is based on the understanding that drama reflects on reality and perhaps it would best reflect on the philosophy of the Basotho as Africans. Based on the fact that time is a structural element of a literary text, discussions around this research study are based within a structuralist theoretical framework.

Frequent incidence of coalescent holdfasts was detected in natural populations, and this process gives rise to fused sporophytes. This study presents the coalescence events in natural populations in northern Chile. During 2011, in natural intertidal populations, 435 target sporophytes of different sizes were observed weekly and 63.90 % (278) showed physical signs of coalescent disks. We were able to distinguish five fusion modes depending on the number and size of each of the participant sporophytes and their spatial distribution. There was a progressive decrease of density and an increase in the number of stipes of each sporophyte over time. Two processes were recognized: active fusion of juvenile sporophytes and passive fusion of adult and senescent sporophytes. However, most of the coalescence processes were detected in juvenile sporophytes with a holdfast diameter of 0.5 to 2 cm. The minimum distance between pairs of coalescing sporophytes was 0.5 cm, and the maximum distance was 13 cm. For good harvesting practices, it is recommended that plants with over 20 cm holdfast diameter are harvested from natural populations because over this size, all of the plants have reproduced. Coalescence events would produce plants with legal size requirement; however, these plant units would not be reproductive, affecting the sustainability of this important coastal resource.","The authors appreciate the field support of N.

By invoking the phrase, scientists, policy analysts, journalists and others draw attention to the collision of global warming and global investment in the Arctic today and project a variety of futures for the region and the planet. While changes are apparent, the trope of a “New North” is not new. Discourses that appraised unfamiliar situations at the top of the world have recurred throughout the twentieth century. They have also accompanied attempts to cajole, conquer, civilize, consume, conserve and capitalize upon the far north. This article examines these politics of the “New North” by critically reading “New North” texts from the North American Arctic between 1910 and 2010. In each case, appeals to novelty drew from evaluations of the historical record and assessments of the Arctic’s shifting position in global affairs. “New North” authors pinpointed the ways science, state power, capital and technology transformed northern landscapes at different moments in time. They also licensed political and corporate influence in the region by delimiting the colonial legacies already apparent there. Given these tendencies, scholars need to approach the most recent iteration of the “New North” carefully without concealing or repeating the most troubling aspects of the Arctic’s past.","The author thanks Klaus Dodds, Anna Zeide, and an anonymous reviewer for providing excellent feedback on an initial draft of this essay.

The authors claim that contemporary rituals can only be properly understood when cognisance has been taken of their deep roots into the past. The authors indicate how water and rain rituals show signs of continuity between past and present, in spite of the dramatic upheavals created by the arrival of colonialism and missionary Christianity. The authors furthermore argue that such rituals are not only of ‘religious’ importance, but also indicative of the material concerns concerning the environment in the communal consciousness of ordinary people. The popular interest in these types of rituals may indeed be understood as the refusal by ordinary people to submit to a dominant globalisation paradigm which has a vested interest in casting them in the role of permanently helpless victims.",,,Exchange,,,,2013-01-01,2013,2013-01-01,,42,2,143-156,Closed,Article,"Müller, Retief; Kruger, Frans","Müller, Retief (Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa, retiefmuller@sun.ac.za); Kruger, Frans (University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, krugerf@ukzn.ac.za)",,"Müller, Retief (Stellenbosch University); Kruger, Frans (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",6,2,,7.63,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003006258,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies",

In order to evaluate economically the wild kelp populations in northern Chile (26° to 32° S) more than simply their commercial value as a source of raw materials for alginate extraction, we used several economic indicators to holistically assess the value of a group of brown seaweeds of economic importance, Lessonia spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera: (1) market value of biomass as a source of raw material for extraction of alginic acid, (2) market value of associated species of economic importance, (3) value as a source of scientific information, (4) value as a climate buffer (CO2 capture and release of O2), (5) value of associated biodiversity (non-commercial species), (6) value as cultural heritage and (7) value as a reservoir of biodiversity. Existence values of kelp beds which estimate the willingness of citizens to pay and work without payment to preserve the ecosystem were calculated using the contingent valuation technique. The results indicate that kelp beds in northern Chile have a total value of US $540 million. Of this total, kelp fishery accounts for 75 % and associated-species fisheries account for 15 %. In this context, the economic value of Chilean kelp beds is mainly associated with the industry of alginate extraction. By contrast, existence value as a source of scientific information or environmental buffer for CO2 capture or O2 production represents only 9 % of the total value, representing a very low relative importance to society. The economic valuation of coastal resources and marine ecosystems is a complementary tool for decision making and implementation of public policies related to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of renewable resources and their ecosystems.","We thank Fondo de Investigación Pesquera FIP-Chile for supporting the project FIP 2005-32 to JAV.

Proxy data and dates from palynological, limnological, geomorphological archives were compared with data recovered from the archaeological sites in high altitude basins, intermediate ravines and piemontane paleowetlands. Due to exceptionally favorable conditions, numerous Early Holocene archaeological sites were found. In contrast, the lack of occupations in previously populated areas suggests a decline in human activity during the arid mid-Holocene. In this context, two key concepts are introduced: ecorefuge or ecological refuge, and archaeological silence (silencio arqueológico). The first refers to the particular favorable locations occupied by human groups during the mid-Holocene. The second provides a better understanding about the impact of the arid interval during this period on human adaptations in the most barren territories of the New World.","AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the organizers of the Taller de Arqueología del NOA: Poblaciones humanas y ambientes durante el Holoceno Medio for the invitation to present the results of our research, supported by Project Fondecyt 1930022, Fondecyt 1020316 and Project NGS-5836-96.",,Quaternary International,,,,2013-09,2013,,2013-09,307,,5-13,Closed,Article,"Núñez, Lautaro; Cartajena, Isabel; Grosjean, Martin","Núñez, Lautaro (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, Le Paige 380, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Cartajena, Isabel (Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Grosjean, Martin (Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Berne, Switzerland)","Núñez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North)","Núñez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North); Cartajena, Isabel (University of Chile); Grosjean, Martin (Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research)",42,5,,6.14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028530744,"37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",

Reducing or eliminating beach litter requires a sound understanding of the beach users that often produce the litter. Education has consistently been promulgated as positively influencing environmental behaviors, though this is not well-investigated for the beach environment. In this citizen science project, school children surveyed the population in their various coastal communities in Chile, garnering over 900 responses nationwide. The survey included several domains concerning the problem of beach litter: demographic profiles of beach users (including education level), their littering behavior, and their disposition and preference towards solutions. Nearly half of the participants admitted to having littered in some way while the majority of those with college or graduate school education said they never litter, significantly more than lower education groups. A vast majority of the population endorsed a fine for beach littering. Community-level environmental education (for the entire population, including litterers) was the most common solution proposed by beach users, but was significantly less popular the more often the participant self-reported littering. Based on these results it is suggested that beach managers create multifaceted and localized solutions that involve several strategies (environmental education, fines, more trash cans) and also take into account the demographic profile of the beach users (including their education level), which could influence their littering behavior and support of potential solutions.","AcknowledgementsSpecial thanks go to Professor Michelle McCauley (Middlebury College, USA) and Raúl Quintanilla (UCN, Chile), who provided extremely helpful comments and suggestions for the analysis of the survey results.

To obtain a better description of the iron microbial activity and the dissolution rate of sulfide ores occurring in the leaching cycle, iterative process based on “Knowledge Discovery in Databases” (KDD) was used. A data mining technique, called “hierarchical clustering”, was employed with mineralogical characteristics of the ores loaded in the heap as input. Three different groups of strips were distinguished by this model. Chalcocite and chalcopyrite contents were the most relevant parameters selected by “decision tree” technique. The results showed that there was a good coincidence between the three groups defined and the metallurgical performance in terms of copper recovery.Moreover, another decision tree analysis was performed including the three mineralogical groups, the gathered data about physicochemical parameters and the microbial community composition and function from the PLS. The PLS temperature and the MPN were the most relevant factors selected to explain the differences between the operation of the defined groups of strips. The group with the lowest chalcocite and highest chalcopyrite content, reached the highest PLS temperature and the highest MPN of ferrous iron oxidizing microorganisms and also the fastest kinetics of copper recovery.The estimated temperature inside the heap following conservatively the available models for heaps loaded with agglomerated material, together with the sustainable occurrence of a moderate thermophile population and the confirmation of some chalcopyrite dissolution by analysis of tail allowed us to account the chalcopyrite as a microbial substrate in that industrial scale operation.Those results confirmed the relationship between the microbial community function and the copper release and the hypothesis that the substrate availability is an important parameter to describe the microbial activity. Nevertheless, the model is not yet able to explain the low bacterial growth in the group with the highest chalcocite content that is considered a good microbial substrate. Then it is needed to perform another cycle of the KDD process to complete the model. This kind of information should be considered in defining models to describe and to predict copper recovery in ROM industrial bioleaching processes.",AcknowledgmentThis work was partly supported by the InnovaChile Project 08CM01-03 and CICITEM.

The Density Functional Theory (DFT) method and Pople’s basis set have been used to study its structure and vibrational properties. These calculations have given us a precise understanding of the normal modes of vibration, taking into account the neutral and zwitterionic forms of the compound. The harmonic vibrational wavenumbers for the optimized geometries of both structures were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G*and B3LYP/6-311G** levels for an isolated molecule. For a complete assignment of the vibrational spectra, DFT calculations were combined with Pulay´s Scaled Quantum Mechanics Force Field (SQMFF) methodology to fit the theoretical and experimental wavenumber values. In this context, an assignment of the observed spectral features is proposed. Four intense bands in the infrared spectrum at 3332, 1734, 1654 and 1534cm−1 and three bands in the Raman spectrum at 3332, 2928 and 985cm−1 are reported to characterize both forms of the compound.

Traumatic events were assessed using the Stressful Life Events Scaling Questionnaire, and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety were measured using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale–Self Report Version, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory, respectively. The sample consisted of females ( n = 857) and males ( n = 480). Approximately 90% of the sample reported at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and male and female students reported similar levels of exposure to traumatic events. With regard to symptoms of post-traumatic stress, those students who had experienced a traumatic event reported more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms than those students who had not. Significant correlations were found among symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. The significant predictors of the severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms were gender, Black race, Coloured race, and year of study. The significant predictors of the frequency of traumatic events were gender, age, Black race, Coloured race, and private residence.

A total of 180 159 ESTs were yielded from a M. donacium cDNA library. De novo assembly was performed using stringent calling parameters, producing 10 178 contigs and 41 765 singletons. Here, a total of 2594 SNPs were discovered related to 613 consensus sequences, achieving a frequency of 1 SNPs per 260 bp. SNP variants showed that A/G, A/T and C/T were the most abundant among the identified polymorphisms. We validated a total of 12 SNPs loci by HRMA for annotated genes such as heat shock protein‐70 and the translation elongation factor 1‐alpha. The Gene Ontology analysis regarding molecular function level revealed that sequences with SNPs were mainly classified to protein and nucleotide binding, as well hydrolase activity, ion binding and oxidoreductase activity. Further, biological processes like cellular and metabolic process, biogenesis, localization and biological regulation were highly annotated. The most expressed genes were related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, senescence‐associated protein, ubiquitin and actin. Interestingly, some relevant genes related to immune response and biomineralization showed a high abundance, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐alpha‐receptor‐like protein, serine protease inhibitor, heat shock protein, aragonite‐binding protein and ferritin.

The University of Limpopo, a historically disadvantaged University has established a Disability Students’ Unit (DSU) in order to alleviate the problems of students with visual impairments on campus and recently appointed an Orientation and Mobility (O&M) instuctor to provide assistance and skills to these students. Various modern disability facilities were installed into infrastructure to enable disabled students access to them. These strategic initiatives and interventions are now yielding remarkable results and having significant impacts on teaching and learning. To this end, over the years, the number of students with disabilities registered by the University has increased tremendously and majority of disabled students are now completing their degrees in record time. A major contributory factor for this success has been the appointment of a skilled instructor to oversee the students with visual impairments. Ii is against this backdrop that this paper examines the significant role being played by the instructor in facilitating teaching and learning and the continuous mentoring of visually impaired students prior to admission and throughout their years of studies. The paper highlights various teething problems being faced daily by both students and the instructor and details various strategies that have been implemented to solve the problems. Numerous innovations introduced by the instructor to enhance teaching and learning at the University and the assistance received from the University management are also enumerated. Despite some occasional problems, significant successes have been recorded over the years.

The effect of the type of reactant on the relative amount of Sr incorporated in BST compound was also analysed. The synthesised BST nanoparticles showed differences in their structural and chemical characteristics, which were attributed to the presence of Cl− or OH− anions during the synthesis of the compound. The structure, morphology and oxidation state of the samples were studied by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. In addition, theoretical calculations using cluster models were carried out to understand the possible phases formed of BST, the effect of the Sr incorporation and the possible presence of oxygen vacancies inside the BST structure.","AcknowledgementsThis work has been partially financed by: FONDECYT Grant under contract no 1110555.Basal Financing Program CONICYT, FB0807 (CEDENNA).

The methodology uses a superstructure that considers the many different available elements of the flotation circuits and compares the results. The circuits were evaluated using radial/spider graphs, and were evaluated based on the metric indices of efficiency, capacity, quality, economics and environmental impact.The simulations were performed for a superstructure that considered 27 flotation circuits for an Australian sulphide ore containing chalcopyrite, tennantite, quartz and pyrite. The starting circuit corresponded to the flotation circuit described in previous work on this ore (Haque et al., 2010; Bruckard et al., 2010), and was used as the basis for comparison of the alternative flotation circuits.The key result of the analysis is that the base condition is one of the best circuits with respect to the copper grade in the concentrates, CO2 emission, and fresh water usage. However, the base condition is one of the most inefficient circuits with respect to the percentage of arsenic in the products, profit, and copper recovery. This study shows that there are more suitable flotation circuits available than the stated base condition for a specific goal and/or multiple goals.","AcknowledgementsMr. Montenegro thanks Mr. W.

In most cases, the safety crisis threatened the farmers and their labour force. In order to contain the situation, the commandos played a significant role of providing security to both the farmers and the farm workers. Although the commandos provided this security, in the main the structure was regarded as the National Party’s (NPs) initiative. To the new African National Congress (ANC) as the ruling party after the April 1994 general elections where it got the majority votes, the organisation wanted to replace the commando units with another security force in the rural areas. However, this initiative was not welcomed by the farming communities who were mostly White. They viewed the disbandment and the replacement of the commandos as an attempt by the ANC’s government to make them vulnerable for physical attacks, which in most cases led to deaths. Therefore, this study attempts to highlight the socio-political impact of this initiative to both the farmers and farming communities. The question of whether the commandos were to be retained or not in favour of rural safety had a huge socio-political impact and divided the South African rural communities.",,,Studies of Tribes and Tribals,,,,2013-07,2013,2017-10-03,2013-07,11,1,25-33,Closed,Article,"Twala, Chitja; Oelofse, Marietjie","Twala, Chitja (Faculty of the Humanities, Department of History, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein.

This was introduced in two didactics topics included in the first year geometry course. This experiment was aimed at assisting teachers who found that English as Language of Learning and Teaching (LoLT) contributed to the difficulties they experienced with these topics. Users were shown the new interpreting technique where the headphone is placed into only one ear, leaving the other earpiece unused, so they could hear both source and target languages simultaneously. In 2010 and 2011, the interpreting was extended to include mathematical transformation and Euclidean geometry. The aim was to investigate how teachers as end-users would experience simultaneous interpreting into an indigenous language in a teaching and learning situation.

These practices focus on the selective harvest of sporophytes to allow the maintenance of a reproductive stock, facilitating recruitment and minimizing grazing of benthic herbivores. To improve coverage and accessibility, enforcement of administration measures along the northern coast of Chile requires ecological indicators to monitor the sustainability of Lessonia kelps. Over 2 years, density, biomass, recruitment, and size structure of Lessonia were sampled seasonally in coastal areas with different regimens of harvesting administration as follows: (1) Management Areas for Exploitation of Benthic Resources (MAEBR), (2) Open Access Areas (OAA), and (3) Marine Protected Areas without human intervention. The use of demographic parameters as ecological indicators allows discrimination between kelp beds where good harvesting practices have been applied by users (MAEBR), and areas where management recommendations have not been put in practice (OAA). The ecological indicators reinforced the concept of co-management in MAEBR as a viable harvesting administration system along the Chilean coast, and indicated a high-harvesting pressure in OAA. Moreover, together with other harvesting parameters, they could be useful to justify the application of other administration strategies, such as quotas or bans.","JMAV would like to thank the Universidad Católica del Norte and the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT) for scholarship to attend Ph.D. Program in Applied Biology and Ecology Universidad Católica del Norte (Coquimbo, Chile).

The site currently lies 650 m offshore and 13 m underwater, covers an area of ∼64 m2 and contains several discrete exposed and shallow-buried bone deposits. Through underwater archaeology survey and test excavations, a significant amount of animal bone assigned to the Late Pleistocene was successfully recovered and analyzed. After recovery and prior to the analyses, the bones were subjected to conservation and stabilization treatments, resulting in good preservation of the material. Taxonomic analyses (NISP 224) revealed high taxonomic diversity of extinct fauna (Camelidae, Cervidae, Artiodactyla, Equidae, Mylodontidae, Canidae, Rodentia and Xenarthra). The sample represents a continental faunal assemblage belonging to a drowned terrestrial context, probably related to an estuarine-lagoon environment. Taphonomic analysis allowed macroscopic identification of natural marks (punctures) associated with large and small size carnivores. The bones also show abrasion related to the action of marine sands along with colour alterations. By applying Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs and Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) to fossil bones, marks and colour alterations were identified. Marks indicated rodent gnawing and trampling, while colour alterations were attributed to diagenesis processes, discarding thermal treatment. Site GNLQ1 is identified as having very high potential, for it provides the first evidence for a submerged palaeolandscape viable for human occupation and movement along the Pacific Coast of South America during the Late Pleistocene.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank Fabiana Martin, Luis Borrero and Francisco Prevosti, organizers of the Symposium of Multidisciplinary Research on the Late Quaternary of South America: Humans, Animals, and Paleoenvironments, for inviting us to participate.

It is in this location that a new technique for the vegetative propagation of C. chamissoi by secondary attachment disc (SAD) was evaluated for the first time. In order to achieve this, SAD development was seasonally analyzed on natural and artificial substrata submitted to different water exchange and nutrient enrichment conditions. Cystocarpic and vegetative thalli were able to reattach and develop SADs during winter and summer under all tested conditions. However, higher values were observed in vegetative thalli cultivated in the winter. The size of shoots formed from SADs was higher in summer than in winter, varying in length between 0.2 and 5.4mm after 40days of cultivation. A continuous seawater exchange was the appropriate condition for SAD development whereas nutrient enrichment was not necessary. High adaptability of these structures to outdoor conditions was observed, as expressed in high survival rates of SADs. This study shows the technical feasibility of culturing C. chamissoi by means of SADs, which could be an alternative to spore and macrofragmentation strategies.",AcknowledgmentsWe gratefully appreciate the efforts of the staff of marine botany laboratory of Universidad Católica del Norte.

Since then, a new point of view has emerged questioning this relationship and instead argues about the existence of a positive relationship between these two variables. This paper studies the impact of the heterogeneity in market power on this relationship through the case of the Chilean banking sector.

In this zone, the water availability is scarce, being a critical issue for the mining industries and whereby the use of other leaching agents as seawater may be a viable alternative. For this reason in the present study, column-leaching experiments using seawater were performed, including different irrigation rates and column heights. It is found that the highly soluble minerals such as nitrate and iodate are rapidly leached, while for other minerals like sulphate and chloride, the outlet concentration increased once that part of the sodium has been removed. Crystals of sodium sulphate were found at the column bottom, when this was dismantled. An existing phenomenological model (Gálvez et al., 2012) was used to analyse the changes of concentration of nitrate and iodine (as iodate) with a good agreement between the experiments and the simulations. On the other hand, for sulphate and chloride a new model was developed, which takes into account the dissolution and precipitation phenomena of these ions. The model was able to capture the trends observed in the experiments for the outlet concentrations of the modelled ions.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank CONICYT for supporting through the project MEL 81105010, J.I.O. thanks CONICYT for the PhD scholarship.",,Hydrometallurgy,,,,2013-07,2013,,2013-07,139,,79-87,Closed,Article,"Ordóñez, Javier I.; Moreno, Luis; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Ordóñez, Javier I.

G. marmoratus larvae were more abundant than S. sanguineus larvae during the study period. For both species, the sagittae deposited micro-increments during embryonic development (before hatching) and a hatch mark was observable in all examined otoliths. The sagittae otoliths of G. marmoratus grew in radius, perimeter and area faster than did the otoliths of S. sanguineus. Both species showed significant (P < 0.05) differences in larval growth and lunar periodicity of the hatching events. G. marmoratus hatched at smaller sizes (2.6 mm) mainly during the first-quarter moon and the larvae grew at rates of 0.24 ± 0.01 mm day–1. S. sanguineus hatched as larger larvae (>3 mm) during the first-quarter and full moons and grew at slower rates (0.14 ± 0.01 mm day–1) during the initial 25 days. The high abundance of larval clingfish in near-shore waters, temporal decoupling among the hatching events, and the different growth rates may be tactics to increase self-recruitment in coastal waters.","The authors want to thank Nicolás Suárez-Donoso, Cristian Cortez, Pablo Veas and Dr Randy Finke for their help in the sampling on board the RV Ilán.

A field study was conducted, hypothesizing that the digging activity of these predators disturbs the habitat thereby leading to a reduction in individual abundance, biomass and species richness; these changes result in a modified structure of macrobenthic communities. A directed sampling (crab pits vs. reference areas) showed significant reductions in total abundances in pits compared to reference areas, but no differences were observed in taxonomic richness or benthic biomass. Short-term cage experiment showed significant decreases in total abundance and biomass of macroinvertebrates in predator inclusion treatments compared to exclusions and controls. In consequence, our results confirmed that burrowing activities and the generation of small disturbed sediment patches influence the community structure. These results highlight the importance of large cancrid crabs in soft-bottom habitats, where their modification of the physical configuration of the sediment affects community structure over small spatial scales. Crabs are thus an important source of spatial heterogeneity of the sea-floor landscape. This ecological role must be considered in management strategies of the extensive artisanal fishery for these crabs, as current evidence is showing increasing populations of intermediate predators (like cancrid crabs) in many benthic habitats in response to the depletion of top predators.",AcknowledgmentsWe thank E.

Therefore it’s important to assess the viability of QZ Nor, V340 Nor, and GU Nor as calibrators for Leavitt’s law via their purported membership in the open cluster NGC 6067. The following suite of evidence confirms that QZ Nor and V340 Nor are members of NGC 6067, whereas GU Nor likely lies in the foreground: (i) existing radial velocities for QZ Nor and V340 Nor agree with that established for the cluster ($$-39.4\pm0.2(\sigma_{\bar {x}}) \pm1.2 (\sigma)~\mbox{km/s}$$) to within 1 km/s, whereas GU Nor exhibits a markedly smaller value; (ii) a steep velocity-distance gradient characterizes the sight-line toward NGC 6067, thus implying that objects sharing common velocities are nearly equidistant; (iii) a radial profile constructed for NGC 6067 indicates that QZ Nor is within the cluster bounds, despite being 20′ from the cluster center; (iv) new BVJH photometry for NGC 6067 confirms the cluster lies d=1.75±0.10 kpc distant, a result that matches Wesenheit distances computed for QZ Nor/V340 Nor using the Benedict et al.

Accordingly, the main assignment of the academic profession was teaching. As the South African university sector became part of the international academic world, the requirement to conduct research came to the fore since the middle 1980s, more so after South Africa reintegrated with the international academic world after the repeal of the international academic boycott which had been waged against the country from c. 1960 to c. 1990. At the same time, the democratization of universities, and the allocation of more power to students, as well as the new conceptualization of students as clients in a consumer-driven economy, changed the nature of the teaching assignment of the academic profession. This was not the only factor which made teaching at universities all the more demanding. New pedagogies and new technology and the rise in the number of distance education students contributed to this trend too, as did the rising managerialism and the influx of students poorly prepared for university study.

239,pub.1025959334,10.1016/j.epsl.2013.04.005,,,Active erosion–deposition cycles in the hyperarid Atacama Desert of Northern Chile,"There is significant debate over the rates and types of fluvial activity at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary in the hyperarid Atacama Desert of Chile. To quantify fluvial processes and help resolve this debate, we measure terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) (10Be and 21Ne) concentration depth profiles in three settings representing a chronosequence: (1) a late Pliocene alluvial fan representative of major regional deposits, (2) a modern, active channel and (3) an adjacent low terrace inset into the Pliocene alluvium. Late Pliocene deposits that are widely preserved in the region contain TCN profiles consistent with relatively rapid stripping of upland sediment at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. Deposits inset into these Late Pliocene features record cut and fill cycles that rework sediment throughout the Quaternary. The TCN profile in the modern channel is best explained by sediment aggradation at 2.1mMyr−1 during the last 250,000yr. Similarly, the adjacent low terrace sediments contain TCN concentration profiles consistent with aggradation of 2.0mMyr−1 over a period of 250,000–750,000yr prior to the last 250,000yr of stability. In summary, depth profiles of two TCNs provide constraints on the rates of sediment deposition, sources of sediment and transport history, as well as the subsequent exposure conditions of the sediment following deposition. Our results are consistent with early Quaternary initiation of hyperaridity for the region. During the Quaternary, winter precipitation events experienced at our sites' latitude (24°S) drive active erosion–deposition cycles. The northward migration of the subtropical front during Quaternary glacial cycles may have enhanced precipitation at 24°S, leading to more active fluvial processes during cooler periods.",This work was supported by an American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund grant to AMH and NSF grants 0447441 and 0345936 to RA.

238,pub.1092994317,10.1080/00043389.2013.11877187,,,Actions speak louder than words in ‘The Alice Sequence’: A series of exhibitions by Wilma Cruise,"The artist Wilma Cruise's exploration of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (1865) as an iconic and thematic motif for her recent series of exhibitions, collectively titled ‘The Alice Sequence’ (2011–2012), presents a theoretically rich exploration of the human/ animal dialectic. This article explores key notions of inter-species communication and distinction that arise from Cruise's artistic exploration, also the practice-led component of her doctoral study. I argue that Cruise's interest in this fanciful text stems from the proliferation of distinctive animal characters in Carroll's oeuvre; in particular the credible ‘force’ of the creatures of Wonderland who, in their fictional veracity, resist (to some extent) a descent into becoming solely allegorical conduits. Carroll's fantastical realm, where humans and animals converse with each other, is fertile ground for an artistic and theoretical contemplation of human and animal cognisant difference (a concept at the core of anthropological distinction). In pursuing this direction I explicate Cruise's extension of Carroll's fictional trope into the Freudian and Lacanian terrain of the preconscious and pre-linguistic modality (Cruise 2012: 17–20), which Cruise links to the phenomenon of horse-training methodologies that foreground bodily modes of communication between horses and their human trainers (Cruise 2012: 18). The ‘bodily register’ of écriture féminine is also connected to this theoretical grouping as a repurposed framework for revising notions of human logo-centric supremacy over animal beings. Further theoretical formulations that disregard preconceived conceptions of human and animal capacity, such as Actor Network Theory, are discussed in relation to this premise. Selected artworks from Cruise's ‘The Alice Sequence’ are analysed in relation to these theoretical paradigms, with the conclusion that Cruise's disarticulated use of text and image enacts the estrangement of logo-centric reason from physical interspecies ontology. This artistic dislodgement of certainty in the prerogative of language to enforce human superiority over non-human beings, places emphasis on the bodily presence of Cruise's sculptural animal figures, in an artistic echo of pre-linguistic modes of communication.",,,De Arte,,,,2013-01,2013,2017-05-24,2013-01,48,88,7-20,Closed,Article,"Tully, Ann-Marie","Tully, Ann-Marie (She is also a Research Associate at the, Research Centre, Visual Identities in Art and Design, Faculty of Art Design and Architecture, University of Johannesburg, .)",,"Tully, Ann-Marie (University of Johannesburg)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092994317,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3604 Performing Arts,

In Chile a TURFs system called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (Áreas de Manejo y Explotación de Recursos Bentónicos-AMERB) were developed as a solution for the fishery crisis of Concholepas concholepas, a hard bottom snail. The success of these AMERBs led to its widespread application across different fisheries resources and social-ecological contexts, among them the surf clam Mesodesma donacium which has a highly variable population. Traditionally, fishermen followed the sporadically appearing M. donacium beds, migrating along the coast, a behavior now suppressed under the AMERB regime. We examined the dynamics of the M. donacium fishery, evaluating the performance of the AMERB system for its sustainable exploitation. Fishermen extracted surf clams based on monthly quotas, which were conservative. Despite this, after three years the fishery of M. donacium within the AMERB collapsed because of lack of recruitment and high natural mortality. The resulting low abundances made the fishery unattractive, causing the abandonment of the AMERB. This suggests that implementation of an AMERB system must integrate knowledge of the spatial scales over which different clam beds (subpopulations) are connected. While still ignoring the structure of the metapopulation, as occurs at present for M. donacium stocks in Chile, it could be evaluated to increase capture during the periods of boom, taking advantage of surf clams that will disappear in any case due to natural mortality. A spatial reserve within each clam bed could also be established in order to conserve the unknown but potentially important role of the subpopulation for the metapopulation.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Martin Thiel for their valuable comments.

A mixed methodology was used, with interviews, conversation groups, and surveys of groups of men and women born in Colombia who have settled in Chile. It was sought to describe their experiences in two contexts: the first, from outside in, as a context of emigration from Colombia, and the second, the current context of immigration in Chile. The principal findings include a description of what the displacement means for the women based on their motivations to migrate and the relevant experiences they had in accessing Chilean territory and in the normalization of their migratory status. Transversally, the authors observed whether or not their basic, social, and economic rights were prevalent and the constant impact that the contextual and ethnic systems that affect them had on the immigrant women.","We acknowledge collaboration from Mauricio Torrico, María Fernanda Sanabria, Alejandra Bordones, Karina Reyes, Leyla Mendez, Jaime Cáceres, and the team of volunteers from the Martín Baró Immigrants Service Centre, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta.","Funding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We acknowledge the support of the Project NS 100046 of the Iniciativa Científica Milenio of the Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Turismo, Chile.",Journal of Black Studies,,,,2013-02-25,2013,2013-02-25,2013-04,44,3,231-251,Closed,Article,"Segovia, Jimena Silva; Lufin, Marcelo","Segovia, Jimena Silva (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Lufin, Marcelo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Lufin, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North)","Segovia, Jimena Silva (Catholic University of the North); Lufin, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North)",7,1,,1.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053885975,44 Human Society; 4403 Demography,
238,pub.1039331669,10.1007/s13593-013-0195-0,,,Quinoa biodiversity and sustainability for food security under climate change. A review,"Climate change is rapidly degrading the conditions of crop production. For instance, increasing salinization and aridity is forecasted to increase in most parts of the world. As a consequence, new stress-tolerant species and genotypes must be identified and used for future agriculture. Stress-tolerant species exist but are actually underutilized and neglected. Many stress-tolerant species are indeed traditional crops that are only cultivated by farmers at a local scale. Those species have a high biodiversity value. Besides, the human population will probably reach nine billion within coming decades. To keep pace with population growth, food production must increase dramatically despite the limited availability of cultivable land and water. Here, we review the benefits of quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa Willd., a seed crop that has endured the harsh bioclimatic conditions of the Andes since ancient times. Although the crop is still mainly produced in Bolivia and Peru, agronomic trials and cultivation are spreading to many other countries. Quinoa maintains productivity on rather poor soils and under conditions of water shortage and high salinity. Moreover, quinoa seeds are an exceptionally nutritious food source, owing to their high protein content with all essential amino acids, lack of gluten, and high content of several minerals, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, and health-promoting compounds such as flavonoids. Quinoa has a vast genetic diversity resulting from its fragmented and localized production over the centuries in the Andean region, from Ecuador to southern Chile, and from sea level to the altiplano. Quinoa can be adapted to diverse agroecological conditions worldwide. Year 2013 has therefore been declared the International Year of Quinoa by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Here, we review the main characteristics of quinoa, its origin and genetic diversity, its exceptional tolerance to drought and salinity, its nutritional properties, the reasons why this crop can offer several ecosystem services, and the role of Andean farmers in preserving its agrobiodiversity. Finally, we propose a schematic model integrating the fundamental factors that should determine the future utilization of quinoa, in terms of food security, biodiversity conservation, and cultural identity.","The authors wish to thank the growers, communities, and stakeholders involved in quinoa cultivation.

We discuss the issues around gaining informed consent, particularly in research environments in the South, and highlight the need for accommodations. The aim is to advance a case for hybridity in educational research – that is, developing some general ethical principles that can serve as guidelines for researchers to develop contextually appropriate ethical practices that do not compromise either the research participants or the rigour of their research enterprise. Finally, some strategies are presented to address the issues raised in regard to informed consent in varied research settings.

However, the knowledge about the distribution and feeding ecology of fish larvae is scarce. Since this area is characterized by low phytoplankton biomass, we hypothesize that marine fish larvae display different foraging tactics in order to reduce diet overlap. During austral spring 2009–2010, two oceanographic cruises were carried out along southern Patagonia (50–56°S). Larval fish distribution and feeding of the two most widely distributed species were studied, the smelt Bathylagichthys parini (Bathylagidae) and black southern cod Patagonotothen tessellata (Nototheniidae). Larvae of B. parini showed a lower increase in the mouth gape at size, primarily feeding during daytime (higher feeding incidence during the day) mostly on nonmotile prey (invertebrate and copepod eggs, appendicularian fecal pellets, diatoms). They showed no increase in feeding success (number, total volume of prey per gut and prey width) with increasing larval size, and the niche breadth was independent of larval size. Larvae of P. tessellata showed a large mouth gape at size, which may partially explain the predation on motile prey like large calanoid copepods (C. simillimus) and copepodites. They are nocturnal feeders (higher feeding incidence during night) and are exclusively carnivorous, feeding on larger prey as the larvae grow. Nonetheless, niche breadth was independent of larval size. Diet overlap was important only in individuals with smaller mouth gape (<890 μm) and diminished as larvae (and correspondingly their jaw) grow. In conclusion, in the peri-Antarctic Magellan region, fish larvae of two species display different foraging tactics, reducing their trophic overlap throughout their development.","We thank the technical support in the field of María Inés Muñoz, Dr. Leonardo R.

237,pub.1017458689,10.1163/22134514-45060006,,,An African Doctrine of Equity in South African Public Law,"For the first time in the history of South African law, a typically African concept – Ubuntu – has been adopted into the common law of the land (which is a mixture of English and Roman-Dutch law). Ever since colonial conquest, the indigenous normative orders of Africa have been treated as inferior. While South Africa’s new constitutional dispensation had the effect of elevating customary law to the same status as that of the common law, the traffic of ideas between the two systems continued to favour the latter as the superior system. The reception of ubuntu into the common law reversed this process. This paper examines the function of ubuntu in its new environment. Most of the discussion about the concept has concentrated on its meaning, a question that has been concentrated on finding a suitable English translation. The most obvious have been the calques, ‘humanity’, ‘personhood’ or ‘humaneness’, but none have been especially helpful, for they cannot hope to convey the full range of functions now performed by ubuntu. It is argued in this paper that searches for a priori meanings are unhelpful: words are continually being exploited by users to serve their own particular ends. In this regard, it must be appreciated that ubuntu is a loanword, and thus especially susceptible to manipulation. The paper shows that the courts have used ubuntu to supply a peculiarly African form of equity that has been used to solve hard cases and conflicts between rules, notably in the area of public law.",,,European Journal of Comparative Law and Governance,,,,2013-01-01,2013,2013-01-01,,,,1-15,Closed,Article,"Bennett, Thomas W.","Bennett, Thomas W.

The morphological, physiological and reproductive performances of D. antarctica rafts in the Coastal System of Coquimbo, Chile (CSC, ~30°S), were examined during winter and summer of two successive years (2010/11 and 2011/12). Epibionts (Lepas spp.) that only attach to floating objects were used as indicator for the floating time of kelp rafts. Photosynthetic efficiency and reproductive maturity of both benthic and floating algae varied seasonally, with a stronger decrease in summer than in winter. Blade size (measured as weight proportion of kelp individuals), phlorotannin concentrations and antioxidant activities were lower in floating than in benthic algae. Environmental conditions and floating time affected the blade tissues, with stronger negative effects during summer. These results confirm that floating persistence of D. antarctica in the CSC is suppressed during the summer months, which indicates that the dispersal potential of this (and other) floating algae varies seasonally.","We gratefully thank David Jofre, Lorena Jorquera, Leonardo Miranda, Jose Pantoja, German Penna, Miguel Penna, Jeanette Werner and the crew of RV Stella Maris for their invaluable help and assistance in the field and laboratory procedures.

The purpose is to attempt to lay the groundwork and provide insight to both the theoretical and practical considerations behind qualitative research, especially as it is conducted in South African universities. The review adopted a purposive non-probability sample from the population of participating universities, namely, the socalled previously advantaged White universities, and the previously disadvantaged Black universities, to critically look at research challenges that the latter universities face. This review established amongst other thing that the research output of the previously advantageous White universities far surpasses and outclasses that of the previously Black university… and this gap in research output levels between the two types of institutions was remarkably unacceptable. It was on the basis of this outcomes that the review suggests and recommends the thematic model of qualitative research discourse that includes the following processes, approaches and tools: (a) selection and choice of a research paradigm/approach; (b) qualitative research design; (c) introduction of and background to the study;(d) problem formulation and statement of the problem and sub-problems; (e) formulation of the research questions; (f) identification key research aim and objectives; (g) qualitative data collection and gathering; (h) qualitative data analysis and interpretation; (I) the significance of the study; (j) the scope and/or limitations of the study; (k) discussion of the findings ; (l) recommendations; and (m) summary and conclusion of the study. It is believed that if this model can be effectively implemented, could lead to the performance of qualitative research processes, approaches, and tools in social sciences research, and further lead to the improvement of research outputs in the previously disadvantaged Black universities in the country.",,,The Journal of Social Sciences,,,,2013-06,2013,2017-10-09,2013-06,35,3,217-229,Closed,Article,"Bogopane, L P.","Bogopane, L P.

New approaches to this history have suggested that some undertook educational initiatives that broke with the dominant apartheid model. Bophutatswana's Primary Education Upgrading Programme (PEUP) was such an initiative. This article focuses on the actors, origins, aims and practices of the programme and assessments by contemporaries and its strengths and weaknesses. Using documentary evidence on the project, interviews with its initiators and participants in the programme, as well as assessments by contemporaries at the time, it argues that the project involved a contradictory alliance of conservative Bantustan leaders and Christian liberals. The project drew on progressivist, child-centred ideas borrowed from Europe and the United Kingdom but these were encased within the broader ethnic apartheid project and served a legitimatory purpose. PEUP included both innovative aspects within the context of Bantu Education but also continuities with its broader ethnic purposes. Miserly budgets, Bantustan politics, and limitations specific to progressivism ultimately undermined the success of the PEUP. Nonetheless, the project survived in memories of teachers.",,,South African Historical Journal,,,,2013-09,2013,,2013-09,65,3,403-420,Closed,Article,"Chisholm, Linda","Chisholm, Linda (HSRC, Education, Science and Skills Development, South Africa; University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa)","Chisholm, Linda (Human Sciences Research Council; University of Johannesburg)","Chisholm, Linda (Human Sciences Research Council; University of Johannesburg)",5,0,,6.35,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053346348,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",4 Quality Education
225,pub.1019956009,10.1016/j.mineng.2013.06.005,,,Exploiting the metallurgical throughput–recovery relationship to optimise resource value as part of the production scheduling process,A single process plant throughput rate to achieve a certain recovery at a certain cost is often assumed over the life of a resource project for strategic planning purposes. The process plant throughput–recovery relationship that exists for each ore type can and should be exploited for the purpose of creating additional economic value within the resource plan. This paper investigates the impact on Net Present Value (NPV) of strategic resource plans when allowing a fluctuating process plant throughput rate over the life of a base metals operation in comparison to only considering a single fixed throughput rate for a given plant size configuration. The metallurgical throughput–recovery relationship is confirmed as being an important factor in planning the extraction of the resource to feed a given process plant of fixed size since this impacts heavily upon the production schedule and therefore the NPV of the project. Mathematical programming to better aid the decision making process is investigated in comparison to traditional manual approaches to thus help determine the best throughput rate to use in each period. Results suggest that it would seem reasonable to expect an increase of around 4.0% in NPV when allowing a fluctuating process plant throughput rate over a single fixed throughput rate over the life of a midsize underground operation when using a mathematical programming approach.,,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2013-11,2013,,2013-11,53,,74-83,Closed,Article,"Yap, A.; Saconi, F.; Nehring, M.; Arteaga, F.; Pinto, P.; Asad, M.W.A.; Ozhigin, S.; Ozhigina, S.; Mozer, D.; Nagibin, A.; Pul, E.; Shvedov, D.; Ozhigin, D.; Gorokhov, D.; Karatayeva, V.","Yap, A.

This article is concerned with the discursive aspect of songs used as ZANU-PF promotional jingles on national radio and television to persuade the audience to buy into the party's thinking. Purposively sampled jingles are subjected to close textual examination from a perspective of folklorisation approached from within the framework of critical discourse analysis (CDA). The article argues that lyrics of jingles by the ZANU-PF group Mbare Chimurenga Choir (MCC) use folklorisation discourse strategies to appropriate the national heritage to ZANU-PF while alienating rival parties from that heritage. The strategies that the MCC uses to enhance folklorisation thus exploit a presumed desire to be associated with the national heritage along with the presumed fear of alienation and ridicule to establish ZANU-PF hegemony in Zimbabwe.,,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2013-03,2013,,2013-03,31,1,71-88,Closed,Article,"Manyawu, Andrew Tichaenzana","Manyawu, Andrew Tichaenzana (Midlands State University, Private Bag 9055, Gweru, Zimbabwe)","Manyawu, Andrew Tichaenzana (Midlands State University)","Manyawu, Andrew Tichaenzana (Midlands State University)",9,4,,3.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070957946,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Most studies about the region have analyzed economic and social problems derived from the existence of urban giants but have not considered in which ways urban primacy is currently affecting national growth. In this respect, Brülhart and Sbergami (2009) show, using a sample of 105 countries and controlling for 18 variables used in various convergence studies worldwide, that when a country achieves a GDP per capita level of $10,000 an increase in the level of urban concentration, negatively affects the national growth rate. Consequently, it is plausible that in some Latin American countries spatial concentration not only has become an equity problem but also a constraint for national efficiency whose reduction should be taken into account in development strategies.",,,Advances in Spatial Science,Regional Problems and Policies in Latin America,"Juan R.

The methodology considers the construction of a superstructure that includes alternatives to be analyzed, the representation of variables by distribution functions, a Monte Carlo simulation, the incorporation of indicators and a multi-objective analysis. From the obtained results, we conclude that the proposed methodology is a useful tool for analyzing and designing separation processes that include several stages, especially when there is uncertainty about the operating conditions of each stage.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank CONICYT for its support through Fondecyt Project 1090406.

However, the factors that influence host choice by symbionts, such as shrimps, are poorly understood but may have important implications for the distribution and abundance of these mesoconsumers. In Hong Kong, the rhynchocinetid shrimp Rhynchocinetes brucei uses two alternative hosts: an urchin (Diadema setosum) and an anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor). We examined the association between R. brucei and its anemone and urchin hosts in the field and laboratory, investigating host choice and host fidelity. Underwater surveys on shallow rocky reefs in Hong Kong revealed that shrimps were rarely found outside refuges, such as crevices and holes, unless they were associated with anemones and urchins. Shrimps were more frequently associated with urchins than with anemones, although anemones were more abundant within the survey area. Host-choice experiments in the laboratory confirmed that, when given a choice, shrimps avoided open areas and associated with anemones, urchins or artificial refuges. Shrimps overwhelmingly chose urchins over artificial refuges, but did not show any clear preference for anemones over refuges. When offered a choice, shrimps displayed fidelity for their original host species (i.e. the host with which they were associated when collected from the field), suggesting that they imprinted upon the host. Host-imprinting may allow symbionts to efficiently relocate their original host species after separation (e.g. following nocturnal foraging trips) thereby, perhaps, reducing the risk of predation. However, host preference by R. brucei was facultative because shrimps would associate with an unfamiliar host when their original host was unavailable. This flexibility may allow shrimps to respond to local variability in host abundance.","This study was financed by the Swire Educational Trust, John Swire Sons (Hong Kong) Ltd., and supported by the Swire Institute of Marine Science, the University of Hong Kong.

Nonetheless, considerable population structure might still occur in species with high dispersal ability due to current oceanographic and/or historical processes. Specifically, for the wider Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that populations inhabiting each of the following areas should be genetically distinct: Panama, Belize, Southwest Florida (Tampa), and Southeast Florida (Fort Pierce). This study tests the hypothesis of significant genetic differentiation in  P alaemon floridanus  populations across the wider Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Population level comparisons were conducted using sequences of the mt DNA COI . In agreement with predictions, AMOVA and pairwise  F ST  values demonstrated population differentiation among most pairs of the studied populations. Only Panama and East Florida populations were genetically similar. An isolation‐with‐migration population divergence model (implemented in IMA 2) indicated that population divergence with incomplete lineage sorting can be invoked as the single mechanism explaining genetic dissimilarity between populations from the east and west coast of Florida. Historical demographic analyses indicated demographic expansion of P. floridanus in some localities [recent in Panama and ancient in East Florida and the wider Caribbean (entire dataset)] but constant population in other localities (in Belize and West Florida). This study rejects the idea of panmixia in marine species with high long‐distance dispersal ability. Contemporary and historical processes might interact in a complex manner to determine current phylogeographic patterns.","This study would have not been possible without the support of Valerie Paul and Raphael Ritson‐Williams from the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce (SMSFP, Florida), Anson (Tuc) Hines and Ilka (Candy) Feller from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC, Maryland), Carla Piantonni and Klaus Ruetzler from the Caribbean Coral Reefs Ecosystem Program (CCRE, Washington, DC, USA) and John Christy from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI, Panama).

However, the modes of post-larval dispersal in low energy sublittoral habitats have been poorly documented. Herein we examined the specific dispersal mechanisms (diel vertical migration, water column, and bedload transport) and corresponding biological traits of the dispersing assemblage. At two sublittoral sites (sheltered and exposed) along the northern coast of Chile, we installed different trap types that capture benthic organisms with specific modes of dispersal (active emergence and passive water column drifting) and also by a combination of mechanisms (bedload transport, passive suspension and settlement from the water column). Our results show that even though there were common species in all types of traps, the post-larval macrobenthic assemblage depended on specific mechanisms of dispersal. At the sheltered site, abundant emerging taxa colonized sediments that were placed 0.5m above the bottom and bedload-transported invertebrates appeared to be associated to the passive drifting of macroalgae. At the exposed site, assemblage dispersal was driven by specific mechanisms e.g. bedload transport and active emergence. At both sites the biological traits “small size, swimming, hard exoskeleton, free living and surface position” were associated to water column and bedload dispersal. This study highlights the importance of (i) the water–sediment interface for dispersal of post-larvae in sublittoral soft-bottom habitat, and (ii) a specific set of biological traits when dispersing either along the bottom or through the water column.","We appreciate the help of E.

We describe the evolution of this policy and apply a semi-structured interview to managers of Chilean BANs. The poor results in total investments in the case of Chilean BANs allow us to understand how government programmes exclusively oriented towards the supply of the informal venture capital market are insufficient to promote the dynamism of this industry. It is necessary to implement articulated programmes both from the supply and demand side, accompanied by the continuous evaluation of their results.","We thank the managers of BANs for their availability to answer the questions and also Professor Colin Mason for his comments, suggestions and contributions to improve this paper.",,Venture Capital,,,,2013-04,2013,,2013-04,15,2,95-113,Closed,Article,"Romaní, Gianni; Atienza, Miguel; Amorós, José Ernesto","Romaní, Gianni (Entrepreneurship and SME Center, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Atienza, Miguel (Entrepreneurship and SME Center, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Amorós, José Ernesto (Global Entrepreneurship Research Center, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago de Chile, Chile)","Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North)","Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North); Amorós, José Ernesto (Universidad del Desarrollo)",19,1,,5.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010765428,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

These rights might also open other income options for fishers, including some that go beyond the original objectives intended by authorities establishing the right. The opportunity for alternative uses is especially high if the details of these rights are not clearly identified. In Chile, a de novo TURF (Territorial User Rights for Fishery) system, called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (Áreas de Manejo y Explotación de Recursos Bentónicos-AMERB) was created to achieve sustainable exploitation of benthic resources. This study compares two small-scale fishing communities in Chile, Guayacán and Huentelauquén, representing two typical contrasting settings, regarding geographical contexts and surroundings, origin, history, location, social embeddedness, main fisheries activities as well as the motivation and the process through which they acquired their AMERB. While in Guayacán the main fishing activity outside the AMERB is the giant squid and finfish fishery, in Huentelauquén the main and traditional activity has been diving for benthic resources. The objectives to acquire their AMERBs were different in both cases. Huentelauquén applied the AMERB for their traditional activity, the fishery of Concholepas concholepas (“loco”), thus in accordance with the official objective of the AMERB. Due to reduced catches of loco, fishers also added the collection of kelps, using their AMERB to control access to the entire coast surrounding their fishing community, beyond the limits of their AMERB. In Guayacán the AMERB, applied for the management of scallops and a species of red algae, began to be used for sea squirt aquaculture. Within the framework of sustainable fisheries implied by the AMERBs, there was in both cases a clear expectation to gain new sources of income. However with time both AMERBs are being used as a tool for territorial exclusion of other fishers beyond the limits of their respective AMERBs. In Huentelauquén fishers mention mostly negative aspects about the performance of their AMERB, given the poor economic results, being unsatisfied with the AMERB system in general, because they feel that the system disrupted their traditional migration along the coast. In Guayacán, fishers mentioned mostly positive aspects for their AMERB, as it was an opportunity to add new activities. Both examples show that rights-based management approaches are very attractive; they could promote new uses or developments, whose sustainability nevertheless needs to be analyzed further. The analyzed case studies show that, contrary to how the system was developed in Chile, a more bottom-up implementation of new management arrangements may make it easier to agree on common objectives, and/or leave more freedom for fishers to adjust and arrange their livelihood. Considering the importance the AMERBs have acquired for fishers, these kinds of systems need flexible regulations in order that fishers can adapt the system to local traditions, uses or needs and also to their learning and adapting capacities.","AcknowledgmentsThis paper is a result of a FORMAS (The Swedish Research Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning) financed project (2006–2207) assigned to G.L.G.F., J.A. and W.S. acknowledge financial support from Project FONDEF AQ08I1030.The authors are grateful to Georgina Cundill and Martin Thiel for their valuable comments.

The article explores Christian ecumenical developments in the twentieth century and specifically the crisis point reached in 1960 after the Sharpeville massacre. It turns to discuss the formation of two key black student leaders, Steve Biko and Barney Pityana, in the Eastern Cape and discusses their creation of the black-led South African Students' Organisation (SASO) in 1968. I explore a fraught but productive relationship between the growth of Black Consciousness and a developing commitment to social justice by student Christian organisations. A political culture of dialogue enabled the message of Black Consciousness to be quickly communicated to a broad cross section of progressive political actors in the early 1970s. A prime legacy of the ecumenical endeavour of the 1960s was its emphasis on unity and muting of strict orthodoxy, an approach that facilitated such cooperation. I argue that the theological radicalism of the ecumenical movement provided a reference point from which to understand and come to terms with the challenge of the emergent Black Consciousness movement.",,,Journal of Southern African Studies,,,,2013-06,2013,,2013-06,39,2,447-463,Closed,Article,"Macqueen, Ian","Macqueen, Ian (Society, Work and Development Institute, University of the Witwatersrand)",,"Macqueen, Ian (University of the Witwatersrand)",5,0,,8.61,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036054637,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

The aim of this article is to review the chronological and archaeological evidences of their coexistence in Brazil and to evaluate the degree of direct interaction between them. Critical assessment of the Brazilian megafauna chronological data shows that several of the late Pleistoscene/early Holocene dates available so far cannot be considered reliable, but the few that do suggest that at least two species (Catonyx cuvieri, ground sloth; Smilodon populator, saber-toothed cat) survived until the beginning of the Holocene in Southeast Brazil. Archaeological data indicates that the first human groups arrived in Brazil and were inhabiting this region during the last millennia of the Pleistocene and, consequently, they coexisted with the extinct fauna in some parts of Brazil for at least one thousand years. There is no robust evidence favoring any kind of direct interaction between humans and megafauna prior to their extinction. To date, it is not possible to properly judge the indirect influence of humans (landscape transformation, introduction of predators, among others) in this extinction event. Intense and to some extent unique climate changes between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene favors the interpretation that they had a major contribution to the megafauna extinction, although the scarcity of data impedes the proper testing of this hypothesis.","AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Augusto Auler for providing important references for our discussion and Leonardo Kerber, Ana Maria Ribeiro and Elizete Holanda for assisting us with information regarding dates from Rio Grande do Sul.

However, until the 1980s, mining regions were predominantly considered productive enclaves. This article analyzes the case of the Antofagasta Region, the main mining region in Chile. A descriptive analysis is put forward that addresses the ideal types of the mining cluster and enclave, establishing as criteria of comparison the mechanisms proposed by Marshall as sources of agglomeration economies. Despite strong growth, the Antofagasta Region approximates more a mining enclave than a cluster. This implies the need to revise and adapt the concept of enclave to the current reality.","This work was supported by Compañía Minera Zaldivar and Barrick and the Project NS 100046 of the Iniciativa Científica Milenio of the Ministry of Economics, Public Works and Tourism, Antofagasta, Chile.

We present a simple model that explains inflation divergence across regions in a monetary union with similar preferences as a consequence of the geographical allocation of producers in the different regions. Our results indicate that spatial allocation together with transport costs are important determinants of regional inflation, while macroeconomic common factors do not play an important role in this process. Existing literature had obtained the opposite result for Europe, and the reasons for this difference warrant further investigation. Moreover, we find that geographical distance seems to be a more appropriate measure of neighbourhood than the adjacency of regions.

202,pub.1120192714,10.29173/cais22,,,Review and Revision of Library and Information Science Curriculum in a South African University and the Usage of Follow-Up Study and Advertisement Scanning Methods,"Two methods for curriculum review and revision are used to review and revise the Library and Information (LIS) curriculum at the University of Zululand, South Africa. Firstly, as an exercise in product analysis, a case study of the graduates of the University of Zululand between 1996 and 1999 was conducted. Graduates were traced to their current places of employment and interviewed together with their employers in order to determine whether the knowledge, skills and attitudes gained during training were adequate for their current job requirements. Secondly, a market-type analysis was conducted by scanning job advertisements in the field of library and information science appearing in a popular national weekly newspaper over a period of three years. Details regarding date and location of advertisement, type of employer, job details and job specifications and requirements in terms of qualifications, experience, knowledge, skills and attitudes were captured from this source and analysed. Whereas the aforementioned two methods still enjoy popularity, arguably, they alone do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the demand and supply matrix that can enhance effective and beneficial LIS education for service and employability of graduates. Evidently, the public sector and in particular the public and academic libraries, dominate this specific segment of the employment market in South Africa. Sound education in the fields of management, information and communication technologies, information searching, analysis and synthesis, as well as the ability to perform practical work is regarded as essential. The use of the aforementioned two methods exploits techniques which play a crucial verification role and which effectively supplement other methods such as reviewing existing curriculum and literature, consulting with colleagues and observing national and international trends as well as the focus-group method for academic programme development. Other intervening variables in the study are discussed. The paper addresses issues that can benefit theoretical and methodological issues in library and information science education and curriculum development.",,,Proceedings of the Annual Conference of CAIS / Actes du congrès annuel de l ACSI,,,,2013-10-15,2013,2013-10-15,,,,,Closed,Article,"Ocholla, Dennis N","Ocholla, Dennis N ()",,"Ocholla, Dennis N ()",1,0,,0.85,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120192714,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,4 Quality Education

Larvae subsequently spread throughout the water column encountering both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We analyzed some short- and long-term responses of Pleuroncodes monodon larval metabolism to hypoxia at 11 °C. Routine and postprandial aerobic respiration rates were lower in hypoxia than in normoxia for all zoeal stages. Zoea V oxyconformed, while megalopae oxyregulated down to very low oxygen concentrations. Throughout zoea I development, the rate of nitrogen (protein) accumulation in zoea I was lower, and C:N ratios were higher under hypoxic conditions than in normoxia. Citrate synthase (CS) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) apparent specific activities (as indicators of aerobic and metabolic potentials, respectively) decreased and remained at the same level, respectively, throughout zoea I reared under hypoxic conditions. Anaerobic to aerobic potential (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/CS) was higher in organisms reared under hypoxia, and MDH/LDH potential ratios were characteristic of organisms tolerant to hypoxia. In spite of P. monodon zoea endurance and metabolic adaptations to decreasing oxygen tensions, intense hypoxia as such of their release site would affect their overall condition especially toward the end of the molt cycle. Our results indicate the importance of considering the interaction between environmental oxygen variability and recruitment success.","The Chilean ‘Instituto de Fomento Pesquero’ (IFOP) kindly provided ovigerous females to conduct the experiments.

202,pub.1032404142,10.1002/aqc.2333,,,"Effects of isolation and fishing on the marine ecosystems of Easter Island and Salas y Gómez, Chile","ABSTRACT     An expedition to Salas y Gómez and Easter islands was conducted to develop a comprehensive baseline of the nearshore marine ecosystem, to survey seamounts of the recently created Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMHMP) – a no‐take marine reserve of 150 000 km 2 – and to compare these results with Easter Island where the marine ecosystem is similar but has no marine protection.    Live coral cover was surprisingly high at both Easter Island (53%) and Salas y Gómez (44%), especially considering their sub‐tropical location, high wave energy environments, and geographic isolation.    Endemic and regionally‐endemic species comprised 77% of the fish abundance at Easter Island and 73% at Salas y Gómez. Fish biomass at Salas y Gómez was relatively high (1.2 t ha ‐1 ) and included a large proportion of apex predators (43%), whereas at Easter Island it was almost three times lower (0.45 t ha ‐1 ) with large predators accounting for less than 2% of the biomass, despite good habitat quality.     The large cohort of small sharks and the absence of larger sharks at Salas y Gómez suggest mesopredator release consistent with recent shark fishing. The fish fauna at the seamounts between Easter Island and Salas y Gómez, outside of MMHMP, harboured 46% endemic species, including a new species of damselfish ( Chromis sp. nov.) and probably a new species of Chimaera ( Hydrolagus ). Numerous seamounts adjacent to Salas y Gómez are currently not included in the MMHMP.    This expedition highlights the high biodiversity value of this remote part of the Pacific owing to the uniqueness (endemicity) of the fauna, large apex predator biomass, and geographic isolation.

Stetson University’s Pursuit of an Academic Carnegie Library in the Early Twentieth Century,"Andrew Carnegie is well known for the more than 1800 public libraries he funded across the country, but less attention has been paid to the 108 academic library buildings for which he is responsible. Carnegie favoured smaller rather than larger academic institutions, funded a number of colleges serving African American students, and was known to have somewhat of a bias against Church-related schools. John B. Stetson University, a small school, yet segregated and firmly affiliated with the Baptists, makes an interesting study of how one college successfully pleaded a case for Carnegie funding and received one of the larger gifts of the 108 academic recipients. Stetson’s ultimately successful application was not seamless, however, and this article looks at the application process, the role of the Baptist connection, and the requirements of matching funds in the form of new endowment — all in the context of Carnegie’s philosophy of philanthropy and philanthropic giving at the turn of the century.",,,Library & Information History,,,,2013-03-01,2013,,2013-03-01,29,1,38-58,Closed,Article,"Ryan, Susan M","Ryan, Susan M (Stetson University, DeLand, Florida, USA)",,"Ryan, Susan M (Stetson University)",1,0,,0.85,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004519183,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The Dafne and Josefa diatremes crosscut the quartzites and are interpreted to be sources of the pyroclastic volcanic rocks. Hydrothermal activity was centered on the diatremes and four hydrothermal stages have been defined, three of which introduced Au ± Ag mineralization. The first hydrothermal stage is restricted to the quartzites of the Chimú Formation and is characterized by silice parda, a tan-colored aggregate of quartz-auriferous pyrite–rutile ± digenite infilling fractures and faults, partially replacing silty beds and forming cement of small hydraulic breccia bodies. The δ34S values for pyrite (1.7–2.2 ‰) and digenite (2.1 ‰) indicate a magmatic source for the sulfur. The second hydrothermal stage resulted in the emplacement of diatremes and the related volcanic rocks. The Dafne diatreme features a relatively impermeable core dominated by milled slate from the Chicama Formation, whereas the Josefa diatreme only contains Chimú Formation quartzite clasts. The third hydrothermal stage introduced the bulk of the mineralization and affected the volcanic rocks, the diatremes, and the Chimú Formation. In the volcanic rocks, classic high-sulfidation epithermal alteration zonation exhibiting vuggy quartz surrounded by a quartz–alunite and a quartz–alunite–kaolinite zone is observed. Company data suggest that gold is present in solid solution or micro inclusions in pyrite. In the quartzite, the alteration is subtle and is manifested by the presence of pyrophyllite or kaolinite in the silty beds, the former resulting from relatively high silica activities in the fluid. In the quartzite, gold mineralization is hosted in a fracture network filled with coarse alunite, auriferous pyrite, and enargite. Alteration and mineralization in the breccias were controlled by permeability, which depends on the type and composition of the matrix, cement, and clast abundance. Coarse alunite from the main mineralization stage in textural equilibrium with pyrite and enargite has δ34S values of 24.8–29.4 ‰ and $$ {\delta^{18 }}{{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}{{\mathrm{O}}_4}}}} $$ values of 6.8–13.9 ‰, consistent with H2S as the dominant sulfur species in the mostly magmatic fluid and constraining the fluid composition to low pH (0–2) and logfO2 of −28 to −30. Alunite–pyrite sulfur isotope thermometry records temperatures of 190–260 °C; the highest temperatures corresponding to samples from near the diatremes. Alunite of the third hydrothermal stage has been dated by 40Ar/39Ar at 17.0 ± 0.22 Ma. The fourth hydrothermal stage introduced only modest amounts of gold and is characterized by the presence of massive alunite–pyrite in fractures, whereas barite, drusy quartz, and native sulfur were deposited in the volcanic rocks. The $$ {\delta^{18 }}{{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}{{\mathrm{O}}_4}}}} $$ values of stage IV alunite vary between 11.5 and 11.7 ‰ and indicate that the fluid was magmatic, an interpretation also supported by the isotopic composition of barite (δ34S = 27.1 to 33.8 ‰ and $$ {\delta^{18 }}{{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}{{\mathrm{O}}_4}}}} $$ = 8.1 to 12.7 ‰). The Δ34Spy–alu isotope thermometry records temperatures of 210 to 280 °C with the highest values concentrated around the Josefa diatreme. The Lagunas Norte deposit was oxidized to a depth of about 80 m below the current surface making exploitation by heap leach methods viable.","This research is part of the PhD research of Luis Cerpa.

Nematode communities were studied in sediments off Concepción, Central Chile, spanning the outer shelf within the OMZ (122m) to the mid-lower continental slope (972m) beneath the OMZ. The total density and biomass of nematodes (core depth 0–10cm) ranged from 677 to 2006 ind. 10cm−2, and 168.4 to 506.5µg DW 10cm−2, respectively. Among metazoan meiofaunal taxa, nematodes predominated at all sites both in terms of relative abundance (83.7–99.4%) and biomass (53.8–88.1%), followed by copepods, nauplii and polychaetes. Nematodes were represented by 33 genera distributed among 17 families, with densities greatest at low oxygen sites (122–364m; ~2000 ind. 10cm−2). Nematode generic and trophic diversity, and individual biomass were lowest, and Rank 1 dominance was highest, at the most oxygen-depleted site (122m), despite the fact that the organic carbon content of the sediment was maximal at this depth. At the most oxygenated slope sites (827 and 972m), all of Wieser's nematode feeding groups were represented. In contrast, at the lowest-oxygen site, only selective deposit (bacterial) feeders (1A) were present, indicating a reduction in trophic complexity. A large percentage of nematodes inhabited subsurface sediment layers (>1cm). At deeper, more oxygenated sites (827 and 972m), nematode individual biomass increased downcore, while within the OMZ, nematode biomass was low and remained relatively uniform through the sediment column. The concentration of nematodes in deeper sediment layers, the vertical distribution of the feeding groups, as well as the high nutritional quality of the deeper layers, suggest a differential resource partitioning of the food available, which may reduce interspecific competition.","AcknowledgementsWe thank the captain, crew and scientists of the R/V Vidal Gormáz for assistance during the cruise.

A review of recent work on ethnicity in the field reveals, however, that methodological approaches to these social entities do not always follow suit and rather favor normative synchronie comparisons. This paper explores the origins and trends in the study of ethnic groups and ethnicity in Andean archaeology, arguing that we may be seeing the persistence of the culture concept in the guise of ethnicity. It also examines best practices in the literature in order to make recommendations concerning the adoption of local, contextual, and diachronic methods in conjunction with multiple lines of evidence. These practices are more likely to expose the processes of identity construction by rendering explicit the relationships among culture, ethnicity, and the use of emblemic material culture. It argues, thereby, for the provision of proof of this process rather than its assertion.
A pesar de que la arqueología andina haya utilizado durante mucho tiempo el término “étnico” para referirse a los grupos humanos en el pasado, una nueva definición de la etnicidad ha producido una visión menos estática de la construcción contextualizada de identidades. Sin embargo, el presente trabajo, tras la exploración de trabajos recientes sobre la etnicidad, revela que los enfoques metodológicos empleados no siempre siguen esta nueva trayectoria y por lo tanto favorecen comparaciones normativas sincrónicas. Este artículo explora los orígenes y las tendencias en el estudio de los grupos étnicos y la etnicidad en la arqueología andina, proponiendo que quizá estamos frente a la persistencia del concepto de cultura detrás del uso actual del concepto de etnicidad. A su vez, examina las mejores prácticas en la literatura con el fin de ofrecer recomendaciones sobre la adopción de una metodología contextual y diacrònica aplicando múltiples líneas de evidencia que nos dejarán más cerca de la construcción de la identidad en el pasado. Asimismo, es clave hacer explícitas las relaciones entre cultura, etnicidad, y el uso emblemático de la cultura material.

Methane seep biota on the Chilean margin likely represent a novel biogeographic province; however, little is known about the ecology of the seep fauna and particularly their trophic support. The present study, using natural abundance stable isotopes, reveals a complex trophic structure among heterotrophic consumers, with four trophic levels supported by a diversity of food sources at a methane seep area off Concepción, Chile (~36° S). Although methanotrophy, thiotrophy and phototrophy are all identified as carbon fixation mechanisms fueling the food web within this area, most of the analysed species (87.5%) incorporate carbon derived from photosynthesis and a smaller number (12%) use carbon derived from chemosynthesis. Methane‐derived carbon ( MDC ) incorporation was documented in 22 taxa, including sipunculids, gastropods, polychaetes and echinoderms. In addition, wide trophic niches were detected in suspension‐feeding and deposit‐feeding taxa, possibly associated with the use of organic matter in different stages of degradation ( e.g . from fresh to refractory). Estimates of Bayesian standard ellipses area (SEA B ) reveal different isotopic niche breadth in the predator fishes, the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides and the combtooth dogfish Centroscyllium nigrum , suggesting generalist versus specialist feeding behaviors, respectively. Top predators in the ecosystem were the Patagonian toothfish D. eleginoides and the dusky cat shark, Bythaelurus canescens . The blue hake Antimora rostrata also provides a trophic link between the benthic and pelagic systems, with a diet based primarily on pelagic‐derived carrion. These findings can inform accurate ecosystem models, which are critical for effective management and conservation of methane seep and adjacent deep‐sea habitats in the Southeastern Pacific.","We thank the captain, crew and scientific party of R/V Vidal Gormáz (VG‐07 cruise), R/V Melville (INSPIRE cruise) and R/V Sonne (ChiFlux cruise) for support at sea.

It involves penetration of thaw into ice-rich layers of permafrost, with attendant melting of ground ice and consolidation of thawed earth materials. Development of thermokarst terrain involves localized or widespread collapse, subsidence, erosion, and instability of the ground surface. Thermokarst is a response to disruption of thermal equilibrium in ice-rich permafrost, which leads to elevated ground surface temperatures and penetration of the annual thaw into ice-rich upper layers of permafrost. The causes of thermokarst terrain are environmental change, at a variety of scales, including climatic warming, increases in the magnitude of seasonal variations in temperature, increased snow-cover thickness, destruction of vegetation, bodies of standing water, and anthropogenic impacts. Thermokarst can cause profound ecosystem changes, and can lead to serious damage to or even collapse of human infrastructure in permafrost regions.",,,,Treatise on Geomorphology,,,2013,2013,,2013,,,354-373,Closed,Chapter,"Shiklomanov, N.I.; Nelson, F.E.","Shiklomanov, N.I.

We call the bands “zebra stripes” due to the contrast between the darkly varnished clasts and the light-colored, salt-rich soil. Gravel that comprises the zebra stripes is sorted such that the coarsest clasts are at the downslope front and fine progressively upslope. How and when the zebra stripes formed are perplexing questions, particularly in a region experiencing prolonged hyperaridity. Using GoogleEarth, satellite imagery, and field observations, we report the first quantitative and qualitative observations of zebra stripes in order to test hypotheses of the mechanisms and timing of their formation. We consider soil shrink-swell, seismic shaking, and overland flow as possible formation mechanisms, and find that overland flow is the most likely. Based on cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in surface clasts, salt deposition rates from the atmosphere, and content in the soils, we propose that the salt-rich soils began accumulating ~106 y ago and the zebra stripes formed 103–104 y at the latest. The zebra stripe pattern has been preserved due to the self-stabilization of the clasts within the stripes and the continued absence of life (which would disturb the surface, as seen at a wetter site to the south). We conclude that the occurrence of zebra stripes is diagnostic of a set of distinct characteristics of local and/or regional precipitation, soil, hillslope form, and bedrock type.","Thanks to Sarah Reed, Brad Sutter, Robert Finkel, and Simona Balan for help with fieldwork; Peter Nelson and Mike Lamb for helpful discussions of gravel transport; and Marc Caffee and Robert Finkel for cosmogenic radionuclide analysis.

This article examines the role of variable slope morphology, surface hydrology and microclimate in controlling colluvial sedimentation along a coastal tract of the hyperarid Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Direct accessibility of active surfaces is accompanied by uninterrupted stratigraphic exposures along the base of slopes, allowing direct comparisons between surface processes and the resulting sedimentary record. Four slope sectors are identified, based on differences in morphology and processes over active surfaces. Colluvial sedimentation is controlled by complex interactions of slope gradients and profiles, exposure to dominant winds, and potential runoff pathways, which vary considerably between different sectors. Major differences are evident between these hyperarid deposits and slope sedimentation in periglacial and temperate settings, including the complete absence of pedogenic activity and clay minerals; the volume of aeolian deposits and their role in controlling processes which redistribute sediment downslope, extending colluvial aprons; and the occurrence of runoff processes only where favoured by particular topographic configurations. Depositional surfaces range from steep talus cones, to debris‐flow‐dominated and aeolian‐dominated colluvial aprons, to an aeolian ramp subject to reworking by mass flows and flash floods. Consequently, facies associations and architectures at outcrop are highly variable and highlight the importance of spatial variations in slope morphology and processes in producing distinct, coeval colluvial stratigraphies within a single environmental context. Discrepancies between active processes and the corresponding stratigraphic signatures are also evident in some sectors; for example, preservation of alluvial and aeolian facies in stratigraphic sections does not always reflect the dominant processes over active slopes. Together with the spatial variability in processes and deposits along these slopes, this suggests that caution is required when extracting palaeoenvironmental information from analyses of colluvial successions.","Acknowledgements This research was financed by grant 815·01·012 of NWO (Netherlands Council for Scientific Research).

However, this debate is still open. After analyzing 80 published articles from 2007 to 2011, I conclude that the contradictions between these two approaches come from implicit assumptions that are not modeled when each approach is tested individually. Therefore, the aim of this article is to put the demographic and essence approaches to the test. To reach this objective, I developed a theoretical framework to analyze the relationship between family management involvement, family-oriented strategic decision making, and family firm performance. I conclude that contradictory conclusions may result from each model whether they are tested separately or together.","AcknowledgementsI wish to thank the editors of JFBS and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that led to the improvement of the article, as well as Julie Dekker and Salvatore Sciascia for their valuable suggestions.

The majority of Christians worldwide are now found in the continents of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. But the nature of that shift and the actors involved have not been fully explored. This book maintains that a transformation of Christianity has occurred that is far more than demographical or geographical — a profound reformation in the character of Christianity itself has taken place. The emergence, growth, and impact of Pentecostalism in the past hundred years played a major role in this transformation of a European and North American religion into a non-Western, charismatic, and predominantly female one. Key figures and movements, the many divisions and proliferations, and the resourcefulness and challenges of its leaders and members in the majority world are examined. The book discusses the historical origins, characteristics, ideologies, theologies, and emphases of Pentecostalism as it developed from a small number of obscure Christian revivalist sects at the beginning of the century, to representing, in many different forms today, possibly as much as a quarter of the world’s Christian population.

As the cliché states, ‘As Nigeria goes, so goes Africa’. This book frames the socio-historical and political trajectory of Nigeria while examining the many dimensions of the critical choices that she has made as an independent nation. How does the social composition of interest and power illuminate the actualities and narratives of the Nigerian crisis? How have the choices made by Nigerian leaders structured, and/or have been structured by, the character of the Nigerian state and state-society relations? In what ways is Nigeria’s mono-product, debt-ridden, dependent economy fed by ‘the politics of plunder’? And what are the implications of these questions for the structural relationships of production, reproduction and consumption?

However, despite such challenges the global tourism system has in the main retained its past vitality although in some cases in a different form. The book investigates different kinds of ""crisis"" and unpacks understandings of crisis in relation to various components in the contemporary tourism system. The aim of this book therefore is to critically analyse the relationship between tourism and crises. The volume focuses on the roles and potential of tourism for development and relations between tourism, environment and broad global process of change at different levels of analysis, highlighting different types of “crisis”. In particular it questions the general conviction that tourism-led development is a sustainable and necessarily solid platform from which to develop local, national and regional economies from a range of perspectives. Written by leading academics in the field this book offers valuable insight into tourism's relationship with socio – cultural, environment, economic and political crisis as well as the challenges facing future tourism development.",,,,,"Gustav Visser, Sanette Ferreira",,2013-02-15,2013,2013-02-15,,,,,Closed,Monograph,,,,,13,5,,2.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050669766,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",

Each approach draws on distinct bodies of literature and traditions and uses distinct identifiers, labels, and constellations of concepts; each has been taken up across diverse global contexts and is used as rationale and guide for the design of research and of educational policies and practices. Authors discuss the genesis and historical trajectory of the approach with which they are associated; offer their unique perspectives, rationales, and engagements; and investigate implications for understanding language and literacy use in and out of schools. The premise of the book is that understanding concepts, perspectives, and approaches requires knowing the context in which they were created, the rationale or purpose in creating them, and how they have been taken up and applied in communities of practice.

Managing Natural Resources for Sustainable Livelihoods analyses and extends this premise to show unequivocally that the process of research for improving natural resource management must incorporate participatory and user-focused approaches, leading to development based on the needs and knowledge of local resource users. Drawing on extensive and highly relevant case studies, this book presents innovative approaches for establishing and sustaining participation and collective decision-making, good practice for research, and challenges for future developments. It covers a wide range of natural resources - including forests and soils, and water and management units, such as watersheds and common property areas - and provides practical lessons from analysis and meta-analysis of cases from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It offers insights on how to make research participatory while maintaining rigour and high-quality biological science, different forms of participation, and ways to scale up and extend participatory approaches and successful initiatives.

This approach provides an opportunity for adults and young people to engage with a range of processes such as group conferencing and peer mediation, whereby: conflict and harm are confronted and repaired; a future rather than past orientation is developed; relationships are built upon the values and attitudes of respect, inclusion and equality; pupils learn inter-personal and problem solving skills as well as social responsibility; staff develop skills and confidence in working restoratively; the risk of future/repeat problems is minimised; and a positive school ethos is developed. conflict and harm are confronted and repaired; a future rather than past orientation is developed; relationships are built upon the values and attitudes of respect, inclusion and equality; pupils learn inter-personal and problem solving skills as well as social responsibility; staff develop skills and confidence in working restoratively; the risk of future/repeat problems is minimised; and a positive school ethos is developed. These approaches have proven to be highly effective in criminal justice systems around the world, and are beginning to be applied more widely in educational contexts. This edited volume draws together for the first time contributions from an interdisciplinary field of international experts and practitioners on the subject, and offers both critique and guidance in order that the implementation of restorative approaches in schools may be undertaken thoughtfully and sustainably.

However, its mining regions, including Antofagasta, face the challenge of developing a critically important primary sector in a manner that contributes to both economic growth and broader measures of well-being. Antofagasta's long term sustainability goals include a more diversified economic base, supported by a city that is lived in for its high quality of life and the opportunities it offers. To achive this, it will need to make the most of its natural endowments, improve the city's physical attractiveness and ensure better urban policy outcomes. It will also require regional and local actors to act in a strategic and innovative manner. This study focuses on economic diversification, urbanism and governance in the city of Antofagasta. Consideration is given to: economic and socio-economic trends such as those associated with labour markets and skills, as well as quality of life factors; opportunities for specialisation, diversification and innovation within and beyond the mining cluster, including throught its port network; urban policy challenges especially in land use, waste management, environment and public transport; and to the role of public governance in helping the city realise its economic and quality of life objectives.",,,OECD Territorial Reviews,,,,2013-09-27,2013,,2013-09-27,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,17,0,,3.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107160201,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

It came a few days after the removal of the ban on the African National Congress (ANC); founded a century ago and outlawed in 1960, the ANC had transferred its headquarters abroad and opened what it termed an External Mission. For the thirty years following its banning, the ANC had fought relentlessly against the apartheid state. Finally voted into office in 1994, the ANC today regards its armed struggle as the central plank of its legitimacy. This book studies the ANC’s period in exile, based on a full range of sources in southern Africa and Europe. These include the ANC’s own archives and also those of the Stasi, the East German ministry that trained the ANC’s security personnel. The book reveals that the decision to create the Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation)—a guerrilla army which later became the ANC’s armed wing—was made not by the ANC but by its allies in the South African Communist Party after negotiations with Chinese leader Mao Zedong. It shows that many of the strategic decisions made, and many of the political issues which arose during the course of that protracted armed struggle, had a lasting effect on South Africa, shaping its society even up to the present day.",,,,,,,2013-12-04,2013,,2013-12-04,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Ellis, Stephen","Ellis, Stephen ()",,"Ellis, Stephen ()",35,4,,44.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1098728539,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Their internal structure consists of a core component and peripheral nodes that are filled by default values. These values are instantiated, that is changed to specific values or left at their default values, when the individual experiences events of any type. Thus, the possibility arises for recognizing and categorizing events as representative of the same cultural model even if they slightly differ in each of their specific occurrences. Cultural models play an important role in the generation of the individual’s behavior. A proposal is advanced to consider cultural models as fundamental units of analysis for an approach to culture that goes beyond the dichotomy between the individual (culture only in mind) and the collective (culture only in the social realm). The genesis of the concept of cultural model is traced from Kant to contemporary scholars. The concept underwent a number of transformations while it crossed and received further and unique elaborations within disciplines like philosophy, psychology, anthropology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. A methodological trajectory is outlined that blends qualitative and quantitative techniques. A survey follows of the extensive research about cultural models carried out all over the world. The results of the survey generated the proposal of an empirically motivated typology of cultural models rooted in the primary difference between foundational and molar types.

For example, a reader may compare costs of drugs in France versus the United States versus Canada. Each country spread will feature short entries on the ten health care categories accompanied by charts, table, and photos as appropriate. The work culminates as a unique and essential resource for pre-med and medical students, as well as researchers in sociology, economics, and the health management fields.",,,,,,,2013-01-01,2013,,2013-01-01,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Boslaugh, Sarah","Boslaugh, Sarah ()",,"Boslaugh, Sarah ()",32,6,,6.04,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099325758,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor & Francis, an informa company.","This project has grown out of so many hands, minds, and hearts, that befitting acknowledgement would require another volume in itself. However, in the space available, I would like first to offer my thanks to the distinguished Board of Advisers who so kindly guided the book. The editor is extremely grateful for their insights and support for a project that in some ways was an unknown quantity. My special thanks must go to Craig Howes, Philippe Lejeune, and Julia Watson who consistently and generously supported a tome as capacious and capricious as Virginia Woolf said a diary should be. Zhao Baisheng added an invaluable contribution with his vision of auto/biography studies in China. Their humour and enthusiasm were very much appreciated. I would also like to thank the nearly 400 scholars who contributed to the book, whose imagination and xiipatience with the collaborative process went tar beyond the call of duty. My thanks also to the Mass-Observation Archive at the University of Sussex. This unique collection of life writings is run by a uniquely supportive group of women, whose Director, Dorothy Sheridan, not only offered help as an Adviser but took me on as Honorary Research Fellow for the duration of the Encyclopedia&#x27;s construction. The years of intellectual stimulation and practical help I have received from Dorothy and her colleagues are much treasured. I also offer thanks to the School of Cultural and Community Studies at the University of Sussex and the School of English at the University of Exeter, which provided me with warm and congenial academic environments within which to work. Working with Alistair Thomson at the Centre for Continuing Education was another delight at Sussex. Many thanks to him and to the Brighton Women&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Educational Association, with whom I learned so much about life history work. I would also like to acknowledge Jenny Bourne Taylor and Treva Broughton, inspirational supervisors of my studies in the field, along with Julia Swindells, who started me off on the prickly trail of autobiography before I know what is was. I thank her for a timely prod regarding the politics of encyclopedia-making. Thanks must also be given to Lydia Fakundiny at Cornell University who found a moment at the very beginning of the project to encourage a young stranger. I owe heartfelt thanks to the freelance editorial staff whose work is so crucial to any book of this nature: Delia Gaze (editorial compilation); Martha Bremser, Delia Gaze, and Richard Shaw (copy editing); Caroline Howlett and Cathy Johns (research); Caroline Howlett and Alison Worthington (proofreading); Patrick Heenan (indexing); Nina Bunton and Helena Lyons (text preparation); as well as to Daniel Kirkpatrick at the FDP London office. Finally, an immeasurable thank-you to my Commissioning Editor, Mark Hawkins-Dady. His unfailing calm, humour, judgement, and above all his light-handed, scholarly touch have made this work a joy to do.",,,,,,2013-12-04,2013,2013-12-04,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Jolly, Margaretta","Jolly, Margaretta ()",,"Jolly, Margaretta ()",11,2,,14.02,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028489429,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3602 Creative and Professional Writing,
5,pub.1015844888,10.4324/9780203483862,,,Encyclopedia of African History,"Covering the entire continent from Morocco, Libya, and Egypt in the north to the Cape of Good Hope in the south, and the surrounding islands from Cape Verde in the west to Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles in the east, the Encyclopedia of African History is a new A-Z reference resource on the history of the entire African continent. With entries ranging from the earliest evolution of human beings in Africa to the beginning of the twenty-first century, this comprehensive three volume Encyclopedia is the first reference of this scale and scope. Also includes 99 maps.","This encyclopedia has taken considerably longer than originally planned, both to write and prepare for publication. Anybody who has worked on collaborative projects, even on a small scale, knows only too well how delays quickly get built into the system. I am grateful for the patience of advisers and contributors, many of whom have inevitably been asked to add last-minute updating to their entries. I am particularly grateful for the help, guidance, and encouragement I received from our team of eminent advisers in the early stages. In addition, the commitment to the project by the large number of contributors was always an inspiration to me, and the whole project is greatly indebted to that handful of contributors who responded so willingly to appeals for yet more work to be produced on short notice. My thanks to Kristen Holt and her team at Routledge Reference, New York, who took up the project at a late stage, trusted my judgment, and completed the work expeditiously. Special acknowledgment, however, is due to the originator of the concept, Mark Hawkins-Dady of Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, who first proposed the project to me, and then, through several years of inspiring and industrious work, saw it through, almost to its final stages. Without him, this book would not have happened. Finally, I dedicate this book to Pippa, my wife, always an inspiration in my work.",,,,Kevin Shillington,,2013-07-04,2013,2013-07-04,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,0,,2.54,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015844888,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

Information dissemination and acquisition is now effortless, and the way we visualise information is constantly evolving. The face of anatomy education has been altered by the advent of such innovation with Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) now commonplace in modern curricula.With the constant development of new computing systems, the temptation is to push the boundaries of what can be achieved rather than addressing what should be achieved. As with clinical practice, education in healthcare should be evidence driven. Learning theory has supplied educators with a wealth of information on how to design teaching tools, and this should form the bedrock of technology-enhanced educational platforms. When analysing resources and assessing if they are fit for purpose, the application of pedagogical theory should be explored and the degree to which it has been applied should be considered.",,,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,Biomedical Visualisation,Paul M.

Scholars from the Global South have questioned the notion that the Western way of thinking is the universal way of thinking. For decolonial feminist scholars, gender, like race, is a colonial invention. In contemporary society, decolonial feminism has, first, motivated the questioning of media discourse constructed from the rhetoric of the matrix of colonial power and, second, the recreation of subaltern identities beyond global epistemic hierarchies. By assuming an “epistemic disobedience,” which implies questioning the Eurocentric/Western perspective as the only valid viewpoint, this entry explores how understandings about the intersection between race, class, sexuality, and gender related to Eurocentric points of view and a patriarchal perspective have been instilled and reproduced since colonial times in Latin American countries and other colonial areas. It also explores how such perspectives are still presented and perpetuated in current societies in the form of media messages.

As increasing attention has been paid to sustainability and natural resources preservation, highway agencies are looking for alternative materials and innovative asphalt mix technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of their pavement construction practices. In this study, a comparative carbon footprint assessment was conducted to evaluate the potential environmental benefits related to the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) as a partial replacement of coarse natural aggregates in the production of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA). In order to estimate the GHGs emissions associated with the use of these alternative resources in the construction of road pavements in Barranquilla, Colombia, primary data was gathered from companies in the region. The SimaPro software version 8.4.0 was used for modelling the processes analyzed in the case study according to the methodologies proposed in the ISO 14067 standards “Greenhouse gases- Carbon footprint of products- Requirements and guidelines for quantification and communication” and ISO 14040 standards “Environment management- Life cycle assessment- Principles and framework”. The pavement life cycle phases and processes included within the system boundaries were the following: (1) materials production and transportation to the mixing plant; (2) materials processing and mixtures production at the mixing plant; (3) mixtures transportation to the construction site; and (4) pavement construction. Finally, three percentages of RCA replacements were considered in the production of WMA. This chapter discusses the comparative carbon footprint assessment was conducted to evaluate the potential environmental benefits related to the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) as a partial replacement of coarse natural aggregates in the production of Warm Mix Asphalt. The construction of road pavements is an important consumer of natural resources and a major contributor to the human-driven emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). The functional unit is the basis for comparisons between different products with the same utility for the same function. A comparative carbon footprint assessment was performed to estimate the potential savings related to the use of different levels of RCA replacements in coarse natural aggregates of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA). The main goal of this study was to estimate the potential environmental benefits, expressed as CO2 equivalent emissions, related to the production of WMA with several RCA contents, namely 15, 30 and 45%.",,,,"Pavement, Roadway, and Bridge Life Cycle Assessment 2020","John Harvey, Imad L.

Three methods for calculating traditional beta are presented and illustrated through the case of Facebook. Different choices of market index, data frequency, and sample size result in different values of beta; however, in all cases beta was greater than one. The chapter explores ordinal beta as an alternative measure to treat outliers in both developed and thin markets. Using a sample of 84 US stocks, there was no statistical difference between median traditional and ordinal betas. This was not the case for a sample of 47 Colombian stocks, which questions the usefulness of traditional beta in thin markets. In contrast with median traditional beta, median ordinal beta did not change significantly as a result of irregular data series. The contrary occurred when the observation (sampling) period was reduced; this leaves open the question of subjectivity when defining such period.

In this paper we schedule a set of jobs on a production system with more than one stage and several machines in parallel per stage, considering multiple objectives to be optimized. This problem is known as the Flexible or Hybrid Flowshop Scheduling problem (HFSP), which is NP-hard even for the case of a system with only two processing stages where one stage contains two machines and the other stage contains a single machine. In that sense, it is possible to find an optimal solution for this problem with low computing resources, only for small instances which, in general, do not reflect the industrial reality. For that reason, the use of meta-heuristics as an alternative approach it is proposed with the aim to determine, within a computational reasonable time, the best assignation of the jobs in order to minimize the makespan, total tardiness and the number of tardy jobs simultaneously. In this regard, a Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (MOACO) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) are used for solving this combinatorial optimization problem. Results show the effectiveness of the approaches proposed.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Aided Systems Theory – EUROCAST 2019,"Roberto Moreno-Díaz, Franz Pichler, Alexis Quesada-Arencibia",,2020-04-15,2020,2020-04-15,2020,12013,,446-453,Closed,Chapter,"Niebles-Atencio, Fabricio; Rojas-Santiago, Miguel; Mendoza-Casseres, Daniel","Niebles-Atencio, Fabricio (Institute of Information Systems, Universität Hamburg, Von-Melle-Park 5, 20146, Hamburg, Germany); Rojas-Santiago, Miguel (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Ant.

This article shows the experience in the implementation of a tool called Glyph Reader, which is an application that has two interfaces, Web and Mobile and that responds to the need for an educational and interactive resource whose main objective is the Multisensory stimulation for literacy training in a population with cognitive disabilities and/specific learning disorder. The design of the activities that this application has is based on the theoretical model of multisensory stimulation Orton Gillingham, which seeks the development of basic skills for decoding isolated words based on a phonetic - graphic analysis of them.

The platform aims to cover the shortcomings of the TCP/UDP/IP internet protocol for a traffic streaming intrasession sensitive to the delay in wireless networks since the current systems in native mode do not differentiate between transmission failures due to bottlenecks caused by congestion or by the characteristics of the random medium. The system establishes a mapping of the population of packets to be transmitted over an RLNC coding system based on Finite fields (Galois field), which allows forwarding nodes to eliminate redundant information on the network to decrease communication times and increase throughput. Moreover, thanks to its configuration, the model takes advantage of a Cross-Layer communication, to define a dynamic trade-off between the parameters that define the performance of the system, which translates into a coding density in a reduction of the delay in each of the transmissions. The communication platform is presented under a simulation scheme supported by (KODO and NS3) and is compatible with the Multicast, Unicast, and Broadcast transmission types established under a channel with erasure effect.",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Information Technology and Systems,"Álvaro Rocha, Carlos Ferrás, Carlos Enrique Montenegro Marin, Víctor Hugo Medina García",,2020-01-31,2020,2020-01-31,2020,1137,,579-588,Closed,Chapter,"Julio, Yair Rivera; Garcia, Ismael Gutiérrez; Marquez, José","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Garcia, Ismael Gutiérrez (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Marquez, José (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte)","Julio, Yair Rivera (Universidad del Norte); Garcia, Ismael Gutiérrez (Universidad del Norte); Marquez, José (Universidad del Norte)",8,5,,2.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124433160,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

In this chapter we present the first consistent formal quantitative analysis of the regional dimension of that story. By putting together estimations of the provincial Gross Domestic Products (GDPs) for ten benchmark years between 1895 and 2004, we confirm the paramount importance of the city of Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires in the national economy since the end of the nineteenth century. We also add new insights about the evolution of regional disparities: first, there is a remarkable persistence in the relative positions of the provinces along the whole period under analysis; second, this persistence is mainly due to the fact that the high levels of income per capita in some provinces of Patagonia and in Capital Federal—relative to provinces in the North—is a feature that is defined since the nineteenth century. Third, the explanation of a large share of regional inequality is related to high productivity generated by abundance of natural resources in some areas of Pampa Húmeda and Patagonia and by increasing returns in manufacturing and services in Capital Federal.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

The success of any project lies in a great manner on keeping costs in the estimated values, as well as meeting customer required due date. Therefore, there is a current need of developing an information system that facilitates the creation and managing of projects and their processes, including costing schemes, as well as monitoring an optimizing project’s makespan. In order to address this situation a user-friendly information system (IS) was developed. This IS includes an optimization module that reduces the project’s execution time, thus, minimizing costs and ultimately providing the manager with the right tools for the correct development of the project. Therefore, a better planning of activities in a reduced time is accomplished. In this way, the project manager is equipped with a decision support system (DSS) that allows a better decision making and, thanks to this performance optimization, a cost-effective solution can be delivered to the company. The optimization module is the main innovative component in this IS, considering that addresses the problem as a multiobjective one, considering at the same time makespan and cost. This module is based on global bacteria optimization (GBO). This becomes the most relevant improvement when compared to other ISs in the market.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management,"Khalid Saeed, Jiří Dvorský",,2020-05-22,2020,2020-05-22,2020,12133,,158-171,Closed,Chapter,"Jimenez-Barros, Miguel Angel; Ramirez Rios, Diana Gineth; Ardila Hernandez, Carlos Julio; Castro Bolaño, Lauren Julieth; Neira Rodado, Dionicio","Jimenez-Barros, Miguel Angel (Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ramirez Rios, Diana Gineth (Fundación Centro de Investigación en modelación Empresarial del Caribe, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ardila Hernandez, Carlos Julio (Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Castro Bolaño, Lauren Julieth (Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Neira Rodado, Dionicio (Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Neira Rodado, Dionicio (University of the Coast)","Jimenez-Barros, Miguel Angel (University of the Coast); Ramirez Rios, Diana Gineth (Fundación Centro de Investigación en modelación Empresarial del Caribe, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ardila Hernandez, Carlos Julio (Universidad del Norte); Castro Bolaño, Lauren Julieth (University of the Coast); Neira Rodado, Dionicio (University of the Coast)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127786656,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4609 Information Systems,

We use regional economic data from several academic and official sources to study the patterns of economic growth through most of the century. We conclude that Colombian regions did not converge during this time. Although poorer regions grew at faster rates, the dispersion of regional per capita GDP did not decrease. We argue that geographic conditions led to an early development of isolated markets that concentrated in the central regions of the country, and their integration to regional markets through the construction of railroads and highways occurred late in comparison to other Latin American countries. However, this process reinforced the concentration of economic activity due to the reduction of transport costs and the presence of economies of scale. Moreover, the implementation of import substitution policies during the second half of the century benefited industrial economies located in the center of the country, increasing their advantage over peripheral areas. As a result, the economic development of both coastal regions, Pacific and the Caribbean, lagged behind those regions located in the center. We believe that this historical perspective contributes to a better understanding of current regional economic inequalities in Colombia and their persistence over time.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

These conditions have not been explicitly considered in comparative research on journalists’ work environments, an omission that may obscure important realities of contemporary journalism. We address this gap through analysis of journalist surveys in 62 countries. We confirm the existence of insecure democracies as an empirical phenomenon and begin to unravel their meaning for journalists. We find democracies with uneven democratic performance tend to have more journalist assassinations, which is the most extreme form of influence on work, and that levels of democratic performance, violence, public insecurity and economic inequality significantly shape how journalists perceive various influences in their work environment. Case studies of insecure democracies in Africa and Latin America address why these conditions sometimes (but not always) lead to journalist assassinations and other anti-press violence. They suggest anti-press violence is higher when sub-national state actors intensify criminal violence and when insecurity is geographically and topically proximate to journalists. How journalists’ perceive influences on work are therefore more complex and multidimensional than previous research has suggested. The study concludes by identifying areas for improvement in data collection.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the research assistance of Luca Romero Carcamo, Luís Lemini and Melissa Andrea Gonzáles Medina of the Universidad Iberoamericana-Mexico City and Sean Beckett of Stellenbosch University, South Africa.","The authors are grateful for internal funding grants from the University of Miami Provost’s Research Award and School of Communication; The Universidad Iberoamericana-Mexico City Young Scholars Grant; and The Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla, Colombia).

This work describes a differential equations online course based on the solution of learning challenges, through mathematical modelling. This course has been developed on the OpenEdx platform. This course is built in order to provide engineering students with the abilities necessary to analyze and solve ordinary differential equations (ODE). The course consists of five units or modules: 1) first order ODE’s, 2) second order ODE’s, 3) Laplace transform, 4) Numerical methods and 5) Partial differential equations (PDE). On each module, the necessary theory is briefly explained through interactive videos. Besides this, our course includes: an e-Book, computational simulations using applications such as Mathematica and Python, an adaptive trainer for problems and exercises, a comprehensive activity about concepts and an evaluation activity. At the end of each module, the course offers a real life situation or a mathematical challenge to be solved in a collaborative way. The goal of this course is to develop the student’s abilities for mathematical modelling of systems through differential equations. Technology being implemented lets to give an individual following to each student. Finally, we show the results obtained recently by the students that took part in the course of differential equations, and we also show several examples with their answers to the proposed problems.","The authors would like to acknowledge the technical support of Writing Lab, TecLabs, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico, in the production of this work.",,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"Methodologies and Intelligent Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning, 10th International Conference","Pierpaolo Vittorini, Tania Di Mascio, Laura Tarantino, Marco Temperini, Rosella Gennari, Fernando De la Prieta",,2020-07-28,2020,2020-07-28,2020,1241,,249-258,Closed,Chapter,"Acosta, Rubén Dario Santiago; de Lourdes Quezada Batalla, María; Cooper, Ernesto Manuel Hernández","Acosta, Rubén Dario Santiago (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico); de Lourdes Quezada Batalla, María (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico); Cooper, Ernesto Manuel Hernández (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico)","Acosta, Rubén Dario Santiago (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico)","Acosta, Rubén Dario Santiago (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico); de Lourdes Quezada Batalla, María (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico); Cooper, Ernesto Manuel Hernández (Tecnológico de Monterret, 52926, Atizapán Edo Mex, Mexico)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129693570,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Analytical study was carried out; the study population consisted of 5351 workers. All workers in grassroots positions who answered the questionnaire voluntarily were included.
For this study three questionnaires were considered: the first one collected sociodemographic and labor data; the second was the “CVT-GOHISALO” for the identification of the level of QWL in seven dimensions and finally the “Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS)” scale for the evaluation of Burnout Syndrome in three dimensions.
The analyzes were descriptive and inferential. The descriptive analysis was used both in the socio-demographic and labor data, satisfaction of QWL and Burnout Syndrome. The association between them was established with Chi square, considering the association if p was lesser than 0.05. For the calculation of Odds Ratio (OR), the low and medium levels of the QWL dimensions were grouped as non-satisfaction and the high level was considered as satisfaction and, for the dimensions of Burnout were handled as absent (low-null) and present (medium and high).
Of 5351 workers included in the study, 68.2% were female; the average age being 38.6 years, 31.2% were graduated with a degree. The seniority in the position varied from less than a year to 37 years, being 11.7 years old average.Regarding the evaluation of perceived QWL, 27.6% described as “low”, 43.8% as “average” and 28.5% as “high”. As for the dimensions of Burnout, we found that 30.3% presented “lack of personal realization” 16.5% presented “emotional exhaustion” and 13.5% presented “depersonalization”.Unsatisfaction with QWL in all its dimensions, showed a consistent association with the dimensions of Burnout Syndrome, showing values ​​of risk factor in all cases. As can be seen, the non-satisfaction with the QWL is consistently a risk factor for Burnout Syndrome, being especially high in the dimension of emotional exhaustion.",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"Advances in Physical, Social & Occupational Ergonomics","Waldemar Karwowski, Ravindra S.

1137,pub.1131330330,10.4324/9780429294426-24,,,Leveraging Social Responsibility for Worker Engagement,"One key to engage and promote happiness of workers is to instill long-term organizational commitment and productivity using an agenda of social responsibility. Individuals comprise organizations, which are focused on a common set of values, purposes, and goals. Workers and volunteers today have a self-imposed awareness, expectation, and understanding of organizations’ social agendas. Thus, organizations strategically need to attract personnel desiring certain pro-social activities through their social responsibility priorities and initiatives. Organizations having the right people in place creates stability and a positive relational performance (Bartlett & Ghoshal, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000). This attachment and reinforcement creates a positive, on-going cycle of commitment, growth, and mutual satisfaction. This involvement with an organization creating attachment is based on theories of social identity, pro-social behavior, and organizational citizenship behavior. Whether vocation or avocation, people function on a combination of internal, external, and interactionist facets to be productive. Nonprofits typically focus on a social goal, and for-profit organizations often adopt strategic initiatives for social and environmental causes. As such, social responsibility extends an individuals’ interests and talents into areas of importance and validation beyond their everyday obligations. Long-term commitment to productivity—creating both individual and organization satisfaction and happiness—establishes a cycle of engagement.",,,,The Routledge Companion to Happiness at Work,Joan Marques,,2020-10-15,2020,2020-10-15,,,,273-282,Closed,Chapter,"Clevenger, Morgan R.","Clevenger, Morgan R.

Although there are several types of PCM, depending on the composition and characteristics they can be used in different applications. The most used characterization methods, throughout their study, are the DSC and the T-history, but new methods that replicate or exceed the expected are still being studied, which contribute to make an adequate material selection and their components. The bibliography and study of these materials has aroused curiosity and over the years new materials and new ways of obtaining them are studied. Also, to improve the environment in which they work, wider applications and those currently used, it is possible to obtain greater energy efficiency.

The policy-makers also know that it is extremely difficult to measure the effectiveness of the initiative because they are so many variable factors that can impact upon the outcome of an initiative. Although Colombian business processes, in the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector, are as old as the pre-Columbian cultures that practised commercial, agricultural, mining and production activities using barter as the main economical mechanism, the sector as such only became recognized by academics, unions and governments in the late 1940s.

The framework combines the evolutionary path of the business startup life cycle with PM approaches and methodologies to support startuppers in addressing the uncertainty of the entrepreneurial process. Focusing on the business startup project life cycle, the framework examines the critical issues in managing each stage, the most suitable PM approaches, and lastly the tools, techniques, and interpersonal skills that startuppers need to organize their activities. The findings demonstrate that managing flourishing business startup projects can be supported by balancing traditional and agile project management methodologies according to the level of uncertainty and complexity of the different stages of their launch and development. Implications for theory relate to the unconventional connection between the literature on PM and entrepreneurship; implications for practices include the adoption of the proposed framework as a roadmap to support nascent entrepreneurs in managing entrepreneurial projects.",,,International Studies in Entrepreneurship,Innovative Entrepreneurship in Action,Giuseppina Passiante,,2020-05-14,2020,2020-05-14,2020,45,,55-69,Closed,Chapter,"Secundo, Giustina; Capaldo, Guido","Secundo, Giustina (Department of Innovation Engineering, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy); Capaldo, Guido (Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy)","Secundo, Giustina (University of Salento)","Secundo, Giustina (University of Salento); Capaldo, Guido (University of Naples Federico II)",5,1,,1.74,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127555205,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

Here, I consider this possibility in one of the most marginal environments on the planet, the hyperarid Atacama Desert. Through bioarchaeological analyses of skeletal remains from the tumultuous Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000–1450) in the San Pedro de Atacama oases, I document direct evidence of traumatic injury and the distribution and patterns of violence across a series of Atacameño oases through time. Results indicate that these conflicts arose in these groups with diminishing resources over time but violent responses varied substantially. Evidence of temporal differences in violence suggests that climate volatility may have been a breaking point for communities living in this marginal environment and may have served as an impetus for escalating conflict. While a generalized increase in violence is notable in this tumultuous time, it is clear that those populations with less access to resources—both in material wealth and natural resources—succumbed to violent injury at higher rates than those whose situation was less precarious.","The data on which this work is based were collected over many years under the auspices of NSF BCS-0721229 and NSF BCS-1359644 and support from Colorado College and the University of California, Merced.

In addition, sometimes questions are not organized by topics or levels of difficulty, which can lead to exams on topics not yet seen in class, or questionnaires with the wrong difficulty level among students in the same course. To reduce this problem, we developed a peer review tool for evaluating and adjusting questions and then exporting them to an LMS as a question bank, organized by topic and difficulty level.

Argentina, for instance, experienced rapid growth until World War I, following an export-led model, and a relative decline afterwards, whereas economic growth in Brazil and Mexico was faster in the second half of the twentieth century, in both cases driven by state-led industrialization policies. Others as Chile and Peru were blessed with different mining cycles, while experienced industrialization expansion led by the state at mid-twentieth century.In this chapter, benefiting from the work done in the previous chapters, we provide a first attempt to analyse regional growth (at a subnational level), emphasizing the interaction between first- and second-nature forces, namely the localization of natural resources, trade policies, agglomeration forces and economic policies in shaping the regional income inequality of Latin American countries from the end of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Following the work done by Badia-Miró et al. (Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 49(1), 117–139, 2018), we will test existence of sigma and beta convergence, and the evolution of the Theil index and its decomposition. Finally, we check statistically the existence of a group of richer or poorer regions, considering spatial clustering analysis. To do that we run a simple test to obtain local Moran’s I coefficient for all the regions, which consider a statistical relationship between the regional income per capita of any region and its neighbourhood. We are especially interested in detecting the existence of this groups across national borders and its persistence in the long run, according to the changes in commodity cycles, industrial and trade policies and regional integration. Besides, we are also interested in the role played by the administrative capitals of the countries and the economic linkages to neighbouring regions.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

Our analysis, which goes back to the nineteenth century, shows that regional income inequality has followed over time what appears now to be an N-shaped evolution in both regions. However, both experiences differ markedly and we identify the main stylized facts of these trajectories. First, Latin America begun the period with higher levels of regional inequality than Europe. Second, the increase in inequality up to the interwar years was more intense in Latin America than in Europe. Besides, the increasing disparities in Europe in this initial period were based on the high territorial concentration of industry while in Latin America inequality mainly grew responding to the specific geography of the natural resources. Third, both regions underwent a period of convergence between the aftermath of the World War II and the crisis of the 1970s, being the process more intense in the European case. In Europe, the spread of industrialization and structural change to a growing number of regions was determinant in the decrease in inequality. In the case of Latin America, however, it was the marked change in economic policy—import substitution industrialization—that constituted the driving force behind the regional convergence. Finally, the crisis of the 1970s and changes in the international political and economic consensus in the 1980s signalled the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of inequality. A context of increasing international economic integration brought to a halt the narrowing of the gap between richer and poorer regions, but in a lower degree in Europe compared to Latin America. In this case, the liberalism typical of the 1980s, as enshrined in the Washington Consensus, favoured reinsertion into the international goods and factor markets and led to the unequal growth of those regions best endowed with resources.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

Atmospheric pollution has a big impact on the health of those who already have an underlying disease (asthma, cystic fibrosis) and in the most vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and the malnourished. Indoor pollution is composed of solid combustibles or biomass combined with the infiltration of atmospheric contaminants to indoor environments and/or contamination caused by environmental tobacco smoke. It can exceed the atmospheric pollution in many countries in the world, and so it is the most important environmental risk factor. It is responsible for 5% of the global load of respiratory diseases and causes around 4.3 million early deaths. The WHO has declared that the global burden of morbidity caused by indoor and outdoor air pollution causes millions of premature deaths, which are associated with tobacco risks, and it currently represents one of the greatest sanitary risks around the globe. It has been estimated that around 13% of total world deaths are attributed to atmospheric and indoor pollution combined.

Plants and animals associated with this sacred landscape have had, and in some societies continue to have, a particular cultural and religious meaning. Food crops and cultigens that sustained life and their associated preparation were often seen as a sacred act, with strong cultural associations to ethnic identity. Other plants have had direct associations to ritual and religious practices and were seen as sacred, reaffirming the diversity and complexity of Andean foodways and local cuisines. Anthropologists and archaeologists have documented the symbolic complexity of the natural world and the social importance of feasting, rituals and rites in contemporary and historical societies. Cultural perceptions and beliefs regarding the natural world and their associated plants and cuisines were subsequently modified to varying degrees by the Spanish conquest and introduction of foreign plants and animals. Contributions in this volume explore the art history and history to examine the roles of food through particular interdisciplinary lenses. Research from diverse regions of the cordillera further emphasize the diversity of Andean cultures. Contributions explore and analyze these topics in the context of historic and contemporary Andean culture, with examples of how domesticates, cuisines, their preparations, and basic ingredients continue to influence present day foodways and regional tastes.",,,The Latin American Studies Book Series,Andean Foodways,John E.

The social and cultural context of this region sets conditions for a natural existence of experiences related to C4D approaches. A reason for this might be the oral tradition of most Latin American cultures which has been based on their indigenous origins and forms of communication until now. Another factor that makes communication practices be linked to efforts to promote social change is the structural setting in several countries and the persistence of poverty conditions and unequal distribution of opportunities among the diverse social sectors. Despite the course of at least three moments of the presence of C4D in Latin America identified as development communication, development support communication, and alternative communication for democratic development, this approach is permanently modified by the presence of new social and collective actors, different resources, and means that allow this practice, as well as new social demands of the community. These experiences are, however, recovering the regional tradition of understanding the process of communication as an ethical, aesthetical, and political practice based on dialogue and participation to reach conditions for survival and social change. Contemporary Latin America presents new visions which have an impact on C4D paradigms of Communication for Living Well and the analysis of the decolonial approach in the field of communication.",,,,Handbook of Communication for Development and Social Change,Jan Servaes,,2020-06-09,2020,2020-06-09,2020,,,443-467,Closed,Chapter,"Aguirre Alvis, José Luis","Aguirre Alvis, José Luis (Department of Social Communication, Universidad Católica Boliviana “San Pablo”, La Paz, Bolivia)","Aguirre Alvis, José Luis (Universidad Católica Bolivia San Pablo)","Aguirre Alvis, José Luis (Universidad Católica Bolivia San Pablo)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128309985,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Cross-culture leadership is the dominant paradigm, and a large number of papers have been published on this concept. A more recent term in the literature is intercultural leadership. The literature reviewed on cross-cultural leadership research gives the impression that cultural differences exist only between countries or people from different nationalities, not within countries. Thus, the concept of cross-cultural leadership provides insights in multicultural settings, meaning international, but in populations trying to build a social fabric under the concept of intercultural societies, including indigenous and non-indigenous people, the concept of intercultural leadership offers a better framework to develop methods, training, and the like, needed for good governance. However, the conceptual framework of intercultural leadership is not well defined in the literature; sometimes, it overlaps with cross-cultural meaning. On the other hand, the indigenous approach to intercultural leadership is also missing in the literature. This article builds on concepts of culture, leadership, cross-culture, and intercultural views to examine the indigenous factor in the concept of intercultural leadership.",,,Management for Professionals,New Horizons in Positive Leadership and Change,"Satinder Dhiman, Joan Marques",,2020-03-12,2020,2020-03-12,2020,,,285-311,Closed,Chapter,"Rosado-May, Francisco J.; Cuevas-Albarrán, Valeria B.; Jimenez Pat, Nelsy F.","Rosado-May, Francisco J.

Many studies have focused on various aspects of Inca culture, on the major sites of the Empire, and on mapping the extensive Inca road system. Fewer studies address the varying use of plants at these major administrative centers. This present chapter presents the paleoethnobotanical investigations of the redistribution/administrative center, Khota Chullpa or the ancient site of Paria (Ce-01), and associated qollqas or storage structures (Ce-51) along the Inca highway in the Paria Basin, Department of Oruro, Bolivia. In particular, plant remains that indicate the subsistence strategies, as well as the use of possible hallucinogenic and medicinal plants. These plant remains provide a perspective on the functions of this administrative center as more than just a place to store and account for everyday economic goods like maize and potatoes.","The author would like to thank János Gyarmati and Álvaro and Carola Condarco Castellón for the opportunity to work with them at the site of Ancient Paria. Botanical analyses were conducted under the permit for the Paria Archaeological Project granted for a survey in 2004, and fieldwork and excavations in 2005/06 by the Bolivian Dirección Nacional de Arqueología (DINAR AUT. No. 27/04, 030/05, COM. EXT. 228/06). The fieldwork was funded by the Heinz Latin American Archaeology Program of the University of Pittsburgh. A more extensive version of this chapter with photographs was previously published in Gyarmati and Castellón (2014). I also thank Ernest Presher and Paula and Rinaldo Condarco during the 2006–08 field seasons. Also, thanks to Dr. Marc Bermann of the Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh, for his assistance in returning to Bolivia in the 2007/08 field seasons. Dr. Richard Jefferies of the Department of Anthropology, University of Kentucky, also kindly assisted with the photography of the botanical remains. Most of all, the author offers her sincere thanks to the extended Condarco family for their help and great hospitality while she stayed on their farm to conduct this research.

The importance that in the last decades have acquired the composite materials of metallic matrix with reinforcements of nano ceramic particles, not only for their extraordinary mechanical properties, finding applications in different branches of industrial technology such as automotive, naval, aerospace and others. This work aims to show how the hardening of this type of materials depends on: the type of reinforcement, the size and its characteristics, the interaction of the dislocations with the defects, the process of obtaining these materials and the grain size of the matrix for the materials obtained by fusion or the particle size for those obtained by sintered compacting.",We would like to thank the Technical University of the North for sponsoring the development of this research.,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Applied Technologies,"Miguel Botto-Tobar, Marcelo Zambrano Vizuete, Pablo Torres-Carrión, Sergio Montes León, Guillermo Pizarro Vásquez, Benjamin Durakovic",,2020-03-03,2020,2020-03-03,2020,1195,,346-358,Closed,Chapter,"Cardenas, Victor M.; Villarreal B., Carlos A.","Cardenas, Victor M.

The author has opted for a long chronological approach and a discussion of Black Consciousness before and after the Black Consciousness Movement (1968–1977), to emphasise the time-depth and longevity of its ideas. The chapter also stresses the significance of anticolonial struggles in the region for informing Black historical consciousness, as well as the independence of African countries that had been gathering pace from 1960, the so-called ‘year of Africa’. It is against this backdrop that perhaps the most infamous regime of white supremacy of the latter half of the twentieth century, the apartheid state, stood. The principles of self-worth and pride in blackness that the Black Consciousness activists would articulate from 1970 onwards echoed earlier traditions of thought and struggles in the country.",,,,Routledge Handbook of Pan-Africanism,Reiland Rabaka,,2020-04-30,2020,2020-04-30,,,,136-146,Closed,Chapter,"Macqueen, Ian","Macqueen, Ian ()",,"Macqueen, Ian ()",1,0,,3.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127256753,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

A major concern of these changes was to institutionalize quality management systems. However, these changes brought its own complexities. Key features of this complexity revolved around cooperation and information sharing in the university governance in spite of ideological differences. Using the concept of culture developed from a multi-theoretical approach and data collected from institutional documents available in the public domain, interviews with members of the university council, and surveys of university staff, the chapter examines the extent of the relationship between public tolerance and different stakeholders involved in the university governance. This is with a view to recommend the need for effective governance and quality management system based on the professionalization of governance practices and institutionalized quality management processes.",,,Advances in Higher Education and Professional Development,Quality Management Implementation in Higher Education,"Michael Sony, Kochu Therisa Karingada, Neeta Baporikar",,2020,2020,,,,,217-239,Closed,Chapter,"Afolabi, Olugbemiga Samuel; Omal, Felix","Afolabi, Olugbemiga Samuel (University of Johannesburg, South Africa & Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria); Omal, Felix (University of Johannesburg, South Africa)",,"Afolabi, Olugbemiga Samuel (Obafemi Awolowo University); Omal, Felix (University of Johannesburg)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120477646,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In Chile, the northern Atacama Desert is sensitive to changes induced by global warming, especially regarding precipitations. The very low level of annual precipitation experimented by this region makes that cities placed there are totally unprepared to face disruptive events, and climatological predictions show that the frequency of such events will increase, such as the intensity of the precipitations during the event. This chapter analyzes the case of the Antofagasta urban system, evaluating the environmental hazard, the social exposure, and the vulnerability to obtain a global risk evaluation of the system. Two neighborhoods exposed to flooding has been considered and studied by different ways, including climatological simulations, multiple criteria analysis, and interviews to assess risk perception of the inhabitants.",This work is part of a bachelor thesis developed by Eng.

In these scenarios, the efficient identification of conflicts is crucial. Junker’s QuickXPlain is a divide-and-conquer based algorithm for the determination of preferred minimal conflicts. Motivated by the increasing size and complexity of knowledge bases, we propose a parallelization of the original algorithm that helps to significantly improve runtime performance especially in complex knowledge bases. In this paper, we introduce a parallelized version of QuickXPlain that is based on the idea of predicting and executing parallel consistency checks needed by QuickXPlain.","This work has been partially funded by the EU FEDER program, the MINECO project OPHELIA (RTI2018-101204-B-C22); the TASOVA network (MCIU-AEI TIN2017-90644-REDT); and the Junta de Andalucia METAMORFOSIS project.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Foundations of Intelligent Systems,"Denis Helic, Gerhard Leitner, Martin Stettinger, Alexander Felfernig, Zbigniew W.

In this way, the implementation of good practices for sustainable soil management are essential to reverse their tendency to degradation as preventive measures and so, guarantee food security and protect the provision of different ecosystem services associated with the soil. The advent of the Sentinel and Landsat satellite programs provide free data sets with good spatial and temporal resolution that can be a valuable source of information for monitoring pasture resources. In order to evaluate this type of techniques, a time series (TS) was generated with images of the Landsat 8 (L8) OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor and a time series with images of the Sentinel-2 (S2), MSI (Multispectral Imager) sensor to determine the best results in the quantification of changes in the coverage of pastures at the Santa Mónica farm. In this study, pastures were analyzed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series obtained from median quarterly mosaics obtained in 2019. Different samples were drawn that represent the change trend throughout the time series and were classified according to their degree of change and persistence in the series. The results indicate that the densification of the time series allows to provide better results in the quantification of the changes and dynamics of the coverage. The established methodology represents a great advance on the generation of images and the monitoring and detection of changes in coverage through time series [22]. Hence, it is one the first studies carried out in the country that incorporate this type of process. It was concluded that the determination of spectral signatures with the index used together with the near infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR 1) spectral bands, allow to extract values and intervals where the change produced by pastures is identified with an acceptable level of accuracy.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2020,"Osvaldo Gervasi, Beniamino Murgante, Sanjay Misra, Chiara Garau, Ivan Blečić, David Taniar, Bernady O.

The proposed model considers the forecast, in addition to the historical quantitative data of the share price, the inclusion of qualitative macroeconomic factors that significantly influence the behavior of the time series of the stock markets. It is about harnessing the ability of artificial neural networks to work with nonlinear quantitative data and their capacity for learning and also take advantage of the fuzzy logic technique to simulate the way of reasoning of human beings by defining judgment rules or knowledge base and their evaluation through inference mechanisms.

It influences biodiversity at different levels, including zooplankton, which is a key component of aquatic communities and plays a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine planktonic food webs as a major link between pelagic primary producers and planktivorous. The effect of OA on the fitness of individual zooplanktonic species has been reported by many studies mostly developed under laboratory conditions. In this context, this chapter reviews the OA effects on zooplankton and describes the potential of natural shallow-water CO2 vents as in situ laboratories. The impact on zooplankton assemblages is shown from a study in the North Atlantic (Azores islands) and the suitability of this area for future studies on marine organisms and ecosystems. Sites with naturally elevated CO2 conditions are described, including which variables and limitations must be considered. Results shown are highly relevant to improve our predictions of the responses of zooplankton to climate change stressors including OA. Future studies including long-term multigenerational exposure to multiple stressors (e.g. increased pCO2 and food shortage) are a priority to understand the adaptation capacity of common species and how the zooplankton communities will shift.

It influences biodiversity at different levels, including zooplankton, which is a key component of aquatic communities and plays a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine planktonic food webs as a major link between pelagic primary producers and planktivorous. This chapter reviews the OA effects on zooplankton and describes the potential of natural shallow-water CO2 vents as in situ laboratories. Patterns of variation in zooplanktonic assemblage structure along the CO2 gradient in each island were analysed by multivariate statistical methods. Copepods were the most abundant component of zooplankton, the main species being calanoids as Paracalanus parvus or Centropages typicus.","This work was part of the project MOFETA (EXPL/MAR-EST/0604/2013), funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).

Aqueous mediums based on distilled water and different initial concentrations of Cr3+, with a dose of 10 g of adsorbent per liter, were used. The residual concentrations of Cr3+ were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, obtaining optimum values of pH of 2.9, the adsorbent particle size of 300 µm, and stirring rate of 300 rpm, for Cr3+ removal. Kinetic studies indicate a chemical adsorption process, with the best adjustment to pseudo-second-order models (R2 ≥ 0.9973), a contact time of 120 min to reach the adsorbent-Cr3+ equilibrium, and a good fit to the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.9291), with an adsorption intensity n of 1.5876.

The African indigenous knowledge incorporates health concepts and needs evolved from beliefs, attitudes, customs, methods and established practices for improving human health conditions and elevating the quality of human life. For explanatory models, African indigenous health care knowledge subscribes to a predominantly metaphysical explanation and places a high premium on the roles of social and spiritual conditions, power relations and societal institutional arrangements in the conceptualization of ideal human functioning as well as associated help-seeking behaviours. By African cultural perspectives, health and ill-health are multidimensional and are socially constructed. African traditional health care delivery is holistic with intervention for the promotion health and treatment of ill-health incorporating techniques with potential roles of facilitating increased well-being, in one or more of the levels of the body, mind, emotions and the spirit.

Tongoy Bay is a high biological productive area that supports an important artisanal benthic fishery. The highest catch take place in the late 1990s, since then Tongoy Bay has been under a fishing control regime, as a consequence of the Implementation of Territorial Uses Rights for Fisheries (TURFs), showing signs of improvement in the health status of whole communities. To establish the level of sustainability in long term of the benthic ecosystem, three stationary trophic models (using Ecopath) were building for the years 1992, 2002 and 2012. Fisheries management strategies were evaluated for economic and ecological objectives through dynamic trophic models (Ecosim), which were optimized based on changes in fishing mortality of the exploited resources. The main result showed that high fishing mortality rates are associated with greater economic value but have negatively effect on the structure of the ecosystem. Conversely, giving greater weight to ecological objectives results in strong negative effects on economic objectives. The evaluation of both criteria simultaneously allows establishing criteria that responds to optimum results for both criteria used. However, the optimization responses of both objective functions were notably affected by the ecosystem health condition of each year/model. In 1992, for which the lowest health ecosystem was established, showed a lower ecological sustainability and low potential for economic optimization compared to the year 2012, which presented a better ecosystem condition. We concluded that sustainability and optimization based on the potential of ecological and economic is a condition related by the degree of exploitation in benthic ecosystem. Therefore, before seeking to optimize the productivity of the system, its health should be recovered.",This research was supported from Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT).

Bioarchaeology, formally defined in 1977, has changed this approach by developing a robust scientific discipline, which relies heavily on the biocultural nature of skeletal remains as well as external theoretical frameworks that help contextualize the information retrieved from them. As the introduction to this volume, this chapter presents the main theoretical discussions that contributed to the formation of bioarchaeology (e.g., the New Archaeology, New Physical Anthropology, and biocultural approach). Taking into account these contributions, this chapter reviews the extent to which bioarchaeology has become a more analytical and theoretical discipline and highlights the importance for the discipline to continue incorporating broader theoretical frameworks from both biological and social sciences.",,,,Theoretical Approaches in Bioarchaeology,"Colleen M Cheverko, Julia R Prince-Buitenhuys, Mark Hubbe",,2020-08-20,2020,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,,1-14,Closed,Chapter,"Cheverko, Colleen M; Prince-Buitenhuys, Julia R; Hubbe, Mark","Cheverko, Colleen M (Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe Campus); Prince-Buitenhuys, Julia R (Division of Environmental Services, California Department of Water Resources); Hubbe, Mark (Department of Anthropology, The Ohio State University and Instituto de Arqueología y Antropología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Cheverko, Colleen M (Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe Campus); Prince-Buitenhuys, Julia R (Division of Environmental Services, California Department of Water Resources); Hubbe, Mark (Catholic University of the North)",4,1,,3.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129781882,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology",

We aimed to build a model that was balanced (Ecopath) and spatially-explicit (Ecospace) to assess the application of different management strategies on the ecosystem. The spatial model for Banco Chinchorro reef distinguished the following five subsystems: Cueva de Tiburones, La Caldera, La Baliza, El Colorado, and El Chankay. Outcomes showed that benthic autotrophs comprised of the highest biomass in the whole system, followed by small benthic epifauna and sponges. Concerning ecosystem growth and development, Banco Chinchorro reef achieved a Total System Throughput of 144,980.7 g ww m−2 year−1, an Ascendency of 184,988.0 g ww m−2 year−1*bit, and a Development Capacity equal to 304,287.4 g ww m−2 year−1*bits. The A/C and Ov/C ratios reached 40.69% and 59.31%, respectively. The mean trophic level of the catch was estimated as 3.09, indicating that fishing is concentrated on species located at a high trophic level. Spatial-dynamic simulations showed that exploitation exerted separately, by subsystem, resulted in higher direct and indirect effects than fishing throughout the whole ecosystem. These results suggest that habitat rotation for harvest would not be advised.","This study was financed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-México, the Comisión Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP), and Universidad de Guadalajara.

These multiple benefits suggest that woody perennials, such as trees and shrubs, could contribute to a regenerative agricultural landscape that lessens poverty and malnutrition in marginalized communities. In this chapter, we review beneficial insects and their ecological significance in human-modified landscapes. Insects should not be written off as insect pest species by the education, agricultural or policy sectors. Rather, the ecosystem services provided by beneficial insects and their associated habitat should be left intact in agricultural and urban settings. In the case of insects that are both beneficial and harmful to food production, their promotion as food to areas where insect cuisine is unknown in conjunction with sustainable farming methods should be considered.",This contribution was possible due to funding from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa.

Higher temperature in cities are involved in many processes and have impacts on energy needs, thermal comfort, public health and air pollution. Especially in tropical climates, where temperature and humidity ranges are high per se, the impact of urbanization processes can be even deeper.

This chapter highlights over 15 years of microbial ecology research conducted in this fascinating system covering microbial diversity, microbial adaptation to extreme conditions, and the role of microbes in biogeochemical cycles, including the recycling of greenhouse gases. Salar de Huasco is representative of other active saline wetlands in the same area harboring a high biodiversity. The important spatial and temporal variability of this ecosystem configure a unique environment for the study of the diversity and function of microbial communities. Salar de Huasco supports very high microbial diversity: studies so far have identified the presence of more than 50% of all bacterial phyla and the three archaeal superphylum described globally. Eukaryotic communities have been less studied, but recent efforts have highlighted their high endemism in Salar de Huasco. Microbial communities have been shown to play an active role in nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycles, intensely recycling greenhouse gases and representing a source of CH4, CO2, and a sink of N2O in this ecosystem. It has become apparent that microbial communities in the salar are highly adapted to polyextreme conditions, allowing them to withstand simultaneous environmental stressors, including extremely high solar radiation, salinity, and marked diel shifts in temperature. The production of compatible solutes within the microbial community plays a key role as a protection mechanism against such harmful conditions. Notwithstanding the concerted efforts by both our group and other colleagues to understand the dynamic of the microbiome in Salar de Huasco, many unsolved questions remain, especially regarding biological and ecological interactions within the microbial communities, as well as other temporal and spatial factors. Evaporitic basins in the Andes are currently under marked threat, largely due to extraction of water to support mining, and there is an urgent and pressing need to preserve and conserve this still understudied environment.","A large number of people and institutions have collaborated with us over the past decade, contributing with sampling, fruitful discussions, and good science.

This intimate practice involved binding the head of infants with long cloths and occasionally with pillows or boards for what seems to have been a period of even years. Through this constant pressure and constriction, individuals were able to obtain a variety of alterations to natural head shape. In this chapter, I consider ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources that speak to the practice of intentionally binding the heads of children in the pre-Columbian and colonial Americas. I integrate this information with a large-scale study of the skeletal evidence for this custom in northern Chile and concomitant evidence for related injury or chronic conditions. Landa, among other chroniclers of the Spanish conquest, speaks to strong pain and even death affecting infants in the Aztec world as a result of modifying the head; others only address the myriad forms and the strangeness of this custom. My analyses of the crania of well over 1,000 individuals show no clear ties to chronic conditions such as arthritis or TMJ nor evidence that the pressure of this practice caused skull fractures. While the physical ramifications of this choice are prominent and permanent, overall, textual, and material evidence suggests that what pain there was, was tolerable and normalized, by the infants and children, but more notably by the adults imposing this practice. Ultimately, the overall goal of modifying head shape superseded the discomfort of the act.","This chapter derives from over a decade of work at the Instituto de Arqueología y Antropología and Museo Le Paige of the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile, and their ongoing support is always appreciated, particularly that of former Curators of Physical Anthropology María Antonietta Costa Junqueira and Mark Hubbe.

In Antarctica only one species possess floating structures (gas-filled vesicles), the brown seaweed Cystosphaera jacquinotti. However, other species such as Durvillaea antarctica and Macrocystis pyrifera that form abundant forests around the sub-Antarctic islands can also remain at the sea surface once detached, providing a potential dispersal mechanism not only for the seaweeds but also for the associated biota. Additionally, recent reports indicate that floating D. antarctica can reach the Antarctic continent from sub-Antarctic regions. Herein, we collect information about floating and drifting seaweeds in Antarctica, but also their biology, physiology, and distribution within the sub-Antarctic sources. Up to now, only a few species have been recorded floating in Antarctica, and mainly during the first Antartic explorations. So far, most of the studies on detached seaweeds only highlight their importance, when already stranded and serving as carbon sources for benthic communities. However, some seaweed species are able to handle present sea surface conditions in Antarctica and thus in the future when higher temperatures, less ice and more available substrate are available, they might be able to frequently travel and colonize this region, thereby representing an important dispersal mode.","We thank the editors for inviting us to contribute to this review.

Despite their essential ecological role, in the last years kelp forests have been heavily exploited and disturbed by artisanal fishing, inducing drastic changes in such benthic communities and altering the structure and functioning of ecosystem properties. The kelp forest ecosystem gives shelter to a rich community of interacting species. Therefore, any natural or anthropogenic perturbation will affect, directly or indirectly, several components of their interaction network. This can be monitored by holistic, macroscopic indicators. Multispecies trophic network analyses allow us (1) to identify core species or functional groups that play key roles in these ecosystems, named as Keystone Species Complex (KSC) and (2) to quantify macroscopic properties of ecosystems that quantify structure, organisation and health. For the former task, we perform topological analysis and identify the most central sets of nodes. For the latter task, we compute Ascendency, based on thermodynamic laws and information theory and Loop Analysis, based on semi-quantitative community matrices. Using these frameworks, we contribute to the improvement of the current management strategies of artisanal fisheries, conservation and monitoring programmes.","The information used for this study was obtained via the grants INNOVA-CORFO 05CR11IXM-03 (Región de Atacama, Chile) and 09CN14-5873 (Región de Antofagasta, Chile).

It is associated with coastal upwelling which generates a very productive ecosystem. However, due to a variety of interconnected biophysical processes at diverse temporal and spatial scales, production varies greatly in time and space. The interplay of the biophysical environment, biological processes involving valuable resources on international markets, the socio-political context, and some management decisions, has shaped the daily life of the HCLME fisheries, marked by booms and busts, offering wealth for short periods of time, followed by collapses. These collapses are generally interpreted as the consequence of a lack of appropriate management, so that a variety of increasingly stricter regulations have been implemented. Nevertheless, this has not significantly reduced the temporal variability of the fisheries landings, which is broadly characterized by a peaks and troughs pattern. While the HCLME is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on Earth, along with a great biophysical and biological variability, it is also a huge but fragile exploited social-ecological system. Modelers can help to understand how to continuously adapt in order to deal with recurrent fisheries “crises,” which, as we are beginning to learn, may simply be an expression of the variability inherent in this complex system.

This is largely attributable to oceanic pathways that transfer ENSO‐associated anomalies around the Pacific and into other basins. While the impact of atmospheric teleconnections occurs over days to weeks, oceanic teleconnections permit a memory of anomalous air‐sea coupling during ENSO to persist months to years. ENSO‐generated ocean perturbations are transmitted to remote regions by planetary waves. Equatorial Kelvin waves generated by intraseasonal western Pacific wind bursts travel along the equator to the eastern basin and excite coastally trapped waves that extend ENSO's reach to high latitudes along the American coastlines. Rossby waves that either radiate from the coast with the passage of these Kelvin waves or are generated in the ocean interior by ENSO‐related wind anomalies propagate signals westward across the basin, rapidly altering tropical circulation and affecting subtropical gyres. At the leaky western boundary, the waves excited by ENSO radiate and scatter through the Indonesian seas to enter the Indian Ocean.

This is within awareness of metacognitive application of critical thinking that transforms prior obtained frame of reference. It also ignites, without imposing, critical self-reflection as a deliberate cognitive activity on experiences that bring about perspective transformation. Ironically, that school counselling continues to be less regarded as a management role in schools is a misconstrued perspective that not only disadvantages the pupil but also alienates counsellors while also deflating effectiveness of teaching efforts. The teaching and learning process is a collaborative effort that can only succeed when existing school's networks are utilised in the most effective manner especially for a transformative and democratic education. This chapter explores avenues of school counselling along post-constructivist perspectives determining a democratic pupil as sought to be a change catalyst for good citizenship in the society.",,,"Advances in Educational Marketing, Administration, and Leadership",Addressing Multicultural Needs in School Guidance and Counseling,Simon George Taukeni,,2020,2020,,,,,292-338,Closed,Chapter,"Mafu, Noxolo","Mafu, Noxolo (Vaal University of Technology, South Africa)",,"Mafu, Noxolo (Vaal University of Technology)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121224701,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems; 44 Human Society","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

125,pub.1132375152,10.1163/9789004435315_002,,,Introduction,"George Bancroft (1800–1891) was an influential statesman, historian and educator. He was one of the first Americans to attend the University of Göttingen as a young man in order to master multiple academic disciplines and educational techniques that the young United States needed. At Göttingen, Bancroft became fascinated by German constitutional theory and history, their connection to politics and human geography, and the forerunners of German legal science. After his return to the United States, Bancroft translated into English books by Arnold Heeren, his former professor. Bancroft also set up a school and adopted German teaching methods at Round Hill in Northampton, Massachusetts, employed German scholars, and intensely engaged Göttingen academics and other Americans who looked to Germany for pedagogic and constitutional inspiration. A close reading of Bancroft’s translations and correspondence suggests that this was not a one-way exchange. Bancroft was instrumental not only in importing German texts and practices into the United States, but also formulated American notions of progress, abolitionism and state-systems that in turn shaped the so-called Göttingen School. Citizenship is and has for a long time been a core component of constitutional theory. The rebirth of citizenship in the quattrocento in Northern Italy from classical Greek and Roman sources of inspiration demonstrates its salience, as does the importance citizenship had in French Revolutionary thinking. In general, citizenship constitutes a reciprocal relationship between the citizen and the polity with a set of fundamental rights and obligations. These might include the right to vote for representative assemblies, the right to free movement within the territory of the state and the obligation to bear arms when required by law. However, the relationship between a state and the citizens of its overseas territories challenges the basic model of citizenship. Contrasting the approaches of the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the rights of citizens of overseas territories sheds light on the meaning and contours of citizenship in constitutional theory and law. Located at a crossroads between politics and law, constitutional preambles often represent the outcome of debates between different political forces over the founding principles of the Constitution. The discussions that took place during the drafting of the Preamble to the Ukrainian Constitution provide an insightful case study of this phenomenon. Influenced by its Soviet past and an unstable political environment, Ukraine has seen severe struggles among the political parties in order to reach an agreement over issues of particular sensitivity to the nation. By examining the case of Ukraine and its 1996 Constitution, this chapter also aims to contribute to the debate concerning the legal value of constitutional preambles. While stressing the theme of ‘good faith’ and surveying the decisions and opinions of courts and scholars in Hong Kong, this article delves into the issue of interpretation of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and explains why, in the face of a breach of the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong resulting from the exercise of illegal interpretative power by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, it is about time for the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong to forcefully re-assert its power of constitutional control over the actions of the Standing Committee. This chapter examines the separation of powers and forms of government in North Africa and the Middle East following the ‘Arab Spring’ and shows that most Arab constitutions still guarantee (albeit to a lesser extent than in the past) an extremely high concentration of power in the hands of the Head of State, thus favouring the continuation in office of illiberal regimes. This weak separation of powers is due to different reasons, including the constitutional tradition, the top-down constitution-making processes and the external influences. The only notable exception (at least for the moment) is Tunisia, which is already at an advanced stage in the process of democratization. This chapter compares constitutional institutions that political thinkers in Revolutionary France, early nineteenth-century Spain, and Mexico devised with the aim of protecting constitutional order from abuses by one or more of the branches of government. The chapter focuses on two different types of historical institutions: those with moderating powers and those with conserving powers. Moderating institutions acted as buffers between legislative and executive authorities to prevent either from encroaching upon the prerogatives of the other. Conservative institutions undid unconstitutional actions and supervised constitutional order. The chapter shows that Mexicans were well-acquainted with the constitutional debates surrounding both types of institutions in France and Spain. It demonstrates that Mexican politicians not only endorsed these two types of institutions in their constitutional plans, but also reworked them to create an innovative institution of constitutional control in the 1836 Mexico Constitution: the Supreme Conservative Power. This chapter offers both a genealogy and a critique of the Portuguese system of judicial review of legislation, which blends elements of American-style diffuse control carried out by the ordinary courts and European-style concentrated control carried out by a specialized constitutional court. The genealogy suggests an unorthodox explanation of the peculiarly mixed character of the system. The critique identifies three principal flaws of the system and argues that it should be reformed. The judicial review of constitutional amendments in Colombia has evolved through the activism of constitutional judges rather than the texts of the Constitutions. In times of judicial crisis and reform to the judiciary it becomes more interesting because the constitutional judges have reviewed amendments regarding the judicial branch, as several of them have been declared unconstitutional during the last four decades. This chapter tells the trajectory of the review of constitutional amendments to the Judiciary, suggesting that one of the factors that could explain these rulings is the defence of the judicial branch by the constitutional judges. In this way, it tells the interdependency between politics and Law on the decisions that have limited the power of the Congress to reform the Judiciary, by the Supreme Court, between 1978 and 1991; as well as by the Constitutional Court as of the Constitution of 1991. Individual access to constitutional justice can take many forms. One of the most prominent examples is the individual constitutional complaint. In many constitutional courts, the constitutional complaint has become the key method for individuals to assert constitutional claims. In Germany, constitutional complaint is very well established and it extends to complaints against judicial judgments. This chapter examines individual access to constitutional justice in South Korea and Taiwan. Although the legal systems of both countries have been heavily influenced by German constitutional practices, constitutional complaint against judicial judgments is explicitly prohibited in Korea; in Taiwan such a possibility was only officially introduced in 2019 and awaits implementation in 2022. By comparatively tracing and analysing the constitutional conditions, and nature and evolution of the mechanism of individual constitutional complaint in South Korea and Taiwan, this chapter aims to shed light on variations and convergences in individual access to constitutional justice in East Asia.",,,,Comparative Constitutional History,"Francesco Biagi, Justin O.

            The origins of animal domestication and crop farming in southern Africa remain poorly understood given the limited research done and the assumption that such processes did not originally take place in the region but, rather, derived from other regions of the continent or the world, for example, maize. However, southern African biomes are unique and thus different from those of North Africa and the Western Asia associated with early forms of agriculture. What needs to be established is whether there existed forms of food production among Stone Age populations prior to the introduction of crops and domestic animals from elsewhere, given the region’s complex fauna and flora.",,,,Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology,Claire Smith,,2020-10-26,2020,2020-10-26,2020,,,10044-10048,Closed,Chapter,"Pikirayi, Innocent","Pikirayi, Innocent (Faculty of Humanities, Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa)","Pikirayi, Innocent (University of Pretoria)","Pikirayi, Innocent (University of Pretoria)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132038266,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",2 Zero Hunger

Human objects in outer space and the presence of cultural resources on celestial bodies, especially the Moon, mandate a preservation strategy now. The material culture of exploration of space and the Moon are part of the heritage of the Cold War. The field of Space Archaeology and Heritage recognizes this extraordinary period called the “Space Age” with all its technological, scientific, political, and social complexities as a critically important area for study. Within the last 60 years, space has become part of the cultural landscape of human history on Earth. It deserves the same archaeological investigation as all other significant periods of human prehistory and history. Because space is an extraterrestrial global commons with increasing commercial and national presence, humanity’s important sites and artifacts demand new international agreements which will preserve them for future generations.",This entry has been written thanks to grants from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE) and the financial support of the Beatrice de Cardi funds of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

            Human objects in outer space and the presence of cultural resources on celestial bodies, especially the Moon, mandate a preservation strategy now. The material culture of exploration of space and the Moon are part of the heritage of the Cold War. The field of Space Archaeology and Heritage recognizes this extraordinary period called the “Space Age” with all its technological, scientific, political, and social complexities as a critically important area for study. Within the last 60 years, space has become part of the cultural landscape of human history on Earth. It deserves the same archaeological investigation as all other significant periods of human prehistory and history. Because space is an extraterrestrial global commons with increasing commercial and national presence, humanity’s important sites and artifacts demand new international agreements which will preserve them for future generations.",,,,Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology,Claire Smith,,2020-10-26,2020,2020-10-26,2020,,,10105-10112,Closed,Chapter,"O’Leary, Beth Laura","O’Leary, Beth Laura (Department of Anthropology, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA)","O’Leary, Beth Laura (New Mexico State University)","O’Leary, Beth Laura (New Mexico State University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132035198,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies; 4303 Historical Studies",

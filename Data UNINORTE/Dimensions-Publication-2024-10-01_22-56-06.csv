This book presents a collection of frontline research on Latin-American coastal marine ecosystem models, written mostly by Latin-American authors. Linking parts to the whole, ecosystem models show large-scale, holistic approaches for better understanding human impact on these complex ecological systems, ranging from the North-East Pacific to the South-East Pacific and Mexican Caribbean coastal areas. In this chapter, we present an overview and synthesis regarding the information presented in each previous chapter, highlighting the relevant aspects and their implications for the conservation, management, and monitoring of coastal marine ecosystems. We also include a general analysis regarding the advances in marine ecological modelling in Latin America within a global context. Finally, we outline and discuss the perspectives of the systems-based view on conservation biology and marine fisheries management.",,,,Marine Coastal Ecosystems Modelling and Conservation,"Marco Ortiz, Ferenc Jordán",,2020-12-17,2020,2020-12-17,2021,,,203-207,Closed,Chapter,"Ortiz, Marco; Jordán, Ferenc","Ortiz, Marco (Laboratorio de Modelamiento de Sistemas Ecológicos Complejos (LAMSEC), Instituto Antofagasta, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile; Instituto de Ciencias Naturales Alexander von Humboldt, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Recursos Biológicos, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile; Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Jordán, Ferenc (Balaton Limnological Institute, Centre for Ecological Research, Tihany, Hungary; Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Napoli, Italy)","Ortiz, Marco (University of Antofagasta; University of Antofagasta; Catholic University of the North)","Ortiz, Marco (University of Antofagasta; University of Antofagasta; Catholic University of the North); Jordán, Ferenc (Balaton Limnological Institute; Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn)",3,0,,0.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133575514,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law,14 Life Below Water

Tongoy Bay is a high biological productive area that supports an important artisanal benthic fishery. The highest catch take place in the late 1990s, since then Tongoy Bay has been under a fishing control regime, as a consequence of the Implementation of Territorial Uses Rights for Fisheries (TURFs), showing signs of improvement in the health status of whole communities. To establish the level of sustainability in long term of the benthic ecosystem, three stationary trophic models (using Ecopath) were building for the years 1992, 2002 and 2012. Fisheries management strategies were evaluated for economic and ecological objectives through dynamic trophic models (Ecosim), which were optimized based on changes in fishing mortality of the exploited resources. The main result showed that high fishing mortality rates are associated with greater economic value but have negatively effect on the structure of the ecosystem. Conversely, giving greater weight to ecological objectives results in strong negative effects on economic objectives. The evaluation of both criteria simultaneously allows establishing criteria that responds to optimum results for both criteria used. However, the optimization responses of both objective functions were notably affected by the ecosystem health condition of each year/model. In 1992, for which the lowest health ecosystem was established, showed a lower ecological sustainability and low potential for economic optimization compared to the year 2012, which presented a better ecosystem condition. We concluded that sustainability and optimization based on the potential of ecological and economic is a condition related by the degree of exploitation in benthic ecosystem. Therefore, before seeking to optimize the productivity of the system, its health should be recovered.",This research was supported from Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT).

We aimed to build a model that was balanced (Ecopath) and spatially-explicit (Ecospace) to assess the application of different management strategies on the ecosystem. The spatial model for Banco Chinchorro reef distinguished the following five subsystems: Cueva de Tiburones, La Caldera, La Baliza, El Colorado, and El Chankay. Outcomes showed that benthic autotrophs comprised of the highest biomass in the whole system, followed by small benthic epifauna and sponges. Concerning ecosystem growth and development, Banco Chinchorro reef achieved a Total System Throughput of 144,980.7 g ww m−2 year−1, an Ascendency of 184,988.0 g ww m−2 year−1*bit, and a Development Capacity equal to 304,287.4 g ww m−2 year−1*bits. The A/C and Ov/C ratios reached 40.69% and 59.31%, respectively. The mean trophic level of the catch was estimated as 3.09, indicating that fishing is concentrated on species located at a high trophic level. Spatial-dynamic simulations showed that exploitation exerted separately, by subsystem, resulted in higher direct and indirect effects than fishing throughout the whole ecosystem. These results suggest that habitat rotation for harvest would not be advised.","This study was financed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-México, the Comisión Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP), and Universidad de Guadalajara.

Despite their essential ecological role, in the last years kelp forests have been heavily exploited and disturbed by artisanal fishing, inducing drastic changes in such benthic communities and altering the structure and functioning of ecosystem properties. The kelp forest ecosystem gives shelter to a rich community of interacting species. Therefore, any natural or anthropogenic perturbation will affect, directly or indirectly, several components of their interaction network. This can be monitored by holistic, macroscopic indicators. Multispecies trophic network analyses allow us (1) to identify core species or functional groups that play key roles in these ecosystems, named as Keystone Species Complex (KSC) and (2) to quantify macroscopic properties of ecosystems that quantify structure, organisation and health. For the former task, we perform topological analysis and identify the most central sets of nodes. For the latter task, we compute Ascendency, based on thermodynamic laws and information theory and Loop Analysis, based on semi-quantitative community matrices.

It is associated with coastal upwelling which generates a very productive ecosystem. However, due to a variety of interconnected biophysical processes at diverse temporal and spatial scales, production varies greatly in time and space. The interplay of the biophysical environment, biological processes involving valuable resources on international markets, the socio-political context, and some management decisions, has shaped the daily life of the HCLME fisheries, marked by booms and busts, offering wealth for short periods of time, followed by collapses. These collapses are generally interpreted as the consequence of a lack of appropriate management, so that a variety of increasingly stricter regulations have been implemented. Nevertheless, this has not significantly reduced the temporal variability of the fisheries landings, which is broadly characterized by a peaks and troughs pattern. While the HCLME is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on Earth, along with a great biophysical and biological variability, it is also a huge but fragile exploited social-ecological system. Modelers can help to understand how to continuously adapt in order to deal with recurrent fisheries “crises,” which, as we are beginning to learn, may simply be an expression of the variability inherent in this complex system. Furthermore, it is essential to increase our capacity to adapt to the expected consequences of climate change.",,,,Marine Coastal Ecosystems Modelling and Conservation,"Marco Ortiz, Ferenc Jordán",,2020-12-17,2020,2020-12-17,2021,,,27-51,Closed,Chapter,"Chevallier, Adrien; Stotz, Wolfgang; Ramos, Marcel; Mendo, Jaime","Chevallier, Adrien (Grupo de Ecología y Manejo de Recursos (Ecolmar), Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Stotz, Wolfgang (Grupo de Ecología y Manejo de Recursos (Ecolmar), Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena, Chile); Ramos, Marcel (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Núcleo Milenio de Ecología y Manejo Sustentable de Islas Oceánicas (ESMOI), Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Innovación Acuícola Aquapacífico, Coquimbo, Chile); Mendo, Jaime (Departamento Académico de Manejo Pesquero y Medio Ambiente, Facultad de Pesquería, Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina, Lima, Peru)","Stotz, Wolfgang (Catholic University of the North; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena, Chile)","Chevallier, Adrien (Catholic University of the North); Stotz, Wolfgang (Catholic University of the North; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena, Chile); Ramos, Marcel (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Innovación Acuícola Aquapacífico, Coquimbo, Chile); Mendo, Jaime (National Agrarian University)",7,3,,2.8,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133571748,31 Biological Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law,14 Life Below Water

Aqueous mediums based on distilled water and different initial concentrations of Cr3+, with a dose of 10 g of adsorbent per liter, were used. The residual concentrations of Cr3+ were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, obtaining optimum values of pH of 2.9, the adsorbent particle size of 300 µm, and stirring rate of 300 rpm, for Cr3+ removal. Kinetic studies indicate a chemical adsorption process, with the best adjustment to pseudo-second-order models (R2 ≥ 0.9973), a contact time of 120 min to reach the adsorbent-Cr3+ equilibrium, and a good fit to the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.9291), with an adsorption intensity n of 1.5876.

Food crops and cultigens that sustained life and their associated preparation were often seen as a sacred act, with strong cultural associations to ethnic identity. Other plants have had direct associations to ritual and religious practices and were seen as sacred, reaffirming the diversity and complexity of Andean foodways and local cuisines. Anthropologists and archaeologists have documented the symbolic complexity of the natural world and the social importance of feasting, rituals and rites in contemporary and historical societies. Cultural perceptions and beliefs regarding the natural world and their associated plants and cuisines were subsequently modified to varying degrees by the Spanish conquest and introduction of foreign plants and animals. Contributions in this volume explore the art history and history to examine the roles of food through particular interdisciplinary lenses. Research from diverse regions of the cordillera further emphasize the diversity of Andean cultures. Contributions explore and analyze these topics in the context of historic and contemporary Andean culture, with examples of how domesticates, cuisines, their preparations, and basic ingredients continue to influence present day foodways and regional tastes.",,,The Latin American Studies Book Series,Andean Foodways,John E.

Many studies have focused on various aspects of Inca culture, on the major sites of the Empire, and on mapping the extensive Inca road system. Fewer studies address the varying use of plants at these major administrative centers. This present chapter presents the paleoethnobotanical investigations of the redistribution/administrative center, Khota Chullpa or the ancient site of Paria (Ce-01), and associated qollqas or storage structures (Ce-51) along the Inca highway in the Paria Basin, Department of Oruro, Bolivia. In particular, plant remains that indicate the subsistence strategies, as well as the use of possible hallucinogenic and medicinal plants. These plant remains provide a perspective on the functions of this administrative center as more than just a place to store and account for everyday economic goods like maize and potatoes.","The author would like to thank János Gyarmati and Álvaro and Carola Condarco Castellón for the opportunity to work with them at the site of Ancient Paria. Botanical analyses were conducted under the permit for the Paria Archaeological Project granted for a survey in 2004, and fieldwork and excavations in 2005/06 by the Bolivian Dirección Nacional de Arqueología (DINAR AUT.

It influences biodiversity at different levels, including zooplankton, which is a key component of aquatic communities and plays a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine planktonic food webs as a major link between pelagic primary producers and planktivorous. The effect of OA on the fitness of individual zooplanktonic species has been reported by many studies mostly developed under laboratory conditions. In this context, this chapter reviews the OA effects on zooplankton and describes the potential of natural shallow-water CO2 vents as in situ laboratories. The impact on zooplankton assemblages is shown from a study in the North Atlantic (Azores islands) and the suitability of this area for future studies on marine organisms and ecosystems. Sites with naturally elevated CO2 conditions are described, including which variables and limitations must be considered. Results shown are highly relevant to improve our predictions of the responses of zooplankton to climate change stressors including OA. Future studies including long-term multigenerational exposure to multiple stressors (e.g. increased pCO2 and food shortage) are a priority to understand the adaptation capacity of common species and how the zooplankton communities will shift. Rising atmospheric CO2 alters the ocean biochemistry in the process known as ocean acidification (OA). It influences biodiversity at different levels, including zooplankton, which is a key component of aquatic communities and plays a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine planktonic food webs as a major link between pelagic primary producers and planktivorous. This chapter reviews the OA effects on zooplankton and describes the potential of natural shallow-water CO2 vents as in situ laboratories. Patterns of variation in zooplanktonic assemblage structure along the CO2 gradient in each island were analysed by multivariate statistical methods. Copepods were the most abundant component of zooplankton, the main species being calanoids as Paracalanus parvus or Centropages typicus.","This work was part of the project MOFETA (EXPL/MAR-EST/0604/2013), funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).

In this chapter we present the first consistent formal quantitative analysis of the regional dimension of that story. By putting together estimations of the provincial Gross Domestic Products (GDPs) for ten benchmark years between 1895 and 2004, we confirm the paramount importance of the city of Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires in the national economy since the end of the nineteenth century. We also add new insights about the evolution of regional disparities: first, there is a remarkable persistence in the relative positions of the provinces along the whole period under analysis; second, this persistence is mainly due to the fact that the high levels of income per capita in some provinces of Patagonia and in Capital Federal—relative to provinces in the North—is a feature that is defined since the nineteenth century. Third, the explanation of a large share of regional inequality is related to high productivity generated by abundance of natural resources in some areas of Pampa Húmeda and Patagonia and by increasing returns in manufacturing and services in Capital Federal.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

We use regional economic data from several academic and official sources to study the patterns of economic growth through most of the century. We conclude that Colombian regions did not converge during this time. Although poorer regions grew at faster rates, the dispersion of regional per capita GDP did not decrease. We argue that geographic conditions led to an early development of isolated markets that concentrated in the central regions of the country, and their integration to regional markets through the construction of railroads and highways occurred late in comparison to other Latin American countries. However, this process reinforced the concentration of economic activity due to the reduction of transport costs and the presence of economies of scale. Moreover, the implementation of import substitution policies during the second half of the century benefited industrial economies located in the center of the country, increasing their advantage over peripheral areas. As a result, the economic development of both coastal regions, Pacific and the Caribbean, lagged behind those regions located in the center. We believe that this historical perspective contributes to a better understanding of current regional economic inequalities in Colombia and their persistence over time.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

Argentina, for instance, experienced rapid growth until World War I, following an export-led model, and a relative decline afterwards, whereas economic growth in Brazil and Mexico was faster in the second half of the twentieth century, in both cases driven by state-led industrialization policies. Others as Chile and Peru were blessed with different mining cycles, while experienced industrialization expansion led by the state at mid-twentieth century.In this chapter, benefiting from the work done in the previous chapters, we provide a first attempt to analyse regional growth (at a subnational level), emphasizing the interaction between first- and second-nature forces, namely the localization of natural resources, trade policies, agglomeration forces and economic policies in shaping the regional income inequality of Latin American countries from the end of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Following the work done by Badia-Miró et al. (Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 49(1), 117–139, 2018), we will test existence of sigma and beta convergence, and the evolution of the Theil index and its decomposition. Finally, we check statistically the existence of a group of richer or poorer regions, considering spatial clustering analysis. To do that we run a simple test to obtain local Moran’s I coefficient for all the regions, which consider a statistical relationship between the regional income per capita of any region and its neighbourhood. We are especially interested in detecting the existence of this groups across national borders and its persistence in the long run, according to the changes in commodity cycles, industrial and trade policies and regional integration. Besides, we are also interested in the role played by the administrative capitals of the countries and the economic linkages to neighbouring regions.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

840,pub.1132431913,10.1007/978-3-030-47553-6_14,,,Regional Inequality in Latin America: Does It Mirror the European Pattern?,"The aim of this chapter is to analyse the comparative evolution of regional inequality over the course of the historical economic development processes in four countries of South West Europe—France, Italy, Portugal and Spain—and nine countries of Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Our analysis, which goes back to the nineteenth century, shows that regional income inequality has followed over time what appears now to be an N-shaped evolution in both regions. However, both experiences differ markedly and we identify the main stylized facts of these trajectories. First, Latin America begun the period with higher levels of regional inequality than Europe. Second, the increase in inequality up to the interwar years was more intense in Latin America than in Europe. Besides, the increasing disparities in Europe in this initial period were based on the high territorial concentration of industry while in Latin America inequality mainly grew responding to the specific geography of the natural resources. Third, both regions underwent a period of convergence between the aftermath of the World War II and the crisis of the 1970s, being the process more intense in the European case. In Europe, the spread of industrialization and structural change to a growing number of regions was determinant in the decrease in inequality. In the case of Latin America, however, it was the marked change in economic policy—import substitution industrialization—that constituted the driving force behind the regional convergence. Finally, the crisis of the 1970s and changes in the international political and economic consensus in the 1980s signalled the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of inequality. A context of increasing international economic integration brought to a halt the narrowing of the gap between richer and poorer regions, but in a lower degree in Europe compared to Latin America. In this case, the liberalism typical of the 1980s, as enshrined in the Washington Consensus, favoured reinsertion into the international goods and factor markets and led to the unequal growth of those regions best endowed with resources.",,,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,Time and Space,"Daniel A.

The high cost of traditional systems has led several authors to evaluate the feasibility of using affordable acquisition systems. This article aims to quantify the uncertainties of the modal parameters of a flexible structure, instrumented with traditional and low-cost measurement devices. The evaluated low-cost acquisition systems were smartphones and Raspberry Pi microprocessors, while the conventional system consisted of highly sensitive piezoelectric accelerometers. The instrumented structure was a steel pedestrian bridge located in the city of Barranquilla. Bayesian methodologies were used to identify the modal parameters and their associated uncertainties in terms of probability distributions. The results obtained show the feasibility of using low-cost devices to determine the dynamic properties of a flexible structure.",,,Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series,"Model Validation and Uncertainty Quantification, Volume 3",Zhu Mao,,2020-10-28,2020,2020-10-28,2020,,,201-208,Closed,Chapter,"Duarte, Alejandro; Ortiz, Albert R.","Duarte, Alejandro (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ortiz, Albert R.

The African indigenous knowledge incorporates health concepts and needs evolved from beliefs, attitudes, customs, methods and established practices for improving human health conditions and elevating the quality of human life. For explanatory models, African indigenous health care knowledge subscribes to a predominantly metaphysical explanation and places a high premium on the roles of social and spiritual conditions, power relations and societal institutional arrangements in the conceptualization of ideal human functioning as well as associated help-seeking behaviours. By African cultural perspectives, health and ill-health are multidimensional and are socially constructed. African traditional health care delivery is holistic with intervention for the promotion health and treatment of ill-health incorporating techniques with potential roles of facilitating increased well-being, in one or more of the levels of the body, mind, emotions and the spirit. A very important characteristic of African indigenous healing is what is often described as group healing or healing practices that involve not just the patient but also the patient’s primary and associational groups and the community in general.",,,,"The Routledge International Handbook of Race, Culture and Mental Health","Roy Moodley, Eunjung Lee",,2020-10-27,2020,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,,496-504,Closed,Chapter,"Bojuwoye, Olaniyi","Bojuwoye, Olaniyi ()",,"Bojuwoye, Olaniyi ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131129217,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Human objects in outer space and the presence of cultural resources on celestial bodies, especially the Moon, mandate a preservation strategy now. The material culture of exploration of space and the Moon are part of the heritage of the Cold War. The field of Space Archaeology and Heritage recognizes this extraordinary period called the “Space Age” with all its technological, scientific, political, and social complexities as a critically important area for study. Within the last 60 years, space has become part of the cultural landscape of human history on Earth. It deserves the same archaeological investigation as all other significant periods of human prehistory and history. Because space is an extraterrestrial global commons with increasing commercial and national presence, humanity’s important sites and artifacts demand new international agreements which will preserve them for future generations.",This entry has been written thanks to grants from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE) and the financial support of the Beatrice de Cardi funds of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

            Human objects in outer space and the presence of cultural resources on celestial bodies, especially the Moon, mandate a preservation strategy now. The material culture of exploration of space and the Moon are part of the heritage of the Cold War. The field of Space Archaeology and Heritage recognizes this extraordinary period called the “Space Age” with all its technological, scientific, political, and social complexities as a critically important area for study. Within the last 60 years, space has become part of the cultural landscape of human history on Earth. It deserves the same archaeological investigation as all other significant periods of human prehistory and history. Because space is an extraterrestrial global commons with increasing commercial and national presence, humanity’s important sites and artifacts demand new international agreements which will preserve them for future generations.",,,,Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology,Claire Smith,,2020-10-26,2020,2020-10-26,2020,,,10105-10112,Closed,Chapter,"O’Leary, Beth Laura","O’Leary, Beth Laura (Department of Anthropology, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA)","O’Leary, Beth Laura (New Mexico State University)","O’Leary, Beth Laura (New Mexico State University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132035198,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies; 4303 Historical Studies",

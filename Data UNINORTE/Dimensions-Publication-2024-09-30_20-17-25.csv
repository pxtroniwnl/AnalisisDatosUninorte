Since the original description of these lines in the 19th century, they have been attributed to recurring events during tooth development. They have also attracted the attention of dental scientists and anthropologists; however, to date, studies of these structures have been largely theoretical and microscopic. We show here that the statistical properties of the spacing between the lines are similar in teeth from both ancient and modern humans and from extinct archosaurs, reptiles that lived tens or hundreds of millions of years ago-they also resemble heart rate variability of living humans. We propose that the deposition of these recurring structures is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. This control accounts for their regularity and recurrent nature and implies that the lines are an expression of a biologic rhythm which has been conserved throughout evolution. Details of the rhythms give clues to life styles in ancient civilizations and to the physiology of extinct archosaurs.","We thank the Museum of Natural History Berlin, Germany for the loan of the Brachiosaurus teeths; the Instituto de Investigationes Arqueológicas, R. P. G. Le Paige, Universidad del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile for allowing the study of teeth from the San Pedro culture; and the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, Peru for allowing the study of teeth from the Chiribaya culture.

One hundred and twenty premises, in an urban area of Colombia where dengue type-1 and type-2 virus cocirculated, were randomly selected and sampled for 7 months. The geometric mean monthly numbers (density index, DI) of Ae. aegypti eggs (ODI), 4th instar larvae (LDI), pupae (PDI), and adults (ADI) were calculated based on the use of ovitraps, nets, and manual aspirators, respectively. A negative temporal correlation was observed between the LDI and the ODI (r = -0.83, df = 5, and P < 0.01). Positive temporal correlations were only observed between the LDI and the PDI (r = 0.90, df = 5, and P < 00.5) and the Breteau and House indices (r = 0.86, df = 5, and P < 0.01). No other correlations were found between these indices and any of the other density indices or the incidence of suspected DF cases in residents, the temperature, the rainfall, or seasonal fluctuations. Our results were, therefore, probably due to the most productive Ae. aegypti breeding sites (large water containers) being located indoors within this study area. The number of adult female Ae. aegypti/person (n = 0.5) and pupae/person (n = 11) in our study area were lower and dramatically higher than the transmission thresholds previously reported for adult and pupae, respectively. Because there were confirmed DF cases during the study period, the transmission threshold based on the Ae. aegypti pupae was clearly more reliable. We found that the mean ovitrap premise index (OPI) was 98.2% during this study and that the mean larval (L-4th instars) premise index (LPI) was 59.2%, and therefore we suggest that the OPI and LPI would be more sensitive methods to gauge the effectiveness of A. aegypti control programs.","We thank the people of Puerto Triunfo, the Secretara Departamental de Salud de Antioquia, Jerry Wheeler (Cambridge University, United Kingdom), for statistical advice, and COLCIENCIAS, Colombia, for financial support.",,Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association,,,Aedes; Animals; Colombia; Dengue; Female; Humans; Insect Vectors; Larva; Oviposition; Ovum; Population Density; Pupa,2005-03,2005,,2005-03,21,1,15-21,Closed,Article,"Romero-Vivas, Claudia M.

METHODS: Epididymides from five adult rats and five adult mice were fixed in alcoholic Bouin's fixative and embedded in paraffin. Serial longitudinal sections through the medial aspect of the organ were cut at 10 microm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. As determined from major connective tissue septa, nine subdivisions of the rat epididymis and seven for the mouse were determined, consisting of five sub-regions in the caput (rat and mouse), one (mouse) or three (rat) in the corpus and one in the cauda (rat and mouse). Using the Epiquatre software, several tubular, luminal and epithelial morphometric parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: Statistical comparison of the quantitative parameters revealed regional differences (2-5 in the rat, 3-6 in the mouse, dependent on parameters) with caput regions 1 and 2 being largely distinguishable from the similar remaining caput and corpus, which were in turn recognizable from the cauda regions in both species.
CONCLUSION: The use of the Epiquatre software allowed us to establish regression curves for different morphometric parameters that can permit the detection of changes in their values under different pathological or experimental conditions.",,,Asian Journal of Andrology,,,Animals; Automation; Computers; Epididymis; Epithelium; Male; Mice; Rats,2005-09-01,2005,2005-09-01,2005-09,7,3,267-275,All OA; Gold,Article,"Soler, C.; de Monserrat, J.

Of the 1214 SLE patients included in the GLADEL cohort, 123 were male. Demographic characteristics as well as clinical manifestations, laboratory profile, activity and damage scores were evaluated at onset and during the course of the disease and compared with female patients. The median age at onset of the male patients was 27 and that at diagnosis 29.2 years. Delay to diagnosis was shorter in males (134 versus 185 days, P = 0.01). At onset, men more frequently showed fever (42.3 versus 27.0%, P = 0.001) and weight loss (23.6 versus 11.8%, P = 0.001). During disease course the incident of symptoms was: fever, 67.8 versus 55.6%, P = 0.012; weight loss, 47.2 versus 24.3%, P = 0.001; arterial hypertension, 37.4 versus 25.8%, P = 0.007; renal disease (persistent proteinuria and/or cellular casts), 58.5 versus 44.6%, P = 0.004); and hemolytic anemia, 19.5 versus 10.9%, P = 0.008. The laboratory results showed that: men more frequently had IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (68.2 versus 49%, P = 0.02) and low C3 (61.3 versus 48.1%, P = 0.03); 5/123 men died (4%) compared with 29/1091 women (2.7%). In conclusion, 10% of GLADEL's cohort patients were male. They showed a distinctive profile with shorter delay to diagnosis, higher incidence of fever, weight loss, arterial hypertension, renal disease, hemolytic anemia, IgG anticardiolipin antibodies and low C3.

METHODS: We interviewed members of the Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio del Lupus Eritematoso (GLADEL) inception cohort of 1,214 SLE patients to ascertain whether they had relatives with SLE and/or other autoimmune diseases. Identified relatives were studied. Familial aggregation was tested using reported highest and intermediate population prevalence data for SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or all autoimmune diseases, and studies were performed to identify the genetic model applicable for SLE.
RESULTS: We identified 116 first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with SLE, 79 with RA, 23 with autoimmune thyroiditis, 3 with scleroderma, 1 with polymyositis, and 16 with other autoimmune diseases, related to 166 of the 1,177 SLE patients in the GLADEL cohort who agreed to participate. Forty-two SLE patients had 2 or more relatives with an autoimmune disease. We found a lambda(sibling) of 5.8 and 29.0 for SLE and of 3.2-5.3 for RA, when comparing with their reported high or intermediate population prevalence, respectively. We also found familial aggregation for autoimmune disease in general (lambda(sibling) = 1.5) and determined that for SLE, a polygenic additive genetic model, rather than a multiplicative one, is applicable.
CONCLUSION: In SLE there is familial aggregation of SLE, RA, and autoimmune disease in general. A polygenic additive model applies for SLE. American Indian-white Mestizo SLE patients and those with higher socioeconomic level were more likely to have familial autoimmunity.",The authors are grateful to Daniel Wojdyla for his assistance in handling the database and statistical analysis of data from the GLADEL cohort and to Daniel Villalba and Leonardo Grasso for their expert assistance with the ARTHROS 6.0 software.,,Arthritis & Rheumatism,,,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Autoimmunity; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Family; Family Health; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Latin America; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male",2005-04-07,2005,2005-04-07,2005-04,52,4,1138-1147,Closed,Article,"Alarcón‐Segovia, Donato; Alarcón‐Riquelme, Marta E.; Cardiel, Mario H.; Caeiro, Francisco; Massardo, Loreto; Villa, Antonio R.; Pons‐Estel, Bernardo A.; del Lupus Eritematoso, on behalf of the Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio","Alarcón‐Segovia, Donato (University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden; Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico; Hospital Privado, Centro Médico de Córdoba, Cordoba, Argentina; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Hospital Escuela Eva Perón, Granadero Baigorria, Rosario, Argentina); Alarcón‐Riquelme, Marta E.

Se esperaba observar si a mayor densidad en la red personal, se encontrarían bajos niveles en la calidad de vida de los desplazados, lo cual unido a otros factores sociales reduciría su sentido de comunidad y capacidad de adaptación. La muestra se tomó en Pinar del Río (periferia de Barranquilla – Colombia), con 19 personas seleccionadas por muestreo en bola de nieve (8 hombres, 11 mujeres con edades entre 27 y 61 años). Respondieron un cuestionario sobre Calidad de Vida en Salud (SF-36) (McHorney et al., 1994), y el Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule (ASSIS) de Barrera (1980, citado por Araya y Maya, 2005). Los resultados mostraron que no existen correlaciones significativas entre los que Llegan y los Asentados en las variables de estudio, pero se encontró evidencia que la calidad de vida en su dimensión de salud física, es menor en los desplazados que llevan más de un año en el asentamiento, con respecto a los que tienen menos de tres meses.   Abstract This article is based on a research that explored the relations between the Personal Social Network of people who have been displaced because of political violence and their Quality of Life in Health. These relations can be modified by the time of being in the new place of refuge - less than three months and more of one year. The hypothesis looked for if to greater density of the Personal Social Network of displaced people the Quality of Life in Health was low, which together with other social factors would reduce their Sense of community and capacity of adaptation. The data were collected in Pinar del Río (periphery of Barranquilla - Colombia), with 19 people selected in snow ball sample (8 men, 11 women, between 27 and 61 years).

Intercropping maize with legumes such as lablab, Lablab purpurens (L.), is one of the effective systems to control stem borers. Sole culture maize and maize/lablab intercrop system of different lablab densities were planted at two locations to investigate the effects of intercrop system on incidence and severity of stem borers with particular reference to Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Stem borer infestation was found to be more severe in sole culture maize than maize in maize/lablab intercrop. There was a significantly negative relationship between lablab densities and maize grain yields, suggesting a possible competition for resources between the two crops.

Nine physical fitness test items were assessed: standing long jump, bent arm hang, sit-ups, 10 × 5 m shuttle run, 50 m sprint, 1600 m run, flamingo balance, sit and reach, plate tapping.Results:BMI was highly correlated with FFM (r=0.7, P<0.001). In line with findings from Western countries, regression coefficients (B) showed that children with higher BMI or SSF performed worse in bent arm hang (girls, B=−0.84, P<0.001, and B=−0.06, P=0.02, respectively) and in 1600 m run (B=6.68, P<0.001). BMI was significantly associated with flamingo balance (B=0.26, P=0.04). WHR was positively associated with bent arm hang (B=9.37, P=0.03), and inversely with sit and reach (B=−7.48, P=0.01). In contrast, significant relationships were found between BMI and standing long jump (B=0.74, P=0.04), sit and reach (B=0.51, P<0.001), flamingo balance (B=0.26, P=0.04) and plate tapping (B=−19, P=0.01). SSF was significantly associated with sit and reach (B=0.04, P=0.03). Significant inverse associations were found between FFM and bent arm hang (girls, B=−0.06, P=0.05), 1600 m run (girls, B=−2.33, P=0.003) and 50 m run (boys, B=−0.11, P=0.006). FFM was significantly associated with standing long jump (boys, B=0.99, P<0.001; girls, B=0.73, P<0.001), flamingo balance (B=0.17, P<0.001), and with sit and reach (boys, B=0.59, P=0.03).Conclusion:In the present study in undernourished children, body composition was significantly related to physical fitness, but not always in the expected direction. It is therefore important to note that in this population, BMI should not be interpreted as a measure of fatness/overweight, but rather as an indicator of muscle mass.Sponsorship:Financial support was received from the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the University of the North, Sovenga, South Africa.","The cooperation of community leaders, school authorities, parents and children in the Ellisras area is greatly appreciated.

Their implementation takes an important amount of time because of the required PID tuning and the model characterization/identification. This paper presents a strategy to perform on-line adaptation for the dynamic matrix coefficients in a DMC controller. Based on the observed PH (Prediction Horizon) elements of the response and controller signal vectors, and based on a non-residing control horizon controller design, the direct control problem is reformulated using the full-effect dynamic matrix (PHxPH) as an unknown. Data is collected and used in two directions: training a RAWN Network (Random Allocation Weight Neural Network), to describe recently observed process behavior, and to solve a least-squares problem for a set of linear equations where the unknowns are the characteristic response coefficients. The paper presents the effect of both approaches, illustrating the adaptation algorithms operation in a highly nonlinear process where the controller is designed in a low-gain region. Then the process operating condition is shifted so that it moves to a high-gain region to observe controller response.Copyright © 2005 by ASME",,,,"Dynamic Systems and Control, Parts A and B",,,2005-01-01,2005,2008-02-05,2005-01-01,,,1033-1040,Closed,Proceeding,"Sanjuan, Marco E.","Sanjuan, Marco E.

The in vitro antimalarial activities of these compounds were evaluated against the chloroquine-sensitive (D10) and the chloroquine-resistant (RSA11) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The 1,2,4-triazino[5,6b]indole derivatives (4, 6 and 8) with a trifluoromethyl group at position 6 exhibit increased in vitro activity when compared to the unsubstituted analogues, which are all devoid of activity. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group in the 5H-1,2,4-triazolo[1',5',2,3]-1,2,4-triazino[5,6b]indole ring system leads to compounds with diminished antimalarial activity when compared to the corresponding unsubstituted analogues.

The effective potential confines the two‐dimensional electron gas to a region under the disk. Firstly the results of a detailed calculation for the eigenenergies and wave functions of the confined exciton,for four different substrates of technological interest, are obtained and discussed. The allowed transition probabilities between the energy states as a function of the strength of the magnetic field are estimated for GaAs. This antidot confinement makes the excitons very sensitive to spin orientation.The spin down state (mz = –1) increases the confinement. The exciton becomes more localized in the antidot region as the applied field increases. In contrast, the spin up state does not result in a significant localization of the exciton within the antidot region. (© 2005 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
METHODS: A sample of 1608 women and 498 men aged 30 years and above participated in the study. Sociodemographic data, anthropometric measures (body mass index, waist/hip ratio), blood pressure and biochemical risk factors were measured. A global cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile was developed.
RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of tobacco use for men (57%) and women (35.4%), with women (28.1%) predominantly using smokeless tobacco. Alcohol use was very common in men (57.2%). Women weighed a great deal more than men, and 51.7% were either overweight or obese. Diabetes was diagnosed in 8.8 and 8.5% of women and men, respectively. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was relatively high, whereas 42.3% of women and 28.5% of men had low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels of 3 mmol/l or more. Hypertension (blood pressure > or =140/90 mmHg) was found in 25.5% of women and 21.6% of men. According to the Framingham formulae, 18.9% of women and 32.1% of men had a 20% or higher chance of having a CVD event in the next 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of chronic disease risk factors in the rural, poor black community in Limpopo, South Africa. Consequently, the population had a higher than expected risk of developing a CVD event in the following 10 years when compared with similar studies in black Africans.","The authors’ sincere thanks go to all the students, nurses and fieldworkers who assisted with the study.

To solve the GMM-model, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) inspired by the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) was already proposed. In this paper, we extend the GMM-model to dynamic multicast groups (i.e., egress nodes can change during the connection's lifetime), given that, if recomputed from scratch, it may consume a considerable amount of CPU time. To alleviate this drawback we propose a Dynamic Generalized Multiobjective Multitree model (Dynamic-GMM-model) that in order to add new egress nodes makes use of a multicast tree previously computed with the GMM-model. To solve the Dynamic-GMM-model, a new MASPA (multiobjective approximation using shortest path algorithm) heuristic is proposed. Experimental results considering up to 11 different objectives are presented for the well-known NSF network. We compare the performance of the GMM-model using MOEA with the proposed Dynamic-GMM-model using MASPA, showing that reasonable good solutions may be found using fewre resources (as memory and time). The main contributions of this paper are the optimization model for dynamic multicast routing; and the proposed heuristic algorithm.",,,,"IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

One interesting strategy for load balancing enhancement is the multipath approach, in which data is transmitted through different paths. The use of effective hashing functions for load balancing optimizes the network utilization and reduces packet disordering and imbalance. This paper address the problem of packet ordering in multipath - multicast MPLS networks, studies the impact of the hashing function to effectively partition the traffic to implement the flow splitting values issued from an optimized model and analyzes the traffic allocation to the LSPs of the network and the mis-ordering problem at the egress node using buffer schemes. The buffer allocation levels are calculated according to end-to-end delays.

Clinical evidence has shown that the conjunctiva also responds to sensory denervation, but little is known of the cytology of the conjunctival tissue response to denervation. The purpose of this study therefore was to investigate the cytological aspects of tissue response induced in the conjunctiva of monkeys by sensory denervation. Intracranial ophthalmic neurotomy was carried out in three monkeys, maxillary neurotomy in four, combined ophthalmic and maxillary neurotomy in two, and infraorbital nerve transaction in one monkey. These various operations were performed for other experimental purposes, but the conjunctival tissues from the animals were suitable and available to study the cytology of the inflammatory response induced in the tissue following the sensory denervation. The cytological changes were studied using light microscopy. Complete or severe ophthalmic nerve transection induced significant inflammatory responses, which were largely confined to the tarsal region of the conjunctiva. The responses included a substantial increase in the infiltration of the epithelium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and severe disruption of the epithelium. The number of macrophages in the conjunctiva also increased. The response induced by maxillary denervation, however, was not as pronounced as that induced by sensory denervation. The restriction of the conjunctival tissue response to the tarsal region was considered to be due to the friction between the tarsal conjunctiva (and the hard tarsal plate) and the cornea during blinking. This study shows that sensory denervation of the conjunctiva elicits an inflammatory response characterized by substantial infiltration of the epithelium by neutrophil and macrophage and disorganization of the conjunctival tissue.","The operations on the monkeys used in this study were carried out by my supervisor, the late Professor Gordon L. Ruskell. He also ensured that the animals were kept in humane conditions before and after the operations.

Su unidad est dada por el espacio compartido: la pampa calichera en medio del desierto ms rido del mundo, y por el trabajo, vinculado en todos sus aspectos a las faenas extractoras del nitrato. El relato salitrero tiene manifestaciones tempranas en los avatares de la Guerra del Pacfico y comienza a adquirir su propia fisonoma con los albores del siglo XX.

Its unity if granted by a shared geography -the nitrate deposits in the the worlds driest desert- and those activities related to nitrate minerals extraction. Nitrate fiction has early samples in nineteen-century Pacific War (Chile versus Peru and Bolivia), and acquires a mature aspect by the beginning of twentieth century. Nitrate-pampa writing registers, witnesses, and transforms the reality of the desert and of the miners villages, both condemning and evoking its ways of life beyond real death.

The crystals have been studied by means of cathodoluminescence (CL), revealing high crystalline quality. The different growth sectors are identified by CL imaging. The incorporation of impurities and non-radiative recombination centers depends on the growth sector. The surface introduces band tailing producing self-absorption of the high energy luminescence photons. The broad visible luminescence band is composed of at least three different bands, green, orange and red, which are non-equally distributed, depending on the growth sector. Also a strong dependence of the visible luminescence on the penetration depth of the excitation — the e beam — is observed, which suggests that the concentration of the deep levels responsible for the visible luminescence is at the sample surface to a depth of 2 μm.","AcknowledgementsThe Spanish group was funded by EOARD (grant FA8655-04-13073).

Despite only one proof of concept trial a few anecdotal reports and no report on safety, it is being offered in several regions as compassionate use. We performed detailed follow at 18 months of age to asses for adverse effects in the newborns who were treated with oral sildenafil in a randomized trialObjective: To analyze the outcome of term newborns who were treated with oral sildenafil for neonatal PPH in a region where iNO is unavailable.Design/Methods: Of the seven term newborns that were treated with oral Sildenafil during the study, five were alive at one year of age and four were followed up to 18 months. Anthropomorphic measurements, neurodevelopment assessment (Gesell developmental scale), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and otoacustic emissions (OAE) were done in all children.Results: The mean of height (77.5 cm.) weight (11.02 Kg.), head circumference (46.5 cm) and neurodevelopment evaluation on Gesell scales (102.7) were within normal limits.

The dynamic (state dependent) policy optimizes a cost function based on the WIP inventory, the backorder penalty costs and the setup costs, while meeting the productivity constraints for the products. The methodology uses a simulation optimization technique called Reinforcement Learning (RL) and was tested on a stochastic lot-scheduling problem (SELSP) having a state–action space of size 1.8×107. The dynamic policies obtained through the RL-based approach outperformed various cyclic policies. The RL approach was implemented via a multi-agent control architecture where a decision agent was assigned to each of the products. A Neural Network based approach (least mean square (LMS) algorithm) was used to approximate the reinforcement value function during the implementation of the RL-based methodology. Finally, the dynamic control policy over the large state space was extracted from the reinforcement values using a commercially available tree classifier tool.",,,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,,,,2005-07,2005,,2005-07,13,5,389-406,Closed,Article,"Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.; Das, Tapas K.","Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.

These assumptions may be unrealistic in many practical cases; in particular, it has been argued that thresholds may be part of choice–rejection mechanisms (i.e. if the threshold of any attribute for a given alternative is surpassed the alternative is rejected) and, therefore, act as explicit criteria to determine the set of feasible alternatives.We formulate a semi-compensatory two-stage discrete choice model incorporating randomly distributed thresholds for attribute acceptance. The formulation allows us to estimate the parameters of the threshold’s probability distribution; these parameters can be expressed as a function of the socio-economics characteristics of the individual and the conditions under which the choice process takes place.Applying the model to real and simulated data allowed us to conclude that if thresholds exist in the population, the use of compensatory models such as Multinomial Logit or even Mixed Logit, can lead to serious errors in model estimation and, therefore, in the computation of marginal rates of substitution such as the subjective value of time, as well as in prediction. Although the Mixed Logit model can deal with random parameters allowing to treat taste differences, we found it could not be used to accommodate non-compensatory behaviour or to represent the existence of thresholds.","AcknowledgmentWe are grateful to Ben Heydecker, Luis Rizzi, Mauricio Sillano and Huw Williams for their intellectual help in developing these ideas.

1281,pub.1045062528,10.1007/0-306-48652-0_11,,,The Archaeology of Identity Construction: Ceramic Evidence from Northern Chile,"Although ethnicity has a long history in archaeology (e.g., Aldenderfer, 1993; Athens, 1992; Auger et al., 1987; Cordell and Yannie, 1991; Kelly and Kelly, 1980; Oakland Rodman, 1992; Penner, 1997; Pollard, 1994; Sackett, 1977, 1986, 1990; Shennan, 1989), its study as a shifting, contextual phenomenon in conjunction with the idea of identity construction is relatively new and represents an interesting manifestation of postmodern archaeological variants that attempt to import modern models into the past (e.g., Bowser, 2000; Emberling, 1997, 1999; Hill, 1998; Jones, 1996, 1997; MacEachern, 1998, 2001; McGuire, 1982; Terrell, 2001; Wells, 1998). New understandings of identity construction stem from a modern interest in subverting imposed identities and examining the contextual and historical conditions for the strategic homogeneous construction of group identity. This perspective presumes that group formation and definition, or the construction of difference, is intimately related to the exercise or rejection of power (i.e., Comaroff, 1985, 1996). In this vein, archaeologists interested in power relations in the past have recently explored two modes of ethnic identity construction: identification and attribution (Brumfiel, 1994). Ethnic identification1 implies members of an inferior faction or community actively (re)define ethnic categories as a mechanism of unification and of negotiating for economic or political resources. We find this perspective in several of Ian Hodder's (1979, 1982) early texts. Ethnic attribution implies the imposition of ethnic categories or qualities and traits on certain communities by dominant groups. As such, ethnic identity construction does not usually involve the development of new ethnic categories, but rather the struggle for the right to define extant categories, usually using essential and value-laden characteristics. This process suggests that cultural homogeneity is a product of intercultural communication and interaction instead of isolation.",,,,Global Archaeological Theory,,,2005-01-01,2005,,2005-01-01,,,145-166,Closed,Chapter,"Stovel, Emily M.","Stovel, Emily M.

In this sense, this article reflects on the hermeneutic ground from which is interpreted the experience of being anxious, as well as on a first attempt to integrate the Amedeo Giorgi's procedure, employed to analyze data, in an hermeneutic perspective. The article then offers the results and conclusions of a single case study. The article emphasizes the importance of clarifying that in order to understand the way people live and confront the experience of being anxious, we have to be capable of grasping the meaning of this experience for the person who is experiencing it, from both the researcher's clarification of her/his own reactions and prejudices and the coresearcher's existential structure and experiential perspective. In this way, the article considers the hermeneutic idea related to understanding another person's experience through the embodied and pre-reflective understanding in which every interpretation is based. Finally, it is also emphasized that if we are contextualized about one person's experience and its meaning, we could offer and develop theories and explanations that attend and are specifically focused on that person and her/his concrete needs, instead of attending to our own theoretical and technical needs.",,,Qualitative Research in Psychology,,,,2005-01,2005,,2005-01,2,2,141-167,Closed,Article,"De Castro, Alberto","De Castro, Alberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","De Castro, Alberto (Universidad del Norte)","De Castro, Alberto (Universidad del Norte)",4,0,,0.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018779801,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

Enhanced solution for planar, cylindrical and annular geometries","The motivation of the study performed in this project is focused on deriving a more effective, accurate, and mathematically friendly solution for the prediction of the electrostatic potential, commonly used on electrokinetic research and its related applications. In this contribution, based on the Debye-Hückel approximation, a new solution strategy for the differential equations of the electrostatic potential is proposed. In fact, a simple predictor-corrector calculation is developed to achieve more accurate predictions of electrostatic potential profiles. Furthermore, in this study the authors introduce the correction function f(AO) to the inverse Debye length, lambda. The f(AO) function improves the Debye-Hückel approximation and it is a recursive function of the electrical potential. Once the inverse Debye length, lambda, has been corrected by the f(AO) function and introduced in the simplified solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (i.e., the linear approximation, due to Debye and Hückel), the electrostatic potential outcome little differs from the numerical solution of the complete (nonlinear) differential equation. This new approach embraces different geometries of interest, such as planar, cylindrical, and annular, with excellent results in all the cases and for a wide range of electrostatic potential values. This new predicting semi-analytical technique can be a useful tool on electrical field applications such as the separation of a mixture of macromolecules and the removal of contaminants in soil cleaning processes. Illustrative results are presented for the geometries identified above.","AcknowledgmentsThe support provided by Universidad Católica de Norte, Chile, and the Fulbright Commission to the doctoral work of M.A. Oyanader is especially acknowledged.",,Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,,,,2005-04,2005,,2005-04,284,1,315-322,Closed,Article,"Oyanader, Mario; Arce, Pedro","Oyanader, Mario (Chemical Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Arce, Pedro (Department of Chemical Engineering, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN 38505, USA)","Arce, Pedro (Tennessee Technological University)","Oyanader, Mario (Catholic University of the North); Arce, Pedro (Tennessee Technological University)",16,0,0.18,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044848129,40 Engineering,

Given interactions between the neuroendocrine and central serotonergic systems, we hypothesized that exposure to early trauma would lead to abnormal hypothalamic-adrenal axis activity that would be normalized by pretreatment with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor. Hypothalamic-adrenal axis function was assessed by determining basal corticosterone levels and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity. Rats were subjected to a triple stressor on postnatal day 28, and again to a single swim re-stress session on postnatal day 35 and postnatal day 60. On postnatal day 61 i.e. 24 h after the last re-stress, trunk blood was collected for serum corticosterone determinations and hippocampal tissue was collected for immunohistochemistry of glucocorticoid receptors. Escitalopram (5mg/kg) or saline vehicle was administered from postnatal day 47-postnatal day 60 via osmotic mini-pumps. Animals exposed to early life trauma showed an increase in basal corticosterone levels, and a significant decrease in the ratio of glucocorticoid receptor positive cells to total cells in the hilus, granule cell layer and the dentate gyrus. Both the increase in basal corticosterone and decrease in glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity were reversed by escitalopram pretreatment. These data confirm alterations in hypothalamic-adrenalaxis function that may stem from decreases in glucocorticoid receptor levels, in response to early adverse experiences, and demonstrate that these alterations are reversed by serotonin re-uptake inhibitor pretreatment.",AcknowledgmentsThe authors were funded by the Medical Research Council of South Africa (MRC) and by an unrestricted grant from Lundbeck A/S.,,Neuroscience,,,"Aging; Animals; Citalopram; Dentate Gyrus; Disease Models, Animal; Down-Regulation; Glucocorticoids; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Neurons; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Serotonin; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological",2005-11-28,2005,2005-11-28,2006-01,137,2,619-625,Closed,Article,"Uys, J.D.K.; Muller, C.J.F.; Marais, L.; Harvey, B.H.; Stein, D.J.; Daniels, W.M.U.","Uys, J.D.K.

1186,pub.1068925590,10.2113/gsecongeo.100.5.819,,,The Role of Preexisting Geologic Architecture in the Formation of Giant Porphyry-Related Cu ± Au Deposits: Examples from New Guinea and Chile,"Development of giant porphyry-related copper and/or gold deposits in New Guinea and northern and central Chile occurred during Tertiary magmatic events that overprinted earlier extensional tectonic settings. The earlier tectonic settings consisted of a Mesozoic passive margin in New Guinea, a Jurassic-Cretaceous back-arc basin in northern Chile, and an Oligocene intra-arc basin in central Chile. The preexisting architecture of the basement rocks, the fault systems, and the stratigraphic packages associated with these settings played a strong role in controlling development of the giant deposits. Although the extensional tectonic settings in these terranes were different, they share a number of elements that were used during formation of the Tertiary ore deposits. These were the presence of coupled systems of deeply detached, listric synsedimentary faults and steep transverse faults, and the presence of a relatively flat-lying heterogeneous volcano-sedimentary rock package. During Tertiary collision the deeply detached listric faults were inverted and strongly focused uplift, exhumation, and associated overpressuring-induced failure and fluid flow. In addition, steep transverse faults were activated to form wrench systems, with attendant steep, deeply tapping pathways for magma and/or fluid associated with dilatant jogs, flexures, or fault intersections. Ore deposits are commonly located in the hanging wall of the thrust faults. Under compression associated with collision, the competent units of flat-lying stratigraphic packages formed plates overlying the folded, weaker units underneath and separated by a detachment or otherwise faulted contact. Examples of the competent upper units include the Darai/Mendi Limestone or equivalents in New Guinea and the lavas of the Farellones Formation in central Chile. These plates appear to have impeded magma ascent and formed a cap on a magma and/or fluid system pressurized by collision and orogenesis. This geometry provided an ideal location for focusing of magmas and magmatic hydrothermal fluids. From these three example terranes a set of exploration indicators have been constructed to highlight belts that are prospective for giant porphyry Cu systems. These indicators include (1) the presence of magmatic arcs that migrated into preexisting extensional architectures; (2) coupled systems of deeply detached, listric synsedimentary faults and steep transverse faults; (3) rigid basement blocks that could form regional stress field perturbations; and (4) fold belts with a major plate (to 50 km wide) of competent, relatively undeformed or gently folded stratigraphy overlying more complexly folded and faulted parts of the sequence.",,,Economic Geology,,,,2005-08-01,2005,2006-03-29,2005-08-01,100,5,819-833,Closed,Article,"Gow, P.

The site relates culturally to the second phase of the Camarones Complex, as well as with the Quiani Complex. It represents an important southward continuum of the expansion of archaic fishing groups similar to Morro 1, Morro 1/6 and Camarones 14, towards the more southerly point of Punta Teatinos and El Cerrito. The materials that make up the collection were excavated in the 1970s by Nez, Zlatar and Nez; with osseous remains housed in the National Museum of Natural History (Santiago). the study is based on analysis of metric traits and indicators of pathology and traumas. Sexual dimorphism was measured through the one-way ANOVA method, and biological relationships with similar groups are inferred on the basis of multivariate analytical techniques (Morro 1, Morro 1/6, Morro Uhle, El Cerrito y Punta Teatinos). The results suggest that a third of these individuals had signs of infection in their lower limbs. The percentage of persons with signs of osseous trauma is comparatively low (8,3 %) and is linked to accident-type injuries. Only a small part of the sample hints at nutritional pathologies. No traces of artificial cranial deformation are present, and sexual dimorphism is found in half the measurements. While it is possible to establish a common ancestral origin for all five of the groups compared in this study, the closest relationships are established among samples from the Arid North (Caleta Hueln 42 and the Morro de Arica samples, such as Morro Uhle, Morro 1, Morro 1/6), rather than with the series from the Semi-Arid North (El Cerrito y Punta Teatinos)",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2005-06,2005,2005-06,,37,1,5-19,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cocilovo, Jos A.; Varela, Hctor H.; Costa-Junqueira, Mara A.; Quevedo, Silvia G.","Cocilovo, Jos A.

The new site at Salar Punta Negra (24°28′S/60°53′W/2976 m) includes about 1000 classifiable, mostly unifacial artefacts and, uniquely, three different diagnostic types of early projectile points. Two of the Lateglacial/early Holocene projectile types have wide distribution and are known from different geographical areas in South America: the Palaeoindian ‘Fell’ fish‐tail point mainly from the southern cone of South America, and the triangular ‘Tuina’ points typical of the Puna of the south‐central Andes in northern Chile and northwestern Argentina. In addition, we found a third type, a stemmed point typical for the Salar Punta Negra. Filling a large geographical gap of ‘Fell’ occupation, the site at Salar Punta Negra provides evidence for generally much higher mobility and diversity of early cultures, and supports an Andean‐Pacific route for early human exploration of South America to the south through the desert at intermediate altitudes. Contemporaneous high‐amplitude climatic changes were fundamental preconditions to provide adequate environments and habitats, and to make Palaeoindian hunting‐gathering occupation possible in the Atacama Desert.

1135,pub.1038913723,10.1007/bf03028589,,,Ecotoxicological evaluation of sewage sludge using bioluminescent marine bacteria and rotifer,"Bioassay using the marine bacteria,Vibrio fischeri and rotifer,Brachionus plicatilis, and chemical analyses were conducted to assess the toxicity of the various sewage sludges, one of the major ocean dumped materials in the Yellow Sea of Korea. Sludge elutriates extracted by filtered seawater were used to estimate the ecotoxicity of the sludge. Chemical characterization included the analyses of organic contents, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants in sludge. Bacterial bioluminescent inhibition (15 min), rotifer mortality (24 hr) and rotifer population growth inhibition (48 hr) assay were conducted to estimate the sludge toxicity. EC50 15 min (inhibition concentration of bioluminescence after 15 minutes exposed) values by Microtox® bioassay clearly revealed different toxicity levels depending on the sludge sources. Highest toxicity for the bacteria was found with the sludge extract from dyeing waste and followed by industrial waste, livestock waste, and leather processing waste. Clear toxic effects on the bacteria were not found in the sludge extract from filtration bed sludge and rural sewage sludge. Consistent with Microtox® results, rotifer neonate mortality and population growth inhibition test also showed highest toxicity in dyeing waste and low in filtration bed and rural sewage sludge. High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals were measured in the samples from the industrial wastes, leather processing plant waste sludge, and urban sewage sludge. However, there was no significant correlation between pollutant concentration levels and the toxicity values of the sludge. This suggests that the ecotoxicity in addition to the chemical analyses of various sludge samples must be estimated before release of potential harmful waste in the natural environment as part of an ecological risk assessment.",,,Ocean Science Journal,,,,2005-06,2005,,2005-06,40,2,91-100,Closed,Article,"Park, Gyung Soo; Lee, Sang Hee; Park, Soung Yun; Yoon, Seong Jin; Lee, Seung Min; Chung, Chang Soo; Hong, Gi -Hoon; Kim, Suk Hyun","Park, Gyung Soo (NFRDI, West Sea Fisheries Research Institute, 707 Eulwang-dong, 400-420, Joong-gu, Incheon, Korea); Lee, Sang Hee (NFRDI, West Sea Fisheries Research Institute, 707 Eulwang-dong, 400-420, Joong-gu, Incheon, Korea); Park, Soung Yun (NFRDI, West Sea Fisheries Research Institute, 707 Eulwang-dong, 400-420, Joong-gu, Incheon, Korea); Yoon, Seong Jin (NFRDI, West Sea Fisheries Research Institute, 707 Eulwang-dong, 400-420, Joong-gu, Incheon, Korea); Lee, Seung Min (NFRDI, West Sea Fisheries Research Institute, 707 Eulwang-dong, 400-420, Joong-gu, Incheon, Korea); Chung, Chang Soo (Ocean Climate and Environment Research Division, KORDI, Ansan, P.O.

Essential hypertension and obesity may have their inception in childhood, with little data in African children to support these findings. Objectives were to determine the prevalence of overweight and hypertension in rural children in South Africa. Additionally, the association between fat-patterning ratios and blood pressure (BP) was investigated.
METHODS: Data were collected from 1884 subjects (967 boys and 917 girls), aged 6-13 years, participating in the Ellisras Longitudinal Study. Height; weight; and triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds were measured according to the protocol of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry. Skinfold ratio was used as an indicator of the central pattern of body fat. Internationally recommended cut-off points for body mass index (BMI) were used. Hypertension, defined as the average of three separate BP readings where the systolic BP or diastolic BP is >or=95th percentile for age and sex, was determined.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 1 to 5.8% for boys and 3.1 to 11.4% for girls, and that of overweight from 1.1 to 2.9% for boys and 0.6 to 4.6% for girls. The association between high systolic BP and high BMI was -3.0, while that for high diastolic BP and high BMI was -0.68.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hypertension is evident from the age 6 years for girls, while that of overweight was low. Overweight became evident from the age 10 to 13 years for both sexes. A significant association between high diastolic BP and high BMI was noted, while children with low BMIs were less likely to be hypertensive. Investigating habitual physical activity, fitness and dietary patterns will shed more light on the association of fat patterning and BP in this population.","The authors would like to thank Dr FJ van Lenthe at Department of Public Health, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, and Dr LLJ Koppes from the VU University Medical Center, Institute for Research in Extramural Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands for their critical inputs.

KEY MESSAGES The prevalence of hypertension was evident in younger age groups in the Ellisras rural population of South Africa. Overweight occurred during the adolescence for boys and girls although the prevalence was very low. A positive significant association between BMI, subscapular/subscapular + triceps, susbscapular + suprailiac/suprailia + subscapular + biceps + triceps, and the sum of four skinfold measurements with systolic BP exists. No significant association between the fat-patterning ratios and DBP exists.

In particular, a 25,000-atom ""cube"" of MnO2 was amorphized (tension-induced) under molecular dynamics (MD). Long-duration MD, applied to this system, results in the sudden evolution of a small crystalline region of pyrolusite-structured MnO2, which acts as a nucleating ""seed"" and facilitates the recrystallization of all the surrounding (amorphous) MnO2. The resulting MnO2 nanoparticle is about 8 nm in diameter, conforms to the pyrolusite structure (isostructural with rutile TiO2, comprising 1 x 1 octahedra) is heavily twinned and comprises a wealth of isolated and clustered point defects such as cation vacancies.

In particular, the role of the applied orthogonal electrical field in controlling key parameters involved in the effective diffusivity and effective (axial) velocity of the solute is identified. Such mathematically friendly relationships are obtained by applying the method of spatial averaging to the solute species continuity equation; this is accomplished after the role of the capillary geometrical dimensions on the applied electrical field equations has been studied. Moreover, explicit analytical expressions are derived for the effective parameters, i.e., diffusivity and convective velocity as functions of the applied (orthogonal) electric field. Previous attempts (see Sauer et al., 1995) have only led to equations for these parameters that require numerical solution and, therefore, limited the use of such results to practical applications. These may include, for example, the design of separation processes as well as environmental applications such as soil reclamation and wastewater treatment.

Twenty smallmouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus aeneus) and 20 largemouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis) were collected with the aid of gill nets. Surface water quality variables were included. The cestodes were identified as either Bothriocephalus acheilognathi Yamaguti, 1934 or ""other cestode spp."". The majority (99.8%) of the cestodes found in both yellowfish species were identified as B. acheilognathi (Asian tapeworm). The prevalence, mean intensity and abundance of B. acheilognathi in both yellowfish species were calculated. Ecological parameters including species specificity, seasonality, gender specificity and relationships between fish size and the Asian tapeworm prevalence were also included. In this study, B. acheilognathi preferred L. kimberleyensis over L. aeneus although a low intensity was observed in smallmouth yellowfish. Furthermore, the infection (in terms of prevalence, abundance and mean intensity) in largemouth yellowfish was markedly higher. Seasonal patterns observed in the Asian tapeworm's infection of smallmouth yellowfish are attributed to breeding and subsequent feeding patterns of this fish species with relatively high infections recorded in winter and spring. For L. kimberleyensis no explanation can be given regarding the seasonal patterns observed for the mean intensity and abundance of B. acheilognathi. The maximum and minimum mean intensity and abundance values in largemouth yellowfish were recorded in autumn and spring, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of B. acheilognathi was consistently high in all four seasons.",,,Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research,,,Animals; Cestoda; Cestode Infections; Female; Fish Diseases; Fishes; Male; Population Dynamics; Prevalence; Seasons; South Africa; Species Specificity,2005-09-15,2005,2005-09-15,2005-09,72,3,207-217,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bertasso, A; Avenant-Oldewage, A","Bertasso, A (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, South Africa.); Avenant-Oldewage, A ()",,"Bertasso, A (University of Johannesburg); Avenant-Oldewage, A ()",19,1,0.24,1.41,https://ojvr.org/index.php/ojvr/article/download/198/188,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072230010,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

Microcapsules of high mechanical strength and optimum permeability can be produced by injection of BaCl2 crystals into alginate droplets before they come into contact with external Ba2+. A key requirement is that the system parameters (number of crystals, speed of the crystal stream etc.) are properly adjusted according to the mannuronic and guluronic acid ratio and the average molecular mass of the alginate as well as to the diameter of the microcapsules. Robust, reliable, rapid and low-cost validation tools are, therefore, needed for assurance of the microcapsule quality. Here, we describe a novel three-dimensional (3-D) dark-field microscopy that allows the real-time measurement of the number and spatial distribution of the injected Ba2+ ions throughout the microcapsules after treatment with sulphate. This novel method requires only a conventional microscope equipped with three polarising filters and a double aperture stop. In contrast to confocal laser scanning microscopy images, peripherally attached BaSO4 precipitates can clearly be distinguished from internal ones. The data also demonstrate that several steps of the alginate gelling process must be improved before such immunoisolation can be used in patients.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by grants of FONDECYT no. 1000044 to J.A.V., of the BMBF no. 0313369A and no. 0312108 to U.Z. and no. 0313369A to E.B., of Novo Nordisk Pharma GmbH, Germany, and the Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalz für Innovation no. 386261/525 to M.M.W. and S.S., of Forum no.

We examined the effects of multiple predators from an intertidal boulder food web to test whether and how three different predator species affected the survival of a small amphipod species. 2. Predators were chosen because they differ in their foraging mode, two feeding at the bottom and in benthic refuges (nemertean and shrimp) and one in the water-column (juveniles of a fish). 3. Mortality of amphipods was not affected by nemerteans, but was high in the presence of shrimp or fish. Highest mortalities were observed in predator-combinations that contained both shrimp and fish. Amphipods responded to shrimp by escaping into the water column, while they avoided fish by remaining in the refuge. We conclude that predator-specific defence causes conflicts for prey when both shrimp and fish are present. 4. Comparing observed effects of multiple predators with expected effects revealed risk enhancement for the shrimp + fish combination. A comparison of different predictive models revealed that the multiplicative model was most appropriate, although additive models may work well under certain conditions. 5. Based on known consumption-ranges of the predators used, we conclude that nemerteans were saturated with prey while fish were far from their saturation point. A predator's functional response curve (prey consumption in relation to prey abundance) determines its impact on prey populations. This knowledge appears essential in order to predict whether prey organisms face risk enhancement, risk reduction or additive effects of multiple predators.","Acknowledgements Thanks to N.

We recruited 46 women, below 40 years old, in their 2nd trimester of pregnancy. The subjects were living in a rural area of Limpopo Province. Their heights and weights were recorded, as were their diets during pregnancy and for the first 6 months after delivery. We also recorded weights, lengths, and dietary intake of the infants at 3 and 6 months after birth. The subjects were living in severe poverty: none had running water and almost all did their cooking over an open fire. None of the subjects smoked and only one consumed alcohol. The diets of the subjects consisted mainly of maize, brown bread, sweetened beverages (cold drink and tea), and small amounts of vegetables and chicken. The diets were adequate in protein but were marginal in energy and in dietary fibre, and may be deficient in numerous micronutrients, particularly calcium, iron, zinc, niacin, folate, and vitamins A, C, E, and B6. This was seen during pregnancy and lactation. Blood analysis 6 months after birth revealed normal levels of vitamins A and E and an absence of anaemia. Body mass index (BMI) of the women was 23.9 +/- 5.3 kg/m2 (mean +/- SD) when measured 6 months after birth. Those above 25 years old had a higher BMI than did younger subjects (25.5 vs. 22.2; p = 0.028). Overall, 24% were overweight (BMI 25-30) while 9% were obese (BMI > 30). Most infants (93%) were breastfed for at least 6 months but exclusive breastfeeding was only done by 65% of mothers. One-third of breastfed infants also received formula. The use of formula while breastfeeding was twice as common among mothers aged above 25 years (46% vs. 23%). Early introduction of solid foods was very common in this group. Younger mothers introduced solids in the first month (51%) more often compared with older mothers who tended to introduce solids at 2-3 months (64%). The most common solid food given was maize meal porridge (by 78% of all mothers). Mean BMI was low at birth (< 15), but this reached a normal value by 6 months. A significant fraction of the infants was underweight or short (i.e., stunted), based on being below the 3rd percentile compared with NCHS standards. Underweight was short length in girls. This study found that pregnant and lactating women had diets low in energy and micronutrients as reflected by the high prevalence of underweight at birth. Most infants were exclusively breastfed, but the benefit of this was offset by the early introduction of solid foods having a low energy and nutrient density. By 6 months, the prevalence of stunting had more than doubled.",,,Curationis,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Anthropometry; Black People; Breast Feeding; Diet; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Nutrition Disorders; Infant, Newborn; Lactation; Longitudinal Studies; Malnutrition; Nutritional Status; Poverty; Pregnancy; South Africa",2005-09-28,2005,2005-09-28,2005-11,28,4,12-19,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mostert, D; Steyn, N P; Temple, N J; Olwagen, R","Mostert, D (University of Limpopo, Sovenga.); Steyn, N P (); Temple, N J (); Olwagen, R ()",,"Mostert, D (University of Limpopo); Steyn, N P (); Temple, N J (); Olwagen, R ()",28,0,0.74,16.56,https://curationis.org.za/index.php/curationis/article/download/1002/939,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072217925,42 Health Sciences; 4204 Midwifery; 4205 Nursing,

Processes such as separation, drug delivery, soil remediation, and others constitute alist of applications where electrical fields are used to induce the movement of solute species. Different transport driving forces participate in the motion of the solute. In the particular case of soil remediation, the electromechanisms may compete with buoyancy and advection, promoting distinct flow regimes. As a rule of thumb, some of the earlier applications of electrokinetic phenomena, mainly in the area of electrophoresis, neglected this competition, and therefore the hydrodynamics of the systems was considered simpler. The nature of the process in soil, a porous media, calls for a different approach and is in need of further analysis of the complete map of collaborating driving forces. The identification and analysis of the characteristic flow regimes may lead to important guidelines for improving the separation, avoiding the mixing, and more efficient cleaning in a given application. In this contribution, using a cylindrical capillary model, the basic aspects of the behavior of the system are captured. A differential model is formulated using simplifying assumptions, maintaining the mathematical aspects to a minimum level, and a solution is presented for the different fields, i.e., the temperature and the velocity. Based on the selection of values of the parameter space, several limiting cases and flow regimes are presented and discussed. Implications for the design of devices and cleaning strategies are also included. Needs for further research are identified. The main idea behind the study is to obtain a qualitative and semiquantitative description of the different flow regimes inside the channel.

The predominantly calc-alkaline basaltic andesites of the Cretaceous Las Chilcas Formation are characterized by La/Smn ratios of 1.8 to 2.5 and Sm/Ybn of 1.8 to 2.8. The upper Oligocene to lower Miocene Abanico Formation (variously defined as the Los Pelambres, Abanico, or Coya Machalí Formations) ranges from basalt to rhyolite in composition and exhibits a broad southward transition from calc-alkaline to tholeiitic. All samples from this formation are characterized by LREE enrichment and moderately, or locally strongly, fractionated HREE (La/Smn = 1.3–4.1; Sm/Ybn = 1.5–5.8). The basaltic andesites and andesites of the middle Miocene Salamanca Formation have REE chemistry similar to that of the Upper Cretaceous strata (La/Smn = 1.5–2.7; Sm/Ybn = 1.6–2.7). The overlying middle Miocene Farellones Formation ranges from tholeiitic to calc-alkaline and from basalt to andesitic and has a similar LREE enrichment and fractionated HREE (La/Smn = 1.7–2.5; Sm/Ybn = 1.7–3.3). The Pliocene La Copa Rhyolite Complex, however, is strongly LREE enriched and HREE depleted (La/Smn = 3.8–3.9; Sm/Ybn = 4.2–4.7). Overall, the trace element geochemistry of the Cretaceous to middle Miocene volcanic rocks is characterized by enriched LREE and negative Nb anomalies, consistent with an arc setting, with only minor differences in the abundance of most elements. Crustal thickening during the Miocene in central Chile has been suggested to have been responsible for a transition from an amphibole- to garnet-dominated residual mineralogy resulting in the release of fluids that enabled the formation of giant copper porphyry deposits. However, the gradual increase in La/Yb through the early, middle, and late Miocene reported in earlier studies and interpreted to be a response to crustal thickening is not observed in the regional data. Instead, a rapid change in the geochemical signature between the end of the eruption of the Farellones Formation and the eruption of the high La/Yb La Copa Rhyolite Complex implies a more abrupt change in the tectonic environment. Isotopic data broadly support this, although lower εNd values in the Farellones Formation imply a greater role for crustal contamination in younger suites. In the absence of gradual crustal thickening, it is suggested that the subduction of the Juan Fernández Ridge may have been the key geodynamic process responsible for the genesis of the three middle Miocene to lower Pliocene giant porphyry copper deposits in central Chile, possibly by promoting crustal-scale faulting and even acting as a source of metals.",,,Economic Geology,,,,2005-08-01,2005,2006-03-29,2005-08-01,100,5,887-904,All OA; Green,Article,"Hollings, Peter; Cooke, David; Clark, Alan","Hollings, Peter (Centre for Ore Deposit Research, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 79, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia 7001); Cooke, David (Centre for Ore Deposit Research, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 79, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia 7001); Clark, Alan (Department of Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering, Miller Hall, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6)",,"Hollings, Peter (University of Tasmania); Cooke, David (University of Tasmania); Clark, Alan (Queen's University)",100,15,,7.29,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Regional_geochemistry_of_Tertiary_igneous_rocks_in_central_Chile_Implications_for_the_geodynamic_environment_of_giant_porphyry_copper_and_epithermal_gold_mineralization/22856294/1/files/40601324.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068925593,37 Earth Sciences; 3703 Geochemistry; 3705 Geology,

OBJETIVOS: Contribuir a conocer la conducta de EDA en Colombia y determinar si su comportamiento es diferente en niños menores de cinco años en dos regiones distintas entre sí en geografía y clima. MATERIALES Y MÉTODOS: Se hizo un estudio descriptivo en dos localidades colombianas. Una en la costa atlántica y otra en el centro del país. La muestra se obtuvo en menores de cinco años que consultaron por diarrea a centros asistenciales de cada región. Los microorganismos bacterianos se identificaron mediante pruebas bioquímicas y los virus con técnicas inmunoenzimáticas. En el análisis estadístico se siguieron un ensayo bivariado y pruebas Z de normalidad para verificar si el clima modifica el comportamiento de EDA y si se presenta de manera distinta en las dos regiones. RESULTADOS: En ambas zonas (Cartagena, Bolívar y Facatativa, Cundinamarca) predominó la diarrea viral, frente a la EDA bacteriana. También en ambas el rotavirus fue prevalente. Fue mucho más baja la presencia de astrovirus y adenovirus.

Camelids in Early Formative Rock Art of the Atacama Desert (Northern Chile),"Abstract The absence of suitable methodologies to distinguish between wild and domesticated camelids in rock art has limited the interpretation of visual preferences of Andean prehispanic cultures. Although rock art’s contextual information may provide some indications that help to differentiate between wild and domesticated animals, uncertainty prevails because the relation to camelid forms is indirect. Zoological and zooarchaeological knowledge of South American camelid morphology is used as a means of comparison and identification in Atacama Desert rock art attributed to the Initial Pastoral phase (1500–500 B.C., Early Formative period, northern Chile). Based on this analysis, there are strong arguments for a distinctive graphic representation of wild as opposed to domesticated camelids, as well as a correspondence of these representations to two different modes of subsistence—one of hunters and the other of husbandry-pastoralist societies—which would have coexisted during this transitional period.
La ausencia de metodologías para distinguir entre camélidos silvestres y domesticados en el arte rupestre ha provocado importantes limitaciones en la interpretación de las preferencias visuales de las culturas andinas prehispánicas. Aunque el contexto de las representaciones rupestres proporciona en ocasiones algunos elementos para fundamentar enunciados de este tipo, siempre existe cierto grado de incertidumbre, pues estos nunca están directamente relacionados con las formas de los camélidos. En el presente artículo, los conocimientos zoológicos y zooarqueológicos acerca de la morfología de los camélidos sudamericanos, son utilizados como una fuente de comparación e identificación del arte rupestre de la región atacameña, en particular aquel que los arqueólogos asocian al período de pastoreo inicial, 1500–500 a.C. (Formativo Temprano Inicial, norte de Chile).

934,pub.1070165471,10.2307/30042486,,,Distant Colonies and Explosive Collapse: The Two Stages of the Tiwanaku Diaspora in the Osmore Drainage,"Abstract
                  The geographic expansion of Tiwanaku people and culture (cal A.D. 500–1150) in the south-central Andes can be viewed as a two-staged diaspora. This article defines and categorizes diasporas, suggests archaeological correlates and theoretical implications, and reconstructs the Tiwanaku diaspora. The first stage was a colonizing diaspora in the context of the functioning Tiwanaku state, limited to a few mid-elevation places such as the middle Osmore drainage near Moquegua and probably Cochabamba. The second stage was a much more extensive victim/refugee diaspora driven by the violent disintegration of the colonies around A.D. 1000, in conjunction with either the collapse of Tiwanaku or its radical reorientation by a militaristic elite. Second-stage diaspora populations that settled in sparsely populated areas such as the upper Osmore drainage or the Carumas–Calacoa region established dispersed, small, defensible villages. Those that settled among a larger or more established host population such as the Chiribaya in the coastal Osmore Valley integrated as a marked, lower-status minority. This explosive collapse suggests that Tiwanaku was composed of multiple groups whose differing interests could not be contained. Supporting evidence is drawn primarily from the Osmore drainage, especially the coastal segment.
Se puede ver la extensión geográfica de la gente y cultura Tiwanaku (500–1150 d.C.) en los Andes sur-centrales como una diáspora de dos etapas. Este artículo define y clasifica diásporas, sugiera correlativos arqueológicos y consecuencias teóricas, y reconstruye la diáspora Tiwanakota. La primera etapa fue una diáspora colonizadora, en el contexto del estado Tiwanaku en marcha. Esta fue limitada a unos sitios de altura intermedia, como la cuenca media del Osmore cerca a Moquegua, y probablemente Cochabamba. La segunda etapa fue una diáspora mucho más extensa, del tipo víctima/refugiado. Fue impulsada por la desintegración violenta de las colonias alrededor de 1000 d.C., contemporáneo con el colapso de Tiwanaku o su reorientación radical por un élite militar. Poblaciones de la segunda etapa que se asentaron en áreas poco pobladas, como la cuenca superior del Osmore o la región de Carumas-Calacoa, establecieron aldeas pequeñas, dispersas, y defendibles. Los que se asentaron entre una población mayor o mejor establecida, como los Chiribaya en el Osmore costero, integraron como una minoría marcada, de menor estatus. Este colapso explosivo sugiere que Tiwanaku era compuesto de grupos múltiples cuyos intereses diversos no podían ser contenidos. Datos en apoyo provienen principalmente de la cuenca Osmore, especialmente el Osmore costero.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2005-03,2005,2017-01-20,2005-03,16,1,45-80,Closed,Article,"Owen, Bruce D.","Owen, Bruce D.

The Salta rift had a complex geometry with several subbasins of different trends and subsidence patterns surrounding a central high. Fault trends in the rift were extremely variable. There is evidence of normal and/or transfer faults trending N, NE, E and SE. It is not clear if all these faults were active at the same time, indicating a poorly defined extension direction, or if they formed in different, non-coaxial extension phases. In either case, their trends were very likely influenced by preexisting fault systems. Beginning in early Eocene time, the rift basins were superseded by Andean foreland basins and later became caught in the Andean thrust deformation propagating eastward, resulting in the inversion of rift faults. Due to their different orientations, not all faults were equally prone to reactivation as thrusts. N to NNE trending faults were apparently most strongly inverted, probably often to a degree where the traces of their normal fault origin have become obliterated. We present seismic evidence of moderately inverted N trending faults in the Tres Cruces basin and field examples of preserved E trending normal faults. However, reactivation sometimes also affects faults trending approximately parallel to the main Neogene shortening direction, indicating short-term deviations from the general pattern of Neogene thrust deformation. These pulses of orogen-parallel contraction may be linked to the intermittent activity of oblique transfer zones.","AcknowledgementsThe ideas on shortening directions and displacement gradients exposed here were shaped during discussions with David Hindle (then GFZ Potsdam, now at Michigan State University).

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 325 black, white, and mixed ancestry hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Three repeated 24-h urine samples were collected for assessment of urinary Na, and three corresponding 24-h dietary recalls were administered by trained fieldworkers. Blood pressure and weight were measured at each visit. Secondary analyses were performed on existing dietary databases obtained from four regional surveys undertaken in South African adults.
RESULTS: Mean urinary Na excretion values equated to daily salt (NaCl) intakes of 7.8, 8.5, and 9.5 g in black, mixed ancestry, and white subjects, respectively (P < 0.05). Between 33% and 46% of total Na intake was discretionary, and, of the non-discretionary sources, bread was the single greatest contributor to Na intake in all groups. Ethnic differences in calcium intake were evident, with black subjects having particularly low intakes. Urban versus rural differences existed with respect to sources of dietary Na, with greater than 70% of total non-discretionary Na being provided by bread and cereals in rural black South Africans compared with 49% to 54% in urban dwellers.
CONCLUSION: White South Africans have higher habitual intakes of Na, but also higher calcium intakes, than their black and mixed ancestry counterparts.

Alginate is one of the most promising biomaterials for immunoisolation of allogeneic and xenogeneic cells and tissues (such as Langerhans islets). Although great advances in alginate-based cell encapsulation have been reported, several improvements need to be made before routine clinical applications can be considered. Among these is the production of purified alginates with consistently high transplantation-grade quality. This depends to a great extent on the purity of the input algal source as well as on the development of alginate extraction and purification processes that can be validated. A key engineering challenge in designing immunoisolating alginate-based microcapsules is that of maintaining unimpeded exchange of nutrients, oxygen and therapeutic factors (released by the encapsulated cells), while simultaneously avoiding swelling and subsequent rupture of the microcapsules. This requires the development of efficient, validated and well-documented technology for cross-linking alginates with divalent cations. Clinical applications also require validated technology for long-term cryopreservation of encapsulated cells to maintaining a product inventory in order to meet end-user demands. As shown here these demands could be met by the development of novel, validated technologies for production of transplantation-grade alginate and microcapsule engineering and storage. The advances in alginate-based therapy are demonstrated by transplantation of encapsulated rat and human islet grafts that functioned properly for about 1 year in diabetic mice.",,,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine,,,"Alginates; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Biotechnology; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells, Cultured; Device Approval; Humans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Materials Testing; Pancreas, Artificial; Time Factors; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Preservation",2005-06,2005,,2005-06,16,6,491-501,Closed,Article,"Zimmermann, H.; Zimmermann, D.; Reuss, R.; Feilen, P.

The results show that there is an agreement among the families about the necessity to educate the children about the use of money, and that this is a responsibility that concerns the parents. A wide dispersion is observed among the practices that the parents claim to use to educate their children about the use of money. The practices which are rather intuitive, not very systematic and isolated, do not constitute strategies of socialization, and show inconsistency among the values expressed by the parents and the practices used by them. The parents' experience of an early socialization in their origin families rebounds in the education of their children, consequently leading to the presence of an intergenerational influence in the process of economic socialization.",,,Psicologia & Sociedade,,,,2005-08,2005,2006-01-02,2005-08,17,2,88-98,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coria, Marianela Denegri; Tapia, Mireya Palavecinos; Fuentealba, René Gempp; Costa, Cristina Caprile","Coria, Marianela Denegri (Temuco, Universidad de La Frontera, Chile); Tapia, Mireya Palavecinos (Temuco, Universidad de La Frontera, Chile); Fuentealba, René Gempp (Temuco, Universidad de La Frontera, Chile); Costa, Cristina Caprile (Chillán, Banco de Chile, Chile)",,"Coria, Marianela Denegri (University of La Frontera); Tapia, Mireya Palavecinos (University of La Frontera); Fuentealba, René Gempp (University of La Frontera); Costa, Cristina Caprile (Chillán, Banco de Chile, Chile)",2,0,,0.46,https://www.scielo.br/j/psoc/a/vmpSD6skxJCqBvnKm58YccR/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002189919,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 44 Human Society",

Consequently, from the beginning of the 20th century, the exploration of the principles by which people need to exchange at all has been a subject of central importance. Quite often this search ended with the answer that people need to build a socially integrated life, and that these transactions help towards that integration (Strathern, 1992). However, exchange theory has been lately reconfigured in anthropology, focusing the debate on the ambiguities and heterogeneities in exchanges more than in normative or homogeneous aspects (Weiner, 1992:17). Following this line, understanding the roots of exchange relationships requires the re-evaluation of some concepts, such as space, value and reciprocity.",,,,Global Archaeological Theory,,,2005-01-01,2005,,2005-01-01,,,191-210,Closed,Chapter,"Lazzari, Marisa","Lazzari, Marisa ()",,"Lazzari, Marisa ()",9,2,,9.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034836362,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies",

Puesto que la mayora de estos sitios se encuentra en territorios desrticos sin recursos, asociados a contextos tales como coprolitos de llamas y hojas de maces, argumentamos que fueron componentes directos del trfico caravanero. Esta ruta estuvo vinculada al intenso trfico macrorregional de larga distancia por donde circulaban bienes econmicos y suntuarios procedentes de los ms diversos ambientes (selva-altiplano-oasis-pampa-costa). Las seis dataciones de radiocarbono, obtenidas de los contextos excavados, indicaran que, si bien la mayora de los geoglifos de la transecta de estudio fueron elaborados durante el perodo del Desarrollo Regional (900-1.450 aos d.C.), ciertas rutas transdesrticas ya estaban en uso, al menos desde el Arcaico Tardo (1.300 aos a.C.), por parte de cazadores, pescadores y recolectores This study brings new empirical evidence, resulting from the excavation of four transitory camp sites and two human burials associated with geoglyphs, and found along a prehispanic caravan path of 150 km long, connecting the Pica oasis with the Pacific coastal ocean in the Atacama desert in northern Chile. Since the majority of these sites are found in resourceless desertic areas and are associated to contexts such as llama coprolites and corn leaves, we argue that these sites were direct components of caravan trafficking. This route was linked to an intensive long distance macro-regional traffic associated with the circulations of economic and sumptuary goods from diverse origins, including the selva, altiplano, oasis, pampa and coast. Radiocarbon dates obtained at the excavations indicate that even though most of the geoglyphs were created during the Desarrollo Regional period (900-1,450 yrs. A.D.) some transdesertic routes were already used, from at least the Late Archaic Period (1,300 B.C.) by hunters, fishers and gatherers",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2005-12,2005,2005-12,,37,2,195-223,All OA; Gold,Article,"Briones, Luis; Nez, Lautaro; Standen, Vivien G.","Briones, Luis (Universidad de Tarapac Departamento de Antropologa, Arica, Chile); Nez, Lautaro (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Standen, Vivien G.

A sample of 682 crania was analyzed for evidence of cranial trauma in order to assess changing patterns of interpersonal violence during the occupation of the oasis. It was hypothesized that the level of traumatic injuries in this population would parallel some of the changes seen in the archaeological record. Low fracture rates would be expected in periods of affluence and environmental stability, while periods characterized by environmental extremes and state collapse would yield elevated rates of aggression. This analysis found that rates of trauma escalated from 5.1% (5/99) in the earliest period, to 10.9% (10/92) in the Middle Horizon (AD 600-950). Although it may reflect problems related to increasing population density in the oasis, this increase is surprising, given that the early period witnessed the shift to permanent settlements, and the middle period was one of prosperity and plentiful resource availability. Trauma rates peaked at 35.6% (16/45) in an early Late Intermediate period (AD 950-1400) cemetery, with other Late Intermediate cemeteries demonstrating similarly high rates of traumatic injury. The elevated trauma rates during this period correlate with major droughts, the concentration of settlements on the oasis' east side, fortified structures, and material poverty, all reflected in the archaeological record. As the Late Intermediate waned and environmental conditions improved, trauma concomitantly decreased (7.0%), and remained low throughout the Inka occupation (AD 1400-1532). This indicates that while the Atacama was not peaceful, violence became commonplace only during periods of great social change and resource stress.",,,American Journal of Biological Anthropology,,,"Adult; Age Distribution; Anthropology, Cultural; Burial; Causality; Child; Chile; Environment; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Multiple Trauma; Paleopathology; Prevalence; Sex Distribution; Skull Fractures; Stress, Psychological; Violence",2005-12-13,2005,2005-12-13,2006-05,130,1,60-70,Closed,Article,"Torres‐Rouff, Christina; Junqueira, María Antonietta Costa","Torres‐Rouff, Christina (Department of Anthropology, Colorado College, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80903); Junqueira, María Antonietta Costa (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, II Region, Chile)","Torres‐Rouff, Christina (Colorado College)","Torres‐Rouff, Christina (Colorado College); Junqueira, María Antonietta Costa (Catholic University of the North)",114,10,0.87,33.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005913751,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In the present study, we examined the effect of the selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP) on operant ethanol self-administration by two strains of rats, the Fawn-Hooded (FH) rat and the inbred alcohol-preferring (iP) rat. MTEP (2 mg/kg i.p.) caused a significant reduction in responding for ethanol by both strains of rats; however, in the iP rats, MTEP also induced apparent sedation at this dose, although still reduced alcohol responding at lower doses. Chronic MTEP (2 mg/kg/day) caused a significant reduction in ethanol consumption by FH rats in a two-bottle preference test; however, chronic treatment with this dose had no effect on anxiety-like behavior or depressive-like behavior in FH rats, suggesting the dose used was subthreshold for anxiolytic or antidepressive-like effects. Finally, repeated dosing with MTEP (2 mg/kg i.p.) caused significant reductions in expression of the mRNA encoding the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the GluR2 subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor in the cingulate cortex. A significant decrease in NR1 expression also occurred in the piriform cortex. Chronic MTEP also caused a significant decrease in mGlu5 gene expression and a significant increase in dopamine transporter and dopamine D(2)-like receptor binding within the olfactory tubercle. Collectively, these data suggest that MTEP can reduce alcohol-seeking behavior in different rodent models of alcoholism, and this effect is associated with regulation of cortical glutamate systems, particularly those in olfactory-related regions.",The supply of MTEP from Merck is gratefully acknowledged.,,Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,,,"Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Animals; Autoradiography; Biomarkers; Brain Chemistry; Conditioning, Operant; Depression; Drinking; Glutamic Acid; In Situ Hybridization; Male; Motor Activity; Pyridines; Rats; Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5; Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate; Smell; Swimming; Thiazoles",2005-07-13,2005,2005-07-13,2005-11,315,2,590-600,Closed,Article,"Cowen, Michael S; Djouma, Elvan; Lawrence, Andrew J","Cowen, Michael S (Howard Florey Institute, Royal Parade, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.); Djouma, Elvan (); Lawrence, Andrew J ()",,"Cowen, Michael S (Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health); Djouma, Elvan (); Lawrence, Andrew J ()",108,3,2.59,8.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000939964,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, in this study we examine melt inclusions which have escaped alteration and that sampled all of the phases coexisting in the magma, in late- and postmineral rhyolitic units from the Río Blanco Cu-Mo deposit, Chile. These inclusions demonstrate the existence of a volatile-rich melt, the exsolution from it of an aqueous volatile-rich phase, initially as melt + vapor bubble emulsions, and the disruption of these emulsions into melt and primary magmatic fluids. Trapping of these emulsions may explain the occurrence of melt inclusions containing widely varying proportions of melt and aqueous fluid found at Río Blanco. We demonstrate the sequestering of metals into the exsolved volatile phases and the derivation from these of possible ore-forming hydrothermal fluids, with particular reference to the implications for metal transport. Melt inclusions show differences between adjacent comagmatic intrusions that may be directly related to the extent of mineralization of the respective bodies. In one of the Río Blanco postmineral rhyolite bodies melt inclusions show exsolution of the volatile-rich phase but only minor evidence of trapping of a metal-rich vapor.

We argue that the missing bones, position of the cranium, and breakage of some elements resulted from both postdepositional human intervention and taphonomic processes. The body was laid to rest in a supine position and after it became skeletonized hunters revisited the inhumation and removed some bone elements. However, the other bones present in situ were not displaced and remained in proper anatomical position, with the exception of the cranium, which was placed vertically on top of the cervical vertebrae. The observed breakage of vertebrae, long bones, and skull seems to have been the result of taphonomic, nonanthropogenic, postburial actions. In reporting on the Patapatane burial, Archaic period funerary patterns from western South America are reviewed to support the notion that early hunters and gatherers systematically manipulated their dead through perimortem and postmortem alterations. These included several processes: (1) processes of body reduction and transformation by removal of body sections or removal of bone elements, cremation, and human remains discarded in domestic middens; and (2) processes of artificial preservation of the dead that included roasting, salting, and artificial mummification. In addition, we recognize the simultaneous existence of intact primary burial and that other skeletons were possibly altered accidentally by postdepositional natural or cultural agents.
El enterratorio encontrado en la Cueva Patapatane en las tierras altas de Arica del norte de Chile, corresponde a un esqueleto incompleto, perteneciente a una mujer de 20 a 23 años de edad, y está datado hacia finales de Arcaico Medio, con una fecha radiocarbónica no calibrada de 5.910 ± 90 años A.P. El sitio se ubica en un ambiente semi-desértico en la Sierra de Huaylillas, a 3.800 m de altura, en el interior de Arica. Argumentamos que los huesos ausentes, la posición del cráneo y las fracturas observadas en algunas piezas óseas fueron el resultado de acciones humanas postdepositacionales y procesos tafonómicos. El cuerpo, enterrado en forma extendida en posición supina, muestra signos inequívocos de que después de su inhumación y trascurrido un tiempo necesario para su esqueletización, se removieron una serie de elementos óseos. Los huesos remanentes no fueron desplazados y quedaron en posición anatómica, con la excepción del cráneo, que fue colocado en forma vertical sobre las vértebras cervicales, con pérdida de la mandíbula. Las fracturas observadas en huesos largos, vértebras, y foramen mágnum fueron aparentemente consecuencia de factores tafonómicos postdepositacionales no humanas. Junto con el enterratorio de Patapatane, se revisó la literatura acerca de evidencias funerarias arcaicas a lo largo del oeste de Sudamérica, para evaluar la hipótesis que los antiguos cazadores recolectores de esta región del continente, sistemáticamente alteraronperi y post mortem- la integridad de los muertos. Esto incluía: (1) procesos de transformación y reducción de los cuerpos a través de la remoción de partes del mismo, de la eliminación de piezas óseas, la cremación y el descarte de restos humanos carbonizados en depósitos de basura y, (2) procesos artificiales de conservación de los cuerpos a través de quemado, salado o momificación artificial. Además, reconocemos la existencia simultánea de patrones de enterramiento primarios intactos y de entierros disturbados accidentalmente por la acción humana o agentes naturales.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2005-09,2005,2017-01-20,2005-09,16,3,329-346,Closed,Article,"Santoro, Calogero M.; Standen, Vivien G.; Arriaza, Bernardo T.; Dillehay, Tom D.","Santoro, Calogero M.

The surveillance task is a complex one involving people, management procedures, and technology. This paper describes an architecture that takes into account the distributed nature of the detection processes and the need to allow for different types of devices and actuators. This was part of a major European initiative on intelligent transport systems. Because of the dominant nature of closed circuit television in surveillance, this paper describes in detail a computer-vision module used in the system and its particular ability to detect situations of interest in busy conditions. The system components have been implemented, integrated, and tested in real metropolitan railway environments and are considered to be the first step toward providing ambient intelligence in such complex scenarios. Results are presented that not only deal with detection performance, but also on the perception of people who used the system on its effectiveness and potential impact.","This work was supported in part by the Rome Transport Authority (ATAC) under project IPSATAC and in part by the European Commission under project PRISMATICA, whose partners included RATP-Paris, LUL-London, ATM-Milan, STIB-Brussels, PPT-Prague, ML-Lisbon, Kings College London, University College London, INRETS-France, CEA-France, TIS-Portugal, SODIT-France, FIT-Italy, ILA-Germany, and Thales-France.

The problem is studied during two key moments: the period in which the State Monopolies were enforced (1821–1850) and the subsequent period of their dismantling (1850–1886).

A review of ethnohistorical sources in conjunction with a human osteological study of cranial shape modification offers original data regarding diversity in Tiwanaku society, which was situated in the southern Andes from ca. AD 500–1100. The study sample includes 412 individuals from the site of Tiwanaku, surrounding sites in the Tiwanaku and Katari valleys, and Tiwanaku-affiliated sites in the Moquegua valley of southern Peru. A distinct regional pattern is clear in the ways in which head form was modified. In the Moquegua valley, solely fronto-occipital modification was employed, while in the Katari valley a distinctly different, annular modification was practiced. In contrast, individuals interred in the capital city of Tiwanaku displayed both head form styles. These results suggest that diverse groups of people from neighboring areas were drawn to the Tiwanaku capital in the highlands, and cranial shape modification was involved in symbolic boundary maintenance at the juncture of two distinct environmental niches, the precise location of the capital site of Tiwanaku.","AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by a grant from the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Starting point forms the perspective wherein adult education is not merely seen as a form of second chance education, but is also directed to offering support to all sorts of social interventions. A perspective, in which the aim is not merely directed to one group (women) and the burden of proof not merely placed with one individual.

Intercropping maize with legumes such as lablab, Lablab purpurens (L.), is one of the effective systems to control stem borers. Sole culture maize and maize/lablab intercrop system of different lablab densities were planted at two locations to investigate the effects of intercrop system on incidence and severity of stem borers with particular reference to Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Stem borer infestation was found to be more severe in sole culture maize than maize in maize/lablab intercrop. There was a significantly negative relationship between lablab densities and maize grain yields, suggesting a possible competition for resources between the two crops. It was concluded that density of lablab and date of planting of lablab in maize/lablab intercropping have significant affects on stem borer populations and maize grain yields.",We thank J. D.

We conducted a Cu geochemical study in salt beds (mainly gypsum and anhydrite) from this soil. The sampling was distributed over mineralized and barren rocks, in salts of evaporitic soils from hills, slopes, gullies, plains and alluvium-filled valleys. The samples of salt from hills and slopes reflect very well the presence of blind ore deposits, and the magnitude of the Cu anomalies (<200 to >1000 ppm Cu) is independent of the depth at which the mineralization is located. Similar geochemical response has been found in salt from evaporitic soils that cover gullies, plains and alluvium-filled valleys. However, in the last case the magnitude of the Cu anomalies (<20 to >200 ppm Cu) depends on the thickness of the gravels and the depth of leached bedrock that covers the blind deposits. Although the Cu anomalies are spiky, their contrast with the background Cu population is remarkable. Sampling of salt from evaporitic soils appears to be a valuable tool for exploration of buried Cu deposits in the exceedingly arid Coastal Range of the Atacama Desert.","FONDEF Grants D01-I-1012 and D02-I-1083 supported this research.

In the article it is indicated that identity has always been an important theme in Gordimer’s novels. Her earlier novels tend to focus on her characters’ struggle to attain political or racial rather than personal freedom, while her later novels increasingly tend to examine the construction of individual identities. “The Pickup” has continued this search for identity, but against a new and interesting perspective, a perspective that is in line with the political transformation of post-apartheid South Africa after 1994. Moreover, this theme is extremely relevant in the twenty-first century with its increased emphasis on place and globalisation. This article thus examines the theme of identity in “The Pickup”, first against a South African background and then against the backdrop of an unknown town somewhere in the desert – most probably in Northern Africa.",,,Literator,,,,2005-07-31,2005,2005-07-31,,26,1,49-68,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cloete, M.J.","Cloete, M.J.

417,pub.1124544288,10.5382/sp.11.03,,,Isotopic Evidence for Magmatic-Dominated Epithermal Processes in the El Indio-Pascua Au-Cu-Ag Belt and Relationship to Geomorphologic Setting,"Abstract Epithermal mineralization in the El Indio-Pascua belt, a world-class Au-Ag-Cu district located along the Chile-Argentina frontier, formed in the late Miocene within an actively uplifting tectonic block of the Cordillera Principal. Previous studies have demonstrated a spatial and temporal relationship between epithermal processes and a series of regional erosional surfaces (pediplains) for all the major deposits in the belt. Ore deposition occurred beneath the 12.5 to 14 Ma Azufreras-Torta pediplain but near the head of actively incising 6 to 10 Ma Los Ríos pediment valleys. New isotopic and paragenetic data for several major deposits (Pascua-Lama, Tambo, El Indio) suggest that this geomorphologic setting had a significant impact on the processes that produced preore alteration, ore deposition, and postore processes. Barren, preore alteration of late Oligocene to early Miocene age occurs throughout the belt and is well-developed in the vicinity of the major ore deposits. This alteration is of a hypogene advanced argillic type, and isotopic data for alunite and associated sulfide minerals are characteristic of a magmatic-hydrothermal origin. Alunite-pyrite pairs, where available, suggest depositional temperatures of 190° to 350°C. All economic mineralization in the belt is of an epithermal type and is dominated by high-sulfidation—state mineral assemblages. At both Pascua-Lama and Tambo, alunite is intergrown with, or host to, much of the precious metal mineralization. Isotopic data are consistent with a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for much of this alunite, and ore deposition resulted from the boiling of magmatic-dominated fluid at temperatures of ca. 200° to 300°C. A transition from magmatic-hydrothermal to magmatic steam-dominated processes is evident in both systems, and at Tambo this transition is associated with significant Au deposition. Large steam-heated alteration blankets developed above these mineralized centers during this time, although the isotopic signature of this alteration is not typical of most steam-heated zones and is characterized by magmatic-dominated fluid. In contrast to Pascua-Lama and Tambo, alunite at El Indio is restricted to banded alunite sulfide veins that postdate most other mineralized veins in the district. Constraints on mineralization are more difficult to determine for this deposit due to its wide age range (<6.2–7.8 Ma) and different ore styles. A lithologic contact between the Tilito Formation volcanic rocks and overlying andesites of the Escabroso Group most likely enhanced fluid mixing and suppressed widespread boiling of magmatic fluid, although evidence for local boiling in the late, banded alunite sulfide veins is recognized. Overall, isotopic studies and other features of these deposits suggest that magmatic-hydrothermal processes and epithermal ore deposition were strongly influenced by pediment erosion and semiarid climatic conditions. The dominance of magmatic condensates for the duration of the major mineralizing systems, even in near-surface alteration zones, is consistent with an arid climate and limited availability of meteoric water. Telescoping of alteration assemblages and the occurrence of supergene alteration to appreciable depths below the surface suggest drops in the paleowater tables during late stages of the hydrothermal systems. At both Tambo and Pascua-Lama, fluid inclusion and mineralogic evidence for fluid boiling during the main stages of mineralization is recognized. Similarly, in both these systems, a transition to magmatic steam-dominated processes also argues for rapid changes in hydrostatic pressures. In the absence of large volcanic edifices and the potential for topographic collapse, erosion at the head of the Los Ríos pediment valleys, where most deposits are located, is thought to have had a major influence on high-level fluid-flow regimes. Rapid draining of the outflow zones by local catastrophic erosion may have promoted boiling in the upflow zones and allowed lateral outflow at lower topographic levels, thereby significantly modifying the nature of these richly mineralized systems.",,,,Andean Metallogeny,"Richard H.

The sum of coefficients test and the speed of adjustment test are used to determine whether or not prices move up in the same fashion as they move down, over daily and weekly data frequencies. Out of the four commodity futures markets studied over varying data frequencies, only daily wheat is price asymmetric. Wheat daily prices respond faster to price decreases than to price increases. The implication of the results is that past prices do affect current prices and contain information. Hence, the weak-form efficient market hypothesis appears to be contradicted for wheat futures market. Another important implication of the results is that implementing policies accounting for asymmetric behavior through price limit and margin policies will improve the functioning and stability of wheat futures market in South Africa.",,,Agrekon,,,,2005-09,2005,,2005-09,44,3,423-433,All OA; Green,Article,"Mashamaite, P; Moholwa, B","Mashamaite, P (Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the North, Private Bag X 1106, Sovenga, 0727, Phone:, 015 268 2372, Fax:, 015 268 2372, E-mail:, moholwam@unorth.ac.za); Moholwa, B (Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the North, Private Bag X 1106, Sovenga, 0727, Phone:, 015 268 2372, Fax:, 015 268 2372, E-mail:, moholwam@unorth.ac.za)",,"Mashamaite, P (Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the North, Private Bag X 1106, Sovenga, 0727, Phone:, 015 268 2372, Fax:, 015 268 2372, E-mail:, moholwam@unorth.ac.za); Moholwa, B (Department of Agricultural Economics, University of the North, Private Bag X 1106, Sovenga, 0727, Phone:, 015 268 2372, Fax:, 015 268 2372, E-mail:, moholwam@unorth.ac.za)",2,0,,0.38,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/31722/files/44030423.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021101996,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics,

Higher education institutions, in partnership with industry, are expected to play a key role in supporting the national system of innovation and developing the nation's global competitiveness. This paper draws on the audit of higher education-industry partnerships conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) of South Africa during 2002–03. It plots the South African government's programme of incentives for industry-higher education partnerships through two funding programmes: the Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP) and the Innovation Fund. It argues that, notwithstanding considerable outputs, such as publications, patents/artefacts and the involvement of postgraduate students, it is vital that the incentivization of higher education-industry partnerships is managed in such a way that past relations of inequality among higher education institutions and in the broader society are not reproduced.",,,Industry and Higher Education,,,,2005-04,2005,2016-11-04,2005-04,19,2,161-168,Closed,Article,"Letseka, Moeketsi","Letseka, Moeketsi ()",,"Letseka, Moeketsi ()",10,1,,2.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072794416,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",10 Reduced Inequalities; 17 Partnerships for the Goals; 4 Quality Education

Running parallel with the ideal of democratisation and devolution of powers are the imperatives of redress, educational transformation and restructuring, to be managed by central government and provincial authorities. Implementing the process of transformation also affects teacher training colleges. This article discusses the changes that affected teacher training colleges and the challenge faced by college management in managing the change required. A major assumption underpinning the existing body of knowledge is that management has the power and authority to initiate and manage the change required. This assumption could not withstand the scrutiny of research conducted into the transformation of teacher training colleges in South Africa.

This was also the case in post-1994 South Africa, where it became a cornerstone of governmental education policy and a sine qua non for the provision of equal education opportunities. In an attempt to gather information on a grossly under-researched area of South African education, this paper investigates how principals of schools in KwaZulu-Natal have experienced the course of desegregation in recent years. On the basis of these data, an overall assessment is ventured, problematic areas are identified, and recommendations are made to address these problems.

Five loci were studied in black and blue (C. taurinus) wildebeest, the latter being a closely related species and known to produce hybrids with the morphologically very similar black wildebeest. In fact, the entire national black wildebeest population of South Africa potentially contains a significant proportion of introgressed blue wildebeest genes. In our case, eight out of 39 alleles were unique to black and 22 to blue wildebeest, with nine alleles shared between pure populations of the two species in line with their taxonomic proximity. A possible limited past introgression of blue wildebeest genes into the Abe Bailey population, corresponding to documents on population history, was only supported by the presence of a single allele otherwise exclusively found in samples of four pure blue but not in samples of two pure black wildebeest control populations. However, an assignment test and coefficients of population divergence did not support an extended introgression of C. taurinus alleles into the C .gnou population under study. Average heterozygosity at Abe Bailey proved to be intermediate between black and blue wildebeest, the latter species generally harbouring more genetic variation than the former owing to larger population sizes and the absence of population bottlenecks in historical times. The implications of our data are discussed with reference to the persistence of introgressed genes and the conservation of pure black wildebeest gene pools.",,,Mammalian Biology,,,,2005,2005,,2005,70,1,35-45,Closed,Article,"Grobler, J.P.; Hartl, G.B.; Grobler, N.; Kotze, A.; Botha, K.; Tiedemann, R.","Grobler, J.P.

An equilibrium model was also included, together with simple models for leaching and electro-winning, and models for mixers and splitters. These models allow the study of solvent, extraction phenomena, such as the effect of pH or impeller rotational speed on equilibrium and pseudoequilibrium isotherms operating condition, such as internal recycle; and process configuration, such as comparison of a conventional SX circuit versus series-parallel SX circuits.

This subjective approach incorporates a plurality of readings, thereby implying that different interpretations are always possible, allowing us to modify and change our ideas under the light of new information and/or interpretive frameworks. In this way, interpretations form a continuous flow of transformation and change, and thus archaeologists do not uncover a real past but rather construct a historical past or a narrative of the past. Post-processual theory also incorporates a conscious and explicit political interest on the past of the scholar and the subject. This includes fields and topics such as gender issues, ethnicity, class, landscapes, and consumption. This reflects a conscious attempt to also decentralize the discipline, from an imperialist point of view to an empowering one. Method and theory also means being politically aware and engaged to incorporate diverse critical approaches to improve understanding of the past and the present. This book focuses on the fundamental theoretical issues found in the discipline and thus both engages and represents the very rich plurality of the post-processual approach to archaeology. The book is divided into four sections: Issues in Archaeological Theory, Archaeological Theory and Method in Action, Space and Power in Material Culture, and Images as Material Discourse.",,,,,,,2005,2005,,2005,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,16,0,,7.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023172029,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

Transport through the quantum wire is investigated by using a noninteracting Anderson tunneling Hamiltonian. An analytical expression of the conductance at zero temperature is given, showing a band with alternating forbidden and allowed minibands due to the discrete structure of the nanowires. A generalization of the odd–even parity symmetry is found in this system, whose conductance exhibits a forbidden miniband in the center of the band for an odd number of sites in the nanowires, while shows an allowed band for an even number.",AcknowledgementsP.A.O. would like to thank financial support from Milenio ICM P02-054-F and FONDECYT under grants Nos. 1020269 and 7020269.

338,pub.1072228414,10.4102/koers.v70i3.277,,,"Metaphors, domains and embodiment","Investigations of metaphorical meaning constitution and meaning (in-) variance have revealed the significance of semantic and semiotic domains and the contexts within which they function as basis for the grounding of metaphorical meaning. In this article some of the current views concerning the grounding of metaphorical meaning in experience and embodiment are explored. My provisional agreement with Lakoff, Johnson and others about the “conceptual” nature of metaphor rests on an important caveat, viz. that this bodily based conceptual structure which lies at the basis of linguistic articulations of metaphor, is grounded in a deeper ontic structure of the world and of human experience. It is the “metaphorical” (actually “analogical”) ontological structure of this grounding that is of interest for the line of argumentation followed in this article. Because Johnson, Lakoff and other’s proposal to ground metaphorical meaning in embodiment and neural processes is open to being construed as subjectivist and materialist, I shall attempt to articulate the contours of an alternative theory of conceptual metaphor, meaning and embodiment which counteracts these possibilities. This theory grounds metaphorical meaning and meaning change in an ontological and anthropological framework which recognises the presence and conditioning functioning of radially ordered structures for reality. These categorisations in which humankind, human knowledge and reality participate, condition and constrain (ground) analogical and metaphorical meaning transfer, cross-domain mappings, and blends in cognition and in language, provide the basis for the analogical concepts found in these disciplines.",,,Koers - Bulletin for Christian Scholarship,,,,2005-07-31,2005,2005-07-31,,70,3,401-424,All OA; Gold,Article,"Botha, M.E.","Botha, M.E.

338,pub.1030677684,10.1071/bt04027,,,Development and functional anatomy of pods of Colophospermum mopane (Caesalpinioideae: Dietarieae),"Pod development of Colophospermum mopane was studied from its initiation until it was fully developed and completely filled by the seed. After fertilisation, meristematic activity in various regions of the pericarp causes fruit enlargement. The carpel symmetry and vascularisation displayed by the pods is of the follicular type. One dorsal and two unfused ventral bundles supply the pod. The funicle originates from one of the ventral bundles. The vascular supply of both the dorsal and ventral bundles is elaborate as secondary growth of a cambium increases the diameters of the bundles significantly. During early stages of fruit development the 3–5 innermost parenchyma layers of the mesophyll that borders the inner epidermis differentiate into small thin-walled parenchyma cells that differ considerably in size from the larger outer parenchymatous mesophyll cells. The inner zone of small parenchyma cells eventually differentiates into several collenchyma layers. At a later stage, the innermost parenchyma cells next to the collenchyma layers differentiate into sclerenchyma. As the fruit expands laterally, new vascular bundles continue to differentiate towards the centre of the fruit from the ground parenchyma of the dorsal fruit margin. The area of the fruit margin that is occupied by vascular bundles eventually becomes extensive. The xylem and phloem in the dorsal fruit margin are separated by a cambium. When the pod is mature the cell walls of the parenchymatous mesocarp become thickened and lignified, whereas the collenchymatous stratum becomes partly sclerenchymatous. The zone where the follicle eventually opens is characterised by thick-walled unlignified parenchyma cells between the two ventral bundles at the ventral suture. This unlignified zone is closely connected to the sclerenchymatous flanges of the ventral vascular bundles. The outer epidermis of mature brown pods consists of cells with thick lignified and cutinised walls. The mesophyll of fully developed pods consists of an outer stratum of mesophyll cells with lignified walls and an inner stratum of three or four layers of cells with unlignified walls. The unlignified zone is bordered by a sclerenchymatous stratum that originated from the inner mesophyll layers bordered by another sclerenchymatous stratum that originated from the outer layers of the collenchymatous stratum. The walls of the inner layers of the collenchymatous stratum remain unlignified. Between the sclerenchymatous and non-sclerenchymatous zone of the original collenchyma layers is a transition zone where secondary walls are present but they are unlignified or in various stages of lignification. The inner sclerenchymatous layers of the pericarp probably have a protective function. The inner collenchymatous layers may contribute to fruit opening under dry conditions. The usual method of fruit opening is, however, when the seed forces the fruit valves apart during imbibition.","We thank the Department of Agriculture, Northern Province, for permission to do research at the Messina Experimental Farm.

The subjects were first-year Law students enrolled in an English and Academic Skills (EAS) course at the University of the North-West (now known as the North-West University). Two groups were used. Group A comprised first-time first-year entrants and Group B comprised repeat and re-entry students. Both groups were administered a pre-test and post-test of academic reading ability. The dependent variable was academic reading ability and the independent variables were matric grade and prior exposure. Two measures of reading ability were used, namely a reading comprehension and a cloze passage. An analysis of variance found no significant difference between the pre- and post-test means when prior exposure was examined. However, a significant difference was found between the pre- and post-test means when the matric grade was tested. The results seem to suggest that the matric grade rather than prior exposure accounts for a statistically-significant difference in the performance of the subjects in the academic reading ability test (F = 6.89, P < 0.002 and F = 4.96, P < 0.009) for the pre-test and post-test respectively, suggesting that students with upper grades (A, B or C) in matric English are more likely to have a better chance of succeeding in their academic reading course than students with middle or lower grades. A qualitative analysis revealed that critical reading was the most difficult skill for the students, implying that more emphasis should be placed on teaching this skill.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2005-02,2005,,2005-02,23,1,111-123,Closed,Article,"Zulu, Constance","Zulu, Constance ()",,"Zulu, Constance ()",4,0,,1.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070957722,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

In the present work, transitions between two different magnetic ordering phases are obtained as a result of an alternative approach. The critical temperature has been estimated by the Binder method. Ferromagnetic long-range interactions have been included in a special Hamiltonian through a power law that decays at large interparticle distance r as r−α for α⩾0. If the range of interactions decreases (α→∞), the trend of the critical temperature disappears, but if the range of interactions increases (α→0), the trend of the critical temperature approaches to the mean field approximation.

The molecular weight of the isotactic copolymers was not affected significantly by the presence of the comonomer, but the molecular weights of the copolymers obtained with the syndioselective catalysts decreased with increasing comonomer concentration in the medium. Tensile properties were studied. Syndiotactic copolymers with incorporation of the order of 6mol% of 1-octadecene presented elastomeric properties.","AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge with thanks the financial support of CONICYT through the FONDAP 11980002, FONDECYT 2000107 and CSIC/CONICYT 2003 CL0028 Projects.

More than 100 active clay ceramic industries in the region could provide a solution for the destination of such wastes by adding them to final products, mainly bricks. Thus, the effect of an oily waste obtained from a petroleum separation process on the properties of clay ceramics was investigated. The results showed that the addition of 5–10wt.% of such oily waste produces an increase in mechanical strength, while the apparent density, linear shrinkage and water absorption remained practically unchanged. These results are not in agreement with the conclusions of a recent paper in which the incorrect interpretation of experimental data appears to be the main reason for the presented contradictions concerning the effects of oily waste additions on the properties of clay ceramics.","AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the support to this investigation provided by the following Brazilian agencies: CNPq (proc. 1500444/03-6), CAPES, FAPERJ and FENORTE.",,Ceramics International,,,,2005-01,2005,,2005-01,31,2,353-358,Closed,Article,"Monteiro, S.N.; Vieira, C.M.F.","Monteiro, S.N.

However, there are some constraints to animal production due to the low quality of natural vegetation during winter. Alternative winter feeding strategies have been suggested from research conducted in similar vegetation types in other parts of South Africa. Grazing maize is a potential alternative fodder source but its low crude protein might be a limitation to acceptable livestock production. This preliminary study investigated the potential of inter-cropping maize with high protein content crops for providing sheep with fodder of acceptable quality during winter in northwestern KZN. Raphanus sativus (Japanese radish), Ornithopus sativus (serradella) and Vicia dasycarpa (grazing vetch) showed promising results in terms of dry matter yield and nutritional value. The production of Pennisetum glaucum (babala) and Avena sativa (oats) was relatively high. However, the nutritional value of both these species was marginal.

These show oscillating changes in the dominance of species; the abundance of the sand crab Emerita analoga is linked to phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The biogenic surfaces of these crabs serve as substrate for opportunistic colonizers. This study is the first record of an epibiosis between E. analoga and the rock mussel Semimytilus algosus, detected at a southern Peruvian sandy beach. Mussels fouled a wide size-range of adult E. analoga (7.3%) but they themselves belonged to small-size classes. The largest S. algosus was 17.4 mm in length. Highest permanence of epibionts was found on larger sand crabs (maximum between 24 and 27 mm). Significantly more mussels were found on the ventral surface (39.4%) compared to 10 other surface areas of the sand crab. Possible benefits and disadvantages of the observed epibiosis for both the basibiont and the epibiont are discussed.",Sampling was conducted during the fieldwork of the FIP project 2001-24 carried out by the Group of Ecology and Management of Resource (ECOLMAR).

Palaeomagnetic data indicate no significant latitudinal movement of this area since the late Jurassic. The present-day location of the Atacama within the dry subtropical climate belt is the principal cause of aridity. This situation is likely to have prevailed since the late Jurassic, supplemented by (1) the continentality effect (enhanced by the Gondwanan landmass), and (2) the presence offshore of a cold, upwelling current (from at least the early Cenozoic onwards and possibly earlier), resulting in conditions promoting climatic stability and desert development. Rapid and extreme climatic fluctuations during the Plio-Pleistocene were not sufficient to destabilize the climate within the Atacama.

We have used 1 m resolution IKONOS satellite imagery to map nearly 37,000 cracks over an area of 500 km2 near the Salar Grande (21°S). These features, which are best preserved in a ubiquitous gypcrete surface layer, have both nontectonic and tectonic origins. However, their strong preferred orientation perpendicular to the plate convergence vector suggests that the majority owe their formation to approximate east-west extension associated with plate boundary processes such as interseismic loading, coseismic and postseismic strain, and long-term instability resulting from subduction erosion. Similar structures were formed during or shortly after the 1995 Mw = 8.0 earthquake near the city of Antofagasta, south of Salar Grande, and in conjunction with the 2001 Mw = 8.2–8.4 Arequipa, Peru, event. Cracks such as these may form in other forearcs but remain largely unexposed because of vegetative cover or marked fluvial erosion—factors that are absent in northern Chile as a result of its hyperarid climate.",,,Geology,,,,2005,2005,,2005,33,12,973-976,All OA; Green,Article,"Loveless, John P.; Hoke, Gregory D.; Allmendinger, Richard W.; González, Gabriel; Isacks, Bryan L.; Carrizo, Daniel A.","Loveless, John P.

In order to characterize internal flow in the reactor, the residence time distribution (RTD) was obtained by the stimulus-response technique using potassium chloride as a tracer. Different solid hold-up (0–0.37) and air superficial velocity (2.7–6.5mms−1) values were assayed in RTD experiments. The parameters that characterize the RTD curve, mean residence time and variance were independent of the solid hold-up, thus the solid particle concentration did not influence liquid mixing in the reactor. The hydrodynamic of the inverse turbulent bed was well represented by a model that considers the reactor as two-mixed tank of different volumes in series. The value of the volumetric gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient (kLa) was independent of the solid hold-up.

Predominantly hyperarid conditions are required to preserve these oldest continuously exposed surfaces on Earth.

This species is endemic of the South-Eastern Pacific and lives from Peru (Ancon) to Southern Chile. The egg capsules of red spotted catshark were collected from its natural environment and then were maintained in the wet laboratory. After the hatching of the embryos, the red spotted catshark were maintained in tanks of 200, 500, and 1000 L of seawater with constant water flow and room temperature. The dimensions of the tanks depended on the number and size of the individuals. During the period of captivity, the red spotted catshark were fed with a moisten diet cradle in a mixture of shrimp, squid and meat of fresh fish, enriched with vitamins and minerals.

Spionid polychaetes of Polydora and related genera have been reported from Chile but no worms similar to those found in abalone have been described. The abalone pest corresponds in morphology to Polydora uncinata Sato-Okoshi, 1998, a shell-boring species which was originally described from Japan and never reported from outside the country. It is suggested that occurrence of the species in Chile resulted from its accidental transportation from Japan. Adult worms were most likely transported to Coquimbo with imported abalone brood stock. Prevalence of abalone infestation by worms in Coquimbo varied substantially among cultivation tanks, reaching values as high as 98.8%. Up to 42 worms were found in one shell. The worms often caused formation of nacreous blisters which covered up to 50% of the inner shell surface. Egg capsules with developing larvae were present in female burrows. Larval development was entirely lecithotrophic, with larvae feeding on numerous nurse eggs, staying inside egg capsules until 16–17-segment stage and hatching shortly before metamorphosis. Polydora uncinata is redescribed based on individuals from Coquimbo to alert zoologists in case of accidental release of worms into Chilean coastal waters. Regardless of how the species was transported to Chile, its release to the natural ecosystem may have negative unforeseen impacts on the native fauna.",,,Biological Invasions,,,,2005-05,2005,,2005-05,7,3,489-496,Closed,Article,"Radashevsky, Vasily I.; Olivares, Carolina","Radashevsky, Vasily I.

In this study, we have used extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to gain insights into the local environments of the Cd and Pb cations (as a function of composition and temperature) in CdF2(xPbF2) mixed-cation superionic fluorites. A high degree of disorder is shown around both cations. However, the extent of disorder is even larger around the Pb2+ in the entire series of solid solutions, with the highest disorder noted for the x = 60 mol% PbF2 sample. The large values of the Debye–Waller factors of the Pb–F interactions are consistent with the low amplitudes of their Fourier transforms. This can be correlated with relative ionic conductivities of each composition in these materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been used as a complementary technique on structural properties; systems were modelled at temperatures ranging from liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K, to 300 K.

In vitro experiments demonstrated that the serotonin-induced release of oocytes is inhibited in a calcium-free medium. Caffeine (10 and 20 mM), a known activator of ryanodine channels, increased oocyte release by gonadal pieces and 50 μM ryanodine inhibited this release and blocked the serotonin-induced effect. The number of oocytes released under control conditions was not affected when ryanodine was used in concentrations in the nanomolar range. Germinal vesicle breakdown, indicative of meiosis reinitiation, was inhibited in gonadal pieces incubated in calcium-free normal or artificial seawater and serotonin does not overcome this inhibition in the same conditions. An increase in fluorescence on adding serotonin (10−5 M, final concentration) was detected under the confocal microscope when oocytes charged with the calcium fluorescent dye Fluo-3 AM were studied. We postulate that there is a rise in cellular calcium in the serotonin-induced spawning process and that the source for the increase is influx from the external medium and release from internal stores. We suggest that this calcium rise plays a role in germinal vesicle breakdown and in the contraction of gonadal smooth muscle.",,,Invertebrate Reproduction & Development,,,,2005-01,2005,,2005-01,47,2,117-124,Closed,Article,"MARTÍNEZ, GLORIA; PÉREZ, MIGUEL A.; METTIFOGO, LIVIA; WOLFF, DANIEL","MARTÍNEZ, GLORIA (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla, 117, Coquimbo, Chile, Phone:, +56 (51) 209793, Fax:, +56 (51) 209793, E-mail:, gmartine@ucn.cl); PÉREZ, MIGUEL A.

The Cerro Colorado intrusive stock in the northeastern Chilean Precordillera is a plutonic complex formed during Late Cretaceous (64–72 Ma), and consists predominantly of pyroxene‐bearing biotite monzogabbro (Colorado Unit), with lesser amounts of pyroxene‐bearing hornblende biotite diorite (Pucaquisca Unit) and biotite hornblende monzonite (Pabellón Unit). Compositional variations of major and trace elements suggest that the Cerro Colorado complex is composed of shoshonitic alkali granitoids generated at the active continental margin. The basic to intermediate rocks of the Colorado Unit are characterized by high contents of A12O3 (>20 wt%), CaO and LIL elements (K, Sr, Ba), high Fe/Mg ratio and fairly low contents of Cr, Ni and Y. These characteristics suggest that the Colorado Unit was formed by plagioclase‐free source magma originated from asthenospheric mantle or mafic lower crust. All the Cerro Colorado rocks generally display linear compositional trends, and the latest Pabellón Unit rocks are richer in SiO2 than the Colorado Unit and Pucaquisca Unit rocks. These indicate that the Pabellón Unit rocks were produced by assimilation‐fractional crystallization process of the basic to intermediate magma genetically related to the voluminous Colorado Unit.",,,Resource Geology,,,,2005-03,2005,2008-11-05,2005-03,55,1,45-54,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Kojima, Shoji; Salazar, Pablo; Fujimaki, Hirokazu","Kojima, Shoji (Departamento de Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

The discussion is conducted against the backdrop of two principles which are generally held to be characteristic of ‘pure’ agglutinative languages, namely the principle of invariance of morphemes and the principle of a one ‘to’ one matching between a form and a meaning. Agglutinating languages such as the African languages, including Northern Sotho, display deviations from these ideal agglutinative norms. The deviations may assume various forms, but in this article the scope is narrowed down to instances where the deviations manifest as ‘discontinuous’ or ‘interrupted’ elements. Terms such as infixes, circumfixes and extended exponents, which form an integral part of the discussion, are elucidated.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2005-01,2005,2012-10-24,2005-01,25,3,161-170,Closed,Article,"Kosch, Ingeborg M.","Kosch, Ingeborg M.

These disruptions are manifested in the construction of fortified sites, migration, and in a paucity of material culture. We investigate whether these changes affected the levels of interpersonal violence in the oases of San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile. Nearly 150 crania from the Late Intermediate cemetery of Yaye, one of the poorest in the area, were examined for evidence of trauma. They demonstrated a very high frequency of cranial fractures, 29.2% of the population (42/144), distributed throughout the bones of the skull. These results were compared to contemporary sites, which show similar patterns. Moreover, crania from the Tiwanaku and Inka periods were also analyzed and compared to this data. The populations from these two periods show less evidence of cranial trauma than those from Yaye. In the Tiwanaku Period, 11.9% of the population is affected (11/92), but in the subsequent Inka Period we see a notable decrease in trauma (4.0% or 11/275). These temporal differences in trauma may be associated with the larger cultural changes in the area. The results of this study indicate the possibility that the high rate of trauma seen at Yaye is related to the stress of the Late Intermediate Durante el perodo Intermedio Tardo en los Andes (1.000-1.476 d.C.) se advierte una cada de la prosperidad asociada con el Horizonte Medio y con el estado de Tiwanaku (750-1.000 d.C.).

269,pub.1057829839,10.1063/1.1874295,,,Dose-dependent precipitate evolution arising during implantation of Er into Si,"Implant dose effects arising from the implantation of Er+166 into Si(111) have been investigated. This study encompasses a wide dose range from 4×1015 to 1.2×1017at.cm−2 and focuses on channeled implantation as random implantation leads to a high degree of self-sputtering and damage in the resultant silicide precipitates. Dramatic changes are observed in the shape of the implant profile as a function of dose. Buildup of damage to the crystalline lattice and increasing target density as the implant proceeds lead to a piling up of subsequently implanted Er. Concurrently, sputtering and redistribution of the implanted species cause the implant profile to broaden. The crystalline quality and elastic strain of the resulting ErSi1.7 precipitates have been studied using Rutherford backscattering and channeling spectrometry and high-resolution x-ray diffraction. Following implantation, the precipitates are under compressive elastic strain perpendicular to the sample surface. Its magnitude increases linearly with dose and is attributed to the accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. A two-step improvement in crystalline quality is ascribed to the rapidly improving coherence of the growing precipitates with the Si lattice, succeeded by a slow improvement as the peak Er concentration approaches the silicide stoichiometry. Transmission electron microscopy imaging reveals that the transition between the two regimes corresponds to the formation of a continuous silicide layer. These results have consequences for both precipitate and layer formation using ion implantation.","This work was supported by the Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders (FWO), the Concerted Action of the KULeuven (GOA/2004/02) and the Inter-University Attraction Pole (IUAP P5/1).",,Journal of Applied Physics,,,,2005-04-04,2005,2005-04-04,2005-04-15,97,8,083514,Closed,Article,"Hogg, S.

For 7 sources the 1.25 mm fluxes are much brighter than one would expect from a purely thermal dust model fitted to the submm data, providing evidence for the synchrotron nature of the observed 1.25 mm radiation. If we extrapolate a power-law synchrotron spectrum to shorter wavelengths, then for 6 of the 9 sources also the 850 μm fluxes are dominated by synchrotron radiation. We discuss how far the (sub)-millimetre data can be interpreted in accordance with the orientation-dependent unified schemes for powerful radio galaxies and quasars.

This, together with the properties of real matrices with constant row sums, was exploited by the authors in a previous work in connection with the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem, obtaining conditions which are sufficient for the existence of an entrywise nonnegative matrix with prescribed spectrum. In this work we make use of Brauer’s Theorem again, to show that most of the previous results giving sufficient conditions for the real nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem can be derived by using Brauer’s Theorem. Moreover, the technique is constructive, and there is an algorithmic procedure to construct a matrix realizing the spectrum. In particular, we show that if either Kellogg’s realizability criterion or Borobia’s realizability criterion is satisfied, then Soto’s realizability criterion is also satisfied.

261,pub.1024664392,10.1016/j.aquabot.2005.02.009,,,Growth and loss of distal tissue in blades of Lessonia nigrescens and Lessonia trabeculata (Laminariales),"Meristematic growth and loss of distal tissue from blades of two ecologically important species in the south-east Pacific, Lessonia nigrescens and Lessonia trabeculata, was evaluated during 1 year. Comparative growth was determined by a hole-punch method, loss of distal tissue from the blades was determined by subtracting final blade length (with loss) from expected blade lengths (without loss); growth and tissue loss were transformed to fresh biomass units for calculation of inter-algae differences. The results showed that blade elongation rate increased at the beginning of spring, and declined towards the end of summer, with mean values between 0.40 and 0.08cmday−1 for L. nigrescens, and 0.65–0.17cmday−1 for L. trabeculata. Loss of distal tissue varied seasonally when examined as length units for both species; with mean values between 0.24 and 0.10cmday−1 for L. nigrescens, and 0.51–0.25cmday−1 for L. trabeculata. Variations in fresh biomass units were only observed in Lessonia trabeculata, increasing in spring, with mean values to 0.13g (fresh weight) day−1. Annual growth and loss of distal tissue were higher in L. trabeculata (0.41 and 0.39cmday−1, respectively) than in L nigrescens (0.19 and 0.15cmday−1). When growth and tissue loss were considered as fresh biomass, monthly gains significantly outweighed loss of distal tissue in both species, but parallel results based on length data followed a different trend. L. trabeculata released about 50% of its growth biomass as particulate organic matter, while the comparative value for L. nigrescens was about 20%.","AcknowledgementsThis work was performed as fulfilment to obtain the degree of Magister en Ciencias del Mar of the first author in the Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.

260,pub.1003399768,10.1016/j.bej.2005.02.002,,,Modeling and control of nitrite accumulation in a nitrifying biofilm reactor,"Biological ammonium oxidation was carried out in an inverse turbulent bed reactor fed with a synthetic mineral wastewater containing a high ammonium concentration (250 or 500mgN-NH4+/L). The effects of dissolved oxygen concentration in the reactor, of ammonium concentration in the feeding and of ammonium loading rate on nitrite accumulation was studied in order to optimize ammonium conversion. A model of the biofilm was proposed to describe the experiments and to predict the effects of some operating parameters on nitrite accumulation. The model could also describe oxygen concentration gradients in the biofilm in steady-state conditions. It was shown that the O2/N-NH4+ ratio in the bulk phase is the main parameter controlling nitrite accumulation. This parameter was thus chosen to control the process using on-line dissolved oxygen and ammonium concentration measurements to act on the air flow-rate. Using O2/N-NH4+ ratio set-points of 0.05 and 0.1, it was possible to oxidize up to 80% of the inflow ammonium into nitrite, which is better than results obtained without on-line control. Such a control clearly favors the activity of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) over nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), therefore the selection pressure exerted on the nitrification ecosystem enhance nitrite accumulation in the process.",,,Biochemical Engineering Journal,,,,2005-06,2005,,2005-06,24,2,173-183,Closed,Article,"Bernet, N.; Sanchez, O.; Cesbron, D.; Steyer, J.-P.; Delgenès, J.-P.","Bernet, N.

In this paper, we summarize results of a 1-year monitoring study. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA fragments revealed that the retrieved sequences clustered together with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Ferroplasma acidiphilum and environmental clones related to them. In addition, some sequences were distantly related (<95% similarity in the 16S rRNA gene fragment analyzed) to cultured microorganisms from the Sulfurisphaera and Sulfobacillus genera. Thus, the prokaryotic assemblage might be mainly composed of sulfur- and iron-oxidizing microorganisms. The remaining sequences were related to uncultured chrenarchaeota clones or had only partial homology with known microorganisms. Attempts were made to estimate the dynamic of phylogenetic microbial groups in different stages of the leaching cycle and to correlate them with chemical and physical parameters in the heap. The temporal distribution of microbial 16S rRNA gene sequences could be divided in three periods. In the bioleaching cycle, first stage A. ferrooxidans and Sulfurisphaera-like archaea were dominant within each respective phylogenetic domain. In the second stage (from days 255 to 338), Leptospirillum and Ferroplasma groups were mainly detected, respectively. Finally (the third period from operation days 598 to 749), Sulfobacillus-like microorganisms became predominant, while Ferroplasma was the only Archaea detected. These data are now being used to obtain more detailed and quantitative information on prokaryotic community structure over time and to explore the nature of the community metabolic pathways. These results extend our knowledge on microbial dynamics in bioheaps, a key issue required to improve commercial applications.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by Minera Escondida Limitada, and funds provided by Chilean Government through FONDEF project D99I1026 and FONDECYT Project 1030441 from the Science and Technology Chilean Commission (CONICYT).

(PHAEOPHYCEAE) ALONG THE CHILEAN PACIFIC COAST1,"Some species of macroalgae continue to live for extended periods of time after detachment and may even maintain reproductive structures, yet very little is known about this process. Here, we describe the presence of sporophylls (with sporogenous tissues) on floating kelp rafts of Macrocystis spp. along the coast of Chile. Surveys were conducted at nine sites (18–50° S) during austral summer 2002, and floating kelp rafts were seen and collected at seven of these nine sites (between 22 and 50° S). Fifteen (26.8%) of the 56 samples had sporophylls, indicating maintenance of sporophylls after detachment. Some of the kelp sporophytes with reproductive blades showed signs of having been afloat for long periods (indicated by the large size of attached stalked barnacles). Additionally, experiments showed that floating kelps released viable zoospores. To understand the reproductive dynamics of floating kelps, we compared these results with information from attached populations of Macrocystis spp. at nearby coastal sites. In general, attached kelp had higher proportions of sporophylls than floating rafts, suggesting that detachment may negatively affect reproductive status. Nevertheless, floating kelps remained functionally reproductive, suggesting that zoospores may be dispersed via floating rafts. Published reports on other macroalgae indicate that some species (Lessoniaceae, Fucaceae, and Sargassaceae) are fertile and probably release zoospores or zygotes while floating or drifting in ocean currents. Because dispersal distances achieved by spores of most macroalgae are relatively short, release of spores from floating algae may be an alternative mechanism of long‐distance dispersal.","We are grateful to the crews of numerous research and fishing vessels for their cheerful assistance during this study.

251,pub.1036958722,10.1017/cbo9780511535666.047,,,From nature to nurture: soil and water management for rainfed steeplands in the humid tropics,"INTRODUCTION Rainfed farming continues to expand in the humid tropics as the population grows, and natural forests are being replaced by agriculture on increasingly steep hillsides. This process may be abrupt but more often occurs through a series of gradual changes in land use: from forest modification, to shifting agriculture, through settlement mosaics and on to eventual complete forest replacement (Sayer et al., 2000). Often, the gradients in question are above theoretical legal limits for cultivation (Moldenhauer and Hudson, 1988) (Figure 38.1). The challenge is to identify and offer practical solutions for soil and water conservation in these areas that are both technically appropriate and socially acceptable. It is increasingly realised that measures must address water, fertility and production aspects simultaneously, as well as the prevention of surface erosion. These systems should be sound in technical terms so that they control damage to the soil and to the hydrological integrity of the hillsides. They should also sustain plant production. Social acceptability is the acid test of adoption: if ‘solutions’ are not attractive to land users they will not be sustained and they will not spread. Since world-wide concern with soil erosion (‘the problem’) and soil conservation (‘the solution’) spread in the 1930s and 1940s, catalysed by the great dust bowl phenomenon in the United States (Anderson, 1984), there have been significant shifts in conceptual thinking. In summary, it has been recognised that top-down schemes based on engineering techniques have largely failed to deliver.",,,,"Forests, Water and People in the Humid Tropics","M. Bonell, L. A.

suggests rotational m-mode splitting of nonradial pulsation modes as the cause.
If so, the rotation period of the star must be between 30 - 60 d. One of the
signals in the light curves of Nu Eri has a very low frequency of 0.432 c/d. It
can be a high-order combination frequency or, more likely, an independent
pulsation mode. In the latter case Nu Eri would be both a Beta Cephei star and
a slowly pulsating B (SPB) star. The photometric amplitudes of the individual
pulsation modes of Nu Eri appear to have increased by about 20 per cent over
the last 40 years. So do the amplitudes of the dominant combination frequencies
of the star. Among the latter, we only could identify sum frequencies with
certainty, not difference frequencies, which suggests that neither light-curve
distortion in its simplest form nor resonant mode coupling are their single
cause. One of our comparison stars, Mu Eridani, turned out to be variable with
a dominant time scale of 1.62 d. We believe that it is either an SPB star just
leaving its instability strip or that its variations are of rotational origin.",,,arXiv,,,,2005-01-13,2005,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Handler, G.; Shobbrook, R.

Although condoms are a necessity and are being distributed free‐of‐charge in many places, their correct use is not widespread. The objective of this field research was to investigate the connotations men and women in northern Namibia attach to condoms and HIV/AIDS in general, and investigate the myths around condoms in particular. What socio‐cultural factors make the use of condoms difficult to achieve? If condoms denote safer sex, what else do they connote among users? What implied meanings do condoms carry in relationships involving men and women? Key informant interviews, participant observations and about 24 focus group discussions were held with Owambo males and females in rural northern Namibia to assess condom use in the prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission. The study found that awareness of the disease is high and condoms are known in rural northern Namibia as a method of protection against HIV/AIDS. There are several gender differences in that women are more willing to use condoms than men. Although both men and women worry about condom use, they do so differently.

245,pub.1055598060,10.1021/ie049045p,,,Design Criteria for Soil Cleaning Operations in Electrokinetic Remediation: Hydrodynamic Aspects in an Annular Geometry,"The electrokinetic process of soil remediation is affected by different transport driving forces that are responsible for the motion of the bulk fluid and solute species. In particular, the electromechanisms, e.g., electroosmosis, electrophoresis, and electromigration, may compete with buoyancy and advection, promoting distinct flow regimes. The earlier applications of electrokinetic phenomenae.g., electroassisted drug delivery, electrophoretic separations, and material processing, just to name a few mainly in the area of electrophoresisneglected this competition, and therefore, the hydrodynamics of electrokinetic systems was considered simpler. Field test results demonstrate that this is not the case with soil cleanup processes. The unique characteristics of soil porous media call for a different approach and are in need of further analysis. In this contribution, the basic aspects of the behavior of such a system are captured by using an annular capillary model. Under the proposed geometry, a differential model is formulated using simplifying assumptions to maintain the mathematical aspects at a minimum level and a solution is presented for the different fields, e.g., the temperature and the velocity. Several numerical examples are shown to portray the flow situations found in the system for a selection of values of the parameter space. From the analysis of these graphical representations, a qualitative and semiquantitative description of the different flow regimes inside the annular channel is obtained. Particularly interesting in this study is the inclusion of a resistive heating effect in the core of the annular capillary channel as a force term. Temperature developments are explained and analyzed under different scenarios. This information is useful to identify further aspects for the investigation and to delineate a systematic approach for a more rigorous description. Implications for the design of devices and cleaning strategies are also included. The results obtained in this study are useful to promote a deeper understanding of the behavior of the system, to have a better idea about the experimental effort needed for validation of the different trends, and to lead to important guidelines for improving the separation or cleaning efficiency in a given application.","The support given to one of us (M.O.) by Universidad Catülica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile, is gratefully acknowledged.

245,pub.1121021392,10.1201/9781482265750-6,,,"Impacts on groundwater quality and water supply of the Epworth semi-formal settlement, Zimbabwe","Many developing countries experience rapid urbanization without rapid economic growth. This encourages rural to urban migration, but governments are rarely in a position to immediately service the burgeoning urban population. These trends have led to the development of informal or semiformal peri-urban settlements in the municipal areas of large cities in the developing world. This chapter presents an investigation of a semi-formal settlement as a diffuse pollution source. Epworth settlement, southeast of Harare, has characteristics of both formal and informal settlements. The settlement began developing an urban character in the 1970s and has grown and densified substantially during the past twenty years. This growth has not been accompanied by significant investments in water supply and sanitation infrastructure. A survey of water supply and sanitation practices was undertaken, and it was determined that close to half the residents use unprotected wells for water supply and over 90% use pit latrines. The problem is worst in the oldest parts of the settlement. A groundwater quality investigation was therefore undertaken in this ward. Shallow boreholes were drilled, groundwater sampled and chemical and microbiological analyses performed. The results revealed significant levels of contamination, particularly with regard to nitrates and coliform bacteria, and highest down flow in the wetland areas. Elevated levels of these parameters are most likely caused by the abundant pit latrines in Epworth, although urban agriculture could be a secondary factor influencing the nitrate levels. - Preventing further deterioration in groundwater quality requires major investment in piped sanitation. Unless this comes from central government, it will have to be self-financed and residents are unlikely to contribute to costs unless they have security of tenure. The most pragmatic short-term solution for water supply would be for the local authority to extend provision of a limited water supply, via communal taps, to be used for drinking purposes only. Zimbabwe like most developing countries, is experiencing rapid urbanization: for example the population of Harare increased from 665,000 in 1982 to 1.4 million in 2002. The urbanization process, coupled with inadequate public or private housing finance, slow economic growth and natural disasters in the rural areas, has led to the mushrooming of informal settlements. In developing countries, the subsurface environment frequently acts as a major sink for domestic waste, leading to significant degradation of groundwater quality. Rapid urbanization is associated with rapid deterioration in water quality. There are three main informal or semi-formal settlements in the Harare area: Hatcliffe Extension, Epworth and Snake Park. Epworth is the largest and oldest of these settlements, and is located to the southeast of the city of Harare, outside the city borders, but within the Harare Metropolitan Province. The Epworth settlement grew up around the Epworth Mission, established by the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe in 1900.","The data presented and discussed in this paper were collected as part of the “Harare Urban Groundwater Project” funded by WARFSA and incorporate work carried out by Mr. Zingoni and Mrs. Gandidzanwa as part of their M.Sc. studies at the University of Zimbabwe (Zingoni, 2003; Gandidzanwa, 2003).

oscillating Ap star HD 99563 and also acquired mean light observations over two
seasons. The pulsations of the star, that show flatter light maxima than
minima, can be described with a frequency quintuplet centred on 1557.653
microHertz and some first harmonics of these. The amplitude of the pulsation is
modulated with the rotation period of the star that we determine with 2.91179
+/- 0.00007 d from the analysis of the stellar pulsation spectrum and of the
mean light data. We break the distorted oscillation mode up into its pure
spherical harmonic components and find it is dominated by the l=1 pulsation,
and also has a notable l=3 contribution, with weak l=0 and 2 components. The
geometrical configuration of the star allows one to see both pulsation poles
for about the same amount of time; HD 99563 is only the fourth roAp star for
which both pulsation poles are seen and only the third where the distortion of
the pulsation modes was modelled. We point out that HD 99563 is very similar to
the well-studied roAp star HR 3831. Finally, we note that the visual companion
of HD 99563 is located in the Delta Scuti instability strip and may thus show
pulsation. We show that if the companion was physical, the roAp star would be a
2.03 solar mass object, seen at a rotational inclination of 44 degrees, which
then predicts a magnetic obliquity of 86.4 degrees.",,,arXiv,,,,2005-11-11,2005,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Handler, G.; Weiss, W. W.; Shobbrook, R. R.; Paunzen, E.; Hempel, A.; Anguma, S.

238,pub.1118972641,10.48550/arxiv.astro-ph/0502073,,,Detection of 75+ pulsation frequencies in the Delta Scuti star FG Vir,"Extensive photometric multisite campaigns of the Delta Scuti variable FG Vir
are presented. For the years 2003 and 2004, 926 hours of photometry at the
millimag precision level were obtained. The combinations with earlier campaigns
lead to excellent frequency resolution and high signal/noise. A multifrequency
analysis yields 79 frequencies. This represents a new record for this type of
star. The modes discovered earlier were confirmed. Pulsation occurs over a wide
frequency band from 5.7 to 44.3 c/d with amplitudes of 0.2 mmag or larger.
Within this wide band the frequencies are not distributed at random, but tend
to cluster in groups. A similar feature is seen in the power spectrum of the
residuals after 79 frequencies are prewhitened. This indicates that many
additional modes are excited. The interpretation is supported by a histogram of
the photometric amplitudes, which shows an increase of modes with small
amplitudes. The old question of the 'missing modes' may be answered now: the
large number of detected frequencies as well as the large number of additional
frequencies suggested by the power spectrum of the residuals con rms the
theoretical prediction of a large number of excited modes. FG Vir shows a
number of frequency combinations of the dominant mode at 12.7162 c/d (m = 0)
with other modes of relatively high photometric amplitudes. The amplitudes of
the frequency sums are higher than those of the differences. A second mode
(20.2878 c/d) also shows combinations. This mode of azimuthal order m = -1 is
coupled with two other modes of m = +1.",,,arXiv,,,,2005-02-03,2005,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Breger, M.; Lenz, P.; Antoci, V.; Guggenberger, E.; Shobbrook, R.

The relative time spent at different activities was similar for Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris, the most frequent activity being moving over the bottom (42–46% of the time), presumably in search of prey, secondly being stationary (26–27%), and thirdly digesting prey (17–20%). Capture of prey was less frequent, 13% of the time for L. polaris (mainly digging for bivalves) and 5% for A. vulgaris. Compared to L. polaris and A. vulgaris, Crossaster papposus spent more time being stationary and periods of moving were of shorter duration. Solaster endeca differed from the other sea stars because of the high proportion of time spent digesting prey (40%) and the small proportion of time spent moving (22%). Capture events were not observed for C. papposus and S. endeca, likely because they exclusively fed on epifaunal species, which were rapidly captured. For all four species, the most frequent changes between activities were between moving and being stationary.

Effect of composition and length of comonomer,"A set of copolymers of propene and alpha olefins (1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-octadecene) and the corresponding homopolymer (sPP) have been synthesized using a syndiotactic metallocene catalyst. The effect of either the incorporation or length of these conomomeric units on the structure and final properties exhibited has been analyzed. As expected, there is a considerable decrease in crystallinity with the increase of comonomer content. Thus, a completely amorphous copolymer is obtained if the molar fraction is high enough. The structural variations drastically influence the viscoelastic and mechanical behaviors of these copolymers. Three or four relaxation processes can be observed depending on composition and length of comonomer. At temperatures above the process associated with the glass transition (β relaxation), a deep drop (in one or two steps) in E′ and a shoulder in E″, overlapped with that β mechanism, are observed. The existence of a relaxation involving crystalline regions is postulated because of its variation with crystal characteristics. Moreover, a relaxation related to internal motions within the comonomeric units is seen in the range of very low temperatures. This process, primarily ascribed to movement of methylenic segments within the comonomer, is strongly depending on composition and length of the pendant aliphatic chains on incorporated units. On the other hand, a decrease in stiffness and microhardness as well as the brittle–ductile transition are observed by simply varying composition when deformation takes place at room temperature.","AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful for the financial support of Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid, Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia, CONICYT and the Exchange Collaboration Program CONICYT/CSIC (projects 07N/0093/2002, MAT2004-01547, FONDAP 11980002 and 2003CL0028, respectively).

Three levels of L2 proficiency are considered, namely those of Grade 7, Grade 12, and graduated Southern Sotho speakers of English—each group a minimum of five years apart. The purpose is to study the interaction between two similar, yet distinct consonantal systems in the process of language acquisition, viz. aspirated consonants of Southern Sotho and English. Of special theoretical interest is the fact that Southern Sotho possesses a dual system, in which presence or absence of aspiration is phonemic, in contrast with English, where aspiration is phonetically motivated and thus a predictable feature, dependent on factors such as position in a syllable, or of stress. Presence or absence of aspiration is often taken to be a notable trait characterizing the nativeness of second- language accents. The most important findings of this investigation are that VOT values of the three diverse groups do serve as a discriminative factor as long as the data sets are sufficiently large. In such large sets, the results support the general hierarchy for the place of articulation of voiceless aspirated stops in Southern Sotho as well as in the English accent of Southern Sotho speakers. When VOTs per group are considered, the pattern tends to get disturbed. On the grounds of the results, a specific kind of language interference rather than the usual one of negative language transfer is proposed. The theory of lexical frequency turns out not to be able to explain some specific findings, e.g. the behaviour of the bilabial [ph] in the English productions, especially that of the youngest group of speakers.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2005-01,2005,2012-10-24,2005-01,25,3,189-205,Closed,Article,"Wissing, Daan","Wissing, Daan (Centre for Text Technology, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, Private Bag, 6001, Potchefstroom, South Africa, E-mail:, ntldpw@puk.ac.za)",,"Wissing, Daan (North-West University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106839246,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

This article focuses on the use of one particular type of metaphor, namely animacy metaphor. It takes the form of a detailed case-study of an article in the magazine New Scientist describing a new theory of the evolution of multicellular organisms, the Snowball theory. The article fits closely into the rhetorical pattern found for informal written explanatory texts by Low (1997), with the addition of large numbers of animacy metaphors. The animacy metaphors form three clusters, which occur at salient points in the argument, serve to carry the argument forward and are increased in impact by the use of ‘resonance’ effects and metonymic overlays. The analysis further examines what happens between the metaphor clusters, where it is found that, instead of counteracting the animacy, a range of non-metaphoric devices maintain a continuously high level of animacy. The result, it is argued, represents a rhetorical imbalance: the use of animacy and metaphor without accompanying control.",,,Language and Literature International Journal of Stylistics,,,,2005-05,2005,2016-08-13,2005-05,14,2,129-148,Closed,Article,"Low, Graham","Low, Graham (University of York, UK, gdl1@york.ac.uk)",,"Low, Graham (University of York)",6,1,,5.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063904915,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4705 Literary Studies",

For the years 2003 and 2004, 926 h of photometry at the millimag precision level were obtained. The combinations with earlier campaigns lead to excellent frequency resolution and high signal/noise. A multifrequency analysis yields 79 frequencies. This represents a new record for this type of star. The modes discovered earlier were confirmed.
Pulsation occurs over a wide frequency band from 5.7 to 44.3 c/d with amplitudes of 0.2 mmag or larger. Within this wide band the frequencies are not distributed at random, but tend to cluster in groups. A similar feature is seen in the power spectrum of the residuals after 79 frequencies are prewhitened. This indicates that many additional modes are excited. The interpretation is supported by a histogram of the photometric amplitudes, which shows an increase of modes with small amplitudes. The old question of the “missing modes” may be answered now: the large number of detected frequencies as well as the large number of additional frequencies suggested by the power spectrum of the residuals confirms the theoretical prediction of a large number of excited modes.
FG Vir shows a number of frequency combinations of the dominant mode at 12.7162 c/d () with other modes of relatively high photometric amplitudes. The amplitudes of the frequency sums are higher than those of the differences. A second mode (20.2878 c/d) also shows combinations.

At sub‐catchment level, the dynamics of erosional features were investigated by means of aerial photographs. At site level, the changes in soil physical and chemical properties were investigated by means of a fence‐line contrast study. Attention was paid to both surface and subsurface erosion phenomena. The number of erosional features in the study area in 2000 was not substantially different from the number of features in 1945. At sub‐catchment level, an increase in the number of gullies was observed from 1975 to 2000 but this followed a substantial inactivation of most erosional features from 1962 to 1975. Increases in erosional activity in 1962 compared to 1945 were mainly related to abandoned cultivated fields. At site level, a significant decrease in soil C/N ratio was observed within the fenced site within three years. For the same site, total carbon, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were not significantly different for the topsoil inside the fenced area compared with outside. Subsurface erosion phenomena mainly occur in the communal grazing areas and are mostly related to transitions between permeable and less permeable layers. The complex relationships between soil erosion, land use change and climate might further be understood by involving local people in the development, monitoring and evaluation of alternative types of land use, which is also likely to facilitate future steps in controlled grazing management.

Spatial and temporal patterns of distribution were evaluated seasonally for adult and juvenile sporophytes of both species between 1996 and 2003. These two kelp form an assemblage distributed between 2 and 15 m depth, with disjunct patterns along a bathymetric gradient, including two morphs of L. trabeculata, the occurrence of which depends on the presence or absence of M. integrifolia. During the 1997-1998 El Nio the spatial-temporal patterns of abundance of the kelp assemblage were maintained by the continuity of coastal upwelling, which buffered and moderated superficial warming of the sea and depletion of nutrients. In this context, localities associated with coastal upwelling areas could function as ""sources"" of reproductive propagules after passage of El Nio, thus increasing kelp recolonization rates in ""sink"" localities, which suffered local kelp extinctions. Intensification of upwelling processes after the 1998-2000 La Nia increased nutrient inputs into subtidal habitats, favoring the productivity of the kelp assemblage. However, an abrupt change in the spatial-temporal patterns of abundance of the black sea urchin Tetrapygus niger, the most conspicuous benthic grazer in northern Chile, produced local extinctions of M. integrifolia and compression of the range of bathymetric distribution of L. trabeculata. Top-down (mortality of benthic carnivores during the 1997-1998 El Nio) and bottom-up effects (intensity and frequency of upwelling) in this subtidal coastal ecosystem appear to regulate the kelp-herbivore interactions in the study area. The main sources of reproductive propagules for the re-establishment of the assemblage kelp were fertile sporophytes which included isolated, low density patches of M.integrifolia located within the bed of L. trabeculata, although drifting kelp rafts and ""seed banks"" of microscopic dormant stages may provide supplementary recruitment. In the temperate SE Pacific, oceanographic events that act on different spatial-temporal scales plus low frequency biological processes (changes in grazer abundance), which act on local scales, produce inter-annual variability in the long-term dymanics of kelp populations. Furthermore, the interactive effects between centers of permanent upwelling and the oscillating temporal periodicity of oceanographic events that produce positive (El Nio) and negative (La Nia) thermal anomalies modify the spatial arrangement of subtidal kelp populations on a latitudinal gradient Este trabajo describe la biologa poblacional de Macrocystis integrifolia y Lessonia trabeculata durante y despus de El Nio 1997-1998, en un rea de surgencia costera permanente en el norte de Chile. Los patrones de distribucin espacio-temporales de esporofitos adultos y juveniles de ambos huiros fueron evaluados estacionalmente entre 1996 y 2003. Ambos huiros conforman un ensamble que se distribuye entre 2-15 m de profundidad con patrones disjuntos a lo largo del gradiente batimtrico, y con dos morfos de L. trabeculata que dependen de la presencia o ausencia de M. integrifolia. Durante El Nio 1997-1998, los patrones espacio-temporales de abundancia del ensamble de huiros son mantenidos por la continuidad de los procesos de surgencia costera que amortiguan y moderan el calentamiento superficial del mar y la disminucin de nutrientes. En este contexto, despus de un evento El Nio las localidades asociadas a reas con surgencia permanente pueden funcionar como reas ""fuentes"" productora de propgulos reproductivos incrementando la tasa de recolonizacin en reas ""sumideros"" adyacentes donde se produjo extincin local de huiros. Durante La Nia 1998-2000, la intensificacin de los procesos de surgencia incrementa la entrada de nutrientes hacia hbitat submareales favoreciendo la productividad del ensamble de huiros. Sin embargo, un repentino cambio en los patrones espacio-temporales de Tetrapygus niger (erizo negro), el pastoreador bentnico ms conspicuo del norte de Chile, produjo la extincin local de M. integrifolia y la compresin del rango de distribucin batimtrica de L. trabeculata. Efectos cascada abajo (mortalidad de carnvoros bentnicos durante El Nio 1997-1998) y cascada arriba (intensidad y frecuencia de surgencia) en este ecosistema submareal costero parecen regular la interaccin huiros-herbvoros en el rea de estudio. La principal fuente productora de propgulos para el reestablecimiento del ensamble proviene de esporofitos frtiles que configuran parches aislados de baja densidad de M. integrifolia ubicados dentro de la pradera de L. trabeculata, aunque huiros flotando a la deriva y ""bancos de semilla"" de estados latentes microscpicos podran actuar como estrategias complementarias. En el Pacfico Sudamericano temperado, eventos oceanogrficos que actan a distintas escalas espacio-temporales y procesos biolgicos estocsticos de baja frecuencia (cambios en la abundancia de pastoreadores) que actan a escala local, generan variabilidad interanual en la dinmica de las poblaciones de huiros a largo plazo.

225,pub.1011694374,10.1016/j.jembe.2005.05.004,,,Induction of defenses and within-alga variation of palatability in two brown algae from the northern-central coast of Chile: Effects of mesograzers and UV radiation,"Macroalgae possess different defense mechanisms in response to herbivory. Some species produce anti-herbivore secondary metabolites, but production of these substances can be costly. Therefore, algae may produce defensive metabolites only in response to herbivory (inducible defense) or defend particular parts of the alga differentially (within-alga variation). In the present study, we examined whether two species of brown algae from the SE-Pacific show evidence of inducible chemical defense (non-polar compounds) or within-alga variation of defense, which we estimated in form of palatability of differently treated algae to amphipod grazers (with live algae and agar-based food containing non-polar algal extracts). In Glossophora kunthii (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, we observed an increase in palatability after algae were acclimated for 12 days without grazers. Subsequent addition of grazers for 12 days then resulted in a reduction of palatability indicating the existence of inducible defense. After removal of grazers for 12 days, these induced effects again disappeared. The reaction of G. kunthii was triggered even by the mere presence of grazers, which suggests that this alga can respond to waterborne cues by reducing palatability. Effects were only found for agar-based food containing non-polar extracts, but not for live algae, suggesting that some parts of the algae are undefended. Our second experiment on within-alga variation confirmed that only apical (growth region) and basal parts (near the holdfast region) of G. kunthii are defended against herbivores. For the second species, Macrocystis integrifolia Bory, the first experiment revealed no induction of defense, while the second experiment on within-alga variation showed that amphipods avoided basal parts and in particular stipes of M. integrifolia but only in live algae. Although both studied algal species differed substantially in their defensive strategies, their reaction was independent of the presence or absence of UV radiation. Thus, it appears that UV effects play only a minor role in anti-herbivore defense, which is in accordance with most previous studies.","AcknowledgementsWe thank Dr. Juan Macchiavello for the use of the Marine Botany Laboratory at the Universidad Cátolica del Norte of Coquimbo; Nelson Vásquez and Pabla Ugalde for their assistance in the laboratory and field.

The geochemical features of the fluid discharges characterizing this system mainly consist of boiling pools and fumaroles, and represent the result of a complex mixing process involving 3 main components: (i) hydrothermal; (ii) atmospheric; (iii) magmatic. Chemical reactions involving light hydrocarbons equilibrate at higher temperature than those directly measured in the geothermal wells and calculated on the basis of the composition of the inorganic gas species. This suggests that in the deeper parts of the hydrothermal system temperatures higher than 300°C may be achieved. Such results can have a strong impact for the evaluation of the potential resources of this geothermal system. Moreover, the chemical characteristics of the organic gas fraction allow the assessment of the chemical–physical conditions governing the geochemical processes acting on geothermal fluids at depth.","AcknowledgementsThis work has partly been supported by A.S.I.

Adult individuals were collected from the wild after they had been exposed to the ambient autumn photoperiod cue (which is the extraneous trigger thought to elicit gametogenesis in this species) and placed at ambient temperature for 12 weeks under five different photoperiod regimes: (1) 24 h light:0 h dark=“0D”, (2) 16 h light:8 h dark=“8D”, (3) 8 h light:16 h dark=“16D”, (4) 0 h light:24 h dark=“24D”, and (5) ambient photoperiod (range: 10.50–15.25 h dark). Urchins in these five treatments were fed ad libitum with bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana. A sixth treatment consisted of starved individuals held under 0D conditions. Various gonad factors including gonad index, percent gonad water, gonad colour (CIE lightness or L*, CIE hue or a*, and CIE chroma or b*), percent area occupation of the gonad by various cell types (nutritive phagocytes, spermatozoa, and secondary oocytes/ova), and stage of development were assessed at the beginning of the experiment and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 of the study. Consumption and assimilation rates were assessed at weeks 4 and 12 and absorption efficiency at week 12 of the experiment. Urchins were predominantly in the growing and premature stages at the beginning of the experiment, but by week 4 at least 20% of individuals in all treatments receiving food were classified as mature. Spawning occurred during all these treatments between weeks 4 and 8, as evidenced by significant decreases in spermatozoa and secondary oocytes/ova and a significant decrease in percent gonad water, but was not accompanied by major declines in gonad indices. Greater than 90% of individuals in all five of the fed treatments were in the recovering and growing stages at the end of the experiment. The 16D treatment had by far the greatest percentage of urchins in the growing stage. In contrast, individuals that were starved were predominantly in the mature stage at weeks 4, 8, and 12, with only ~30% reaching the spawning stage by the end of the experiment. Photoperiod significantly affected gonad indices at the termination of the experiment with gonad index being the highest in the 16D treatment; this was significantly greater than in the 8D and ambient treatments. Photoperiod did not significantly affect gonad percent water, gonad lightness, or gonad hue. Gonad chroma was significantly affected by photoperiod, urchins held under ambient conditions having significantly lower b* readings than individuals in any other treatment. Photoperiod had little or no affect on consumption rate, assimilation rate, or absorption efficiency. Thus, differences among treatments in regards to gonad index, gonad chroma, and stage of development cannot be attributed to variations in feeding, absorption, or assimilation. The results of this experiment indicate that once gametogenesis is initiated, photoperiod manipulation cannot prevent ultimate spawning. However, photoperiod regime can affect the rate at which urchins move through the various stages of the gametogenic cycle. Urchins placed on short days under artificial lighting (16D) moved through the spawning stage into recovering and growing stages the fastest. This photoperiod regime also produced the highest gonad index at the end of the experiment. Since the commercial urchin market prefers large gonads in the growing and premature stages (i.e. before the mature stage is reached and gonads start leaking sperm and eggs), short day-lengths under artificial lighting (16D) appear to be the best photoperiod conditions for optimizing marketability.","Funding for this research was provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

Health and safety standards tend to vary across countries, depending on the state of infrastructures, technological development, and exploration and development priorities within the sector. Following an overview of hypotheses on work accident exposure and related earnings differentials, the analysis examines the rationale for testing some of these hypotheses through alternative panel data models, by eventually accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, weak exogeneity and persistence. Regressions are estimated on an unbalanced panel of 12 industrial and developing economies. Factors related to the local economy and institutional background, are found to explain varying levels of the two dependent variables across time and space. Mine fatal injury exposure appears to decline with increasing levels of development and higher private investment rates. Earnings differentials with other sectors tend to widen with a large mining sector and high rates of unemployment. The hypothesis that differentials in gross earnings in mining relative to other economic sectors are also determined by increased fatal accident risk is not substantiated by econometric estimates.","AcknowledgementsThe author is grateful to an anonymous referee for useful comments on an earlier version, and to UKSW (Card.

Detailed field mapping of the Mesozoic Atacama fault system in the Coastal Cordillera of Northern Chile documents the progressive development of second- and third-order faults forming a duplex at a dilational jog between two overstepping master faults: the sinistral strike-slip, NNW-striking, Jorgillo and Bolfin faults. These are constituted by a meter-wide core of foliated S-C ultracataclasite and cataclasite, flanked by a damage zone of protocataclasite, splay faults and veins. Lateral separation of markers along master faults is on the order of a few kilometers. Second-order, NW-striking, oblique-slip subsidiary fault zones do not show foliated ultracataclasite; lateral sinistral separations are in the range of ∼10 to 200 m with a relatively minor normal dip-slip component. In turn, third-order, east–west striking normal faults exhibit centimetric displacement. Oblique-slip (sinistral–normal) fault zones located at the southern termination of the Bolfin fault form a well-developed imbricate fan structure. They exhibit a relatively simple architecture of extensional and extensional-shear fractures bound by low displacement shear fractures. Kinematic analysis of fault slip data from mesoscopic faults within the duplex area, document that the NW-striking and the EW-striking faults accommodate transtension and extension, respectively. Examination of master and subsidiary faults of the duplex indicates a strong correlation between total displacement and internal fault structure. Faults started from arrays of en echelon extensional/extensional-shear fractures that then coalesced into throughgoing strike-slip faults. Further displacement leads to the formation of discrete bands of cataclasite and ultracataclasite that take up a significant part of the total displacement. We interpret that the duplex formed by progressive linkage of horsetail-like structures at the southern tip of the Bolfin fault that joined splay faults coming from the Jorgillo and Coloso faults. The geometry and kinematics of faults is compared with that observed in analog models to gain an insight into the kinematic processes leading to complex strike-slip fault zones in the upper crust.","AcknowledgementsThis research has been funded by Fondecyt Project 1020436 (JC) and Fundación Andes Project C13755(12) (GG).

Since poor data on illegal migration to the United States make direct measurement difficult, data on migration within Mexico, where census data permit careful analysis, are used instead to evaluate the mechanism behind predictions on migration to the United States. Specifications are provided for migration within Mexico, incorporating measures of cost of living, amenities, and networks. Contrary to much of the literature, labor market variables enter very significantly and as predicted once possible credit constraint effects are controlled for. Greater exposure to fdi and trade deters outmigration, with the effects working partly through the labor market. Finally, some tentative inferences are presented about the impact of increased fdi on Mexico–U.S. migration. On average, a doubling of fdi inflows leads to a 1.5–2 percent drop in migration.","The authors thank Jaime de Melo, Gordon Hanson, and Raymond Robertson for insightful comments and Gabriel Montes Rojas and Lucas Siga for expert research assistance.",,The World Bank Economic Review,,,,2005-01-01,2005,2005-12-06,2005-01-01,19,3,449-472,All OA; Green,Article,"Aroca, Patricio; Maloney, William F.","Aroca, Patricio (Patricio Aroca is a professor and director of the Institute for Applied Regional Economy (IDEAR), at the Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; his email address is, paroca@ucn.cl, .); Maloney, William F.

One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Coastal Cordillera is a suite of EW topographic scarps located between 19° and 21.6°S latitude. These scarps are associated with predominantly south dipping reverse faults that have almost pure dip slip and produce shortening parallel to the plate boundary. Limited geochronology as well as more regional studies indicate that the scarps formed during the late Miocene and early Pliocene, though some show activity extending into the Quaternary. In several areas, the scarps dammed local drainages, producing internally drained basins that accumulated evaporites. This relationship indicates that the Coastal Cordillera was probably moister during the Late Miocene and Pliocene than it is today and also indicates that the Coastal Cordillera has been significantly uplifted or that the Coastal Escarpment of northern Chile has advanced significantly eastward since the Pliocene. The limited latitudinal extent of the EW scarps and their location symmetrically about the axis of topographic and Wadati-Benioff zone symmetry suggest that they owe their origin to the concave seaward shape of the continental margin due to prior formation of the Bolivian orocline.",,,Geological Society of America Bulletin,,,,2005,2005,,2005,117,1-2,89-104,Closed,Article,"Allmendinger, Richard W.; González, Gabriel; Yu, Jennifer; Hoke, Greg; Isacks, Bryan","Allmendinger, Richard W.

We use accumulation rates and concentrations of diatoms and silicoflagellates, organic carbon (Corg) and biogenic opal (SiOPAL) as proxies of export production, and fluctuations in the contribution of freshwater diatoms as proxies of rainfall in the hinterland and river runoff. Box core sediments collected at two sites within the Puyuhuapi Channel were analyzed: Station 35 (at the head of the fjord; 56 m water depth) and Station 40 (in the middle of the Channel; 270 m water depth). Surface sedimentation rates were 0.75 cm yr-1 at Station 35 and 0.25 cm yr-1 at Station 40. SiOPAL content averaged ~ 4 % at both sites. Diatom accumulation rates as well as the contribution of freshwater diatoms were higher at the head of the fjord (1.59 10(10) valves m-2 yr-1 and 22 %, respectively) than in its middle (1.08 10(10) valves m_2 yr_1 and 14 %, respectively). Diatom abundances were two orders of magnitude higher than silicoflagellate contribution at both sites. In general, diatoms typical of high nutrient environments characterize the Puyuhuapi Channel sediments: at both sites, spores of the genus Chaetoceros dominated the diatom assemblage (> 40 % of total diatoms; spores of Chaetoceros radicans/cinctus, Ch. constrictus/vanheurcki, Ch. debilis and Ch. diadema). Downcore analysis reveals an overall increase in the production of siliceous microorganisms from the late 19th century to the early 1980s, and then a decrease until the late-1990s. We associate a decrease in freshwater diatom contribution since the mid-1970s which we associate with a concomitant decline in rainfall in the Chilean fjords. We suggest that this decline is related to the global atmospheric and oceanic warming of the past ~ 25 years Se presenta una reconstruccin de 100 aos de la productividad silcea exportada en sedimentos del canal Puyuhuapi (44 S, 70 O) en los fiordos chilenos.

The article first shows that divergence has emerged in the form of several income clusters that only partially correspond to traditional geographic regions. Next, when regions are defined by spatial correlation in incomes, a “south” clearly exists, but the “north” seems to be restricted to the states directly on the U.S. border and there is no “center” region. Overall, the principal dynamic of both the increased spatial dependency and the increased divergence lies not on the border but in the sustained underperformance of the southern states, starting before the North American Free-Trade Agreement, and to a lesser extent in the superior performance of an emerging convergence club in the north-center of the country.","The authors thank Gerardo Esquivel, Jaime de Melo, Gordon Hanson, Daniel Lederman, Miguel Messmacher, Raymond Robertson, and Lucas Siga for helpful discussions.

Volcanism started at approximately 0.3 Ma, with dominantly mafic effusions, and expressed ultimately in post-glacial and historic dacite–rhyolite eruptions (1921–1922 and 1960). Three NE-trending gravimetric profiles were carried out across the depression of Cordón Caulle, yielding a residual negative anomaly with the greatest amplitude (−20 mGal) at the center of the depression. A 2D-gravity model given by a 490 m thick shallow body with a density contrast=−650 kg/m3, interpreted as a shallow package of dacite–rhyolite lavas and tephra, was found to match the residual anomaly. A dense rock equivalent volume of felsic material on the order of 28 km3 (25% of the total output of Cordón Caulle) is derived from this thickness. Previous workers explain the origin of felsic rocks at Cordón Caulle in terms of the orientation of the borders of Cordón Caulle relative to the maximum stress direction σ1 (i.e. NE-trending) prevailing during the Quaternary, according to which NW-trending domains were compressional, favoring stagnation, storage and differentiation of magmas. The dominantly monogenetic style of volcanism, the plateau-like morphology and the negative Bouguer anomaly, on the contrary, are interpreted as an indication of extensional tectonics. Intra-arc extension is proposed to be related to coseismic or postseismic stress relaxation accompanying major thrust events, such as the great 1960 Chilean earthquake, which is consistent, at Cordón Caulle, with the direction of propagation of dikes of the 1960 eruption (i.e. coseismic extension) and present-day subsidence inferred from InSAR data (i.e. postseismic extension). Prior to the Quaternary (8.2–1.6 Ma), nearly east-west compression prevailed at the intra-arc zone. A 5.44±0.04 Ma old granodiorite intrusion bracketed by two sub-parallel branches of the regional, margin-parallel Liquiñe–Ofqui Fault Zone (LOFZ) in a prominent pop-up structure, 15 km to the east of Cordón Caulle, accounts for reverse reactivation of the LOFZ and rapid fault-related exhumation of basement rocks (>1 mm/year). We argue that under compression, reverse reactivation of the LOFZ was facilitated by the combined effect of cyclic increase in fluid pressure induced by magmatic–hydrothermal input, and removal of lithostatic load induced by glacial erosion (>1.5 mm/year in the vicinity of Cordón Caulle).","AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank CONICYT (National Council of Science and Technology, CHILE) for financial support through the FONDEF Grant No. 1051 “Characterization and Assessment of Geothermal Resources of Central and Southern Chile: Possibilities of Generation of Electric Energy and Direct Applications”.

However, there must be other forces at work because observed compliance levels cannot be fully explained by the level of enforcement actions typical of most tax authorities. Further, there are observed differences, not related to enforcement effort, in the levels of compliance across countries and cultures. To fully understand differences in compliance behavior across cultures one needs to understand differences in tax administration and citizen attitudes toward governments. The working hypothesis is that cross-cultural differences in behavior have foundations in these institutions. Tax compliance is a complex behavioral issue and its investigation requires the use of a variety of methods and data sources. Results from laboratory experiments conducted in different countries demonstrate that observed differences in tax compliance levels can be explained by differences in the fairness of tax administration, in the perceived fiscal exchange, and in the overall attitude towards the respective governments. These experimental results are shown to be robust by replicating them for the same countries using survey response measures of ""tax morale.""",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2005,2005,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Cummings, Ronald C.; Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge; McKee, Michael; Torgler, Benno","Cummings, Ronald C.

184,pub.1068923955,10.2113/100.1.0131,,,Alunite in the Pascua-Lama High-Sulfidation Deposit: Constraints on Alteration and Ore Deposition Using Stable Isotope Geochemistry,"The Pascua-Lama high-sulfidation system, located in the El Indio-Pascua belt of Chile and Argentina, contains over 16 million ounces (Moz) Au and 585 Moz Ag. The deposit is hosted primarily in granite rocks of Triassic age with mineralization occurring in several discrete Miocene-age phreatomagmatic breccias and related fracture networks. The largest of these areas is Brecha Central, which is dominated by a mineralizing assemblage of alunite-pyrite-enargite and precious metals. Several stages of hydrothermal alteration related to mineralization are recognized, including all types of alunite-bearing advanced argillic assemblages (magmatic-hydrothermal, steam-heated, magmatic steam, and supergene). The occurrence of alunite throughout the paragenesis of this epithermal system is unusual and detailed radiometric, mineralogical, and stable isotope studies provide constraints on the timing and nature of alteration and mineralization of the alunite-pyrite-enargite assemblage in the deposit. Early (preore) alteration occurred prior to ca. 9 Ma and consists of intense silicic and advanced argillic assemblages with peripheral argillic and widespread propylitic zones. Alunite of this stage occurs as fine intergrowths of alunite-quartz ± kaolinite, dickite, and pyrophyllite that selectively replaced feldspars in the host rock. Stable isotope systematics suggest a magmatic-hydrothermal origin with a dominantly magmatic fluid source. Alunite is coeval with the main stage of Au-Ag-Cu mineralization (alunite-pyrite-enargite assemblage ore), which has been dated at approximately 8.8 Ma. Ore-stage alunite has an isotopic signature similar to preore alunite, and Δ34Salun-py data indicate depositional temperatures of 245° to 305°C. The δD and δ18O data exclude significant involvement of meteoric water during mineralization and indicate that the assemblage formed from H2S-dominated magmatic fluids. Thick steam-heated alteration zones are preserved at the highest elevations in the deposit and probably formed from oxidation of H2S during boiling of the magmatic ore fluids. Coarsely crystalline magmatic steam alunite (8.4 Ma) is restricted to the near-surface portion of Brecha Central. Postmineral alunite ± jarosite were previously interpreted to be supergene crosscutting veins and overgrowths, although stable isotope data suggest a mixed magmatic-meteoric origin for this late-stage alteration. Only late jarosite veinlets (8.0 Ma) associated with fine-grained pseudocubic alunite have a supergene isotopic signature. The predominance of magmatic fluids recorded throughout the paragenesis of the Pascua system is atypical for high-sulfidation deposits, which typically involve significant meteoric water in near-surface and peripheral alteration and, in some systems, even ore deposition. At Pascua, the strong magmatic signature of both alteration and main-stage (alunite-pyrite-enargite assemblage) ore is attributed to limited availability of meteoric fluids. This is in agreement with published data for the El Indio-Pascua belt, indicating an event of uplift and subsequent pediment incision, as well as a transition from semiarid to arid climatic conditions, during the formation of the deposit in the mid to late Miocene.",,,Economic Geology,,,,2005-01-01,2005,,2005-01-01,100,1,131-148,All OA; Green,Article,"Deyell, C.

El registro de siete asentamientos formativos tardos datados por C14 en los extremos perifricos de la cuenca de Atacama, asociados a quebradas estrechas esencialmente pastoralistas (Puripica y Tuln), dan cuenta de un proceso expansivo orientado a equilibrar la productividad agraria y pecuaria.

Extensive farming activities must have been consolidated during the phases following the Early Formative Period, that is, from about 0 to 500 A.D., as seen in complex, 14C-dated settlements in the foothill oases: Tulor-1 (380 B.C. - 200 A.D.) and Coyo-Aldea (660 - 995 A.D.). I propose that in order to access the herding production derived from the Tilocalar Phase, which was little adapted to the warm oases, during the Late Formative Period the inhabitants of the region controlled the plains of the salar, the intermediate canyons, and the high puna through a complementary transhumant regime. At this time, sociopolitical leadership of the system was situated in the oases of San Pedro de Atacama. The record of seven 14C-dated settlements in the extreme peripheries of the Atacama Basin, associated with narrow, essentially pastoral canyons (Puripica and Tuln), demonstrates an expansive process aimed at balancing farming and herding productivity. In this sense, I propose that the post-Tilocalar occupation of the grassland (forrajero) hinterland occurred through the foundation of villages that shared similarities in architecture, artifacts, environments, and chronologies, spreading from the nuclear community at San Pedro de Atacama",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2005-12,2005,2005-12,,37,2,165-193,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nez, Lautaro","Nez, Lautaro (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)",,"Nez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North)",35,2,,2.27,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v37n2/art06.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028776275,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 44 Human Society,

We argue that in both census processes, which were based on self-ascribed concepts of ""culture"" and ""people"", respectively, heterogeneous and ever-transforming perceptions and collective identifications are made evident. An interpretation of this issue is drawn from the highly diverse socio-historic shaping of identifications and senses of collective belonging that characterize the indigenous populations in the country. In addition, we consider the sudden changes on conscience and the valuation of cultural difference between both census processes. Equally important is the referential shift from culture to people since, in terms of self-ascription, the later concept is semantically more restrictive than the former. One of the most relevant implications of this analysis lies in the fact that the premise of a direct relationship between ethnic self-ascription and objective biographic basis is only partially fulfilled.

160,pub.1070754710,10.2343/geochemj.39.547,,,"New chemical and original isotopic data on waters from El Tatio geothermal field, northern Chile","The El Tatio geothermal field is located at an height of 4200-4300 m on the Cordillera de los Andes (Altiplano). Geysers, hot pools and mudpots in the geothermal field and local meteoric waters were sampled in April 2002 and analyzed for major and trace elements, δ2H, δ18O and 3H of water, δ34S and δ18O of dissolved sulfate, δ13C of dissolved total carbonate, and 87Sr/86Sr ratio of aqueous strontium. There are two different types of thermal springs throughout the field, that are chloride-rich water and sulfate-rich water. The chemical composition of chloride springs is controlled by magma degassing and by water-rock interaction processes. Sulfate springs are fed by shallow meteoric water heated by ascending gases. In keeping with the geodynamic setting and nature of the reservoir rocks, chloride water is rich in As, B, Cs, Li; on the other hand, sulfate water is enriched only in B relative to local meteoric water. Alternatively to a merely meteoric model, chloride waters can be interpreted as admixtures of meteoric and magmatic (circa andesitic) water, which moderately exchanges oxygen isotopes with rocks at a chemical Na/K temperature of about 270°C in the main reservoir, and then undergoes loss of vapor (and eventually mixing with shallow water) and related isotopic effects during ascent to the surface. These chloride waters do not present tritium and can be classified as sub-modern (pre-1952). A chloride content of 5,400 mg/l is estimated in the main reservoir, for which δ2H and δ18O values, respectively of -78‰ and -6.9‰, are calculated applying the multistage-steam separation isotopic effects between liquid and vapor. From these data, the meteoric recharge (Cl≈0 mg/l) of the main reservoir should approach a composition of -107‰ in δ2H and -14.6‰ in δ18O, when a magmatic water of δ2H = -20‰, δ18O = +10‰ and Cl = 17,500 mg/l is assumed. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the hot springs are quite uniform (0.70876 to 0.70896), with values within the range observed for dacites of the Andean central volcanic zone. A water δ18O-87Sr/86 Sr model was developed for the main geothermal reservoir, by which a meteoric-magmatic composition of the fluids is not excluded. The uniform δ34S(SO42-) values of +1.4 to +2.6‰ in the chloride waters agree with a major deep-seated source for sulfur, possibly via hydrolysis in the geothermal reservoir of sulfur dioxide provided by magma degassing, followed by isotopic exchange between sulfate and sulfide in the main reservoir. This interpretation is supported by the largely negative δ34S(SO42-) value in steam-heated water sulfate (-9.8‰) and mass-balance calculation, which exclude leaching at depth of igneous iron-sulfides with δ34S near zero per mill. All the δ13C values of total carbonate in the chloride waters are negative, with variable values from -9.2 to -20.1‰, pointing to an important proportion of biogenic carbon in the fluids.

(<21 to >2.7Ma). Contractional activity deformed late Oligocene tuffaceous, fluvial, or distal alluvial deposits of the uppermost Lupica Formation; fluvial and lacustrine deposits of the Miocene Chucal Formation; tuffaceous and coarse fluvial deposits of the Quebrada Macusa Formation; and the lower part of the westernmost, latest Miocene?—Pliocene, essentially lacustrine Lauca Formation. It controlled the paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental conditions in which these units were deposited. More humid conditions on the east side of the Chapiquiña-Belén ridge favored the development of an abundant mammal fauna and flora. The deformation is characterized by the Jaropilla thrust fault and the Chucal anticline, which is east of the fault. Deformation on the Chucal anticline began before the deposition of the Chucal Formation and was controlled by a blind thrust fault. The west flank has a nearly constant dip (45–50°) to the west and nearly continuous stratigraphic units, whereas on the east flank, the dip angle is variable, diminishing away from the axis, and the stratigraphic units are discontinuous. The anticline growth on this flank caused the development of three observable progressive unconformities. Deformation was particularly rapid during the deposition of the ∼600m thick Chucal Formation (between the 21.7±0.8Ma old uppermost Lupica Formation and the 17.5±0.4Ma old base of the Quebrada Macusa Formation, a 4 m.y. period). The deformation rate decreased during the deposition of both (1) the ∼200m thick Quebrada Macusa Formation (between the 17.5±0.4Ma age of its basal deposits and the ∼11Ma age of its uppermost levels, a 7 m.y. period) and (2) the lower Lauca Formation (between the ∼11Ma age of the upper Quebrada Macusa Formation and the 2.3±0.7Ma old Lauca ignimbrite, which is intercalated within its middle part). We interpret the contractional deformation to be associated with tectonic activity that led to the uplift of the Altiplano; however, paleobotanical evidence does not indicate any major altitude changes during the time period considered here but rather suggests that rapid uplift took place after the deposition of the Quebrada Macusa Formation.","AcknowledgementsThis study is part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort designed to understand the evolution of Andean (altiplano) uplift in northern Chile and western Bolivia and the associated tectonic, geomorphologic, sedimentary, paleogeographic, faunistic, floristic, and climatic effects.

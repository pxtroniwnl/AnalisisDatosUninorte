The resulting materials were synthetized following a polymerization in situ scheme and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetry (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The effect of different loads of graphene and nanodiamond on the resulting nanocomposite was studied. Despite the presence of the host materials, the formation of Polyaniline polymer is successfully accomplished for all samples. The microstructure of the resulting materials is core-shell type with the additives being covered (core) by layers of the conjugated polymer (shell). The thermal stability of the nanocomposites is improved as confirmed by measuring an increase on the Temperature of Decomposition and the Cross-Linking Temperature compared to bare polymer. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the presence of the additives does not affect the electroactive behaviour of the matrix polymer allowing it to reversely shift from different oxidation stages. The effect of additive content on the charge transfer kinetics is discussed.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",,,,Volume 14: Emerging Technologies; Safety Engineering and Risk Analysis; Materials: Genetics to Structures,,,2015-11-13,2015,2016-03-07,2015-11-13,,,v014t11a032-v014t11a032,Closed,Proceeding,"Perozo, Danny Illera; Vega, Humberto Gómez; Martínez, Julian Yepes","Perozo, Danny Illera (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vega, Humberto Gómez (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martínez, Julian Yepes (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Perozo, Danny Illera (Universidad del Norte); Vega, Humberto Gómez (Universidad del Norte); Martínez, Julian Yepes (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092992480,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Ever since the pioneering studies, parasites were identified in archaeological and palaeontological remains, some preserved for millions of years by fossilization. However, the palaeoparasitological record consists mainly of parasites found specifically in human archaeological material, preserved in ancient occupation sites, from prehistory until closer to 2015. The results include some helminth intestinal parasites still commonly found in 2015, such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms, besides others such as Amoebidae and Giardia intestinalis, as well as viruses, bacteria, fungi and arthropods. These parasites as a whole provide important data on health, diet, climate and living conditions among ancient populations.

2080,pub.1097149552,10.1061/9780784479162.140,,,An Experimental Design Based Methodology for Calibrating 2D Hidromorphodynamic Numerical Models for Rivers,"The confidence level of a numerical model is strongly related to the calibration and validation processes and the quality of their adjustment. Typically, numerical 2D models for rivers that involve hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphology processes are calibrated sequentially under the assumption that the morphology changes do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics. However, in some cases, the morphologic processes modify substantially the hydrodynamic due to the quick bed level accession and erosion as a function of the hydrological regime. These changes require a more efficient procedure reduce the amount of scenarios with indicators that allow to asset the quality of the calibration. This paper shows a methodology proposed to take into account the interaction of hydrodynamic, sedimentology and morphology in rivers based on an experimental design that allow evaluating simultaneously the significance and the sensitivity of the variables in order to select the best set of scenarios based on quantitative and qualitative indicators. The methodology was implemented in the Magdalena River and the Meta River in Colombia, which have different hydromorphodynamic conditions. The calibration and validation was supported with field data of water elevation, velocity vectors obtained by ADCP, flow rate measurements, sediment transport, and bed level changes, showing that is applicable either to straight, meandered, or braided rivers.",,,,World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015,,,2015-05-14,2015,2015-05-14,2015-05-15,,,1419-1431,Closed,Proceeding,"Acuña, Guillermo; Ávila, Humberto","Acuña, Guillermo (Ph.D. Student, Dept. of Civil Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia.

The range of variables was 8 to 13 mm for particle size, 0.8–1.4m/s for air velocity, and updraft or downdraft for the reactor type. It was found that the particle size and air velocity factors were the most significant in the optimization of the output variable, syngas heating value. A heating value of 2.69MJ / Nm3 was obtained using a fixed bed downdraft reactor, with a particle size of 13 mm and 1.4 m/s for air speed; verification of the optimum point of operation under these conditions verified that these operating conditions favor the production of a gas with a high energy value.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",,,,Volume 6A: Energy,,,2015-11-13,2015,2016-03-07,2015-11-13,,,v06at07a015-v06at07a015,Closed,Proceeding,"Ahumada, Luz M.; Verdeza, Arnaldo; Bula, Antonio J.","Ahumada, Luz M.

1923,pub.1092782048,10.1115/imece2015-51913,,,MPC Control of Dynamic PEM Fuel Cell System,"This paper presents, an open cathode fuel cell dynamic model and an advanced control system design that allows to study the transient response of the system and its nonlinearities. The model can be used to design control strategies and design test benches to test fuel cells stacks. A dynamic performance characterization is performed (transient response to disturbances or setpoint changes), and the information is used to propose the structure of a control system capable of incorporating expert information and transition in non-linear regions. The model used in the simulation takes account of three different phenomena: (a) mass transfer, (b) thermodynamics and (c) electrochemical. The fuel cell uses hydrogen and air to generate electricity. The hydrogen is supplied to the fuel cell anode and the air is supplied to the fuel cell cathode. This model allows the calculation of the pressure and mass flow circulating in the cell. Balances are presented for cathode, anode and membrane. The energy balance proposed includes the electrochemical reaction that is exothermic and the heat transfer to the air flowing through the cathode which has to supply the electrochemical reaction with the oxygen required and regulate the stack temperature. The ideal electric potential of a fuel cell is defined by the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation alone is not enough to describe the electrical potential during the actual operation of the system. The main sources of voltage loss are presented: Activation, electrical resistance and concentration. PEM control system is designed and simulated. A model–based algorithm is used to achieve different objectives than could lead to an improvement in the system performance. Results demonstrate that the predictions in voltage and current in the fuel cell stack are close to experimental data obtained from manufacturer. Constraints in the algorithm allow avoiding hazardous operational conditions and a decrease in controlled variable variance.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",,,,Volume 6B: Energy,,,2015-11-13,2015,2016-03-07,2015-11-13,,,v06bt07a023-v06bt07a023,Closed,Proceeding,"Morales, Victor Manuel Fontalvo; Sanjuan, Marco; Vega, Humberto Gómez","Morales, Victor Manuel Fontalvo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vega, Humberto Gómez (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Morales, Victor Manuel Fontalvo (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte); Vega, Humberto Gómez (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.24,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092782048,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy
1864,pub.1092797094,10.1115/imece2015-50434,,,Model Predictive Control of an HVAC System Based on Dynamic Tracking and Optimization of Energy Use,"U.S. Department of Energy affirms that HVAC systems consume approximately 40% of the total energy used in commercial-building sector. These types of systems are complex because they are composed of a large number of interconnected subsystems. The analysis shown in this paper is established on a building geographically located at the Caribbean coast region of Colombia in a region with tropical savanna climate and it is exposed to constant thermal load changes associated to high wall temperatures and direct sunlight incidence. Under this perspective, an energetic analysis is performed for the HVAC in order to implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to enhance the system efficiency under the previously mentioned external conditions. The model predictive strategy is implemented as a system supervisor in order to minimize a cost function that measures the ratio of water consumption to air temperature change in the cooling coil. The strategy manipulates the required temperature of supply water to cooling coil from the chiller, perceiving as input perturbation the outdoor temperature, the desired temperatures for the classrooms and the desired temperature of the air supply to the different zones. The comparison and selection of thermodynamical states for analysis are conducted according to the dynamic characteristics of the entire system and individual components, and the energy assessment is performed including the system transient response. The accomplishment of the supervisory control strategy has demonstrated that dynamic energetic analysis and assessment is an auxiliary tool for HVAC performance management. The analysis performed shows that the supervisory strategy can reduce properly the energy performance index as a consequence, the energy consumption of the fan has a reduction of a 0.65%, while the water required shows a reduction of 66.93%.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",,,,Volume 6B: Energy,,,2015-11-13,2015,2016-03-07,2015-11-13,,,v06bt07a001-v06bt07a001,Closed,Proceeding,"Jácome, Alfredo Díaz; Sanjuán, Marco E.; Morales, Victor Fontalvo; Durán, Cinthia Audivet","Jácome, Alfredo Díaz (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuán, Marco E.

Moreover, the combustion heat of the gas fuel is calculated, as well as the conversion and process efficiency, in order to perform further analyses which allow the determination of energy potential for different types of biomass under several conditions of moisture and equivalence ratio of gasifying agent. Performance of the proposed model is compared to prediction of some models which were found to be relevant in the literature review. An assessment to the model is also carried out. For this purpose, a case-study is performed for African palm (Elaeis guineensis) shells using a commercial gasifier. Experimental data obtained from the biomass used in the case-study are used to feed the model and perform the assessment. Actual results and model predictions (results) are compared varying the equivalent relation between 0.05 and 0.65, and the moisture content form biomass between 0 and 20%.

1817,pub.1092976189,10.1115/imece2015-51865,,,Reduced Model for a Thermal Analysis of a Flat Plate Solar Collector With Thermal Energy Storage Using Phase Change Material (PCM),"In conventional solar water heaters, the thermal energy storage is accomplished by increasing the sensible heat in a fluid. Therefore, the accumulation capacity of sensible heat is proportional to the mass storage and the increase of temperature, so that an increase in the requirements involves a bigger tank volume. Phase change materials (PCM) stored energy at constant temperature (or at least in a fairly narrow range of temperature) while the phase change is produced, they are presented as an alternative to compensate the solar heat supply periods and the thermal demand with a better heat accumulation per volume unit. In contrast, these systems require more complicated thermal analysis and designs than the traditional systems by sensible heat with a single phase. The selection of PCM, its content and location on the device will have a determining effect on the overall performance of the solar collector. This implies that the heat exchanger must be designed for each specific application. Currently, there are no commercial devices for heating water by solar energy using thermal accumulation with PCM. However, preliminary studies in lab scale have shown significant increases in efficiencies and supply capacity. Several authors have been performed experimental and numerical studies in solar collectors including PCM technology, but, due to the complexity of the phenomena and the high consumptions of resources for both approaches, it has not been possible to evaluate different configurations that lead to optimized designs for selection, location and amount of PCM. This fact shows the need to develop simplified models that consider the main physical phenomena in the operation, in order to support the experimental and numerical techniques to determine the comprehensive thermal behavior. This kind of models can be used to estimate the performance for different configurations and boundary conditions in a fast way, to make possible in a posterior stage a detailed evaluation with numerical analysis or an experimental technique. In this paper, a simplified comprehensive model for assessing thermal performance of a flat-plate solar collector with PCM is presented with incorporation of specialized semi-empirical correlations. The model takes into account the main thermodynamic and heat transfer processes in the device, including the internal and external convection effects, conduction, solar radiation analysis, radiation, losses and interactions between surfaces, material solid-liquid phase change and conjugated problems in gas-liquid-solid zones. Due to the numerous existing design alternatives, consideration of an excessive number of options in the final design can lead to long development times and process inefficiencies. Therefore, a methodology of design that includes fast calculations of the main thermal parameters is highly regarded, since this can reduce the number of study cases and thus obtain optimal configurations from the simplified models. The performance of the reduced model, including a sensibility analysis of several input data, is compared qualitatively with results obtained in a traditional collector for a typical cycle available in bibliography. Integrated simplified models are developed to perform a coarse preliminary design of flat solar collectors with incorporation of PCM technology, and thus serve as a pre-evaluator of the different configurations.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",,,,Volume 6B: Energy,,,2015-11-13,2015,2016-03-07,2015-11-13,,,v06bt07a052-v06bt07a052,Closed,Proceeding,"Carmona, Mauricio; Caicedo, Gabriel; Vega, Humberto Gómez; Bula, Antonio","Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Caicedo, Gabriel (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vega, Humberto Gómez (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Carmona, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Caicedo, Gabriel (Universidad del Norte); Vega, Humberto Gómez (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte)",5,1,,0.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092976189,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The procedure starts with characterization of the resonator using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). Characterization allows the estimation of the quality factor $Q$, insertion losses (IL) and the relative phase-shift across the device. This information is used with two purposes, to translate the mechanical information to the electrical domain and to model the device in SPICE-like programs. Once in that simulator the sustaining electronics are designed using feedback theory and looking to satisfy the Barkhausen's criterion. The method suggests providing extra gain to overcome additional losses from interconnections, PCB tracks, etc. VLSI editor programs can be used to layout the electronics following matching rules to minimize possible errors. This paper uses a set of free tools for the complete design process. As a result of the described method, a 4MHz oscillator using a crystal resonator interfaced with 2P3M $0.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ IC is simulated and tested using the proposed procedure.",,,,2015 IEEE 6th Latin American Symposium on Circuits & Systems (LASCAS),,,2015-02-01,2015,,2015-02-01,,,1-4,Closed,Proceeding,"Altamar, David; Martinez, Jorge; Toro, William; Pardo, Mauricio","Altamar, David (Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez, Jorge (Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Toro, William (Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pardo, Mauricio (Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Altamar, David (Universidad del Norte); Martinez, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Toro, William (Universidad del Norte); Pardo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095424718,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

Engineering students at Universidad del Norte learn how to write argumentative documents in the second semester. However, when students reach their senior year, their communication skills do not show their previous training. The paper presents preliminary results of a diagnosis of this skill in engineering students of different programs, different semesters and two different universities. The methodology for the diagnosis consisted in asking students to first read documents on a particular subject, and then, in the classroom, to write an argumentative essay about the same topic. All students used computers and submitted their essays digitally. The professors evaluated the essays by using a predefined rubric.  Results show the students have a low level in academic writing and argument developing. Few students properly cited their sources and no essay fulfilled the minimum requirements for an argumentative document. Noticeably, even though all students employed word processor software, they did not use grammar or style check features. As a consequence, the research team believes that students may not be familiar with these tools. Additionally, students do not allow time for the text to settle before verifying the document, or they do not correct it before submission. Regarding formal aspects of the argument document, fifty percent of the students do not include a thesis in the introduction. Nonetheless, in most   cases the research team identified some statements that could form or be understood as a pseudo-thesis. Essays in general lack evidences and facts to support the arguments. Moreover, most essays did not provide a conclusion where they clearly set the reader in a context and they did not resume the thesis.",,,eLearning and Software for Education,11th International Conference eLearning and Software for Education,,,2015-04-23,2015,2015-04-23,2015-04-23,1,,24-30,Closed,Proceeding,"Calle, Maria; De castro, Adela; Soto, Jose; Torres, Luis; Garcia, Lucy; Candelo, John; Gonzalez, Ricardo","Calle, Maria (); De castro, Adela (); Soto, Jose (); Torres, Luis (); Garcia, Lucy (); Candelo, John (); Gonzalez, Ricardo ()",,"Calle, Maria (); De castro, Adela (); Soto, Jose (); Torres, Luis (); Garcia, Lucy (); Candelo, John (); Gonzalez, Ricardo ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155721891,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3602 Creative and Professional Writing; 39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

The method, called TR-4D-EnKF, is based on a trust region framework and consists of three computational steps. First an ensemble of model runs is propagated forward in time and snapshots of the state are stored. Next, a sequence of basis vectors is built and a low-dimensional representation of the data assimilation system is obtained by projecting the model state onto the space spanned by the ensemble deviations from the mean. Finally, the low-dimensional optimization problem is solved in the reduced-space using a trust region approach; the size of the trust region is updated according to the relative decrease of the reduced order surrogate cost function. The analysis state is projected back onto the full space, and the process is repeated with the current analysis serving as a new background. A heuristic approach based on the trust region size is proposed in order to adjust the background error statistics from one iteration to the next. Experimental simulations are carried out using the Lorenz 96 model. The results show that TR-4D-EnKF is an efficient computational approach, and is more accurate than the current state of the art 4D-EnKF implementations such as the POD-4D-EnKF and the Iterative Subspace Minimization methods.","This work was supported in part by awards NSF CCF–1218454, AFOSR FA9550–12–1–0293–DEF, AFOSR 12-2640-06, and by the Computational Science Laboratory at Virginia Tech.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Dynamic Data-Driven Environmental Systems Science,"Sai Ravela, Adrian Sandu",,2015-11-27,2015,2015-11-27,2015,8964,,239-250,Closed,Chapter,"Nino, Elias D.; Sandu, Adrian","Nino, Elias D.

What is really responsible for the extreme waves regime in the Colombian Caribbean coast,"On Friday, 7 March 2009, a 200 m-long section of the tourist pier in Puerto Colombia collapsed under the impact of the waves generated by a cold front in the area. The aim of this study is to determine the contribution and importance of cold fronts and storms on extreme waves in different areas of the Colombian Caribbean to determine the degree of the threat posed by the flood processes to which these coastal populations are exposed and the actions to which coastal engineering constructions should be subject. In the calculation of maritime constructions, the most important parameter is the wave's height; therefore, it is necessary to definitively know the design wave height to which a coastal engineering structure should be resistant. This wave height varies according to the return period considered. Using Gumbel's extreme value methodology, the significant height values for the study area were calculated. The methodology was evaluated using data from the re-analysis of the spectral NOAA Wavewatch III (WW3) model for 15 points along the 1600 km of the Colombia Caribbean coast (continental and insular) of the last 15 years. The results demonstrated that the extreme waves caused by tropical cyclones and cold fronts have different effects along the Colombian Caribbean coast. Storms and hurricanes are of greater importance in the Guajira Peninsula (Alta Guajira). In the central area formed by Baja Guajira, Santa Marta, Barranquilla, and Cartagena, the strong influence of cold fronts on extreme waves is evident. On the other hand, in the southern region of the Colombian Caribbean coast, from the Gulf of Morrosquillo to the Gulf of Urabá, even though extreme waves are lower than in the previous regions, extreme waves are dominated mainly by the passage of cold fronts. Extreme waves in the San Andrés and Providencia insular region present a different dynamic from that in the continental area due to its geographic location. The wave heights in the extreme regime are similar in magnitude to those found in Alta Guajira, but the extreme waves associated with the passage of cold fronts in this region have lower return periods than the extreme waves associated with hurricane season. These results are of great importance when evaluating the threat of extreme waves in the coastal and port infrastructure, for purposes of the design of new constructions, and in the coastal flood processes due to run-up because, according to the site of interest in the coast, the forces that shape extreme waves are not the same.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2015-05-04,2015,2015-05-04,,3,5,3023-3055,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Otero, L.

Using dense point trajectories, our approach separates and describes the foreground motion from the background, represents the appearance of the extracted static background, and encodes the global camera motion that interestingly is shown to be discriminative for certain action classes.

The proposed implementation starts with decomposing the domain into sub-domains. In each sub-domain a sparse estimation of the inverse background error covariance matrix is computed via a modified Cholesky decomposition; the estimates are computed concurrently on separate processors. The sparsity of this estimator is dictated by the conditional independence of model components for some radius of influence. Then, the assimilation step is carried out in parallel without the need of inter-processor communication. Once the local analysis states are computed, the analysis sub-domains are mapped back onto the global domain to obtain the analysis ensemble. Computational experiments are performed using the Atmospheric General Circulation Model (SPEEDY) with the T-63 resolution on the Blueridge cluster at Virginia Tech. The number of processors used in the experiments ranges from 96 to 2,048. The proposed implementation outperforms in terms of accuracy the well-known local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) for all the model variables. The computational time of the proposed implementation is similar to that of the parallel LETKF method (where no covariance estimation is performed). Finally, for the largest number of processors, the proposed parallel implementation is 400 times faster than the serial version of the proposed method.",,,,Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Latest Advances in Scalable Algorithms for Large-Scale Systems,,,2015-11-15,2015,2015-11-15,2015-11-15,,,1-8,Closed,Proceeding,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Sandu, Adrian; Deng, Xinwei","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

Performance of these systems is highly dependent on several important parameters, which not only impact the long-term efficiency but also its technical and economic feasibility. This paper studies the operation/configuration problem of an ammonia-water power and cooling cycle using an exergetic analysis. Thermodynamic performance of the combined cycle was addressed by using analysis of variance and multiple linear regression analysis. Modeling was done in Matlab®, using Refprop 9.0 to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the ammonia-water mixture. Convergence issues were observed on the thermodynamic properties estimation carried out by Refprop when the stream had high ammonia mass fraction. To solve this issue an averaging algorithm was implemented online to estimate such properties using pure ammonia data and high, but stable, ammonia concentration data. After this implementation, small differences between current and reference model were seen. Optimum operating conditions were obtained using response surface technique. The response variable used was the ratio between exergetic efficiency and exergy destruction. Results showed that the response variable is mainly influenced by the ammonia concentration, pressure ratio, turbine efficiency and temperature gradient in the heat exchanger. Finally integration of the power/cooling cycle with a solar field was performed using two types of concentrated solar collectors: Linear Fresnel Collector (LFC) and Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC). The analysis showed that LFC technology can be a viable alternative for small scale applications combined with power/cooling systems.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",,,,"Volume 2: Photovoltaics; Renewable-Non-Renewable Hybrid Power System; Smart Grid, Micro-Grid Concepts; Energy Storage; Solar Chemistry; Solar Heating and Cooling; Sustainable Cities and Communities, Transportation; Symposium on Integrated/Sustainable Building Equipment and Systems; Thermofluid Analysis of Energy Systems Including Exergy and Thermoeconomics; Wind Energy Systems and Technologies",,,2015-06-28,2015,2015-10-27,2015-06-28,,,v002t15a010-v002t15a010,Closed,Proceeding,"García, Jesús M.; M., Marco E.

degrades exothermically in the presence of light and ambient contaminants. Its
degradation dynamics remain largely unknown. Even before degradation,
local-probe studies indicate non-negligible local curvature --through a
non-constant height distribution-- due to the unavoidable presence of intrinsic
defects. We establish that these intrinsic defects are photo-oxidation sites
because they lower the chemisorption barrier of ideal black phosphorus (> 10 eV
and out of visible-range light excitations) right into the visible and
ultra-violet range (1.6 to 6.8 eV), thus enabling photo-induced oxidation and
dissociation of oxygen dimers. A full characterization of the material's shape
and of its electronic properties at the early stages of the oxidation process
is presented as well. This study thus provides fundamental insights into the
degradation dynamics of this novel layered material.",,,arXiv,,,,2015-07-31,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Utt, Kainen L.; Rivero, Pablo; Mehboudi, Mehrshad; Harriss, Edmund O.; Borunda, Mario F.; SanJuan, Alejandro A.

Our technique formulates this problem as the estimation of a rotation matrix that best aligns the normals of the captured scene to a canonical world axes. By introducing sparsity constraints, our method can simultaneously estimate the scene MF, the surfaces in the scene that are best aligned to one of three coordinate axes, and the outlier surfaces that do not align with any of the axes. To test our approach, we contribute a new set of annotations to determine ground truth MFs in each image of the popular NYUv2 dataset. We use this new benchmark to experimentally demonstrate that our method is more accurate, faster, more reliable and more robust than the methods used in the literature. We further motivate our technique by showing how it can be used to address the RGB-D SLAM problem in indoor scenes by incorporating it into and improving the performance of a popular RGB-D SLAM method.",This work was supported by competitive research funding from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

In this paper we introduce ActivityNet, a new large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding. Our benchmark aims at covering a wide range of complex human activities that are of interest to people in their daily living. In its current version, ActivityNet provides samples from 203 activity classes with an average of 137 untrimmed videos per class and 1.41 activity instances per video, for a total of 849 video hours. We illustrate three scenarios in which ActivityNet can be used to compare algorithms for human activity understanding: untrimmed video classification, trimmed activity classification and activity detection.",We would like to thank the Stanford Vision Lab for their helpful comments and support.

1323,pub.1118675445,10.48550/arxiv.1510.09153,,,Two-dimensional disorder in black phosphorus and monochalcogenide monolayers,"Ridged, orthorhombic two-dimensional atomic crystals with a bulk {\em Pnma}
structure such as black phosphorus and monochalcogenide monolayers are an
exciting and novel material platform for a host of applications. Key to their
crystallinity, monolayers of these materials have a four-fold degenerate
structural ground state, and a single energy scale $E_C$ (representing the
elastic energy required to switch the longer lattice vector along the $x-$ or
$y-$direction) determines how disordered these monolayers are at finite
temperature. Disorder arises when nearest neighboring atoms become gently
reassigned as the system is thermally excited beyond a critical temperature
$T_c$ that is proportional to $E_C/k_B$. $E_C$ is tunable by chemical
composition and it leads to a classification of these materials into two
categories: (i) Those for which $E_C\ge k_BT_m$, and (ii) those having
$k_BT_m>E_C\ge 0$, where $T_m$ is a given material's melting temperature. Black
phosphorus and SiS monolayers belong to category (i): these materials do not
display an intermediate order-disorder transition and melt directly. All other
monochalcogenide monolayers with $E_C>0$ belonging to class (ii) will undergo a
two-dimensional transition prior to melting. $E_C/k_B$ is slightly larger than
room temperature for GeS and GeSe, and smaller than 300 K for SnS and SnSe
monolayers, so that these materials transition near room temperature. The onset
of this generic atomistic phenomena is captured by a planar Potts model up to
the order-disorder transition. The order-disorder phase transition in two
dimensions described here is at the origin of the {\em Cmcm} phase being
discussed within the context of bulk layered SnSe.",,,arXiv,,,,2015-10-30,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mehboudi, Mehrshad; Dorio, Alex M.; Zhu, Wenjuan; van der Zande, Arend; Churchill, Hugh O.

Most of these problems present an environment which changes over time. The problem involving classification tasks in dynamic environments has become one of the major challenges in machine learning domain in the last decades. Currently in the literature, methods based on accuracy monitoring are commonly used to detect changes explicitly. However, these methods may become infeasible in some real-world applications especially due to two aspects: they may need human operator feedback, and may depend on a significant decrease of accuracy to be able to detect changes. In addition, most of these methods are also incremental learning-based, since they update the decision model for every incoming example. However, this may lead to system unnecessary updates. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a method to detect changes based on data distribution dissimilarity and to update the decision model only after drift detection. The achievement of this method is relevant to allow change detection and reaction be applicable in several practical problems. The experiments conducted indicate that the proposed method attains performance and detection rates similar to the traditional DDM and EDDM, which are incremental learning-based and performance monitoring-based drift detectors.",The authors acknowledge the support granted by FAPEAM through process number 01135/2011 and 2210.UNI175.3532.03022011 (Anura Project - FAPEAM/CNPq PRONEX 023/2009).

This paper addresses that issue to identify agricultural produce based on shape, size and maturity. Fuzzy inference system is used for decision making process. In this paper, proposed methodology is divided in three phases: In first phase, mangoes are classified either well formed or deformed using eccentricity, extent and cross-ratio properties of shape. Second phase discusses about size and maturity classification. Weight and area are used for size feature extraction and mean of a* and b* channel of L*a*b* color space are used as parameters of maturity feature. In this phase, mangoes are classified in small, medium or big size and unripe, partially ripe or ripe maturity. At final phase, decision making theory is used to grade mango in class I, class II or class III. Integration of whole system results average accuracy 90% and system takes 2.1 seconds to grade a mango.","Authors gratefully acknowledge the Uka Tarsadia University for financial assistance under research promotion scheme (UTU/RPS/1404(5-5)/2014-15).

Due to these advantages, computer vision systems have been widely accepted in the agricultural and food industries, since these industries require a high demand for objectivity, consistency and efficiency in the quality control of the product, requirements that can be met by the computer vision systems. This paper proposes a method for automatically evaluate the state of maturation of the perolera variety pineapple (Ananas Comosus) in post-harvest using computer vision techniques. The proposed evaluation procedure is implemented through a digital color-image processing based on the stages of preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and statistical classification. For this purpose we use images in the HSV color space, segmentation by automatic thresholding using Otsu's method, the first-order moment of the distributions of the H and S planes as features, and the Modified Basic Sequential Algorithmic Scheme (MBSAS). 1320 images were utilized, which 770 images were used in the process of training and 550images in the evaluation process. The results of the evaluation procedure proposed in this paper were compared with the value judgment of three experts, showing that this algorithm has efficiency in the assessment close to 96.36%.",,,,"2015 20th Symposium on Signal Processing, Images and Computer Vision (STSIVA)",,,2015-01-01,2015,,2015-01-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Angel, L.; Lizcano, S.; Viola, J.","Angel, L.

During common sailing trips on Lake Mondsee and when we visited the Salzburg Festival we developed a common understanding of approaching legal issues in an international context, which fits well with the title of this liber amicorum.Albrecht Weber – we call him Peter – is a specialist in the field of comparative law. Therefore, I will try to continue my recent work in the context of MOCOMILA to describe on a comparative basis some developments in the field of ethics in finance, which I assume is undergoing a transformation process from standards of ethics into binding norms.The international banking crisis that began in 2008 and later developments have once again highlighted the problem that legally permissible behavior need not necessarily be ethical. The United States pursued a strategy – allowed by US laws – to force non‐US institutional investors to (partly) restructure some American Banks (e. g. Washington Mutual Inc.).

geometrical effect occurs regardless of phosphorene allotrope considered, and
it provides a unique optical vehicle to single out local structural defects on

Colombia has a long history of civilian rule and control over the armed forces, experiencing only three military governments since its independence from Spain in 1820. Civilian rule came after a long period, dubbed La Violencia, triggered by the assassination of Liberal leader Jorge Eliezer Gaitan on April 9, 1948, an event known as the Bogotazo. For ten years, tensions between the two traditional parties, Liberales and Conservadores escalated, spreading to much of the country. To quell the violence, in December of 1957, Colombians adopted a referendum for consociational democracy—Frente Nacional, a power-sharing mechanism in which the two main political parties agreed to rotate presidential terms and share bureaucratic positions equally (Dix 1980).",,,Governance and Public Management,Leadership and Culture,"Montgomery Van Wart, Annie Hondeghem, Erwin Schwella, Paul Suino",,2015,2015,,2015,,,271-287,Closed,Chapter,"Sanabria, Pablo; Avellaneda, Claudia N.","Sanabria, Pablo (); Avellaneda, Claudia N.

Through extensive experiments, we characterize the nature of the relationship between abstract concepts (specifically objects in images) learned by popular and high performing convolutional networks (conv-nets) and established mid-level representations used in computer vision (specifically semantic visual attributes). We focus on attributes due to their impact on several applications, such as object description, retrieval and mining, and active (and zero-shot) learning. Among the findings we uncover, we show empirical evidence of the existence of Attribute Centric Nodes (ACNs) within a convnet, which is trained to recognize objects (not attributes) in images. These special convnet nodes (1) collectively encode information pertinent to visual attribute representation and discrimination, (2) are unevenly and sparsely distribution across all layers of the convnet, and (3) play an important role in convnet based object recognition.",Research reported in this publication was supported by competitive research funding from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). lCN is supported by a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship.

In the last decade, several advances in the development of techniques for the treatment of these fractures have been reported. These are the special surgery techniques called “vertebral augmentation techniques”. The purpose of this paper is to show a definitive design of a biomechanically assembled mechanism which has the function of separating the collapsed walls of the fractured vertebral body and to aid to get the necessary space to fix an implant. The function of this mechanism was tested under the surgical technique called “Kyphoplasty”, which is necessary in the treatment of vertebral fractures. With this design the intention is that the mechanism has functional characteristics such as: do to not leave it permanent taken into the fractured vertebral body as well as to have the ability to separate the collapsed walls of the healthy adjacent vertebral body. It is expected to be reusable a finite number of times after a sterilization process. The design methodology used was the QFD (The quality function deployment), and a final concept design was obtained. Some lumbar vertebrae porcine specimens (8 months old of the Duroc breed) were used in order to know the mechanical strength, necessary for the design of the mechanism. The final design of the device will be analyzed by the finite element method (FEM), in order to know the mechanical behavior under simulated working conditions. These studies will provide the necessary data which will be the main support to decide the best material to propose for the final mechanism and its manufacturing. However, these FEM results are not reported on this paper .","The support given by the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, COFAA, Hospital 1º de Octubre of ISSSTE and CONACyT for the development of this work is kindly acknowledged.",,Advanced Structured Materials,Applications of Computational Tools in Biosciences and Medical Engineering,"Andreas Öchsner, Holm Altenbach",,2015-06-09,2015,2015-06-09,2015,71,,89-122,Closed,Chapter,"Beltrán-Fernández, Juan A.; Valdez, Noemí C.; Rebatu, Alejandro Gonzalez; Hernández Gómez, Luis H.","Beltrán-Fernández, Juan A.

Evidence from Colombia,"Access to more information by a group of voters may represent more knowledge about the political system and incentivize people to make better choices. In this paper I argue that mass media have an impact over voters' knowledge, reflected on one of the main forms of political participation that citizens have in a democracy: voting and politicians' performance. The media outlet I take into account is radio, starting from its last stage of expansion in Colombia, since the mid 1990s. I use a measure of radio based on the counting of stations and the exogenous variation in signal transmission given by municipal topographic characteristics to study the effect of the growing number of radio stations on a set of political and policy results. I find that in municipalities with more radio stations turnout for the different types of elections, namely Presidential (1994-2010), Mayor (1994-2011), Senate (1994-2010) and House (1994-2010) elections, increases. I show that the vote share of the winning party in the Senate elections declines and the effective number of parties expands when there is greater exposure to radio, suggesting an increasing electoral competition. Finally, I find that the presence of local media also influences policy. A larger number of radio stations is associated with more resources to investment and a lower share of spending represented by operating expenditures.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Salcedo-Monroy, Dario","Salcedo-Monroy, Dario (Universidad de los Andes, Colombia)",,"Salcedo-Monroy, Dario (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,0.0,https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/bitstream/1992/12595/1/u686527.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102425690,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

In this competition, each participating team constructs a teleoperated/autonomous unmanned ground/aerial vehicle that must be able to search for underground and aboveground antipersonnel landmines and UXOs. The position and the type of each detected object are visualized and overlaid on the minefield map. The robot must be able to navigate through rough terrain that mimics a real minefield. This paper describes this competition, discusses the motivation behind it and summarizes the lessons learned from this initiative.","The author wishes to express special gratitude to the Institute for Systems and Robotics at University of Coimbra for hosting the last edition of the competition and to Catholic University of the North in Antofagasta, Chile for hosting Minesweepers 2015.

While there has not been a systematic evaluation of this merger process, that created 11 new institutions from 26 merger partners and affected 62 % of the South African higher education system (in terms of current student registrations), a full set of independent and rigorous quality assurance reports provide the basis for evaluating the consequences of the policy. These institutional audits suggest three broad types of outcome: mergers that have resulted in well functioning new institutions, failed mergers, and a set of new universities that are still responding to the consequences of merger. Finally, the publication of South Africa’s new National Development Plan in 2012 and a new analysis of student access and success across the country’s public higher education system as a whole, completed in 2013, allow an assessment of the degree to which the objectives of the 2002 merger plan have been achieved.","I am grateful to Ashley Symes and Thierry Luescher for making this study possible through our baseline research during the early stages of the merger process.

A possible solution could be its incorporation into a clay body to fabricate common fired ceramics such as bricks and tiles. The objective of this work is to characterize a type of fluorescent lamp glass waste to be incorporated into a clayey ceramic. The characterization was performed in terms of wettability tests to evaluate the interaction between the surface of the clayey ceramic and glass waste as a function of the firing temperature. The results showed that the contact angle decreased with increasing temperature, reaching a value of 79°, at a temperature of 1100°C, but not sufficient to completely wet the ceramic. However, compatible chemical composition and reduction of porosity by the flow of soft glass waste between the clay particles favor the consolidation of the ceramics structure above 900°C.",,,,"Characterization of Minerals, Metals, and Materials 2015","John S.

This system is imperfectly confined by an external homogeneous magnetic field that is non-vanishing in a finite space region only. We assume that constituting particles can only move in a plane and the magnetic field acts on a circular region in the perpendicular direction. Thermo-statistical description of evaporation effects are analyzed within microcanonical ensemble. A truncation of velocity spectrum is considered to account for the existence of a threshold energy for particles that remain trapped by the magnetic field. The numerical study of macroscopic observables is performed implementing structural equations that describe distribution profiles.,,,AIP Conference Proceedings,,,,2015-03-10,2015,,2015-03-10,1648,1,080003,Closed,Proceeding,"Ordenes-Huanca, C.; Velazquez, L.","Ordenes-Huanca, C.

Applications for WSNs require implementations of complex operations like network administration. To simplify the development of these applications, several mobile agent middlewares have been proposed (e.g., Agilla). Applications for these middlewares are executed by communications among agents; therefore, a common operation is to look up agents. Because existing proposals do not have much technical support for efficient approach to look up agents, every lookup consumes a significant amount of battery energy and time. In addition, current approaches can fail their lookup operations if the target agent moves during a lookup operation. This paper proposes CMSN, an efficient and effective lookup for mobile agent middlewares using distributed hash table. We evaluate and compare CMSN in terms of effective lookups and battery consumption.",,,,2015 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems,,,2015-06-01,2015,,2015-06-01,,,203-205,Closed,Proceeding,"Fukuda, Hiroaki; Leger, Paul","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Information Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Fukuda, Hiroaki (Information Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",1,0,,0.24,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095059292,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

Moreover, these resources are located in the Atacama Desert, the driest in the world. Water resources are exhausted, but Chile has an extensive coast from where to get water. Then, any new operation or expansion of a current operation must use seawater. The distance from the coast to mining operations ranging from a few kilometers to about 300 kilometers, but even more significant, these operations can be found from 600 to 4,000 meters above sea level. Then, the cost of transporting desalinated water can be greater than the cost of desalination.This paper presents a methodology to design the system of desalination plant and desalinated water transport. The objective is to determine the location and size of desalination plants and the water distribution system that minimizes capital and operational costs. The methodology uses a superstructure that represents the set of alternatives on which the optimal solution is found. A mathematical model is generated to represent the desalination plant and water distribution system. The end model corresponds to a MINLP problem which is solved in two steps using commercial software. A case study is used to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology developed.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank CONICYT and the Regional Government of Antofagasta by their funding through PAI program, Project Anillo ACT 1201.",,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,12th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering and 25th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2015,2015,,2015,37,,1193-1198,Closed,Chapter,"Herrera, Sebastián; Cisternas, Luis A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Herrera, Sebastián (Depto. de Ing.

350,pub.1002511687,10.1145/2695664.2696034,,,A library to modularly control asynchronous executions,"Asynchronous programming style has been widely adopted for a variety of reasons one such being the rise of Web applications. Using non-blocking operations is a major approach to enforcing asynchronous programming. A non-blocking operation requires decomposing a module that consists of a set of blocking operations into more than two modules, in turn, leading to a variety of challenges such as callback spaghetti and callback hell. This paper presents SyncAS, a library specification to address these two problems. This library specification follows the ECMAScript standard; indeed, we provide a prototype implementation for ActionScript3. SyncAS proposes a novel approach that enables programmers to virtually block a program execution and restart it at arbitrary points of the program, instead of waiting for a callback execution. As a result, programmers do not need to decompose a module even if non-blocking operations are adopted. SyncAS uses aspect-oriented programming to control the program execution in an oblivious manner.",,,,Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,,,2015-04-13,2015,2015-04-13,2015-04-13,,,1648-1650,Closed,Proceeding,"Fukuda, Hiroaki; Leger, Paul","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology, Toyosu Koto, Tokyo, Japan); Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",2,0,,0.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002511687,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

The ore that is fed to a concentration plant is heterogeneous, and it changes over time as the mine is operated. Moreover, the costs and the selling price of the concentrate can undergo significant changes. This situation forces readjustment of mineral concentration plants to new conditions. The methodology consists of three steps: 1) process modeling, 2) global sensitivity analysis to identify key variables, and 3) economic optimization of the plant. Sobol’s method is used to identify the variables that most significantly affect the recovery of the species and the grade of the final concentrate. The methodology is applied to a copper and molybdenum concentrator plant of three concentration stages. The species present in the mineral correspond to chalcopyrite, chalcocite, covellite, molybdenite, pyrite, and quartz. The results show that the methodology could be helpful to improve the revenue of a flotation plant by making targeted changes to it.","AcknowledgmentsFinancial support from CONICYT (Fondecyt 1120794), CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.",,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,12th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering and 25th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2015,2015,,2015,37,,311-316,Closed,Chapter,"Lucay, Freddy; Cisternas, Luis A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Lucay, Freddy (Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark Centro de Investigación Científico Tecnológico para la Minería, Antofagasta, Chile; Depto. de Ing.

338,pub.1038440203,10.1007/978-3-642-38670-1_102,,,The Contribution of Traditional Agroforestry to Climate Change Adaptation in the Ecuadorian Amazon: The Chakra System,"This chapter presents the contribution of “chakra,” a traditional agroforestry system, to climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation in Ecuador’s Amazonian communities. IPCC’s methodology was used for the estimation of carbon sequestration in soil, biomass, and cacao plantations. Carbon levels in multiple systems of land use were measured through temporary plots. Chakra is efficient to adapt to climate change due to higher levels of carbon sequestration and tree diversity in comparison to other forms of land use. Chakra allows for sustainable use of forests by combining cultivation of the Ecuadorian finest aromatic cacao, controlled timber extraction, production of staple food, and conservation of medicinal plants. Chakra enables Amazonian communities to contribute to both food security and well-being and conservation of the region’s high biodiversity.

This programming style usually uses callback methods, a non-blocking operation, allowing high responsible user interactions even if the application works without multi-threading. However this style requires to uncouple a module into two sub-modules at least, which are not intuitively connected by a callback method. The separation of the module brings the birth of other problems: callback spaghetti and callback hell. This paper proposes a virtual block approach to address previous problems. This approach enables a programmer to virtually block a program execution and restart it at arbitrary points in the program. As a result, programmers do not need to uncouple a module even if non-blocking operations are adopted; therefore, callback dependences disappear. Using aspect-oriented programming, this approach uses aspects to control the execution of a program in an oblivious manner. As a consequence, programmers do not need to care whether pieces of code use blocking or non-blocking operations. We implement a proof-of-concept of this approach, named SyncAS, for ActionScript3.",,,,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and Communications Technologies (formerly BIONETICS),,,2015,2015,,,,,239-242,Closed,Proceeding,"Azegami, Takeshi; Fukuda, Hiroaki; Leger, Paul","Azegami, Takeshi (Toyosu Koto, Tokyo, Japan); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Toyosu Koto, Tokyo, Japan); Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Azegami, Takeshi (Toyosu Koto, Tokyo, Japan); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Toyosu Koto, Tokyo, Japan); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",1,0,,0.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099383420,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

Pattern recognition has become an interesting research line in the area of robotics and computer vision, however, the problem of perception extends beyond that of classification, main idea is training a specified structure to perform the classifying a given pattern. In this work, we have proposed the application of pattern recognition techniques and neural networks with back propagation learning procedure for the autonomous robots navigation. The objective of this work is to achieve that a robot is capable of performing a path in an unknown environment, through pattern recognition identifying four classes that indicate what action to perform, and then, a dataset with 400 images that were randomly divided with 70% for the training process, 15% for validation and 15% for the test is generated to train by neural network with different configurations.

In central Chile and even at the more southern latitudes, the cultivated quinoa is different landraces of the coastal ecotype.

These modern web applications adopt asynchronous programming that provides high responsive user interactions even if an application works without multi-threading. At the same time, as the scale of these applications becomes large, modular programming becomes important because it allows developers to separate concerns, meaning that the evolution of one module does not affect other modules. However, applying asynchronous and modular programming is difficult because asynchronous programming requires uncoupling of a module into two sub-modules, which are non-intuitively connected by a callback method. The separation of the module spurs the birth of other two issues: callback spaghetti and callback hell. Some proposals have been proposed without the lack of issues about modular programming. In this paper, we compare and evaluate these proposals applying them to a non-trivial open source application development. We then present a discussion on our experience in implementing the application using these proposals.

Applications for WSNs require implementations of complex operations like network administration. To simplify the development of these applications, several mobile agent middleware solutions have been proposed (e.g., Agilla). Applications for these middleware solutions are executed by communications among agents, therefore, a common operation is to look up agents. Because existing proposals do not have much technical support for efficient approach to look up agents, every lookup consumes a significant amount of battery energy and time. In addition, current approaches can fail their lookup operations if the target agent moves during a lookup operation. This paper proposes CMSN, an efficient and effective lookup for mobile agent middleware. CMSN is inspired by CSN, a distributed hash table algorithm for WSNs.

Although this confers ample opportunities for social interactions among conspecifics, little is known about social recognition patterns in these species. Current research indicates that social recognition in amphipods is largely limited to mate and female-offspring recognition. In many amphipod species, the males are capable of assessing the reproductive status/quality of females and choose mates accordingly. While females of some species are capable of recognizing their own brood, in other species females seem to be indiscriminate towards their own or unrelated embryos. Some observations, however, suggest kin recognition within family units and even ranking of conspecifics seems to be likely. Central-place foraging has not been reported for amphipod families thus far, and also their potential for fortress defense is very limited. It thus appears that higher level social recognition may not have evolved in amphipods, although we recognize a lack of research in this area. Given their easy maintenance in laboratory cultures and technological advances in video recording and analysis, we believe that selected amphipod species could be ideal model organisms to study the evolution of social behavior.",,,,Social Recognition in Invertebrates,"Laura Aquiloni, Elena Tricarico",,2015-05-30,2015,2015-05-30,2015,,,85-100,Closed,Chapter,"Beermann, Jan; Dick, Jaimie T.

The article will attempt to argue that state concessions to Muslim political leaders who supported the successive Sri Lanka’s ruling classes from independence through the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, have meant an isolation of the community from the other two main ethnic communities. The concessions that the Muslim community have won, actively helped the Muslim community to be proactive in their religious practices and thus paved the way for exclusive social and political choices. The rise of Islamic movements and mosques in the post-1977 period galvanized Muslims. In time this isolation has been reinforced by socio-religious revival among Muslims whose ethnic identity has been constructed along the lines of the Islamic faith by Muslim elites. Despite this revival it has been clear that the Muslim community has been reluctant to use Islamic traditions and principles for peace building which could have helped to ease tensions brought about by the 30 year old ethnic conflict. On the other hand this paper will briefly discuss some reactions from the majority Sinhalese to Islamic revival as well as some issues between the Tamils and Muslims and the reintegration of Muslims in the North. Finally, some pragmatic ways to ease tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the greater discipline of conflict resolution are explored using traditions within Islam.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Razak, Mohamed Imtiyaz Abdul; Hoole, S.

This peculiar morphology has been recurrently included in discussions about the initial human dispersion into the Americas, with different authors favoring contrasting scenarios to explain the origin of the morphological and biological diversity inside the continent. In this chapter, we summarize our latest results on the morphological affinities of Early Holocene South American groups and their implications for our understanding of the settlement of the Americas. Our analyses focus on early series from Lagoa Santa, East-Central Brazil, and Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia, and are based on multivariate analyses of linear craniometric measurements of these series and reference worldwide populations. Our results indicate strong morphological affinities between early Americans and Late Pleistocene specimens from Europe and East Asia, suggesting that the first American groups shared the same morphological pattern seen in other parts of the planet by the end of the Pleistocene. These analyses suggest that the best scenario to explain the morphological diversity seen in the continent across time is one that assumes an extra influx of morphological diversity into the continent during the Holocene, given that in situ differentiation cannot explain the diversity observed across time. However, it is unclear with the present data the nature of this extra influx, if due to two discrete dispersion waves into the continent or if due to continuous gene-flow from Asia during the Holocene.","We are grateful to André Strauss for allowing the usage of his VB code and to Phillip Gunz for helping with the transformation of the 3D landmarks into linear measurements.

Mesoscale eddies are important, frequent, and persistent features of circulation in these regions, transporting physical, chemical and biological properties from shelves to the open ocean. In austral fall of 2011, during the Tara Oceans expedition, a subsurface layer (200–400 m) in which the concentration of oxygen was very low (−1 of O2) was observed in the eastern South Pacific, ~ 900 km offshore (30° S, 81° W). Satellite altimetry combined with CTD observations associated the local oxygen anomaly with an intrathermocline, anticyclonic, mesoscale eddy with a diameter of about 150 km. The eddy contained Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW) that at this latitude is normally restricted near the coast. Undersaturation (44 %) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrite accumulation (> 0.5 μM) gave evidence for denitrification in this water mass. Based on satellite altimetry, we tracked the eddy back to its region of formation on the coast of central Chile (36.1° S, 74.6° W). We estimate that the eddy formed in April 2010. Field studies conducted on the Chilean shelf in June 2010 provided approximate information on initial O2 and N2O concentrations of ""source water"" in the region at the time of eddy formation. Concentrations of both O2 and N2O in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the offshore eddy were lower than its surroundings or ""source water"" on the shelf, suggesting that these chemical species were consumed as the eddy moved offshore. Estimates of apparent oxygen utilization rates at the OMZ of the eddy ranged from 0.29 to 44 nmol L−1 d−1 and the rate of N2O consumption was 3.92 nmol L−1 d−1. Our results show that mesoscale eddies in the ESP not only transport physical properties of the ESSW from the coast to the ocean interior, but also export and transform biogeochemical properties, creating suboxic environments in the oligotrophic region of the eastern South Pacific. Suboxic water masses that are advected by eddies act as hotspots for denitrification and loss of fixed nitrogen from the system.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2015-09-02,2015,2015-09-02,,12,17,14481-14506,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Cornejo, M.; Bravo, L.; Ramos, M.; Pizarro, O.; Karstensen, J.; Gallegos, M.; Correa-Ramirez, M.; Silva, N.; Farias, L.; Karp-Boss, L.","Cornejo, M.

The African National Congress (ANC) then issued a comprehensive policy framework for education and training. This framework addresses the enormity of the apartheid legacy of education and provides a coherent policy statement albeit with contradictory tensions in terms of some of the proposed goals. Most notably, it advocated the pursuit of equity and access as being of paramount importance, and signaled quite clearly that the adverse effects of apartheid in the realm of education need to be addressed. The analysis undertaken in this chapter demonstrates that the enormity of the task at hand, the resources required to redress past inequities, and the deeply entrenched nature of the racially-divided educational system were grossly underestimated by the architects of the new policy framework (and vision) for the sector, including the critically important higher education subsector.",,,Higher Education Dynamics,Higher Education in the BRICS Countries,"Simon Schwartzman, Rómulo Pinheiro, Pundy Pillay",,2015-03-25,2015,2015-03-25,2015,44,,171-190,Closed,Chapter,"Menon, Kirti","Menon, Kirti (University of the Witwatersrand, 1 Jan Smuts Avenue, Braamfontein, 2000, Johannesburg, South Africa)","Menon, Kirti (University of the Witwatersrand)","Menon, Kirti (University of the Witwatersrand)",6,1,,2.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035969431,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

We begin with one evident observation: despite the fact that these studies are fairly thorough and widely disseminated, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, their reception in Continental Europe is late in coming and complex. One factor is undoubtedly the lack of unity amongst these studies, the multifaceted character of the subjects addressed, as well as a certain ambiguity in their approaches. The reiterative post debate is reminiscent of the problems applied to post-modernism: does post refer to a mere chronological reference, in which case it would designate what comes after colonialism, or does it involve an epistemic question: how to think beyond the colonial framework?1",,,,"Eurocentrism, Racism and Knowledge","Marta Araújo, Silvia Rodríguez Maeso",,2015,2015,,2015,,,93-113,Closed,Chapter,"Huguet, Montserrat Galcerán","Huguet, Montserrat Galcerán ()",,"Huguet, Montserrat Galcerán ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047052497,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

active galaxy. Our data set for the well-studied Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548
consists of five epochs of quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy spanning a period of about five years and three epochs of X-ray
spectroscopy overlapping in time with it. Whereas the broad emission lines and
hot dust emission varied only moderately, the coronal lines varied strongly.
However, the observed high variability is mainly due to a flux decrease. Using
the optical [FeVII] and X-ray OVII emission lines we estimate that the coronal
line gas has a relatively low density of n~10^3/cm^3 and a relatively high
ionisation parameter of log U~1. The resultant distance of the coronal line gas
from the ionising source of about eight light years places this region well
beyond the hot inner face of the dusty torus. These results imply that the
coronal line region is an independent entity. We find again support for the
X-ray heated wind scenario of Pier & Voit; the increased ionising radiation
that heats the dusty torus also increases the cooling efficiency of the coronal
line gas, most likely due to a stronger adiabatic expansion. The much stronger
coronal line variability of NGC 5548 relative to that of NGC 4151 can also be
explained within this picture. NGC 5548 has much stronger coronal lines
relative to the low ionisation lines than NGC 4151 indicating a stronger wind,
in which case a stronger adiabatic expansion of the gas and so fading of the
line emission is expected.",,,arXiv,,,,2015-09-19,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Landt, Hermine; Ward, Martin J.; Steenbrugge, Katrien C.; Ferland, Gary J.","Landt, Hermine (Durham University, UK); Ward, Martin J.

The city-state of Athens is often thought to be the best example of ancient Greek democracy-Athens practiced direct democracy, in which eligible citizens could participate in meetings, express their opinions, and vote directly on the issues of the day in the Assembly as long as they were not foreigners, slaves, or women.

Herein we provide an overview of marine litter studies that have been supported by citizen scientists (n = 40) and compare these studies with selected studies conducted by professional scientists (n = 40). Citizen science studies have mainly focused on the distribution and composition of marine litter in the intertidal zone. Studies extended over regional, national and international scales, with time periods generally extending from less than one year to two years. Professional studies have also examined the distribution and composition of marine litter, but from intertidal, subtidal and pelagic zones, with some focusing exclusively on microplastics. These studies have been conducted over local, regional and international scales, usually for less than one year each. Both citizen science and professional studies on marine litter have been conducted mainly in the northern hemisphere, revealing a lack of information available on coastal regions of the southern hemisphere. A main concern of citizen science studies is the reliability of the collected information, which is why many studies include steps to ensure data quality, such as preparation of clear protocols, training of volunteers, in situ supervision by professional scientists, and revision of samples and data. The results of this comparative review confirm that citizen science can be a useful approach to increase the available information on marine litter sources, distribution and ecological impacts. Future studies should strive to incorporate additional citizen scientists who frequent marine environments, for instance, divers and sailors, to improve our understanding of marine litter dynamics.","It seems ironic that most professional scientists studying marine litter have initially been trained in marine biology, microbiology, oceanography or related disciplines. By having redirected their research attention to the problem of marine litter, they have demonstrated that they are true citizens of the oceans! With their fascination for the sea, they join the thousands of enthusiastic citizens all over the world who have contributed to some of the research discussed herein.

It was in Australia that media entrepreneurs foresaw profitable rewards from sports such as cricket, Australian Rules Football, Rugby League and even that honour-bound amateur game: Rugby Union.

Through an examination of the construct of intimacy and ‘nearness’, including emotional, spiritual, psychic, intellectual, and physical closeness, Jonathan Jansen demonstrates its power to influence positive leadership in young people. He argues that sensory leadership, which includes but extends beyond the power of touch, represents a fresh and effective approach to progressive transformation of long divided institutions. Considering richly textured narratives, chapters explore complex intimacies among Black and White university students in South Africa, post-apartheid and in the aftermath of a major racial atrocity. The stories reveal the students’ transformation in the process of ‘leadership for change’, interweaving concepts of racism, human relationships and intimacy, and in turn expanding the knowledge base of social and institutional improvement. This book explores how, when different kinds of nearness come together in leadership change, young people respond in ways that would not be possible through conventional instruments such as policy, legislation and the appeal to moral sensibilities alone. Leading for Change will be critical reading for academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of education, educational justice, higher education, educational leadership and change, social and/or racial justice.

active galaxy. Our data set for the nearby source NGC 4151 consists of six
epochs of quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared spectroscopy spanning a
period of about eight years and five epochs of X-ray spectroscopy overlapping
in time with it. None of the coronal lines showed the variability behaviour
observed for the broad emission lines and hot dust emission. In general, the
coronal lines varied only weakly, if at all. Using the optical [Fe VII] and
X-ray O VII emission lines we estimate that the coronal line gas has a
relatively low density of n~10^3 cm^-3 and a relatively high ionisation
parameter of log U~1. The resultant distance of the coronal line gas from the
ionising source is about two light years, which puts this region well beyond
the hot inner face of the obscuring dusty torus. The high ionisation parameter
implies that the coronal line region is an independent entity rather than part
of a continuous gas distribution connecting the broad and narrow emission line
regions. We present tentative evidence for the X-ray heated wind scenario of
Pier & Voit. We find that the increased ionising radiation that heats the dusty
torus also increases the cooling efficiency of the coronal line gas, most
likely due to a stronger adiabatic expansion.",,,arXiv,,,,2015-01-13,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Landt, Hermine; Ward, Martin J.; Steenbrugge, Katrien C.; Ferland, Gary J.","Landt, Hermine (Durham University); Ward, Martin J.

193,pub.1020533532,10.5194/osd-12-3003-2015,,,Seasonal variability of the Ekman transport and pumping in the upwelling system off central-northern Chile (~ 30° S) based on a high-resolution atmospheric regional model (WRF),"Two physical mechanisms can contribute to coastal upwelling, offshore Ekman transport and Ekman pumping due to the cyclonic wind stress curl, mainly caused by the abrupt decrease in wind stress (drop-off) in a cross-shore band of 100 km. This wind drop-off is thought to be an ubiquitous feature in coastal upwelling systems and to regulate the relative contribution of both mechanisms. It has been poorly studied along the central-northern Chile region because of the lack in wind measurements along the shoreline and of the relatively low-resolution of the available atmospheric Reanalysis. Here, the seasonal variability in Ekman transport, Ekman pumping and their relative contribution to total upwelling along the central-northern Chile region (~ 30° S) is evaluated from a high-resolution atmospheric model simulation. As a first step, the simulation is validated from satellite observations, which indicates a proper representation of the spatial and temporal variability of the wind along the coast by the model. The model outputs are then used to document the fine scale structures in the wind stress and wind curl in relation with the topographic features along the coast (headlands and embayments). Both wind stress and wind curl had a clear seasonal variability with a marked semiannual component. Alongshore wind stress maximum peak occurred in spring, second increase was in fall and minimum in winter. When a threshold of −3 x 10−5 s−1 for the across-shore wind curl was considered to define the region from which the winds decrease on-shoreward, the wind drop-off length scale varied between 8 and 45 km. The relative contribution of Ekman transport and Ekman pumping to the vertical transport along the coast, considering the estimated wind drop-off length, indicated meridional alternation between both mechanisms, modulated by orography and the intricate coastline. Roughly, coastal divergence predominated in areas with low orography and headlands. Ekman pumping was higher in regions with high orography and the presence of embayments along the coast. In the study region, the vertical transport induced by coastal divergence and Ekman pumping represented 60 and 40 % of the total upwelling transport, respectively. The potential role of Ekman pumping on the spatial structure of sea surface temperature is also discussed.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2015-12-08,2015,2015-12-08,,12,6,3003-3041,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Bravo, L.; Ramos, M.; Astudillo, O.; Dewitte, B.; Goubanova, K.","Bravo, L.

producing the most prominent substructure in the Milky Way (MW) halo, the
Sagittarius Stream. Aside from field stars, the Sgr dSph is suspected to have
lost a number of globular clusters (GC). Many Galactic GC are suspected to have
originated in the Sgr dSph. While for some candidates an origin in the Sgr dSph
has been confirmed due to chemical similarities, others exist whose chemical
composition has never been investigated. NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 are two among
these scarcely studied Sgr dSph candidate-member clusters. To characterize
their composition we analyzed one giant star in NGC 5053, and two in NGC 5634.
We analize high-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra by means of the MyGIsFOS
code, determining atmospheric parameters and abundances for up to 21 species
between O and Eu. The abundances are compared with those of MW halo field
stars, of ""unassociated"" MW halo globulars, and of the metal poor Sgr dSph main
body population.
  We derive a metallicity of [FeII/H]=-2.26+-0.10 for NGC 5053, and of
[FeI/H]=-1.99+-0.075 and -1.97+-0.076 for the two stars in NGC 5634. This makes
NGC 5053 one of the most metal poor globular clusters in the MW. Both clusters
display an alpha enhancement similar to the one of the halo at comparable
metallicity. The two stars in NGC 5634 clearly display the Na-O anticorrelation
widespread among MW globulars. Most other abundances are in good agreement with
standard MW halo trends. The chemistry of the Sgr dSph main body populations is
similar to the one of the halo at low metallicity. It is thus difficult to
discriminate between an origin of NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 in the Sgr dSph, and
one in the MW. However, the abundances of these clusters do appear closer to
that of Sgr dSph than of the halo, favoring an origin in the Sgr dSph system.",,,arXiv,,,,2015-05-06,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Sbordone, L.; Monaco, L.; Bidin, C.

The economic crisis has accelerated expectations of an increased role in addressing economic and societal challenges while, at the same time, putting pressure on available finances. Broader trends such as shifting student demographics and expectations, globalisation and mobility and new ways of working with business have contributed to these increased pressures. In the light of these trends there have been moves, both from national or regional agencies and from individual institutions to respond by combining resources, either through collaborative arrangements or more fundamentally through mergers between two or more universities.  This volume seeks to draw upon recent and past experiences of mergers and associations short of a merger and to approach the subject both from a systemic level and from the perspective of individual institutions. Inevitably the two levels are interlinked but broadly speaking this distinction is used to separate Part 1, dealing with perspectives at the level of a nation and national system, although often illustrated by examples which extend the range of cases (for countries such as France, Sweden, Romania, Wales, China, South Africa), and Part 2, which takes us down to individual case-studies analysed in depth (in countries such as France, UK, Romania, Spain, Australia). These experiences of course also show responses to wider forces and initiatives but allow a more detailed insight into the specific rationales and the implementation issues involved in effecting a university merger. Within the sections the general flow is from large to medium to small European countries and then to non-European. The chapters of this volume tell stories and make contributions in their own right. An introductory chapter seeks to guide the reader by pointing out from the start some recurrent themes and tensions. In seeking to identify the phenomenon of university mergers, their causes and their consequences, a series of dichotomies are discussed: alliance vs merger; external vs internal motivation; education vs research; short-term vs long-term outcomes and assessment; and motivation and implementation.",,,,,"Adrian Curaj, Luke Georghiou, Jennifer Cassingena Harper, Eva Egron-Polak",,2015,2015,,2015,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,25,2,,8.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038622550,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Called the agenda-setting role of the media, this influence occurs at three levels. Focusing public attention on a select few issues or other topics at any moment is level one. Emphasizing specific attributes of those issues or topics is level two. The Power of Information Networks: The Third Level of Agenda Setting introduces the newest perspective on this influence. While levels one and two are concerned with the salience of discrete individual elements, the third level offers a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective to explain media effects in this evolving media landscape: the ability of the news media to determine how the public associates the various elements in these media messages to create an integrated picture of public affairs. This is the first book to detail the theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, and international empirical evidence for this new perspective. Cutting-edge communication analytics such as network analysis, Big Data and data visualization techniques are used to examine these third-level effects. Diverse applications of the theory are documented in political communication, public relations, health communication, and social media research.

A total of 387 taxa, including pro- and eukaryotic micro-organisms, seaweeds and invertebrates, have been found rafting on floating litter in all major oceanic regions. Among the invertebrates, species of bryozoans, crustaceans, molluscs and cnidarians are most frequently reported as rafters on marine litter. Micro-organisms are also ubiquitous on marine litter although the composition of the microbial community seems to depend on specific substratum characteristics such as the polymer type of floating plastic items. Sessile suspension feeders are particularly well-adapted to the limited autochthonous food resources on artificial floating substrata and an extended planktonic larval development seems to facilitate colonization of floating litter at sea. Properties of floating litter, such as size and surface rugosity, are crucial for colonization by marine organisms and the subsequent succession of the rafting community. The rafters themselves affect substratum characteristics such as floating stability, buoyancy, and degradation. Under the influence of currents and winds marine litter can transport associated organisms over extensive distances. Because of the great persistence (especially of plastics) and the vast quantities of litter in the world’s oceans, rafting dispersal has become more prevalent in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species.",We thank Miriam Goldstein and Emmett Clarkin for valuable comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

The authors demonstrate that the fields of comic-book production and circulation in various regional histories introduce new postcolonial vocabularies, reconstitute conventional ""image-functions"" in established social texts and political systems, and present competing narratives of resistance and rights. In this sense, postcolonial comic cultures are of particular significance in the context of a newly global and politically recomposed landscape.

The book also addresses the question of how to define and measure the sustainability of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). The sustainability of IWRM is an important issue when planning and/or developing policies that consider the impact of climate change, water governance and ecohydrology in the context of a more holistic approach to ensure sustainable management of water resources. Sustainable IWRM is more about processes, and relatively little systematic or rigorous work has been done to articulate what components are the most essential to ensure the ongoing sustainability of IWRM efforts. The chapters cover topics including global prospective of IWRM; allocation of environmental flows in IWRM; echohydrology, water resources and environmental sustainability; climate change and IWRM; IWRM and water governance including social, economic, public health and cultural aspects; climate change resiliency actions related to water resources management sustainability and tools in support of sustainability for IWRM. This book will be of interest to researchers, practitioners, water resources mangers, policy and decision makers, donors, international institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, educators, as well as graduate and undergraduate students.

To measure realistic temperatures, a corresponding Boltzmann distribution of the rotational level populations has to be achieved. However, this might not be fulfilled, especially at high emission altitudes. In order to quantify possible non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) contributions to the OH Trot as a function of the upper vibrational level v', we studied a sample of 343 echelle spectra taken with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile. These data allowed us to analyse 25 OH bands in each spectrum. Moreover, we could measure lines of O2b(0-1), which peaks at about 94 to 95 km, and O2a(0-0) with an emission peak at about 90 km. The latter altitude is reached in the second half of the night after a rise of several km because of the decay of a daytime population of excited O2. Since the radiative lifetimes for the upper levels of the two O2 bands are relatively long, the derived Trot are not significantly affected by non-LTE contributions. These bands are well suited for a comparison with OH if the differences in the emission profiles are corrected. For different sample averages, we made these corrections by using OH emission, O2a(0-0) emission, and CO2-based temperature profile data from the multi-channel radiometer SABER on the TIMED satellite. The procedure relies on differences of profile-weighted SABER temperatures. For an O2a(0-0)-based reference profile at 90 km, we found a good agreement of the O2 with the SABER-related temperatures, whereas the OH temperatures, especially for the high and even v', showed significant excesses with a maximum of more than 10 K for v' = 8. The exact value depends on the selected lines and molecular parameters. We could also find a nocturnal trend towards higher non-LTE effects, particularly for high v'. The amplitude of these variations can be about 2 K or less, which tends to be significantly smaller than the total amount of the non-LTE contributions. The found variations can be critical for dynamical studies based on Trot derived from OH bands with high v'.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2015-11-05,2015,2015-11-05,,15,21,30793-30856,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Noll, S.; Kausch, W.; Kimeswenger, S.; Unterguggenberger, S.; Jones, A.

She traveled to Rwanda, Mozambique, and South Africa to assess the various ways those nations tried to come to grips with their violent past: from war crimes trials to truth commissions to outright amnesties for perpetrators. She discovered that in terms of both moving forward and satisfying the needs of survivors, war crimes trials are not the most effective path.

56,pub.1102451539,10.2139/ssrn.2725775,,,Financial Characteristics of the Nonprofit Organisation: Theory and Evidence for the Assessment of the Financial Condition of South African Public Universities,"In this PhD thesis, an analytical framework is developed for the assessment of the financial condition of South African public universities. Foundational constructs of nonprofit economics are applied in the consideration of financial theories of nonprofit organisations in general, and public universities in particular. From this review, a number of hypotheses are developed. Each of these specifies a positive or negative association between a university's financial condition and a particular dimension of its assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and surplus. From the nonprofit financial analysis literature, ratios and indicators relevant to these hypotheses are selected. Audited data from the annual financial statements of the universities for the seven year period 2007 to 2013 are substantially transformed in mitigation of failures in accounting, auditing and accountability. The adjusted accounting numbers are used to calculate the financial indicators applicable to each university. Exploratory factor analysis is implemented to categorise and organise this large indicator set on the basis of identified associations with a smaller number of factors. It is found that the financial condition of South African public universities is defined by two broad financial characteristics, capital and revenue. Assessment of the capital dimension is informed by a focus on institutional equity, with particular emphasis on expendable equity and its proportionate relationships with surplus, total capital, and total expenses. The revenue dimension is appropriately evaluated in the context of a comparative and interactive consideration of the three main components of South African public university revenue, as well as the proportionate relationship between non-staff operating expenses and total expenses. The framework displays considerable levels of stability and consistency over the seven year review period, and its constructs are, in addition, robust to the application of multiple alternative confirmatory tests involving financial data that are independent of the factor solutions. The financial condition assessment framework developed in this thesis offers a contribution to a broader discourse in nonprofit finance and accounting, with a focus on public university finances.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Bunting, Mark B.","Bunting, Mark B.

By devoting 28 of the 44 essays in this book to historical surveys, we are able to introduce readers to the historical roots and development of Christian sacramental worship. The contributors to this Handbook explain the diverse ways that believers have construed the sacraments, both in inspired Scripture and in the history of the Church’s practice. In Scripture and the early Church, Orthodox, Protestants, and Catholics all find evidence that the first Christian communities celebrated and taught about the sacraments in a manner that Orthodox, Protestants, and Catholics today affirm as the foundation of their own faith and practice. Thus, for those who want to understand what has been taught about the sacraments in Scripture and across the generations by the major thinkers of the various Christian traditions, this Handbook provides an introduction. While the divisions in Christian sacramental understanding and practice are certainly evident in this Handbook, the Handbook is not thereby without ecumenical and missional value. This book evidences that the story of the Christian sacraments is, despite divisions in interpretation and practice, one of tremendous hope.",,,,,"Hans Boersma, Matthew Levering",,2015-08-06,2015,2016-03-07,2015-08-06,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,7,0,,14.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108912638,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5005 Theology,

In the context of higher education, many universities and academics are seeking new insights that can shift our dependence on ways of living that rely on the exploitation of so many and the degradation of so much of our planet.

Although much of the research is on a relatively small scale, the vision is steadily gaining momentum, forging dynamic collaborations and pathways to new knowledge. The contributors to this book cover a variety of subject areas and offer fresh insights about chronically under-researched parts of the world.

36,pub.1025403753,10.1007/978-94-6300-277-6,,,Decolonizing Global Citizenship Education,"The ideas for this reader came out of a conference organized through the Centre for Global Citizenship Education and Research (CGCER) at the University of Alberta in 2013. With the high expansion of global citizenship education scholarship in the past 15 or so years, and with most of this scholarship produced in the west and mostly focused on the citizenship lives of people in the so-called developing world, or selectively attempting to explain the contexts of marginalized populations in the west, the need for multidirectional and decolonizing knowledge and research perspectives should be clear. Indeed, the discursive as well as the practical constructions of current global citizenship education research cannot fulfill the general promise of learning and teaching programs as social development platforms unless the voices of all concerned are heard and validated. With these realities, this reader is topically comprehensive and timely, and should constitute an important intervention in our efforts to create and sustain more inclusive and liberating platforms of knowledge and learning. “This collection of cutting-edge theoretical contributions examines citizenship and neo-liberal globalization and their impacts on the nexus of the local and global learning, production of knowledge, and movements of people and their rights. Case studies in the collection also provide in-depth analysis of lived experiences that challenge the constructed borders, which derive from colonial and imperial re-structuring of the contemporary world and nation-states. The contributors articulate agency in terms of both resistance and proactive engagement toward the construction of an alternative world, which acknowledges equality, justice and common humanity of all in symbiosis with the social and natural environment. It is a valuable reader for students, scholars, practitioners, and activists interested in the empowering possibilities of decolonized global citizenship education.” – N’Dr",,,,,"Ali A.

However, their composition, formation and evolution remain poorly understood3. The study of multiplanetary systems offers an opportunity to investigate the outcomes of planet formation and evolution while controlling for initial conditions and environment. Those in resonance (with their orbital periods related by a ratio of small integers) are particularly valuable because they imply a system architecture practically unchanged since its birth. Here we present the observations of six transiting planets around the bright nearby star HD 110067. We find that the planets follow a chain of resonant orbits. A dynamical study of the innermost planet triplet allowed the prediction and later confirmation of the orbits of the rest of the planets in the system. The six planets are found to be sub-Neptunes with radii ranging from 1.94R⊕ to 2.85R⊕. Three of the planets have measured masses, yielding low bulk densities that suggest the presence of large hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.","We acknowledge the use of public TESS data from pipelines at the TESS Science Office and at the TESS Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC).

176,pub.1157667281,10.1038/s41561-023-01170-x,,,The global contribution of soil mosses to ecosystem services,"Soil mosses are among the most widely distributed organisms on land. Experiments and observations suggest that they contribute to terrestrial soil biodiversity and function, yet their ecological contribution to soil has never been assessed globally under natural conditions. Here we conducted the most comprehensive global standardized field study to quantify how soil mosses influence 8 ecosystem services associated with 24 soil biodiversity and functional attributes across wide environmental gradients from all continents. We found that soil mosses are associated with greater carbon sequestration, pool sizes for key nutrients and organic matter decomposition rates but a lower proportion of soil-borne plant pathogens than unvegetated soils. Mosses are especially important for supporting multiple ecosystem services where vascular-plant cover is low. Globally, soil mosses potentially support 6.43 Gt more carbon in the soil layer than do bare soils. The amount of soil carbon associated with mosses is up to six times the annual global carbon emissions from any altered land use globally. The largest positive contribution of mosses to soils occurs under perennial, mat and turf mosses, in less-productive ecosystems and on sandy soils. Our results highlight the contribution of mosses to soil life and functions and the need to conserve these important organisms to support healthy soils.","We thank D.

Understanding whether the distribution of terrestrial biosignatures is characterized by recognizable and predictable patterns could yield signposts to optimize search efforts for life on other terrestrial planets. We advance an adaptable framework that couples statistical ecology with deep learning to recognize and predict biosignature patterns at nested spatial scales in a polyextreme terrestrial environment. Drone flight imagery connected simulated HiRISE data to ground surveys, spectroscopy and biosignature mapping to reveal predictable distributions linked to environmental factors. Artificial intelligence–machine learning models successfully identified geologic features with high probabilities for containing biosignatures at spatial scales relevant to rover-based astrobiology exploration. Targeted approaches augmented by deep learning delivered 56.9–87.5% probabilities of biosignature detection versus <10% for random searches and reduced the physical search space by 85–97%. Libraries of biosignature distributions, detection probabilities, predictive models and search roadmaps for many terrestrial environments will standardize analogue science research, enabling agnostic comparisons at all scales.","This study was supported by the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) via grant NNA15BB01A.

In 1982, Terborgh et al. quantified the structure and organisation of the bird community in a 97-ha. plot in southeastern Peru. We revisited the same plot in 2018 using the same methodologies as the original study to evaluate community-wide changes. Contrary to longitudinal studies of other neotropical bird communities (Tiputini, Manaus, and Panama), we found little change in community structure and organisation, with increases in 5, decreases in 2 and no change in 7 foraging guilds. This apparent stability suggests that large forest reserves such as the Manu National Park, possibly due to regional topographical influences on precipitation, still provide the conditions for establishing refugia from at least some of the effects of global change on bird communities.","This work was made possible through the support of San Diego Zoo Global and the staff of Cocha Cashu Biological Station.

804,pub.1166479819,10.1007/s10914-023-09690-4,,,A new early Miocene bat (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) from Panama confirms middle Cenozoic chiropteran dispersal between the Americas,"Fossils of an insectivorous bat from the early Miocene of Panama are described as a new genus and species, Americanycteris cyrtodon (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae: Phyllostominae). Americanycteris is a large phyllostomine bat, similar in size to the living species Chrotopterus auritus. Americanycteris cyrtodon can be distinguished from other closely related species by a posteriorly curved p4 and a thick labial cingulum on m1. Americanycteris cyrtodon occurs in two early Miocene vertebrate faunas from Panama. The holotype mandible with p4–m1 and an isolated p3 of A. cyrtodon were recovered from the early Hemingfordian (19–18 Ma) Centenario Fauna, and a mandible with p2 was found in the older late Arikareean (21 Ma) Lirio Norte Local Fauna. A similar large phyllostomine bat is known from the early Miocene Gran Barranca Fauna in Argentina. The presence of early Miocene phyllostomids in both North America and South America confirms the overwater dispersal of bats between the Americas before the late Miocene onset of the Great American Biotic Interchange. Pre-late Miocene chiropteran dispersals between the Americas were previously documented for the Emballonuridae and Molossidae. Although the five endemic New World families in the Noctilionoidea, including Phyllostomidae, were previously thought to be South American in origin, the oldest fossil records of noctilionoids (Mormoopidae and extinct Speonycteridae) are from the early Oligocene of Florida and one of the earliest records of the Phyllostomidae is from the early Miocene of Panama. The currently available fossil records from Panama and Florida suggest a possible North American origin for the Noctilionoidea.","Numerous people have assisted us in the field and in the laboratory work that led to the discovery of the bat fossils described here. The holotype mandible of Americanycteris cyrtodon was discovered by a coauthor of this paper (AFR), the mandible from Lirio Norte was found by M. C. Vallejo-Pareja, and the isolated tooth from Hodges Hill was recovered from screenwashing concentrate by J. Velez-Juarbe. J. Bourque skillfully prepared the holotype mandible of A. cyrtodon in the fossil preparation laboratory at the Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida. U. Denetclaw, I. Cannon, and A. Poyer helped with screenwashing that led to the discovery of many important specimens of Miocene small vertebrates from Panama. We are grateful to the staff of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for assistance with logistics in conducting fieldwork in Panama, in particular C. Jaramillo and L. Londoño. We thank the Panama Canal Authority and the Ministerio de Comercio e Industria for permits and access to fossil sites along the Panama Canal. P.

1142,pub.1155141273,10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.106643,,,Spatio-temporal assessment of Gridded precipitation products across topographic and climatic gradients in Colombia,"Gridded precipitation products (GPPs) represent an alternative to and a complement to gauge-based observations of precipitation, improving the representation of spatio-temporal precipitation variability in regions with scarce gauge networks. However, GPPs' accuracy varies among products, temporal resolution, and regions, indicating the need for particular regional performance assessments. In this study, we evaluate the performance of eight state-of-the-art GPPs (CHIRPSv2, CMORPHv1, ERA5, ERA5-Land, IMERG, MSWEPv2.8, PERSIANN-CCS, and PERSIANN-CDR) over the steep topographic and climatic gradients of Colombia, in northwestern South America. We use a point-to-pixel comparison between ground-based observations from 1334 gauges with the corresponding grid cell of each GPP at 3-day, monthly, seasonal (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON), and annual scales over 2005–2014. Five categorical indices are used to assess the ability of each GPP to capture different 3-day precipitation intensity events correctly. The Kling-Gupta efficiency and its components are used to assess the GPPs' performance over Colombia and its five natural regions. Our results show that, at the 3-day scale, GPPs can correctly identify the occurrence of no-precipitation events (< 1 mm/day), but their capacity to classify precipitation events (≥ 1 mm/day) is low. The best performance is observed at the monthly scale, particularly at low elevation zones (0–1000 m.a.s.l), compared to 3-day and annual scales. Seasonally, GPPs tend to perform better during the dry season compared to the wet season in all regions. Overall, CHIRPSv2 outperforms other GPPs throughout the country and its five natural regions for all elevation zones and temporal scales, followed closely by MSWEPv2.8 and IMERG. PERSIANN-CCS and ERA5 products had the lowest performance, mainly over the driest and higher-altitude regions, respectively. This study provides insights into the performance of GPPs in complex climatic and topographic settings and, importantly, suggests the most suitable products for climate, hydrological, or ecological studies in a climatic, hydrological, and ecologically-strategic region.","This work was funded by the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MINCIENCIAS) through program “Sostenibilidad de sistemas ecológicos y sociales en la cuenca Magdalena-Cauca bajo escenarios de cambio climático y pérdida de bosques” (code 1115-852-70719) with funds from “Patrimonio Autónomo Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología y la Innovación, Fondo Francisco José de Caldas”.

METHODS: Delayed-onset (>7 days) vaccine-related adverse events (AE), disease flares and AID-related treatment modifications were analysed upon diagnosis of AID vs healthy controls (HC) and the pregnancy/breastfeeding status at the time of at least one dose of vaccine.
RESULTS: Among the 9201 participants to the self-administered online survey, 6787 (73.8%) were women. Forty pregnant and 52 breastfeeding patients with AID were identified, of whom the majority had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (100% and 96.2%, respectively). AE were reported significantly more frequently in pregnant than in non-pregnant patients (overall AE 45% vs 26%, P = 0.01; minor AE 40% vs 25.9%, P = 0.03; major AE 17.5% vs 4.6%, P < 0.01), but no difference was found in comparison with pregnant HC. No difference was observed between breastfeeding patients and HC with respect to AE. Post-vaccination disease flares were reported by 17.5% of pregnant and 20% of breastfeeding patients, and by 18.3% of age- and disease-matched non-pregnant and non-breastfeeding patients (n = 262). All pregnant/breastfeeding patients who experienced a disease flare were managed with glucocorticoids; 28.6% and 20% of them required initiation or change in immunosuppressants, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study provides reassuring insights into the safety of COVID-19 vaccines administered to women with AID during the gestational and post-partum periods, helping overcome hesitant attitudes, as the benefits for the mother and for the fetus by passive immunization appear to outweigh potential risks.","COVAD Study Group authors: Zoltán Griger, Sinan Kardes, Melinda Nagy Vince, Yogesh Preet Singh, Rajiv Ranjan, Avinash Jain, Sapan C.

These genres, particularly the thriving danzón culture in Panama, contributed in various degrees to the shaping of típico as local performers adopted, adapted and reinterpreted rhythms and melodic material from the context of existing musical traditions. Expanding on recent research, I show how this cultural dialogue developed into a platform for innovation from which típico emerges as a distinct genre in the mid 20th century, a reinterpretation of the dance repertoire known as danzón–cumbia by composers which I collectively call the Azuero School. I examine how this repertoire and its performance practice became channels for discontinuous cultural dialogue, experimentation and reinterpretation of multiple influences in a context of political and social change in Panama.","I would like thank Simón Saavedra, Evelio Ramírez, Julio Espino, Joaquín Chávez, Roberto ‘Papi’ Brandao, Alberto Patiño, and Nicolás Aceves Núñez for kindly sharing their insight on the performance and history of Panamanian music.

The Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges, two adjacent seamount chains in the Southeast Pacific, are biodiversity hotspots marked by the highest levels of marine endemism on Earth. Historically isolated from many human activities, this region has produced a unique biodiversity and provides an excellent opportunity for protecting a global biodiversity hotspot before it is degraded. However, no legal protection mechanism currently exists for comprehensively protecting areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) of the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges. After years of negotiations at the United Nations for a legally binding instrument to address conservation in ABNJ, the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement was finally agreed in March 2023. While this Agreement may provide one avenue for protecting the high seas, the Agreement has yet to be adopted and ratification may take several years. As it stands, conservation efforts in ABNJ will rest on sectoral bodies primarily set to manage large-scale industries like fishing, shipping, and mining, but that do have the ability to enact conservation measures other than restricting these industrial activities. Our study provides an overview of the major international organizations managing activities in the ABNJ of the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges, identifies current conservation measures, and maps out potential policy pathways for creating conservation measures in this unique region. Our synthesis focused on identifying conservation procedures within the documents of international organizations and applying their rules and procedures to implement conservation measures. We identify three potential pathways. A regional and national pathway that relies on cooperation among international organizations spearheaded by the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO), and an international pathway through the BBNJ Agreement.",,,Marine Policy,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,152,,105594,Closed,Article,"Chavez-Molina, Vasco; Wagner, Daniel; Nocito, Emily S.; Benedum, Michelle; Gaymer, Carlos F.; Currie, Duncan; Beam, Emily Golden; Brooks, Cassandra M.","Chavez-Molina, Vasco (Department of Environmental Studies, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309, USA); Wagner, Daniel (Ocean Exploration Trust, Aiea, HI 96701, USA); Nocito, Emily S.

Volunteers sampled AML on 130 beaches along the central and southern East Pacific coasts, with AML densities ranging from 0.46 to 2.26 items m-2 in the different countries. AML composition was dominated by plastics and cigarette butts, the latter especially in Mexico and Chile. The accumulation of AML in the upper zones of the beaches and substantial proportions of cigarette butts, glass and metal pointed mainly to local sources. Statistical modelling of litter sources on continental beaches revealed that tourism, access and related infrastructure (e.g. parking lots) best explained AML densities, while plastic densities were also influenced by the distance from river mouths and national Gross Domestic Product. Large-scale monitoring can be a useful tool to evaluate the effectiveness of public policies that should primarily focus on land sources.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

7096,pub.1156565079,10.1016/j.jad.2023.03.058,36997125,,Ancestry component as a major predictor of lithium response in the treatment of bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar Disorder (BD) represents the seventh major cause of disability life-years-adjusted. Lithium remains as a first-line treatment, but clinical improvement occurs only in 30 % of treated patients. Studies suggest that genetics plays a major role in shaping the individual response of BD patients to lithium.
METHODS: We used machine-learning techniques (Advance Recursive Partitioned Analysis, ARPA) to build a personalized prediction framework of BD lithium response using biological, clinical, and demographical data. Using the Alda scale, we classified 172 BD I-II patients as responders or non-responders to lithium treatment. ARPA methods were used to build individual prediction frameworks and to define variable importance. Two predictive models were evaluated: 1) demographic and clinical data, and 2) demographic, clinical and ancestry data. Model performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: The predictive model including ancestry yield the best performance (sensibility = 84.6 %, specificity = 93.8 % and AUC = 89.2 %) compared to the model without ancestry (sensibility = 50 %, Specificity = 94.5 %, and AUC = 72.2 %). This ancestry component best predicted lithium individual response. Clinical variables such as disease duration, the number of depressive episodes, the total number of affective episodes, and the number of manic episodes were also important predictors.
CONCLUSION: Ancestry component is a major predictor and significantly improves the definition of individual Lithium response in BD patients. We provide classification trees with potential bench application in the clinical setting. While this prediction framework might be applied in specific populations, the used methodology might be of general use in precision and translational medicine.",Conflict of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

261,pub.1155631175,10.1111/tran.12605,,,We just gotta do meta! Notes on disciplinary anxieties in Geography in India,"Abstract A hundred years since its inception in college curriculum in India, geography as a discipline appears to be marked by a lack of self confidence. The persistently unenthusiastic response of Indian departments of geography to the present global health crisis over the past three years suggests that this is not a momentary loss of heart. We suggest that this is rather the result of the discipline's intertwining with post independence development policy in addition to the failure to integrate the sub disciplines of geography well with each other. As a way forward, we argue that the greatest promise in fact lies not in the universities but in networks across departments and independent research centres where geography can truly claim its place in the sun as a discipline that offers the relational approach that few other disciplines offer.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Dr Arvind Pandey, Tata Institute of Social Sciences for sharing his insights.",,Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers,,,,2023-03-26,2023,2023-03-26,2024-06,49,2,,Closed,Article,"Roy, Shamindra Nath; Maringanti, Anant","Roy, Shamindra Nath (Centre for Policy Research, Dharma Marg, Chankyapuri, New Delhi, India); Maringanti, Anant (Hyderabad Urban Lab, Hyderabad, India)","Roy, Shamindra Nath (Centre for Policy Research)","Roy, Shamindra Nath (Centre for Policy Research); Maringanti, Anant (Hyderabad Urban Lab, Hyderabad, India)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155631175,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

For this reason, there has been a growing need for simple and sensitive tools for the on-site detection of this mycotoxin. In this study, we developed a label-free impedimetric immunosensor to detect OTA. The biosensor was built on a thin-film gold electrode evaporated on glass substrtes, modified with a self-assembled cysteamine monolayer and anti-OTA antibodies. Atomic force microscopy and Microspectroscopy RAMAN confirmed the successful functionalization of the electrodes. The biosensor performance was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the measurements indicated a linear relationship between the change in the impedance values and the OTA concentration in the range from 0.5 to 100 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection of 0.15 ng mL-1. The biosensor was highly selective and did not suffer matrix interference when analyzed in coffee samples. Furthermore, considering the small sample volumes, the short time required for analysis, and the possibility of miniaturization, the developed biosensor represents a promising analytical device for on-site coffee quality analyses.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

There is an urgent need for sustainable technologies to clean up rivers and oceans to protect wildlife and human health. One solution is harnessing the power of bacterial consortia; however isolated microbes from different environments have shown low diesel bioremediation rates in seawater thus far. An outstanding question is whether Antarctic microorganisms that thrive in environments polluted with hydrocarbons exhibit better diesel degrading activities when propagated at higher temperatures than those encountered in their natural ecosystems. Here, we isolated bacterial consortia, LR-30 (30 °C) and LR-10 (10 °C), from the Antarctic rhizosphere soil of Deschampsia antarctica (Livingston Island), that used diesel oil as the only carbon substrate. We found that LR-30 and LR-10 batch bioreactors metabolized nearly the entire diesel content when the initial concentration was 10 (g/L) in seawater. Increasing the initial diesel concentration to 50 gDiesel/L, LR-30 and LR-10 bioconverted 33.4 and 31.2 gDiesel/L in 7 days, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing profiles revealed that the dominant bacterial genera of the inoculated LR-30 community were Achromobacter (50.6%), Pseudomonas (25%) and Rhodanobacter (14.9%), whereas for LR-10 were Pseudomonas (58%), Candidimonas (10.3%) and Renibacterium (7.8%). We also established continuous bioreactors for diesel biodegradation where LR-30 bioremediated diesel at an unprecedent rate of (34.4 g/L per day), while LR-10 achieved (24.5 g/L per day) at 10 °C for one month. The abundance of each bacterial genera present significantly fluctuated at some point during the diesel bioremediation process, yet Achromobacter and Pseudomonas were the most abundant member at the end of the batch and continuous bioreactors for LR-30 and LR-10, respectively.","Y.S–B and M.O–S acknowledge the support of Beca de Doctorado ANID 21180776 and 2120733.

182,pub.1155635714,10.1007/s10530-023-03015-5,,,Successful intertidal colonization of the invasive macroalga Codium fragile near its equatorial/warm range limit in the South-East Pacific,"Codium fragile is considered one of the most invasive marine seaweeds. It has invaded coastal habitats worldwide in temperate regions (30°–60° in both hemispheres), but it is rarely found at lower latitudes (i.e., tropical and subtropical regions). Here we document the distribution of C. fragile together with relevant size and reproductive parameters across the intertidal zone in a recently invaded bay at 23° S on the SE Pacific coast of Chile, close to its equatorial/warm range limit in the South-East Pacific. Codium was primarily found in mid and high tidepools, with only a few individuals on exposed rock surfaces. Larger individuals were found in the high intertidal pools, but reproductive individuals were more common in mid tidepools. Typical grazing invertebrates were common in low tidepools but decreased in densities towards the upper intertidal zone, suggesting that consumer pressure on Codium is lower in the upper tidepools. The higher temperatures and salinities in the high intertidal pools likely exclude important generalist grazers, allowing the more tolerant invasive seaweed Codium to successfully colonize these pools. These results suggest that Codium can colonize these coastal habitats at low latitudes because it can find a refuge from consumers in the high tidepools and is highly tolerant to extreme environmental conditions.","We thank Maylin Estica, Karina González, Melanie Bon and Leonardo Campos for their help with fieldwork.

Our study focuses on the urban area of the metropolitan area of Barranquilla on the Caribbean Coast of Colombia. We examined heat disparities at the block level and used, 2018 census data to test whether population groups with high socioeconomic vulnerability were also exposed to higher land surface temperatures (LST). Specifically, we defined populations with high and low socioeconomic vulnerability based on their socioeconomic level, educational attainment, age, population density and percentage of migrant population. We tested whether those groups had differences in LST and other temperature-related variables, including NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDBI (normalized difference built-up index) and distance to water. Finally, we generated a heat risk map based on socioeconomic vulnerability and heat exposure. Our results showed that high and low-vulnerability groups had significant differences in LST and distance to water compared to marginal differences in NDVI and NDBI. Spatially, due to historical urban development patterns, areas at higher heat risk were found to the south of the study region, where there is a combination of low socioeconomic level, higher population density and high LST.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Few studies, however, have examined changes in collegiality during the pandemic despite scholarship noting that educators experienced isolation as support systems weakened and collaboration with colleagues in school settings was reduced. In this essay, we discuss the impacts of the pandemic on educator collegiality by drawing upon survey data gathered from 758 educators in 38 public schools in New York State. Survey results show that COVID-19 related disruptions negatively impacted educators’ collegiality although these impacts differed in intensity by educator gender, role, mode of instruction, and years of experience. As educator collegiality is related to a range of positive influences on educators and students and has been shown to potentially mitigate burnout and turnover, it is crucial to better understand the impacts of the pandemic on collegiality and discuss strategies to support educator collegiality in the future.",,,Journal of Educational Change,,,,2023-08-23,2023,2023-08-23,2023-11,24,4,1099-1110,Closed,Article,"Schiller, Kathryn S.; Wilcox, Kristen C.; Leo, Aaron; Khan, Maria I.; Ávila, José Antonio Mola","Schiller, Kathryn S.

Skilled human capital accretion increases regional growing early-stage businesses activity, while skilled wages deter it. Changes in local skilled human capital explain regional differences in growing early-stage businesses activity, whereas the effect of changes in external skilled human capital is less clear.","The authors are grateful to Davide Luca and to two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.

In particular, contributors consider how the analysis of social reproduction might illuminate the politics of everyday life, the representational challenges accompanying the banality or ubiquity of women's work, the potential gaps of social reproduction feminism, and the aesthetic challenges accompanying or following from an interest in social reproduction. Topics covered include digital media as foundational operating mode of Hindu nationalism, the sexuality- and race-based exclusions of employment in higher education, Philippine literature as ‘reproductive fiction’, the Latin American novel vis-à-vis its registration of domestic service, the short story as bellwether for global issues surrounding women’s labour, and questions of complicity in the kinds of labour some women and sexual minorities enact for larger authoritarian, patriarchal projects. If women do much of the work of producing the everyday then we must also ask how women might re-make the everyday along more radical, and radically egalitarian lines.",,,Feminist Theory,,,,2023-11-28,2023,2023-11-28,2024-04,25,2,242-259,Closed,Article,"Houlden, Kate; Rushton, Amy; Marte-Wood, Alden Sajor; Russo, Daniella Sánchez; Varma, Rashmi","Houlden, Kate (Brunel University London, UK); Rushton, Amy (Nottingham Trent University, UK); Marte-Wood, Alden Sajor (Rice University, USA); Russo, Daniella Sánchez (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Varma, Rashmi (University of Warwick, UK)","Houlden, Kate (Brunel University London)","Houlden, Kate (Brunel University London); Rushton, Amy (Nottingham Trent University); Marte-Wood, Alden Sajor (Rice University); Russo, Daniella Sánchez (Universidad del Norte); Varma, Rashmi (University of Warwick)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166497139,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,5 Gender Equality

Many of these studies fail to portray the everyday lives of the students who protested against the Bantu Education system in South Africa, dwelling on the spectacular. This article primarily draws on oral history interviews with former student activists of the 1960s and 1970s to historicise their reading practices. It thus introduces a new layer to the story of the making of youth political consciousness in South African schools in the 1970s. The article shows how reading happened in the classroom, the playground and the home and how this reading led to the formation of multiple and contiguous subaltern counterpublic spheres that became the crucible of many of the student leaders of the march of 1976. It adds to the literature on the subversion of apartheid by exploring some contradictions in the system that were exploited by students and teachers.","I wish to thank the following for their comments on earlier drafts this paper: the anonymous JSAS reviewers, Fernanda Pinto de Almeida, Clive Glaser, Arianna Lissoni and Dennis Walder.

167,pub.1158426215,10.1029/2022gb007688,,,Recent Deoxygenation of Patagonian Fjord Subsurface Waters Connected to the Peru–Chile Undercurrent and Equatorial Subsurface Water Variability,"Abstract  In recent decades, global dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements have registered a decrease of ∼1%–2% in oxygen content, raising concerns regarding the negative impacts of ocean deoxygenation on marine life and the greenhouse gas cycle. By combining in situ data from 2016 to 2022, satellite remote sensing, and outputs from a physical‐biogeochemical model, we revealed the deoxygenation process in the Patagonian fjords for the first time. Deoxygenation was associated with the advection of equatorial subsurface water (ESSW) mass into the northern region of Patagonia. An analysis of the circulation regime using the Mercator‐Ocean global high‐resolution model confirmed the importance of the Peru–Chile undercurrent (PCUC) in transporting the ESSW poleward, contributing to the entrance of ESSW into the northern Patagonian fjords. A mooring system installed in the water interchange area between the Pacific Ocean and Patagonian fjords detected a decreasing DO of −21.66 μmol L −1 over 7 years, which was explained by the increase in PCUC transport of 1.46 Sv. Inside the Puyuhuapi fjord system, a second DO time series exhibited more marked deoxygenation with −88.6 μmol L −1 over 3 years linked with the influence of ESSW and local processes, such as DO consumption by the organic matter degradation. The recent deoxygenation registered in the northern Patagonian fjords demonstrates the significance of studying DO in the context of reducing the global oxygen content, further warranting the quantification of the impacts of deoxygenation on life cycles of marine organisms that inhabit the Patagonian fjords and channels and the Humboldt current system. 
Plain Language Summary  The South Eastern Pacific (SEP) hosts one of the most extensive oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of all oceans, covering an area of 9.8 million km 2 . An OMZ is caused by the decomposition of large numbers of marine organisms which consume oxygen‐poor water circulation, which means that oxygen levels are not replenished. While previous studies on the SEP OMZ were focused on the center and the northernmost areas of the OMZ, research has not focused on how far south the OMZ reaches, and how it connects to bottom waters in the Patagonian fjords. Here, we analyzed temperature, salinity, and oxygen data collected where the South Pacific water meet Patagonian waters. We demonstrate that low‐oxygen waters are transported by the Peru–Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) as far south as the Patagonian fjords. We show that this leads to low‐oxygen in the oceanic‐fjord area and inside the fjords. This deoxygenation was attributed to the increasing southward transport of deoxygenated equatorial subsurface waters by the PCUC. The deoxygenation reported here provides evidence of the association between the SEP OMZ and the fjord systems of Patagonia. Deoxygenation directly impacts marine life, the cycle of greenhouse gases, and ecosystem services for humans. 
Key Points    In situ data collected from a Patagonian fjord from 2016 to 2022 revealed a trend of deoxygenation in deep waters   A combination of modeling and in situ data demonstrated the arrival of the equatorial subsurface water (ESSW) to northern Patagonia   Recent deoxygenation was attributed to poleward transport by the Peru–Chile undercurrent and ESSW","Acknowledgments This research was funded by FONDECYT 1211037, COPAS Sur‐Austral ANID AFB170006, the Office of Naval Research Grant N00014‐17‐1‐2606, COPAS COASTAL ANID FB210021, FONDECYT 1170507, FIPA 2015‐07, CIEP R20F002, and a doctoral fellowship from Universidad de Los Lagos (Chile) to Pamela Linford.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with cervical cancer FIGO 2018 stage IA1 with lymphovascular invasion up to stage IIIC1p who underwent SLN mapping and open radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy from March 2018 through August 2022 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. ICG was the only tracer used with the SPY-PHI system. Patient demographics, surgical approach, and tumor factors were analyzed. Overall detection, bilateral detection, and empty lymph node packet rates were determined.
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included. Ninety-four (88.7%) patients underwent open radical hysterectomy and 12 (11.3%) open radical trachelectomy. Median age was 40 years (range, 23-71). Median body mass index was 28.8 kg/m2 (range, 17.6-48.4). The most common FIGO 2018 stages were IB1 (35%) and IB2 (30%). The most common histologic subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (45%) and adenocarcinoma (45%). Most patients had grade 2 disease (61%) and no lymphovascular invasion (58%). Median tumor size was 1.8 cm (range, 0.3-4). Median number of detected SLN was 4 (range, 0-12). An SLN was identified during surgery in 104 patients (98%), with bilateral mapping in 94 (89%) and unilateral mapping in 10 (9%). The empty lymph node packet rate was 4 (3.8%). The external iliac (73%) was the most common site of SLN detection. Fourteen patients had positive lymph nodes (13.5%); 3 (21.4%) had macrometastases, 9 (64.3%) had micrometastases, and 2 (14.3%) had isolated tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: SLN mapping using ICG with the SPY-PHI system in open radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy is reliable and results in high overall and bilateral detection rates in patients with early cervical cancer.",Supported by the NIH/NCI under award number P30CA016672.,"The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",International Journal of Gynecological Cancer,,,Humans; Female; Indocyanine Green; Middle Aged; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Hysterectomy; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Sentinel Lymph Node; Aged; Trachelectomy; Young Adult; Coloring Agents; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; Neoplasm Staging; Lymphatic Metastasis,2023-12-14,2023,2023-12-14,2024-01,34,1,28-34,Closed,Article,"Fernandez, Maria A; Clark, Helen D; Iniesta, Maria D; Munsell, Mark F; Frumovitz, Michael; Ramirez, Pedro T","Fernandez, Maria A (Medicine Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia; Executive and Continuing Professional Education (ECPE) – Principles and Practice of Clinical Research (PPCR), Harvard University T H Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA); Clark, Helen D (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA); Iniesta, Maria D (Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA); Munsell, Mark F (Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA); Frumovitz, Michael (Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA); Ramirez, Pedro T (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA)","Fernandez, Maria A (Universidad del Norte; Harvard University)","Fernandez, Maria A (Universidad del Norte; Harvard University); Clark, Helen D (Columbia University); Iniesta, Maria D (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center); Munsell, Mark F (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center); Frumovitz, Michael (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center); Ramirez, Pedro T (Houston Methodist)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166969828,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,

This study represents the first phase of the National and Cross-sectoral Plan for TCC Elimination.
OBJECTIVES: To obtain data about knowledge and practices in relation to the TCC from knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys applied in two pilot localities for building a baseline of the potential risk factors related to identification, prevention, and control of TCC in Colombia.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey from October to November in 2019 was carried out using a structured questionnaire and random sampling by single-stage conglomerates in the municipalities of Mahates, Bolívar (n = 152) (Atlantic Region) and Mercaderes, Cauca (n = 152) (Andean Region).
RESULTS: Respondents in Mahates showed moderate knowledge about TCC compared to those in Mercaderes, however, risky practices were identified in both places (consumption of pork with cysts and defecation in places other than the bathroom or latrine). Deficiency in infrastructure and failure in basic services were observed as potential risk factors for TCC transmission in both municipalities.
CONCLUSION: Based on the framework of the National and Cross-sectoral Plan for TCC Elimination, adequate knowledge on identification, prevention, and control of the disease must be reinforced; cultural and ecological differences should be considered when designing communication and knowledge transmission tools. We consider that major investment should be made in improving basic services and creating sustainable modernized pig farming in Mahates and Mercaderes.","Declaration of Competing Interest Authors declare not having any competing interest.

                    Objectives
                    To determine the association between self-medication with antibiotics (SMA) and purchase of brand-name drugs in Peru.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    A secondary analysis was conducted using a nationally representative survey from 2014 to 2016. The exposure variable was self-medication (SM), which is defined as the purchase of drugs for self-administration without a medical prescription. The study outcome was the purchase of brand-name drugs (yes/no). Sociodemographic variables, such as health insurance and type of institution, were considered as confounders. To assess the association between SMA and the purchase of brand-name drugs, the crude prevalence ratios (cPR) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated with their confidence intervals at 95% (95% CI) using a Poisson-type generalized linear model and considering the complex survey design.
                  
                  
                    Key findings
                    A total of 1862 participants were analysed; 54.4% of the participants were women with a mean age of 39.3 years. The prevalence rate of SMA was 54.3%, whereas that of the purchase of brand-name drugs was 55.3%. The adjusted Poisson regression analysis showed an association between SMA and the purchase of brand-name drugs (aPR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.18–1.37; P < 0.001).
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    It was found that 5 of 10 respondents SMA. Approximately 6 of 10 respondents that SMA used brand-name drugs.

201,pub.1166968183,10.1111/zsc.12641,,,Mito‐nuclear discordance and phylogeography of the surf clam Mesodesma donacium along the Southeast Pacific coast,"Abstract  Mesodesma donacium is a surf clam endemic to the southeast Pacific coast, and it is an important resource species of the sandy beach artisanal fishery in Peru and Chile. Over time, the species has shown high variability in population dynamics (presence and abundance), which has been attributed to overfishing and environmental events. In this study, we assess the phylogeography of seven natural beds of M. donacium (17 to 42° S), to reveal the geographic distribution of the genetic diversity through the analysis of 278 sequences of the mitochondrial gene COI. Sequences of the nuclear genes 18S and 28S were used to evaluate the divergence of COI haplogroups. Two divergent parapatric mitochondrial haplogroups were found, which lacked divergence at nuclear markers (18S and 28S); this mito‐nuclear discordance allows inferring that there is no reproductive isolation of mitochondrial haplogroups. The North haplogroup is the only one present at the northernmost site, while only the South haplogroup was present in Cucao in the south. Between 28° and 32° S, coincident with a coastal biogeographic break at 30° S, both haplogroups are in sympatry. Haplogroups differed in their genetic structure, with the North haplogroup representing a single, highly diverse population and the South haplogroup with genetic differentiation and more restricted genetic diversity and gene flow. The divergence in mitochondrial haplogroups without nuclear divergence suggests a past scenario of geographic isolation in the northern and southern areas, without developing reproductive isolation, followed by secondary contact. Given the phylogeography, genetic information should be considered in restocking and management activities.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are thankful to Sheyla Zevallos, Roger Ayerbe and the La Punta Shore Fishermen&#x27;s Association for help with sample collection in Peru.

Under this view, we propose a general parametrization of the bulk viscosity of the form ξ∼H1-2sρms$$\xi \sim H^{1-2s} \rho _{m}^{s}$$, Some advantages of this novel parametrization are: first, it allows to write the resulting equations of cosmological evolution in the form of an autonomous system for any value of s, so a general treatment of the fixed points and stability can be done, and second, the bulk viscosity effect is consistently handled so that it naturally turns off when matter density vanishes. As a main result we find, based on detailed dynamical system analysis, one-parameter family of de Sitter-like asymptotic solutions with non-vanishing bulk viscosity coefficient during different cosmological periods. Numerical computations are performed jointly along with analytical phase space analysis in order to assess more quantitatively the bulk viscosity effect on the cosmological background evolution. Finally, as a first contact with observation we derive constraints on the free parameters of some bulk viscosity models with specific s-exponents from Supernovae Ia and observations of the Hubble parameter, by performing a Bayesian statistical analysis thought the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.","G.G acknowledges financial support from Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación - Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Proyecto DICYT, Código 042031 CM_POSTDOC.

This detection is usually performed manually by one or more clinicians based on reports and psychometric testing. Machine learning algorithms provide an alternative method of prediction that may contribute, with an automated process and insights, to the diagnosis and classification of the severity level of dementia. The aim of this study is to explore the use of neuropsychological data from a reduced version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) to predict absence or different levels of dementia severity using the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) scores through the implementation of the kNN machine learning algorithm. A sample of 1164 elderly people over sixty years old were evaluated using a reduced version of the ACE-III and the GDS. The kNN classifier provided good accuracies using 15 items from the ACE-III and adequately differentiating people with absence and mild impairment, from those with more severe levels of impairment according to the GDS rating. Our results suggest that the kNN algorithm may be used to automate aspects of clinical cognitive impairment classification in the elderly population.",,,Applied Neuropsychology Adult,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,2023-01-01,,,1-9,Closed,Article,"Calderón, Carlos; Bekios-Calfa, Juan; Bekios-Canales, Nikolás; Véliz-García, Oscar; Beyle, Christian; Palominos, Diego; Ávalos-Tejeda, Marcelo; Domic-Siede, Marcos","Calderón, Carlos (Núcleo de Investigación en Neurociencia Cognitiva, Afectiva y Neuropsicología, Laboratorio de Neurociencia Cognitiva, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Bekios-Calfa, Juan (Núcleo de Investigación en Neurociencia Cognitiva, Afectiva y Neuropsicología, Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.); Bekios-Canales, Nikolás (Núcleo de Investigación en Neurociencia Cognitiva, Afectiva y Neuropsicología, Laboratorio de Neurociencia Cognitiva, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Véliz-García, Oscar (Núcleo de Investigación en Neurociencia Cognitiva, Afectiva y Neuropsicología, Laboratorio de Neurociencia Cognitiva, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Beyle, Christian (Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica de Temuco.

Recent data reveals an annual production of approximately 14 million tons of plastic waste, not accounting for the surge in the usage of plastic masks and related materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, what remains largely unreported is that over half of post-consumer plastic packaging in Brazil is managed without any monitoring, and it remains unclear how this will contribute to the occurrence of plastic waste and microplastics in Brazilian freshwaters. This scenario requires the consideration of several other crucial factors. Studies have been carried out mainly in marine and estuarine waters, while data on freshwaters are lacking. Brazil has continental dimensions and the highest water availability on the planet, yet the demand for water is greatest in regions with medium to low supply. Many densely populated Brazilian urban areas face chronic flood problems, possess inadequate levels of wastewater treatment, and display inadequate solid waste management practices. Consequently, urban freshwater with tropical characteristics in Brazil presents an intriguing scenario and is complementary to the most commonly studied marine environments. In this study, we explore the nuances of pollution in Brazilian urban freshwater and discuss how various parameters, such as organic matter, suspended solids, temperature, and pH, among others, influence the behavior of microplastics and their interactions with organic and inorganic contaminants. Furthermore, we address how microplastic conditions, such as biofouling, the type of plastic, or degradation level, may impact their behavior. By analyzing how these conditions change, we propose priority themes for investigating the occurrence of microplastics in Brazilian urban freshwater systems under different degrees of human impact. Ultimately, this study aims to establish a network dedicated to standardized monitoring of microplastic pollution in Brazilian urban freshwaters.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

(Ca) cream on inflammatory hypernociception. Methods Creams with different Ca concentrations were tested for their ability to ameliorate pain-related behavior and edema in rats using formalin test, carrageenan (Cg)-induced acute inflammation model, bradykinin (BK)-induced acute inflammation model, and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic inflammation model. Using the formalin test, we also examined the implication of peripheral opioid receptors in the antinociceptive mechanisms of Ca cream, by means of Q-naloxone, a peripherally acting nonselective opioid antagonist. Furthermore, the effects of Ca cream compared with diclofenac on BK-induced edema were examined when the kininase II in tissue was preserved or inhibited by captopril. The local production of redox biomarkers in formalin model, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Cg model and histopathological changes in CFA model were also evaluated. Results A single application of Ca cream at a dose of 10% or 30% (w/w) decreased the formalin-induced licking/biting behavior during both phases of this test in a Q-naloxone-sensitive manner. This effect was associated with the reduction of oxidative stress in the injured paw and the edema associated with the later phase of formalin-induced pain. A single application of Ca cream (10% or 30%) reduced paw edema and thermal hypernociception in Cg-induced acute inflammation, corresponding with a local decrease in TNF-α. Ca cream also inhibited BK-induced spontaneous nociceptive behavior and paw inflammation in both paradigms studied. Repeated applications of Ca cream also decreased CFA-induced chronic inflammation, mechanical hypernociception and histopathological changes in the paw. Conclusion These results reveal the topical antinociceptive and antiedematogenic effects of Ca cream. A modulatory action on peripheral opioid receptors associated with its antioxidant mechanism may be involved, at least in part, in its analgesic effects. These findings may have an impact on the clinical management of painful inflammatory diseases.",Acknowledgment Special thanks to Jorge Conde Garrido for his advice on the correct use of the English language.

We present a comprehensive revision of Laevilitorina, using molecular and morphological analyses, to address formally the interspecific divergences within the nominal taxon Laevilitorina caliginosa s.l. We confirm the validity of L. caliginosa and Laevilitorina venusta, and we demonstrate that specimens from the Strait of Magellan and Hornos Island constitute four new species here described: Laevilitorina magellanica sp. nov., Laevilitorina pepita sp. nov., Laevilitorina fueguina sp. nov., and Laevilitorina hicana sp. nov. All six species are clearly distinguishable genetically, morphologically, and through radular tooth shape and configurations. Laevilitorina venusta is broadly distributed across the Antarctic Peninsula, South Georgia, and sub-Antarctic Islands (Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Macquarie), whereas L. caliginosa s.s. appears geographically restricted to Cape Horn, the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, and South Georgia. The identification of populations from Macquarie Island as L. caliginosa is dubious; we suggest that these records are likely to pertain to L. venusta. This detailed revision of Laevilitorina, whereby hidden diversity was detected, significantly enriches our knowledge of the evolutionary history of this group.","We are grateful to the Government of South Georgia &amp; South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI), South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute (SAERI), Natural History Museum (NHM) London, and the Shallow Marine Surveys Group (SMSG) for organizing the research cruise (Operation Himantothallus, Darwin Plus Marine Biodiversity Research Cruise, Pharos SG-11-2021) and Tritonia Scientific Ltd for diving operations and dive safety.

185,pub.1168131050,10.1017/s0001972023000785,,,African universities and the challenge of postcolonial development,"Abstract Extensively ignored by the literature on the subject, recent interest in the fate of academic freedom in Africa is linked with shared concerns about the exploding nature of its societal crises. The collapse of political integration and social cohesion; the decline of the civil society and the implosion of conflicts; the rise of authoritarian, non-developmental populist regimes amid extreme poverty; and the worsening material conditions of the populations are major indications of such crises. Nowhere are these crises worse illustrated than in the universities where constrained funding, infrastructural collapse, massive brain drains and strained relations with the state inhibit the production of knowledge. This article reflects on the trajectory of the universities in postcolonial Africa. It draws on the national public universities in Nigeria and accounts for the changes and continuities underlying their performance against the backdrop of hostile material conditions and uncongenial political control, which not only remain disruptive but continue to undermine institutional autonomy and the integrity of scholarship in the universities across Africa.
Résumé Largement ignoré par la littérature sur ce sujet, l’intérêt récent porté au sort de la liberté académique en Afrique est lié aux inquiétudes partagées concernant la nature explosive des crises sociétales. L’effondrement de l’intégration politique et de la cohésion sociale, le déclin de la société civile et l’implosion des conflits, la montée des régimes populistes non développementaux autoritaires sur fond d’extrême pauvreté, et la détérioration des conditions matérielles sont tous des indicateurs majeurs de ces crises. Ces dernières sont le plus clairement illustrées dans les universités où les contraintes financières, l’effondrement de l’infrastructure, la fuite massive des cerveaux et les relations tendues avec l’État sont autant de freins à la production des savoirs. Cet article s’intéresse à la trajectoire des universités en Afrique postcoloniale. Centré sur les universités publiques nationales du Nigeria, il explique les changements et les continuités qui soulignent leur efficacité dans un contexte de conditions matérielles défavorables et de contrôle politique hostile, qui non seulement demeurent déstabilisants, mais aussi continuent à fragiliser l’autonomie institutionnelle et l’intégrité de la recherche dans les universités africaines.
Resumo Extensivamente ignorado pela literatura sobre o assunto, o recente interesse no destino da liberdade académica em África está ligado a preocupações comuns sobre a natureza explosiva das crises sociais. O colapso da integração política e da coesão social; o declínio da sociedade civil e a implosão dos conflitos; a ascensão de regimes populistas autoritários e não-desenvolvimentistas em meios de pobreza extrema; e o agravamento das condições materiais das populações – tudo isto são indícios importantes dessas crises. Em nenhum outro lugar estas crises são mais claramente ilustradas do que nas universidades, onde o financiamento limitado, o colapso das infraestruturas, a fuga maciça de cérebros e as relações tensas com o Estado inibem a produção de conhecimento. Este artigo reflete sobre a trajetória das universidades na África pós-colonial. Baseia-se nas universidades públicas nacionais da Nigéria e explica as mudanças e as continuidades subjacentes ao seu desempenho num contexto de condições materiais hostis e de um controlo político desconfortável, que não só continuam a ser destabilizadores como continuam a minar a autonomia institucional e a integridade dos estudos nas universidades de toda a África.","This article was originally written between September 2019 and September 2020, when I was a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.

This homemade model reproduces the spontaneous subduction of a dense, magnetic sand layer into a viscous layer of white school glue in a plastic kitchen container, all in a few minutes. Preparation of this experimental setup is simple, the materials are inexpensive or easy to obtain, and quantitative observations can be performed using cellphone cameras and freely available software on a personal computer. This very visual model setup brings the concept of subduction closer to the student of geosciences, and can be performed and analyzed at home. Once all the materials are set, spontaneous subduction of the magnetic sand layer takes place in a single event punctuated by one or two slab-tearing episodes, where the trenches quickly retreat (consuming as much as 15 cm2/s), while leaving nearby slab segments unsubducted. Rapidly retreating trenches induce toroidal flow of glue around the torn subducting slab, and cause large vertical-axis rotations of the unsubducted segments above, dynamically supporting, extending, and eventually bringing them into the vigorous poloidal flow of the subducting slab. Black magnetic sand impurities within the otherwise white glue allow precise tracking of the toroidal and poloidal flows. Complete detachment from the edges of the container changes the kinematics of the experiment from rapid trench retreat, to an stationary trench that pulls the remainder of the black magnetic sand layer into the trenches and causes thinning and opening of an extensional axis, reminiscent of spreading centers.","We thank Luz Orozco, Juan Camilo Meza, Julieth Monroy, and Bernardo Caicedo, as well as many generations of Structural Geology students in both Uniandes and Uninorte since 2013 for help in refining the model materials and methods.

1688,pub.1154448761,10.1785/0120220168,,,Ground-Motion Model (GMM) for Crustal Earthquakes in Northern South America (NoSAm Crustal GMM),"ABSTRACT
                  Crustal earthquakes are some of the main contributors to the seismic hazard in northern South America (NoSAm). There is evidence of historical crustal events with epicenters near populated cities, such as the 1999 Mw 6.2 Coffee Region earthquake, whose damages added up to 1.9% of Colombia’s gross domestic product and reported about 1200 deaths. Because the global crustal ground-motion models (GMMs) routinely used in seismic hazard assessments of the region are biased with respect to the available ground-motion records, this article presents a regional GMM developed using local data from earthquakes in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. The filtered database contains 709 triaxial records from 56 earthquakes, recorded at 92 stations between 1994 and 2020 by the Colombian Geological Survey. The moment magnitudes of the events range between 4.5 and 6.8, with hypocentral depths ≤60 km. The model covers rupture distances ≤350 km. The model site amplification is based on a categorization approach relying on the predominant site period, identified through the horizontal-to-vertical response ratios of 5%-damped response spectra. The proposed GMM is developed as a regionalization of the global Next Generation Attenuation-West2 Project ASK14 model. Our model corrects the misfit of the ASK14 GMM with respect to the observed ground-motion data in NoSAm for moderate magnitudes and intermediate to large distances while keeping the extrapolation capabilities. The proposed GMM considers the added attenuation for ray paths crossing the volcanic arc. Analysis of the variance components allows approximating plausible reductions of the standard deviation in future nonergodic models.",,,Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America,,,,2023-01-11,2023,2023-01-11,2023-02-01,113,1,186-203,Closed,Article,"Arteta, Carlos A.; Pajaro, Cesar A.; Mercado, Vicente; Montejo, Julián; Arcila, Mónica; Abrahamson, Norman A.","Arteta, Carlos A.

Design/methodology/approach The framework used draws on trends identified within an international collaborative research study in which both authors participated, titled “Developing a Blueprint for Global Legal Education”. This current paper stems from the premise that these recommendations can be further developed and better utilised if explored within a specific context. The methodology designed for this research consisted of two main components: a thorough analysis of the norms that regulate the education system and the professional practice in Mexico, and an extensive literature review that provided insights into the state of global trends in legal education.   Findings This paper reveals that in Mexico having a well-designed and comprehensive legal framework is the first step to promote the creation of high-quality educational models.   Practical implications The study analyses the current situation in Mexico within four global trends: (1) regulation of legal education and access to the profession; (2) building professional practice skills; (3) internationalisation of education and (4) incorporation of technology and responsible innovation.   Originality/value The reflections are intended to promote better training of law students in the skills required to face the various challenges that the legal profession currently involves. This is under an approach that analyses global challenges and identifies the best practices to connect learning processes with in-demand professional skills.",The authors acknowledge Thomas Guy Scott and Sonsoles Arias for their support in translating and elaborating this paper.,,Higher Education Skills and Work-based Learning,,,,2023-07-10,2023,2023-07-10,2023-11-08,13,6,1305-1317,Closed,Article,"Noriega, Ana María Zorrilla; Arias, Marco Sánchez","Noriega, Ana María Zorrilla (Department of Law, Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico); Arias, Marco Sánchez (Department of Law, Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico)","Noriega, Ana María Zorrilla (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México)","Noriega, Ana María Zorrilla (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México); Arias, Marco Sánchez (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160515502,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Its general dynamics are reasonably well understood in terms of ocean–atmosphere interactions that modify the Walker circulation in the equatorial Pacific. However, some of its space–time features remain stubbornly elusive, such as its event-to-event diversity and asymmetry. Here we show that zonal shifts in the Walker circulation control ENSO space–time complexity in a low-dimensional theoretical framework. We encapsulate these movements in a conventional recharge–discharge oscillator for ENSO by replacing the regionally fixed sea surface temperature index with a warm-pool edge index that displaces the Walker circulation structures. By doing so, we can model essential ingredients of ENSO diversity and nonlinear behaviour without increasing the complexity of the dynamical model. The simple framework is able to reproduce the continuum of ENSO flavours and the asymmetry in the amplitude of warm and cold events. The spatial shifting concept paves the way for a more unified understanding of ENSO and its associated climate teleconnections.","The research of S.T. is supported by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant ANR-18-CE01-0012).

Boron nitride (BN), aluminum nitride (AlN), and gallium nitride (GaN) decorated carbon cage (BN-C, AlN-C, and GaN-C) scaffolds were assessed towards sensing the thiamazole (TMZ) drug through the wB97XD/6–31 + G* level of density functional theory (DFT) computations. The singular models were optimized and their combinations to each other were stabilized to obtain the interacting TMZ@Scaffold bimolecular complexes and their corresponding features. The results indicated the existence of non-covalent physical interactions between the substances and their electronic features indicated possibility of sensing function for the investigated scaffolds. Based on the variations of values of adsorption energy and energy gap, the features of recovery time and conductance rate were achieved to predict a sensing function for the models; TMZ@GaN-C was found at the highest suitability in comparison with TMZ@AlN-C and TMZ@BN-C models. The obtained thermochemistry results indicated a spontaneous process for the formation of TMZ@Scaffold complexes. Based on all the obtained results, an order of TMZ@GaN-C > TMZ@AlN-C > TMZ@BN-C was found for describing stability, formation, and electronic features suitability by assigning specific features for each of the singular BN-C, AlN-C, and GaN-C scaffolds towards the TMZ drug.

There is a trend in the software industry towards building systems that dynamically adapt their behavior in response to their surrounding environment, given the proliferation of various technological devices, such as notebooks, smartphones, and wearables, capable of capturing their execution context. Context-oriented Programming (COP) allows developers to use layer abstractions to adapt software behavior to the context. A layer is associated with a context and can be dynamically activated in direct response to gathered information from its surrounding execution environment. However, most existing layer activation mechanisms have been tailored specifically to address a particular concern; implying that developers need to tweak layer definitions in contortive ways or create new specialized activation mechanisms altogether if their specific needs are not supported. Objective. Complementing ideas to expressively declare activation mechanism models with interfaces that define conditionals of activation mechanisms modularly, this paper proposes an Expressive and Modular Activation mechanism, named EMA. Method. To propose EMA, we analyze existing activation mechanisms in COP regarding activation features and scope strategies. After, we propose the design of EMA and validate it with a case study discussion. Results.

Specifically, I argue that critics overstate RE's philosophical actualism in their argument that its inclination towards technocratic knowledge impedes its scrutiny of stratified social systems. Notwithstanding its limitations in fully elucidating causal structural mechanisms in social inquiry, I argue that RE's research rationale can contribute to the stages of explanatory research based on CR by bridging the comprehension of mechanisms linked to micro-interventions with exploring potential structural forces operating across levels of reality. To illustrate this point, I present a case of a policy evaluation study I led that demonstrates how a RE-oriented research design facilitated a transition from investigating specific programme mechanisms within the interventions' context to proposing transcendental questions about the governance of the education system in Colombia.","Many of the ideas in the article emerged from valuable discussions during the IACR 2022 annual critical realism conference held in The Hague, The Netherlands.

Sequencing and algorithmic thinking are at the core of CT. This study looked into how young children enrolled in a kindergarten in Colombia develop CT skills. This paper aims to develop a learning progression of sequencing and algorithm design for early childhood. This goal is complemented by identifying the challenges children face to advance into more sophisticated approaches to problem-solving using algorithmic thinking. Fourteen five- and six-year-old students participated in this study. These children participated in unplugged learning activities, and solved two sets challenges with the BeeBot. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze how they solved these algorithmic thinking activities and the challenges they faced in this process. Our results suggest four increasingly sophisticated approaches to solving these activities: step-by-step, simple decomposition, advanced decomposition, and full algorithm design. We also found different challenges students faced when working on these activities. These challenges can relate to critical cognitive skills. These results will enable educators to support student learning about CT. These results also open new questions about the relationship between cognitive skills and CT activities in early childhood.","We would like to thank Mariana Arboleda, Gabriela de la Rosa, Roxana Quintero, Britny Velasquez, Gisella Jassir, and Angélica Carrasquilla for all the data collection support.",The work was supported by the Fulbright Colombia and Center for Global Inquiry and Innovation at theUniversity of Virginia.,Computer Science Education,,,,2023-10-12,2023,2023-10-12,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-21,Closed,Article,"Vieira, Camilo; Chiu, J.; Velasquez, B.","Vieira, Camilo (Department of Education, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Chiu, J.

As a result, there is a downward tendency in both older people and their caretakers’ quality of life, which frequently results in frailty. There are numerous solutions available to treat the issue, which primarily affects older people. The basic and most popular imaging method for predicting cognitive impairment is magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, few of the earlier models had a definite level of accuracy when diagnosing the condition. Further, there is a critical need to put in place a stronger, more reliable approach to precise prediction. When compared to other procedures, using magnetic resonance images to predict cognitive decline is the safest and most straightforward. The advanced concept for a better optimized strategy to predict cognitive impairment at an early stage is presented in this research. The hybrid krill herd and grey wolf optimization method is offered as a solution to address the challenges in locating the impacted area.

Although the theoretical electrophilicity index (ω) has been associated with E in a small homologous series, the use of w to predict E in a structurally heterogeneous set of compounds is not a trivial task. In this study, a robust ensemble model is created using Mayr's database of reactivity parameters. A combination of topological and quantum mechanical descriptors and different machine learning algorithms are employed for the model's development. The predictability of the model is assessed using different statistical parameters, and its validation is examined, including a training/test partition, an applicability domain, and a y-scrambling test. The global ensemble model presents a Q5-fold2 of 0.909 and a Qext2 of 0.912, demonstrating an excellent predictability performance of E values and showing that w is not a good descriptor for the prediction of E, especially for the case of neutral compounds. ElectroPredictor, a noncommercial Python application (https://github.com/mmoreno1/ElectroPredictor), is developed to predict E. QM9, a well-known large dataset containing 133885 neutral molecules, is used to perform a virtual screening (94.0% coverage). Finally, the 10 most electrophilic molecules are analyzed as possible new Mayr's electrophiles, which have not yet been experimentally tested. This study confirms the necessity to build an ensemble model using nonlinear machine learning algorithms, topographic descriptors, and separating molecules into charged and neutral compounds to predict E with precision.",This work was performed employing the computational resources of USFQ’s and UR’s High Performing Computing Systems.

Nevertheless, the archaeological record of seaweed burning is still limited to contexts where preservation is exceptional and macroscopic discrimination of charred remains is possible. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in discriminating seaweed vs. plant/wood char. Our dataset (N = 92) consists of modern and archaeological seaweed and plant/wood charred remains, including specimens of unknown origin from the Atacama Desert coast, Northern Chile. The charred samples were processed to obtain 13 parameters which were then fed into five supervised machine learning models. The models, built on samples of known origin (seaweed and plant/wood), performed remarkably well in terms of accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, and specificity. The models were used for final predictions on 10 non-identified archaeological charcoals. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning techniques is a robust methodology for discriminating seaweed and plant/wood charred remains in the archaeological record. The predictions on unknown samples confirm that seaweed was used as fuel in a specific funerary ritual in the southern Atacama Desert coast around 5000 cal BP. Furthermore, charred specimens of Lessonia spp. recovered from combustion features in other northern Chile coastal settlements, suggest that seaweed pyrotechnology developed by Atacama Desert coast people is likely a long-term process. As for coastal archaeology, this work encourages new research on seaweed as an alternative/main fuel in coastal deserts and evaluates possible bias for chronologies from coastal archaeological settlements around the globe.","The authors acknowledge to Arturo Peña and Javier Vargas for allowing us to perform the experimental burnings of the Taller de Cerámica of the Universidad de Tarapacá.

Even so, reports of BHABs remain relatively scarce in South America (SA). This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on BHABs in the continent, by integrating data from published articles, books, and technical reports. We recorded ∼300 different occurrences of potentially toxic BHAB species over the Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific coasts, mostly in marine (>95%) but also in estuarine areas located from 12⁰36' N to 54⁰53' S. Over 70% of the data was published/released within the past 10 years, and ∼85% were concentrated in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia. Benthic species were mainly associated with macroalgae, seagrass and sediment. Incidental detection in the plankton was also relevant, mainly in places where studies targeting BHAB species are still rare, like Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru. The study listed 31 infrageneric taxa of potentially toxic benthic dinoflagellates and eight of estuarine cyanobacteria occurring in SA, with the greatest species diversity recorded in the equatorial-tropical zone, mainly in northeastern Brazil (Atlantic), Venezuela and Colombia (Caribbean), and the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador (Pacific). Local strains of Amphidinium, Gambierdiscus, Coolia and Prorocentrum spp. produced toxic compounds of emerging concern. Prorocentrum lima species complex was the most common and widely distributed taxon, followed by Ostreopsis cf. ovata. In fact, these two dinoflagellates were associated with most BHAB events in SA. Whereas the former has caused the contamination of multiple marine organisms and cases of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning in subtropical and temperate areas, the latter has been associated with faunal mortalities and is suspected of causing respiratory illness to beach users in tropical places. Ciguatera Poisoning has been reported in Colombia (∼240 cases; no deaths) and Venezuela (60 cases; two deaths), and may be also a risk in other places where Gambierdiscus spp. and Fukuyoa paulensis have been reported, such as the Galapagos Islands and the tropical Brazilian coast. Despite the recent advances, negative impacts from BHABs in SA are intensified by limited research/training funding, as well as the lack of official HAB monitoring and poor analytical capability for species identification and toxin detection in parts of the continent.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) are exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts in their natural habitat. In this species, females are typically smaller and dive less deep than males. In related species, the more limited foraging habitat of females and their reduced resiliency due to their smaller size were associated with higher mortality. We hypothesise that potential sex-specific differences in the foraging behaviour of Humboldt penguins may also relate to differences in their physiological stress. Here, we studied sex-specific foraging and diving behaviours and variations in plasma corticosterone levels and leukocyte profiles of Humboldt penguins during the chick-rearing period in Northern Chile. We report no evidence of sex-related differences in most foraging parameters, except that males dived significantly deeper than females. We found that plasma corticosterone levels and leukocyte profiles showed no significant differences between the sexes. Furthermore, there was no clear relationship between an individual’s foraging behaviour and its plasma corticosterone level or leukocyte profile. In summary, we found no support for sex-related differences in physiological stress levels of Humboldt penguins, and no link between their foraging behaviour and their physiological stress. However, we acknowledge that our sample size is small and that more studies are needed. This study contributes with information on the physiological stress and foraging behaviours of Humboldt penguins in Northern Chile. This information can help to understand context-dependent differences in physiological parameters and foraging behaviours for the species.","We thank Wolfgang Goymann and Monika Trappschuh from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany for their collaboration with the hormone analysis.

To analyze how State actions and other factors have triggered its misgovernment, conflicts, and environmental degradation, we constructed a chronology of events related to territorial occupation, gold exploitation, conflict evolution, and state intervention. The overlapping rights that the government assigns to the territory is one of the most controversial actions. For this reason the spatial distribution of mining, forestry, conservation, and property rights was analyzed using QGIS software. As results, we identified places with up to four rights or uses assigned by government institutions and state interventions that compound informality and chaos in the area. We conclude that the main causes of conflicts and misrule stem from weak state, evidenced by deficient services provided, the concession of incompatible usage rights over a single territory, and the enactment of regulations for purposes other than the public good. Finally, mining formalization has not been successful, because formality does not offer major advantages to the miners, being costly and bureaucratic, while informality is not an inconvenience for miners.","To the officials at MINEM, OEFA, Peru&#x27;s Ombuds Office and SERNANP and the experts who provided opinions and perspectives on the problematic.

Its fruits are composed of urn-shaped epicarps, which are bulky ligneous capsules of slow degradation. Activated carbon monoliths were prepared from this fruit epicarp (bioresidue, the source of lignocellulosic matter) by chemical activation with H3PO4. The activation conditions were optimized using a central composite design, considering parameters of temperature, time, and chemical ratio as variables, and iodine and methylene blue number (IN and MBN), along with yield (Y), as responses. The best conditions for activation were 532°C (T), 1.5 h (t), and 1.5-g H3PO4/1-g raw matter (chemical ratio, CR), with response values of 996 mg I/1-g activated carbon (AC) (IN), 361-mg MB/1-g AC (MBN), and 42% (Y). Likewise, the physicochemical/surface characterization of the activated carbon Lecythis minor (ACLM) allowed establishing that it developed micro- and mesopores (Vmicro=0.72 cm3/g; Vmeso=0.87 cm3/g), as well as ultra-microporosity, a BET surface area of 2,164 m2/g, and a total pore volume of 1.7 cm3/g; also, the removal percentages of the emerging contaminants diclofenac and cephalexin in water were above 96%. It is concluded that fruit epicarp of L. minor is a natural-origin resource to produce AC monoliths, with satisfactory yield, desirable surface development, and high thermal stability, capable of adsorption and removal of pharmaceutical products, and other emergent contaminants from water bodies.",The authors would like to thank the Universidad del Norte for the financial support granted to Cindy J.

In the SPEEDY model, the time evolution of dynamics is performed via the second‐order Leapfrog integration scheme; this time integrator relies on two steps: the position and the velocity. The computational implementation of SPEEDY blends the time integrator and the spatial discretization of dynamics to accelerate algebraic computations. Thus, there is no access to the right‐hand side function of the ordinary differential equations governing the time evolution of model dynamics. Consequently, the SPEEDY model is often treated as a black box wherein positions and velocities work as inputs and outputs. Since observations in operational data assimilation only match position states, we can exploit augmented vector states to propagate analysis innovations from positions to velocities. For this purpose, we formulate three variants of ensemble‐based filters and perform numerical experiments to assess their accuracies. We consider two scenarios for the experiments: an ideal case wherein positions and velocities can be observed and a more realistic one wherein measurements are only accessible for position states. Besides, we discuss the effects of the ensemble size on the accuracies of our formulations and, even more, the typical case in which velocities are not updated across assimilation steps. The results reveal that all filter formulations' accuracies remain the same in terms of Root‐Mean‐Square‐Error by neglecting observations from velocities (a realistic scenario) even for cases wherein the number of measurements decreases to 6% of model components. Furthermore, for all discussed filter implementations, the propagation of analysis increments from position to velocities improves up to 100% the performance of filter implementations wherein velocities are not updated, a typical operational scenario.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported in parts by grant MinCiencias 68790 “Exposure to Pollutants Regional Research ExPoR2” and by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory (AML‐CS) at Universidad del Norte.

1661,pub.1158456294,10.1002/jee.20531,,,Self‐explanation activities in statics: A knowledge‐building activity to promote conceptual change,"Abstract  Background The complexity and diversity of problems and concepts in different engineering subjects represent a great challenge for students. Traditional approaches to teaching statics are ineffective in helping some students overcome the learning barriers that underlie learning statics and developing problem‐solving skills.   Purpose This article explores how self‐explanation activities may support student learning in statics. Specifically, this study examines the characteristics of student self‐explanations of worked examples and their relationship with students′ conceptual change.   Design/Method The study population included 147 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a statics course. The students wrote their self‐explanations at each step of an incomplete or incorrect worked example in the context of static equilibrium. Students′ self‐explanations were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis to identify the approaches used. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to identify differences in students′ conceptual understanding of statics, based on their approach to self‐explanation.   Results We identified four self‐explaining approaches: restricted explanations, elemental explanations, inferential explanations, and strategic explanations. After completing the activity, students who self‐explained incomplete worked examples showed better results in the quality of their explanations and conceptual change than students in the incorrect worked example condition.   Conclusions The findings suggest a relationship between the type of worked example, students' approaches to self‐explaining, and their conceptual change and problem‐solving skills in statics. To increase the quality of the students' explanations and to improve their conceptual understanding, additional prompts or initial training in self‐explaining may be required within the worked‐examples context.",,,Journal of Engineering Education,,,,2023-05-28,2023,2023-05-28,2023-07,112,3,741-768,Closed,Article,"De La Hoz, Jose Luis; Vieira, Camilo; Arteta, Carlos","De La Hoz, Jose Luis (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vieira, Camilo (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arteta, Carlos (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Civil engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","De La Hoz, Jose Luis (Universidad del Norte)","De La Hoz, Jose Luis (Universidad del Norte); Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Arteta, Carlos (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158456294,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education; 40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,4 Quality Education

Since the individual possibility to travel and therefore access to urban opportunities strongly depends on socio-economic status and the distances to overcome, highly unequal patterns of mobility and accessibility emerge. The continuous expansion of Latin American cities originates specific mobility-related inequalities visible in periurban areas, which tend to lack some key urban opportunities and public transport services usually available in cities. Due to established and new patterns of territorial segregation, these areas may generate new forms of marginality in relation to mobility, posing challenges for public action and territorial governance. Our paper considers if and how periurban areas experience different forms of mobility-related inequalities in three Latin American metropolises in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia (São Paulo, Santiago, and Bogotá, respectively). We do so by examining the differences among urban core and periurban zones based on four elements: socio-demographic features, access to the public transport system, spatial continuity, and functional dependence. Our analysis shows that the three metropolitan regions have different structures: while Bogotá and Santiago appear to be more dependent on the urban core, São Paulo shows more autonomous and self-sufficient periurban zones. The analysis also highlights different forms of peripherality, defined by differentiated mobility patterns and modal choices that suggest that city-specific lines for public action might be needed.","This paper is part of the project “Transporte y Equidad: abordando la accesibilidad en los márgenes urbanos”.

1096,pub.1164235192,10.1080/10298436.2023.2257852,,,Implementation of deep neural networks and statistical methods to predict the resilient modulus of soils,"The Resilient Modulus (Mr) is perhaps the most relevant and widely used parameter to characterise the soil behaviour under repetitive loading for pavement applications. Accordingly, it is a crucial parameter controlling the mechanistic-empirical pavement design. Nonetheless, determining the Mr by laboratory tests is not always possible due to the high consumption of time and financial resources. Thus, developing new indirect approaches for estimating the MR is necessary. Precisely, this article investigates the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and statistical methods to predict the Mr of soils. For that purpose, the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database was implemented. It includes 64 701 datasets resulting from coarse-grained and fine-grained soil samples considering a wide range of grain size distribution and subjected to different stress levels. The input parameters were the bulk stress, octahedral shear stress, and the percentage of soil particles passing through the different sieves (3”, 2”, 3/2”, 1”, 3/4”, 1/2”, 3/8”, No. 4, No. 10, No. 40, No. 80, and No. 200) and the output was the Mr. The results suggest that while conventional mathematical models are unable to predict the influence of the grain size distribution and stress level on the Mr, the proposed DNNs were able to reproduce very accurate predictions. Notably, the proposed computational models have been uploaded to a GitHub repository and have become a valuable tool for forecasting the Mr when experimental measurements are not feasible.",,The authors appreciate the financial support given by the Czech Science Foundation grant No. 21-35764J.

By integrating archaeology, history and lake sediment–derived ancient DNA records, we reconstructed the nature and intensity of agropastoral activities in the Northwestern French Alps. We investigated their spatiotemporal trajectories and interactions with the erosion dynamic and vegetation cover, between 880 and 2440 m a.s.l. Climatic conditions in the upper altitude case study site predominantly controlled plant community composition and erosion. In contrast, the other sites were influenced mainly by (agro-)pastoral activities. There, the first significant human-driven changes in plant community composition occurred earlier (Mid-Late Bronze Age or Iron Age) above ca. 2000 m a.s.l. than below (Early to High Middle Ages). This pattern mirrors the altitudinal temporal trajectory of (agro-)pastoral activities development. Regarding erosion trajectories, all sites show stable non-degraded and degraded states separated by a transition phase caused by (agro-)pastoral activities. However, this does not necessarily occur when the first significant or the most intense activities develop due to the different sensitivities of the systems. From the High Middle Ages or Late Middle Age/Modern Period, resistance or resilience phases relative to erosion are evidenced for all agroecosystems (other than the upper site). These patterns highlight adaptations of agrarian socio-ecosystems, possibly thanks to soil management strategies with soil protection and/or just being the consequence of changes in practice for other purposes. Whether in terms of plant community composition or erosion, our trajectories evidence the vulnerability of systems above ca. 2000 m a.s.l. to changes in human activities and variations in climate.",We benefited from discussions with Alain Mélo about historical data from the Vallon de Sales.

The experience reveals how promoting formalization strategies that provide much broader support for ASM, beyond mining licenses and tenure rights (i.e., legalization), defined as formalization (e.g., geological data, mining equipment, and skills transfer programs), is vital. Information gathered from secondary sources and semi-structured interviews reveals that while legalization of ASM has been largely successful in Chile, there are still challenges in terms of formalization, especially improvement of exploration and production. Furthermore, ENAMI needs to modernize its own installations and development model to afford ASM greater opportunities of becoming a sustainable and competitive business activity.",This article has benefited from two grants provided by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID): FONDECYT de iniciación 2022 (Nº11220028) and FONDECYT postdoctorado (N°3220208).,,Journal of Rural Studies,,,,2023-02,2023,,2023-02,98,,123-133,Closed,Article,"Atienza, Miguel; Scholvin, Sören; Irarrazaval, Felipe; Arias-Loyola, Martín","Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Scholvin, Sören (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Irarrazaval, Felipe (Instituto de Estudios Urbanos y Territoriales, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

In the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), the most frequent and documented mass strandings correspond to the jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas, but the different hypotheses proposed to explain this phenomenon fail to predict it. Here, we assembled a database with historical stranding occurrences from the nineteenth century to 2022, highlighting the dramatic increase in strandings since the year 2000 along the EPO. The most common regions for jumbo squid strandings in the northern hemisphere are USA and Mexico, whereas in the southern hemisphere these events have mostly occurred in Chile. In both hemispheres the strandings are frequent in summer months. Although we assessed different hypothetical causes (e.g., post-spawning mortality, high temperatures, toxins from harmful algal blooms, human disturbance), we did not find enough evidence to support any of them. Besides, the need to experimentally test the plausible cause(s), we also discuss an alternative ecophysiological hypothesis associated with upwelling shadows and the species’ diel migratory behavior, highlighting the importance of stranding events as key components of global nutrient cycles.","We thank Angel Guerra and Felipe Torres for their comments on early versions of the manuscript.

In this study, we developed genomic resources for M. myriaster. Using a low-coverage short read sequencing strategy, this study estimated the genome size, repetitive genome content, annotated and quantified repetitive elements, assembled the 45S rRNA DNA operon, and characterized in detail the mitochondrial genome of M. myriaster. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer strategy was 615–697 Mbp, which is within the range reported for scleractinian corals. Repetitive genome content estimates using different word sizes (= k-mers) indicated that 53–65% of the genome of M. myriaster comprised repetitive elements. A relatively large number of the discovered repetitive elements could not be annotated. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were more abundant than Class I-LINE, Class I—Penelope, and Class II (DNA transposons)—Subclass 2 Maverick mobile elements. Less abundant repeat element families included Class I-LTR Ty3 retrotransposons, Class II-Subclass 2-Helitron mobile elements, Class I-LTR-Bel-Pao, and Class I-DIRS mobile elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon of M. myriaster was assembled into a single contig that contains, in the following order: a 5′ ETS [length = 1200 bp (partially assembled)], ssrDNA (1800 bp), ITS1 (233 bp), 5.8S rDNA (158 bp), ITS2 (204 bp), lsrDNA (3616 bp), and 3′ ETS [827 bp (partial sequence)]. The mitochondrial genome of M. myriaster is 17,044 bp long and encodes 13 protein-coding genes, 2 transfer RNAs, and two ribosomal genes. Based on protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic position of M. myriaster was examined. These new genomic resources are of utmost relevance to improve the understanding of the biology of M. myriaster and for the development of conservation plans in this reef-forming deep-water coral.","J.A.B thanks Vincent P.

But port land reclamation together with infrastructure deployment and operations, produce unprecedented pressure on surrounding coastal ecosystems. Thus, the implementation of effective management strategies to deal with social-environmental conflicts is often required. Only a few studies have addressed the socio-ecological link between port impact on coastal ecosystem services and how this related to social conflicts. Here, we use multidisciplinary research to address these questions considering two ports located in Coquimbo city-port (29°S) in Chile, as our study port-system. Index scores of port impacts on urban natural ecosystem services and the city were calculated from known drivers of decline. Questionnaires were used to identify local citizens’ concerns about port operations and expansion. Our results demonstrated significant pressures from port infrastructure and operations on maritime but also in shoreland coastal ecosystem services, which were perceived as a critical environmental concern by local respondents. There was low knowledge, but positive appreciation, of ecological engineering initiatives in urban environments to rehabilitate ecosystem attributes. Field experiments showed that biodiversity enhancement of port infrastructure is effective, and might be a good initiative to link people with the port. Our results suggest that port industries must engage in more explicit initiatives to compensate for the environmental impacts of the expansion of built infrastructure, resulting in more effective integration of these urban systems with natural ecosystems.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We propose a model in which the formation of the gypsum‐lined holes, and less commonly the formation of the tumuli itself, is controlled by the unique juxtaposition of physiographic, geologic and hydrologic conditions. On a regional scale, Salar de Pajonales is unusual compared to other salars, as it is located close to a large magmatic inflation centre (Lazufre), lies along strike of major regional structural trends, is a large ephemeral lake and contains high salt concentrations. On a basin scale, the lined holes are only present along strike of lineaments that are directly linked to the local stress regime. In turn, these lineaments control the location of degassing and subsequently the formation of the lined holes in the gypsum tumuli and, in part, the tumuli themselves.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MHH acknowledges Cartalytics LLC for the free use of their software.

Extension, contraction, and strike-slip deformation are commonly proposed mechanisms to explain the main tectonic elements exposed in the Domeyko Cordillera, Salar de Pedernales Basin, and others partially exposed in the Coastal Cordillera and Central Depression. Although pre-Andean tectonic inheritance seems to have influenced the style and mechanisms of mountain uplift in this region, its current architecture and the way it controlled the shortening distribution during orogen evolution are highly speculative, mainly because some of the tectonic provinces in this segment consist of covered areas (e.g., the Central Depression). To address this question, we present the first balanced cross-section and pre-shortening restoration of the Andean forearc at 26°S. We integrated new field data from the Coastal and Domeyko cordilleras with well data and re-interpreted 2D seismic profiles from the Salar de Pedernales Basin to construct a regional-scale cross-section of 210 km length from the Coastal Cordillera to the current Volcanic Arc, thus showing a two-dimensional (2D tectonic model to help understand the tectonic evolution of the western Central Andes. The results indicate a pre-shortening architecture dominated by Late Permian–Jurassic half-graben structures related to continental rifting. West- and east-dipping basement-rooted normal faults controlled rift-related basins, along which kilometric-scale marine and continental syn-rift sequences accumulated. During early Andean orogenesis, the normal faults were partially inverted, and large anticlines developed at the hanging wall faults, which Upper Cretaceous progressively covered to Paleocene synorogenic units. This suggests that the initial topographic relief in the region resulted from a basin inversion. During the more advanced stages of orogenesis (mid-Cenozoic), new reverse and thrust faults (or shortcut faults) were created, which connected upward with incompetent stratigraphic units and facilitated the propagation of localized fold-and-thrust belts in the eastern Domeyko Cordillera and Salar de Pedernales basins. A minimum of 16.3 km of W-E shortening was reported; however, nearly 11 km was accommodated by the newly created thrusts, indicating that these were most relevant to mountain building.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: FERNANDO MARTINEZ reports financial support was provided by National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development.

However, in the wake of the real estate and financial crisis, it is also a growing challenge for urban communities in many states such as California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. Detroit was particularly hit hard, where more than 40,000 blighted structures were identified in 2014. To curb blight, the city mobilized the most extensive demolition program in the country. Funded through the Federal Hardest Hit Fund (HHF), the Detroit Demolition Program began in 2014 and has demolished more than 20,800 properties at the cost of over $250 million. Furthermore, during 2009–2015, the city demolished 11,400 structures with hazardous materials such as asbestos. In this article, we assess the impacts of demolitions on the value of neighboring properties using a Repeat Sales (RS) regression approach. Specifically, we use housing sales price information from 2009 through 2019 to construct real estate price indices. We also rely on information from the 2009 Detroit Residential Survey to differentiate by dilapidation and blight levels before the start of the program. On average, blight removal through the demolition program does not appear to have been capitalized into the residential property prices. However, when considering the effect of ex‐ante program property characteristics, we find a modest positive effect of demolitions on property prices in areas with a low level of blight before the demolitions. Given the magnitude of the observed effect and the high costs associated with the demolition program, our results highlight the need for further research on alternative blight removal strategies that might provide a more cost‐effective solution to this urban challenge.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors wish to thank the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy for their financial support.

The indigenous peoples (IPs) in Chile who suffered the dispossession of ancestral areas after the declaration of PAs, have demanded their inclusion and participation based on the legislative tools available. Via the available scientific, institutional and gray literature, we identified seven ways in which IPs contribute to and participate in the protection of biodiversity, conservation and sustainability of natural resources in marine and terrestrial ecosystems in Chile: resistance or defense of ancestral areas, biocultural conservation, sustainable practices, participation in consultation, promotion of area creation, development of management plans, and management, comprising participation in administration, co-administration or co-management. Sixty percent of IPs participate in the management of 7.3% of Chile’s PAs. Overall, our results show that the Rapanui and Kawashkar peoples participate mostly in the co-management of 729,439 km2 and 668 km2 of MPAs, respectively. The Aymara and Atacameño peoples lead the management of TPAs in the north of Chile, with 1378 km2 and 872.36 km2, respectively. The Mapuche people, with a higher population density, participate in both environments, leading the administration of maritory with 3475.98 km2 of Marine and Coastal Areas for Indigenous Peoples (MCAIPs). The participation of the remaining peoples is limited.

In the Atacama Desert, pediplains are generally used as morphotectonic markers to define the chronology of episodes of Late Cenozoic Andean uplift from their erosion and incision patterns and timings. The Atacama Pediplain (AP) extends over >12,000 km2 (26° to 28°S Lat) through the Central Depression and Precordillera of the southern Atacama Desert. In this study we perform geomorphologic and stratigraphic observations on the AP in the Salado Canyon area, combining new geochronological results derived from 40Ar/39Ar biotite ages from volcanic layers interbedded within the alluvial deposits, and 21Ne exposure ages on quartz-clasts on alluvial plains, to determine the chronology of the AP evolution. Results show that the evolution of the AP is a long-term and continuous process (from >20 to ~2.3 Ma) of alluvial deposition and subsequent alluvial plain formation developed by interplay between the climate variability of the Atacama Desert and Andean uplift. The AP alluvial deposition occurred in two spatially and temporally separated episodes of alluvial backfilling: 1) shortly before ~20.14 Ma and to prior to ~9.4 Ma, a timespan that allows for the drainage capture of the eastern Precordillera, and considerable landscape rearrangement; 2) post ~9.4 Ma, with a re-positioning of alluvial backfilling from the Precordillera towards the Central Depression. This occurs after the Mid Miocene onset of the hyperarid conditions in the Central Depression and is more likely due to late Miocene surface uplift. Exposure ages reveal the cessation of basin-scale deposition and the abandonment of the alluvial plains during ~5.24 to ~3.8 Ma linked to the incision of Salado Canyon. Subsequent climate conditions modulated the surfaces by the development of lag deposits until ~2.69 to ~2.3 Ma when hyperarid conditions reach a threshold that limits surficial activity. Additionally, the drainage capture of the Precordillera by headwards erosion of the Salado Canyon explains marked deep incision depth of this canyon without the need for an increase in surface uplift or a change in climate conditions. The AP is not a general marker of a single climatic or tectonic event/period but a composite paleosurface formed by a complex concatenation of extrinsic and intrinsic geomorphic processes over more than ~17 myr.","The present study was funded by the Ph.D. grant Doctorado Nacional No. 211849 (ANID, Chile), and by the research projects FONDECYT N° 1170992 and N° 1220987 (ANID, Chile), Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1211, funded by German Science Foundation (DFG), and LMI- COPEDIM (IRD, France).

Between 2017 and 2019, semi-structured interviews were applied to 260 residents, 56 (21.53%) of whom had a history of snakebites. The profile of the victims is 73.2% male, a resident of rural areas who develops activities mainly in agriculture and extractivism and who has a low level of education. Just over half of the snakebites occurred during the rainy season (52.8%) and the majority during the day (77%).

To do this, I use census microdata that spans the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. The estimation strategy exploits the plausibly random assignment in the gender of children. The results show a persistent preference for a mixed gender composition (i.e., having at least one boy and one girl) instead of children of the same gender. This translates into an increase in the probability of having a third child, conditional on already having two children of between 9%-23% for those couples who have children of the same gender -in relation to couples with children of opposite genders-. These preferences are heterogeneous over time and have important implications in terms of fertility (i.e., the reduction of these mixed gender preferences -in favor of greater gender-neutrality- could contribute to reducing the number of children per couple). In addition, the findings of this work support the empirical literature that uses the gender composition of the first two children as an instrumental variable to study the impact of fertility on labor participation.",Declaration of Competing Interest None.,,Economics & Human Biology,,,Child; Female; Male; Humans; Argentina; Fertility,2023-11-28,2023,2023-11-28,2024-01,52,,101320,Closed,Article,"González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio","González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.

For a salt marsh to survive in the face of ongoing sea-level rise, organic and/or mineral sediment must accumulate at a rate equal to or faster than that of sea-level increase. We explored the effects of Late Holocene sea-level variations in the Suwannee River Estuary within the Big Bend region of Florida (USA). We conducted a paleoenvironmental study of a sediment core collected from a salt marsh near Cedar Key, on Florida’s Gulf of Mexico coast. The core spans the last ~ 320 years of sediment accumulation. Carbon isotope (δ13C) data and diatom assemblages indicate the salt marsh was relatively stable during that time frame and was dominated by C3 vegetation, likely Juncus roemerianus, but experienced moderate variations in salinity that likely reflect changes in sea-level, with an increase in salinity and marine incursions between ~ 1850 and 1930 CE. Whereas small vertical changes in sea-level have the potential to inundate large areas of the low-gradient salt marsh, as observed during the interval ~ 1850–1930 CE, the salt-marsh vegetation recovered quickly after 1930 CE, indicating that the rate of aggradation and vegetation growth kept pace with the rate of sea-level rise. Despite the apparent resiliency of Big Bend salt marshes and likelihood that they will persist through accretion and migration, we expect to see major changes in salt-marsh ecology if rates of sea-level rise continue to accelerate.","We thank Vic Doig and other scientists at the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge for transport to the core site and for providing contextual information on the area.

In this study, we conducted a genome survey of M. temminckii. Using a low-coverage short read sequencing strategy, this study estimated the genome size, repetitive genome content, annotated and quantified repetitive elements, assembled the 45S rRNA DNA operon, and characterized in detail the mitochondrial genome of M. temminckii. Using a k-mer strategy, the estimated haploid genome size varied between 3.77 and 3.19 Gbp, which is within the range previously reported for other representatives of the family Chelydridae. Repetitive genome content estimates using different k-mers (21 to 51) indicated that more than 75 % of the genome of M. temminckii comprised repetitive elements. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, the most common repetitive elements were classified as Class I - Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE) which were more abundant than Class I - Penelope and Class I - Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) Ty3 mobile elements. Less abundant repeat element families in the nuclear genome of M. temminckii included Class I - DIRS mobile elements and Satellite DNA. The nuclear ribosomal operon was partially assembled into three contigs, one encoding the complete ssrRNA gene, a second encoding the complete 5.8S rRNA gene, and a third comprising the full lsrRNA gene. The AT-rich complete mitochondrial genome was 16,570 bp long.

In this study we provide the first description of a toxic phytoplankton succession in the Patagonian Fjord System. The shift was modulated by atmospheric-oceanographic forcing and consisted of the replacement of the marine dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta in a highly stratified water column during austral summer by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha in a mixed water column during late summer and early autumn. This transition, accompanied by a change in the biotoxin profiles (from lipophilic dinophysis toxins to hydrophilic domoic acid), was induced by the arrival of an intense atmospheric river. The winds in Magdalena Sound may have been further amplified, due to its west-east orientation and its location within a tall, narrow mountain canyon. This work also documents the first known appearance of toxic P. calliantha in Northern Patagonian.

818,pub.1157149963,10.1002/ptr.7830,37039741,,Systematic review on the anxiolytic and hypnotic effects of flower extracts in in vivo pre‐clinical studies published from 2010 to 2020,"Anxiety disorders are prevalent conditions in the world population, whose standard approaches include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and combinations of these interventions. Different classes of psychopharmaceuticals are recommended as the first line of drugs to treat these disorders, which can have several adverse effects, treatment resistance, dependence, and drug-drug interactions making it necessary to search for new therapeutic agents. In particular, diazepam (DZP), a prototype drug from the group of benzodiazepines, has been commonly used and evaluated for its efficacy and safety in different anxiety disorders in clinical trials. DZP is also the most widely used reference standard in in vivo pharmacological assays of natural compounds. However, translating the results obtained in different rodent species and physiological anxiety tests instead of psychopathological animal models that can be of clinical application remains challenging. A systematic review of scientific articles published between 2010 and 2020 that included in vivo pre-clinical tests to define the anxiolytic, sedative and/or hypnotic effect of flower extracts is proposed. PRISMA and Rayyan were used for the selection of studies using four databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and QInsight), using the keywords: ""Animals,"" ""Anxiolytic,"" ""Diazepam,"" ""Elevated Plus Maze,"" ""Flower Extracts,"" ""Insomnia,"" ""In vivo,"" ""Mice,"" ""Open Field Test,"" ""Pre clinical"" and ""Sedative."" The characteristics of anxiety studies in animal models, other studies related to locomotor activity, and the hypnotic effect of the extracts were compiled. Twenty-four articles were included, 21 of them performed the animal model of anxiety-like behavior of the elevated plus maze, seven the open field test, and six the light-dark box test. The locomotor activity was evaluated in 10 studies after the administration of the extracts to the animals to define their sedative effect, where only one defined that the extract (Matricaria chamomilla) had a sedative effect. The plants declared with this type of activity were Achyranthes aspera, Alcea aucheri, Brassica nigra, Cananga odorata, Carthamus tinctorius, Chrysanthemum indicum, Citrus aurantium, Couroupita guianensis, Echium amoenum, Erythrina berteroana, Gardenia jasminoides, Hibiscus tilliaceus, Lavandula officinalis, Lawsonia inermis, Matricaria chamomilla, Melia azedarach, Nerium oleander, Passiflora incarnata, Plumeria rubra, Salix aegyptiaca, Syzygium aromaticum, Tagetes erecta, Tilia americana. Although this review showed that some flower extracts have an anxiolytic effect as effective as diazepam, their therapeutic utility in anxiety disorders remains to be extensively demonstrated. Hence, more reliable and predictive behavioral tests and appropriate strategies for the experimental designs are needed to obtain more conclusive evidence with clinical significance.",ACKNOWLEDGMENT The content of this study was part of the FONDECYT project 1130601 (Chile).

The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory: Short Form of Eight Items was used. A non-regularized network with partial correlation coefficients was estimated through the ggmModSelect algorithm. The network architecture was analyzed for each country through its local properties and global properties. The results indicated that the networks differed significantly between countries. The core dimensions in the networks were relating to others, personal strength, and life value and opportunities, which were more related dimensions that reinforce the emergence of PTG in all countries. The findings may be useful to motivate researchers and mental health professionals to consider the importance of the individual dimensions of PTG in groups of people who experienced the death of a loved one from COVID-19 in 16 Latin American countries, as well as their interrelationships.",,,Illness Crisis & Loss,,,,2023-10-26,2023,2023-10-26,,,,,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Baños-Chaparro, Jonatan; Ventura-León, José; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Valencia, Pablo D.; Yupanqui-Lorenzo, Daniel E.; Paredes-Angeles, Rubí; Arias Gallegos, Walter L.; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Delgado-Campusano, Mariel; Gallegos, Miguel; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Palacios Segura, Diego Alejandro; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Buschiazzo Figares, Andrés; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Camargo, Andrés; Torales, Julio; Monge Blanco, J.

En Chile no existen actualmente directrices para la formación profesional en Fisioterapia, y es necesario avanzar hacia ese objetivo comenzando con un análisis de lo ofrecido por las universidades actualmente. Objetivo Analizar los perfiles de egreso, sus principales ámbitos de desempeño y competencias declarados en las carreras de Fisioterapia que se imparten en 2021 en Chile. Material y método Se realizó una investigación documental cualitativa de los perfiles de egreso publicados en las páginas web de 41 instituciones de Educación Superior en Chile que imparten la carrera universitaria de Fisioterapia durante el año 2021. Se realizó un análisis de contenido temático asistido por el programa NVivo 12 pro. Resultados Se obtuvieron siete categorías principales que caracterizan los ámbitos de competencias de los perfiles de egreso de Fisioterapia en Chile: intervención; razonamiento clínico; promoción y prevención en salud; investigación; gestión y administración en salud; educación, y emprendimiento e innovación. Conclusiones Los principales ámbitos de desempeño presentes en los perfiles de egreso en los planes de formación de los programas universitarios de Fisioterapia en Chile en el presente estudio permitirán promover una reflexión acerca de los significados prácticos para la formación profesional, y así responder a las demandas profesionales presentes y futuras con una identidad centrada en el movimiento humano como eje de acción profesional. Introduction The entry-level profile corresponds to a formal statement of an institution about the intended learning outcomes of a profession. This commitment includes developing a professional identity, specifying the main areas of professional activity and its key attributes. Besides, universities’ training must transparentize institutions’ commitments to their graduates and society. There is currently no standard for professional training in Physiotherapy in Chile, and it is necessary to move toward this purpose by starting with an analysis of what universities offer today. Purpose To analyze the main areas of performance and competencies declared in the competency-based exit profile of Physiotherapy entry-level programs delivered in 2021 in Chile. Material and method Qualitative documentary research was carried out of the competency-based exit profile, published on the web sites of 41 Higher Education institutions in Chile that delivered Physiotherapy entry-level University Programs during the 2021. A thematic content analysis was carried out assisted by CAQDAS NVivo 12 pro. Results Seven main categories were obtained that characterize competence areas of the current competency-based exit profile in Physiotherapy entry-level programs in Chile: physiotherapist intervention; clinical reasoning in physiotherapy; promotion and prevention in health; research; health management and administration; education; and entrepreneurship and innovation. Conclusions The main areas of performance present in the exit profiles of the university programs of Physiotherapy in Chile were identified. A reflection would be made about the practical meanings for university professional training in Physiotherapy in Chile to respond to the present and future professionals requirements with the identity centered on the human movement as the axis of professional action.",,,Fisioterapia,,,,2023-01,2023,,2023-01,45,1,20-29,Closed,Article,"Antúnez-Riveros, M.A.; Rojas-Serey, A.M.; Ríos-Teillier, M.I.; Fuentes-Cimma, J.; Villagrán, I.; Leiva, P.

The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of organic carbon (Corg) and inorganic elements in the WDC fraction of volcanic (WDC–V) and arid (WDC–A) Chilean soils. The WDC fractions were isolated from three arid bulk soil at different meters above sea level (masl) from northern Chile and from five volcanic bulk soil from the southern Chile. The isolation of WDC was carried out according to Stokes’ Law, using Milli–Q water as the extracting agent. The WDC were simultaneously separated and analyzed into natural nanoparticles (NNPs; 0.06–30 nm), fine colloids (FC; 30–220 nm), and medium colloids (MC; 220–450 nm) fractions using flow field–flow fractionation coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or ultraviolet–visible detectors. The WDC–A fractions at 300 and 500 masl had higher concentrations of Fe, Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn, ranging between 35 and 193,070 µg L−1, compared to WDC–V, except for P. Additionally, Corg in WDC–A at 300 and 500 masl ranged from 2600–3600 µg L−1, which was higher than in WDC–V, except for Carilafquen and Lautaro soils. The concentration of Si, Al, Fe, and P increased with larger particle sizes in the WDC–V fraction, whereas in the WDC–A fractions, the concentrations of Si, Al, and Fe were higher in the FC and MC fractions, while P and Ca were higher in the NNPs and FC size fractions. The concentration of inorganic elements and Corg in the WDC fractions differed between the arid northern soils and the volcanic soils of southern Chile, likely attributed to variations in the amount and stability of organic matter present in each soil type.","Yonathan Redel acknowledges The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Research Stays for University Academics and Scientists, Scholarship N° 57442043.

Using the small south American octopus Robsonella fontaniana ( ∼ 270 mm total length, ∼ 70 mm mantle length), we evaluated the mating behavior based on octopuses from central Chile. Eighteen male–female and five male–male interactions were characterized in laboratory using ethograms divided into precopulatory and copulatory stages. Although subjects’ interactions occurred in both treatments, extended mating periods (81–196 min) were only observed in the male–female trials, and specifically, in those involving larger octopuses (39% of the interactions; > 43 mm mantle length). During the precopulatory stage (4–20 min), different behavioral displays were evidenced in 57% of these male–female interactions, including: contact, exhibition of chromatic displays, swimming, and mounting. Larger pairs had longer copulation times, with a maximum of ∼ 200 min in octopuses of 50 mm mantle length. The observed mating in adult male–female pairs and the practically null interaction between juveniles suggest that a maturity-conditional reproductive behavior ( ∼ 43 mm mantle length; ∼ 38 gr), could be one of the mechanisms modulating mating interactions of R. fontaniana in the wild, potentially influencing aspects such as mate guarding behavior, possible sperm removal or sperm loading.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

213,pub.1158506063,10.1007/s12351-023-00778-6,,,Optimizing the wine transportation process from bottling plants to ports,"The wine industry is a highly competitive sector for which any efficiency improvement in the wine supply chain plays a critical role in maintaining or increasing profitability. Literature shows several successful applications of operational research tools at each stage of the wine production process. However, unlike other stages, the transportation and distribution phase has not been given the same attention in the specialized literature. To bridge this gap, this article proposes an integer linear programming model to jointly determine a plan for the bottling and transportation of products to ports in order to minimize inventory, freight, and delay costs. This model can be optimally solved in less than one day for small instances of up to 25 jobs. In practice, however, some industrial instances can easily exceed 200 jobs, which precludes the use of this model to support decision-making. To cope with this issue, we devise a two-stage procedure that generates good-quality solutions for industrial-size instances of this problem in reasonable computing times. Particularly, we show that the GAP of the proposed heuristic solution is relatively low for a wide range of instances. Finally, a case study is conducted on a medium-sized Chilean winery we worked with, where the planning generated by the proposed heuristic reduces the costs corresponding to the transportation stage by 45.3% in the best case, compared to the initial planning of the winery.",,Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Grant Number: 11200167); Fondo de Innovación para la Competitividad (Grant Number: 11190892); Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (Grant Number: ANID PIA/BASAL AFB180003).,Operational Research,,,,2023-05-31,2023,2023-05-31,2023-06,23,2,37,Closed,Article,"Basso, Franco; Contreras, Juan Pablo; Pezoa, Raúl; Troncozo, Alejandro; Varas, Mauricio","Basso, Franco (School of Industrial Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile; Instituto Sistemas Complejos de Ingeniería, Santiago, Chile); Contreras, Juan Pablo (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Pezoa, Raúl (Escuela de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile); Troncozo, Alejandro (Escuela de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile); Varas, Mauricio (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; Centro de Investigación en Sustentabilidad y Gestión Estratégica de Recursos, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile)","Basso, Franco (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso; Complex Engineering System Institute)","Basso, Franco (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso; Complex Engineering System Institute); Contreras, Juan Pablo (Catholic University of the North); Pezoa, Raúl (Diego Portales University); Troncozo, Alejandro (Diego Portales University); Varas, Mauricio (Universidad del Desarrollo; Universidad del Desarrollo)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158506063,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

The sample consisted of 919 Colombian migrants, of whom 464 (50.5%) were women. Participants were residents of the cities of Arica (n = 219; 23.8%), Antofagasta (n = 476; 51.8%) and Santiago (n = 224; 24.4%) in Chile. The variables assessed were Identity Fusion, Acculturation Strategies and Satisfaction with Life. Structural equation modeling using the robust weighted least squares estimation method was performed to estimate the proposed model. The results indicate that, identity fusion with Colombia was positively related to attitudes toward the country of origin and life satisfaction but was negatively related to attitudes toward the host country. On the other hand, identity fusion with Chile was only positively related to attitudes toward the host country. Finally, attitudes towards the country of origin presented indirect effects between identity fusion with Colombia and Satisfaction with life. We conclude that the developing a visceral feeling of union with the country of origin could explain a better evaluation of one's own life, this relationship being mediated by attitudes oriented to maintaining the characteristics of the country of origin. Developing a visceral feeling of attachment to the host country was only associated with adopting characteristics of the host country culture. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed.",,"This publication is derived from the project FONDECYT (Comisión Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología – CONICYT) Regular # 1180315, funded by the National Agency for Research and Development (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo) (ANID) of the Government of Chile, who had no influence on the results of this publication.",Social Identities,,,,2023-07-04,2023,2023-08-23,2023-07-04,29,4,378-397,Closed,Article,"Henríquez, Diego; Urzúa, Alfonso; López-López, Wilson","Henríquez, Diego (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); López-López, Wilson (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); López-López, Wilson (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163503830,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science; 4410 Sociology,
185,pub.1152779699,10.1016/j.seps.2022.101468,,,Shocks derived from mining windfalls and horizontal transfers: Exploring the permanent income hypothesis in Chilean municipalities from a spatial competition approach,"We explore how spatial interaction affects the strategic use of municipal income when deciding between 1) an optimal long-run expenditure strategy versus 2) using the current income to finance current activities, a phenomenon known as the permanent income hypothesis. Even when this hypothesis is grounded in temporal logic, insufficient attention has been given to the impact of spatial dependence on this type of budget decision. Therefore, we present two reasons why spatial interaction adds new insight to this discussion. First, subnational governments located inside larger functional areas have lower average costs due to the population concentration, allowing for coordination between jurisdictions to achieve more power of negotiation and to potentially exploit economies of scale. Second, local government decision-making is not independent of other jurisdictions as municipalities would constantly evaluate the others’ actions regarding local tax effort, spending, and debt. While this spatial consideration remains a challenge for theoretical modeling, we offer empirical evidence to evaluate how robust the permanent income hypothesis is when geography is incorporated. Our empirical approach uses dynamic panel data with spatial dependence on debt, expenditure, and the error term. To evaluate our hypothesis, we exploit panel data from 320 Chilean municipalities between 2008 and 2020 and use two sources of income: non-matched grants via mining windfalls and horizontal fiscal transfers among cities. The evidence indicates that jurisdictions make backward-looking decisions regarding spending; that is, there are no significant differences between the short and long run. The results for debt, however, are not robust. Policy pertaining to the use of public resources should consider the spatial dependence between municipalities which should be a crucial factor in budgetary decision-making.",,This work was supported by the Chilean Fondecyt grant [Nº 1220566].,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,86,,101468,Closed,Article,"Oyarzo, Mauricio; Paredes, Dusan","Oyarzo, Mauricio (School of Business and Management, Universidad de Concepción Campus Chillán, Avenida Vicente Méndez 595, Chillán, Chile; Research Nucleus on Environmental Natural Resource Economics (NENRE EfD-Chile), Concepción, Chile); Paredes, Dusan (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Oyarzo, Mauricio (University of Concepción; Research Nucleus on Environmental Natural Resource Economics (NENRE EfD-Chile), Concepción, Chile)","Oyarzo, Mauricio (University of Concepción; Research Nucleus on Environmental Natural Resource Economics (NENRE EfD-Chile), Concepción, Chile); Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152779699,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,
163,pub.1157614508,10.1016/j.tecto.2023.229880,,,The temporal and spatial relationship between strike-slip and reverse faulting in subduction-related orogenic system: Insights from the Western slope of the Puna Plateau,"The relationship between parallel and oblique to the orogen faults and the magmatic evolution is key to understanding the evolution of a hot orogen, such as the Central Andes. The Andean orogenesis along the southern Central Andes, during the Neogene is characterized by regional compression and magmatic processes associated with subduction. The outcome of this dynamic interaction between plate tectonics and magmatism has generated reverse, normal and strike-slip faults, both parallel and oblique to the trench. Despite the progress made on studying these fault systems, both their relationship with the stress field and their role in magma propagation into the shallow crust are still enigmatic. In this work, geomorphological observations are coupled with kinematic and dynamic analyses, as well as with kinematic forward modeling, to reconstruct the evolution of two main faults affecting the western slope of the Puna plateau, the Barrancas Blancas fault and the Tocomar fault, during the Neogene. The obtained data reveal that, between 17 and 10 Ma, the Barrancas Blancas fault had reverse activity, while the Tocomar fault had left-lateral strike-slip movement. At 10 Ma, the area was affected by the coeval reactivation of the Volcan de Punta Negra fault and the right-lateral activity of the Tocomar fault. During the last stage, strike-slip movement along the Tocomar fault favored the rise of magma, while the hydrothermal activity evolved along the Barrancas Blancas fault. The study results reveal that the oblique-to-the-orogen faults play a role in the segmentation of the reverse parallel-to-the-trench deformation and control the position of the volcanic centers, while the parallel-to-the-orogen faults control the relief development and the evolution of hydrothermal systems. The proposed model helps in understanding how magma rises to the surface associated with movement along reverse and strike-slip faults during the thickening of the crust.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Theory-based interventions are crucial for creating robust interventions for public health concerns, such as interpersonal violence. Methods: In our systematic literature review, we sought to examine social cognitive theory (SCT)-based Interventions addressing interpersonal violence among Hispanic youth. Searching in both English and Spanish, we used the search engines, PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Lilacs, and restricted the years to 2010-2022. Results: Self-efficacy and normative beliefs were the two most commonly addressed SCT constructs in the interventions. SCT-based interventions were found to increase confidence in not engaging in negative behaviors and improve coping skills. Moreover, within the context of implementing SCT-based interventions, school-based interventions and Participatory Action Research, were foundational to the SCT-based interventions. Conclusion: Overall, SCT-based interventions were found to be effective in interpersonal violence mitigation and reduction among Hispanic youths. There was a synergistic effect between the number of SCT constructs incorporated in an intervention and the positive results of the intervention. Thus, future studies are both needed and should robustly incorporate SCT constructs to yield the best possible outcomes.",We would like to sincerely thank Dr. Amy Harley and Dr. Anne Dressel for their contributions.,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Hispanic Health Care International,,,,2023-07-12,2023,2023-07-12,2023-12,21,4,228-234,Closed,Article,"Hawkins, Maren M.; Florez-Garcia, Victor; Guevara-Romero, Edwin; Santacruz-Salas, Esmeralda; Ruiz, Ashley","Hawkins, Maren M.

The primary objective was to determine whether parsimonious models produced by specific feature selection methods are more robust to temporal dataset shift as measured by out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, while maintaining in-distribution (ID) performance.
METHODS: Our dataset consisted of intensive care unit patients from MIMIC-IV categorized by year groups (2008-2010, 2011-2013, 2014-2016, and 2017-2019). We trained baseline models using L2-regularized logistic regression on 2008-2010 to predict in-hospital mortality, long length of stay (LOS), sepsis, and invasive ventilation in all year groups. We evaluated three feature selection methods: L1-regularized logistic regression (L1), Remove and Retrain (ROAR), and causal feature selection. We assessed whether a feature selection method could maintain ID performance (2008-2010) and improve OOD performance (2017-2019). We also assessed whether parsimonious models retrained on OOD data performed as well as oracle models trained on all features in the OOD year group.
RESULTS: The baseline model showed significantly worse OOD performance with the long LOS and sepsis tasks when compared with the ID performance. L1 and ROAR retained 3.7 to 12.6% of all features, whereas causal feature selection generally retained fewer features. Models produced by L1 and ROAR exhibited similar ID and OOD performance as the baseline models. The retraining of these models on 2017-2019 data using features selected from training on 2008-2010 data generally reached parity with oracle models trained directly on 2017-2019 data using all available features.

Few studies have used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pediatric patients with SCA. The aim of this study was to characterize the ABPM profile in children with SCA.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on all subjects <18 years of age with SCA who presented at a medical reference center in the city of Cartagena, Colombia. Anthropometric, clinical laboratory, treatment, and ABPM parameters, including ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) were registered.
RESULTS: The study included 79 patients, of these, 23 (29%) children had normal BP, 49 (62%) had abnormal BP and 7 (9%) had HTN. Mean age was 10.5 ± 3.6 years and 44 (56%) cases were male. Forty-eight (60%) patients had pre-HTN. Masked HTN was present in 6 (8%) patients. One (1%) had ambulatory HTN, and another one (1%) had white coat HTN. The HTA group exhibited significantly higher systolic BP and diastolic BP compared to the other groups in 24-hour BP readings, daytime BP, and night-time BP ABPM parameters ( P  < 0.05), except for daytime DBP ( P  = 0.08). Mean AASI was 0.4 ± 0.2. The HTN group had the highest AASI value compared to the other groups ( P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Significant alterations in ABPM parameters are frequently observed in pediatric patients with SCA. The incorporation of ABPM, along with the assessment of AASI, is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular and renal risk in SCA patients.",All the procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.,,Blood Pressure Monitoring,,,"Humans; Male; Child; Adolescent; Female; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure; Retrospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hypertension; Anemia, Sickle Cell",2023-09-14,2023,2023-09-14,2024-02-01,29,1,9-14,Closed,Article,"Tinoco, Gustavo Adolfo Guerrero; Vergara, Zilac Espitaleta; García, Maria José Daniels; Domínguez-Vargas, Alex","Tinoco, Gustavo Adolfo Guerrero (Pediatric Nephrologist, Hospital Infantil Napoleón Franco Pareja; Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena); Vergara, Zilac Espitaleta (Pediatric Nephrologist, Universidad Simón Bolívar, facultad de Ciencias de la Salud); García, Maria José Daniels (Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Universidad del Norte, División Ciencias de la Salud, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Tinoco, Gustavo Adolfo Guerrero (Pediatric Nephrologist, Hospital Infantil Napoleón Franco Pareja; University of Cartagena)","Tinoco, Gustavo Adolfo Guerrero (Pediatric Nephrologist, Hospital Infantil Napoleón Franco Pareja; University of Cartagena); Vergara, Zilac Espitaleta (Pediatric Nephrologist, Universidad Simón Bolívar, facultad de Ciencias de la Salud); García, Maria José Daniels (University of Cartagena); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164045253,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

We describe the evolution of a snakebite injury with secondary infection and the use of specialized dressings to achieve tissue repair and complete closure of the wound.
CASE: Ms E., a 45-year-old woman, was bitten by a pit viper that began as a small lesion and progressed to necrosis, cellulitis, edema, and hyperemia of the perilesional skin, local inflammation, and infection. We implemented a combination of topical hydrogel therapy with calcium alginate and hydrofiber with 1.2% silver to promote autolytic debridement, combat local infection, and provide a moist wound environment. The wound required daily local treatment for 2 months due to extensive tissue damage, combined with the proteolytic action of the bothropic venom.
CONCLUSION: The care of wounds caused by snakebites is a challenge for the health care team due to tissue loss resulting from the action of the venom and secondary bacterial infection. Close follow-up with the use of systemic antibiotics and topical therapies proved effective in minimizing tissue loss in this case.",,,Journal of Wound Ostomy and Continence Nursing,,,Female; Humans;

Self-supervised learning using adult data may be a promising approach to creating robust pediatric prediction models. The primary objective was to determine whether a self-supervised model trained in adult inpatients was noninferior to logistic regression models trained in pediatric inpatients, for pediatric inpatient clinical prediction tasks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used EHR data and included patients with at least one admission to an inpatient unit. One admission per patient was randomly selected. Adult inpatients were 18 years or older while pediatric inpatients were more than 28 days and less than 18 years. Admissions were temporally split into training (January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2019), validation (January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020), and test (January 1, 2021 to August 1, 2022) sets. Primary comparison was a self-supervised model trained in adult inpatients versus count-based logistic regression models trained in pediatric inpatients. Primary outcome was mean area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUROC) for 11 distinct clinical outcomes. Models were evaluated in pediatric inpatients.
RESULTS: When evaluated in pediatric inpatients, mean AUROC of self-supervised model trained in adult inpatients (0.902) was noninferior to count-based logistic regression models trained in pediatric inpatients (0.868) (mean difference = 0.034, 95% CI=0.014-0.057; P < .001 for noninferiority and P = .006 for superiority).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-supervised learning in adult inpatients was noninferior to logistic regression models trained in pediatric inpatients. This finding suggests transferability of self-supervised models trained in adult patients to pediatric patients, without requiring costly model retraining.",L.S. is supported by the Canada Research Chair in Pediatric Oncology Supportive Care.,The funder did not participate in the work or the decision to submit for publication.,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,,,Humans; Adult; Child; Inpatients; Retrospective Studies; Machine Learning; Supervised Machine Learning; Electronic Health Records,2023-08-28,2023,2023-08-28,2023-11-17,30,12,2004-2011,Closed,Article,"Lemmon, Joshua; Guo, Lin Lawrence; Steinberg, Ethan; Morse, Keith E; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Aftandilian, Catherine; Pfohl, Stephen R; Posada, Jose D; Shah, Nigam; Fries, Jason; Sung, Lillian","Lemmon, Joshua (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G1X8, Canada); Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G1X8, Canada); Steinberg, Ethan (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, United States); Morse, Keith E (Division of Pediatric Hospital Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, United States); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, United States); Aftandilian, Catherine (Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, United States); Pfohl, Stephen R (Google Research, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States); Posada, Jose D (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Shah, Nigam (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, United States); Fries, Jason (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, United States); Sung, Lillian (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G1X8, Canada; Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G1X8, Canada)","Sung, Lillian (Hospital for Sick Children; Hospital for Sick Children)","Lemmon, Joshua (Hospital for Sick Children); Guo, Lin Lawrence (Hospital for Sick Children); Steinberg, Ethan (Stanford University); Morse, Keith E (Stanford University); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (Stanford University); Aftandilian, Catherine (Stanford University); Pfohl, Stephen R (Google (United States)); Posada, Jose D (Universidad del Norte); Shah, Nigam (Stanford University); Fries, Jason (Stanford University); Sung, Lillian (Hospital for Sick Children; Hospital for Sick Children)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163617337,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This suggests an opportunity to implement strategies that integrate technology to visualize the risk of decompensation. This article studies the acceptance of Cardio Sem, a traffic light system mobile application for patients with heart failure. A descriptive, observational pilot study was performed with 23 outpatients belonging to a heart failure program. For 4 weeks, patients used Cardio Sem, which allows visualizing the risk of decompensation through a series of questions that patients must answer daily and provides guidance for managing signs and symptoms of decompensation. A technology acceptance questionnaire was applied to all patients, resulting in acceptance of the application, especially in the dimensions that emphasized perceived usefulness (100%), social influence (100%), and behavioral intent (99.8%). Cardio Sem is useful for early detection of symptoms that allow for early response to complications. Acceptance of the application by patients and its ease of use present the possibility to implement it as a complementary tool to promote self-care and effective management of symptoms.",,"The authors have disclosed that they have no significant relationships with, or financial interest in, any commercial companies pertaining to this article.

This article presents the quantitative results of a survey of 244 children aged seven to fourteen years in Colombia about their perception of media use as a form of participation. The study’s results suggest that there is a varied range of media uses for different purposes that are not exclusive to just one device or one type of media. These results are significant as they show the way children look at their media landscape and engage with it. The authors also identify children’s perception of participation as well as their feelings regarding their media engagement.

This study explores the potential benefits of using inlet air cooling with desiccant dehumidification and evaporative cooling to improve the performance of gas turbine power plants in tropical regions. The findings indicate that this method of inlet air cooling, which integrates evaporative cooling, desiccant wheel, and Maisotsenko cooler, is a viable option for mitigating the performance drop of gas turbines in hot tropical conditions. Moreover, by utilizing turbine exhaust gases to heat the regeneration air utilized in the desiccant wheel for dehumidification, the compressor inlet temperature can be reduced by an average of 11.5 °C. Additionally, the power requirement of the inlet air cooling system is about 0.9 MW, while there is an improvement of more than 2 MW in power output at peak ambient temperature. Further research is needed to understand and quantify other benefits related to inlet air cooling, such as reducing emissions of harmful pollutants and operating at higher turbine inlet temperatures.",,,Journal of Thermal Science and Engineering Applications,,,,2023-10-31,2023,2023-10-31,2024-01-01,16,1,,Closed,Article,"Sánchez Cabarcas, Mateo E.; Bedoya Villegas, Jose A.; Sierra Aragón, Álvaro D.; Rodríguez Roldán, Imanol; Álvarez Silva, Daniel A.; Mesa, Jaime; Bula, Antonio; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo","Sánchez Cabarcas, Mateo E.

In this study, we propose a new greener route for producing chitosan from shrimp exoskeletons. Our design reduces chemical solvents and freshwater consumption while adhering to Green Chemistry principles. Through process simulation and exergy analysis, we identified critical stages with high irreversibility and achieved a global energy efficiency of 75%, outperforming the conventional chitosan extraction process. An exergy analysis is then conducted to identify sources of energy inefficiencies and reveal process irreversibilities. With a processing capacity of 6507 kg/h of shrimp shells, our proposed biorefinery produces valuable byproducts such as astaxanthin and minerals/proteins. The exergy analysis determined drying, dilution, and washing units as critical stages with the highest irreversibility. Our results demonstrate the potential of applying Green Chemistry principles to improve the sustainability of chitosan production from aquaculture waste streams.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

And yet, only a limited number of studies have addressed self-perceptions regarding flirting skills and which variables contribute to those perceptions. To address this research gap, we developed the Perceived Flirting Self-Efficacy (PFSE) scale and assessed its psychometric properties and individual correlates in a sample of Colombian young adults (N = 857). Results showed the validity and reliability of this measure in assessing perceived self-efficacy for flirting in both social media (PFSE-SM) and face-to-face contexts (PFSE-F2F). Multiple regression analyses showed that higher PFSE-SM scores were associated with being younger, sociosexually unrestricted, and more connected to social networks. Higher PFSE-F2F scores were associated with being more extroverted, more open to experiences, sociosexually unrestricted, and more connected to social networks. Our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing flirting behaviors in different contexts, emphasizing the importance of future research to delve deeper into self-perceptions when examining flirting dynamics.",,The funding was provided by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Grant No. 2020.00523.CEECIND).,Sexuality & Culture,,,,2023-10-27,2023,2023-10-27,2024-04,28,2,496-508,Closed,Article,"Romero, Duban; Rodrigues, David; Mebarak, Moisés; Martinez, Martha","Romero, Duban (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rodrigues, David (Psychology, Iscte-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa, CIS-Iscte, Lisbon, Portugal); Mebarak, Moisés (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez, Martha (Psychology, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Romero, Duban (Universidad del Norte)","Romero, Duban (Universidad del Norte); Rodrigues, David (University Institute of Lisbon); Mebarak, Moisés (Universidad del Norte); Martinez, Martha (Universidad Simón Bolívar)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165283199,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies; 4410 Sociology,

Design/methodology/approach This paper is both conceptual and empirical, as a mixed quantitative and interpretive approach is used. The companies’ names of a tourist industry (the tour and guiding companies) in three destinations are compared and pitched against the branding of these cities. The companies' names are classified into categories to ascertain whether they reflect (or diverge from) the official strategies. Finally, a conceptual model is developed to explain the findings: the strategic naming model (SNM).   Findings Our main finding is that the overall business features of a place being stronger determinants to the naming strategies than tourist destination branding initiatives. The intrinsic features of a place seem thus to be “above” destination branding policies. The researched features account for different naming strategies, such as highly original names, flat names or non-strategic names.   Research limitations/implications As the work is based on a convenience sample, it cannot claim strong representativity. The fact that each of the three data sets was processed by a different researcher might bring up personal biases.   Practical implications This work is a call for a more intensive use of naming strategies to the companies’ advantages, as naming is found out to be strategy used to a very low degree. Thanks to this research, companies will understand the different naming possibilities and be able to apply them to their strategies by choosing names which express “uniqueness” or “belonging”. Practitioners will also be aware of whether they are communicating towards the industry or towards the market.   Originality/value No works were found that empirically pursue our research goals. Therefore, this research might be considered as a novelty. The proposed SNM model explains and relates the most usual company naming techniques, which were unrelated up to date.",,,Journal of Place Management and Development,,,,2023-12-19,2023,2023-12-19,2024-07-23,17,3,325-344,Closed,Article,"Gardella, Narcís Bassols i; Acevedo, Christian; Martínez, Catalina Orjuela","Gardella, Narcís Bassols i (Division of Quality Science, Uppsala Universitet, Visby, Sweden); Acevedo, Christian (Escuela Superior de Guerra, Bogota, Colombia); Martínez, Catalina Orjuela (Independent Researcher and Scholar, Bogota, Colombia)","Gardella, Narcís Bassols i (Uppsala University)","Gardella, Narcís Bassols i (Uppsala University); Acevedo, Christian (Escuela Superior de Guerra); Martínez, Catalina Orjuela (Independent Researcher and Scholar, Bogota, Colombia)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167125423,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",

The case of Barranquilla, Colombia","Implementing a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) may impact travel patterns and the activity systems in its surroundings. Such impacts include land-use and environmental changes, capitalisation of land value, and mobility improvements. Even though the literature reports the above impacts extensively, there is a need for more research to understand individual perceptions about these impacts, which may differ geographically and influence the usage level and the acceptance of transportation systems. This paper contributes to filling this gap by assessing how respondents perceive changes in the transport system and the built environment after implementing Transmetro, the BRT system of the Metropolitan Area of Barranquilla, Colombia. The study uses a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach to analyse data from 305 surveys collected in low-income neighbourhoods, including a treatment sub-sample with access and a control sub-sample without access to the BRT. The results suggest an overall positive perception of change in the urban environment after the Transmetro implementation; however, individuals without access to the BRT have an even more positive perception of its impacts than individuals inside the influence area. The perception of the BRT impacts correlates with the perception regarding urban environment changes at the neighbourhood level. Finally, we found that socioeconomics, travel, and accessibility conditions strongly influence the system's impact perceptions.",,,Journal of Transport Geography,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,110,,103623,Closed,Article,"Diaz, Alfredo J.

Tidal constituents are published for the first time at nine of these stations. Harmonic analysis shows that the main constituents in the Caribbean correspond to three diurnals (K1, O1, P1); three semidiurnals (M2, N2, S2), and one long period harmonic (Mf), showing amplitudes and phase lag that correspond to previous tidal reports in the basin. In Turbo, due to the shallow and extensive continental shelf in the Urabá gulf, M2 is amplified, and shallow water harmonics appear. The amplitude and phase of each observed constituent are compared with global tide models FES2014, TPXO9 and DTU10, showing good agreement. The most significant differences occur with semidiurnal harmonics at stations close to the amphidromic point in the eastern Caribbean. In Mf, considerable interannual variations are found, supporting the need of over one year of sea level data to assess this constituent in the Colombia basin accurately. The radiational component of S2 is assessed using barometric pressure in thirteen stations, confirming its importance when compared to the gravitational contribution to the observed sea level harmonic. A trend in the atmospheric S2 is found in Cartagena, which supports those trends in sea-level S2, previously reported in the Caribbean Sea, are caused by variations in the radiational forcing.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,102,,101356,Closed,Article,"Latandret-Solana, Sadid A.; Parra, Rafael R.

We investigated the temporal persistence of anthropogenic litter in breakwaters, and how fast litter accumulates on them. We sampled anthropogenic litter in old (>10 years since construction) breakwaters and in a recently upgraded one (5 months) and on rocky shores located in a coastal conurbation, in central Chile (33°S). We found breakwaters had much higher litter densities than rocky habitats, and this pattern was persistent through time (~5 years). Also, a recently upgraded breakwater had similar composition and densities of litter items as older breakwaters. Therefore, litter accumulation on breakwaters is a very fast process related to their topographic structure and to the willingness of people to dispose of anthropogenic litter in the infrastructure. Redesigning the breakwater structure is required to reduce litter accumulation on the coast and their impacts.",Field work and writing was financed by FONDECYT grant #1160223 and #1210146 to MAA.

The evolution of computing hardware has made possible to solve complex equations with large amount of data, such as the one used in neural networks. On the other hand, time series methods such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) could also have a good approximation with low computational resources. Nonetheless, to improve the ARIMA approximations, it could be combined with other techniques such as Wavelet Transform or Fourier Transform. Therefore, this work evaluates the appropriate utilization to make predictions for different time horizons (2, 5 and 10 years) and different time frequencies (days, months, and years) using artificial neural network, ARIMA combined with Wavelet Transform, or Fourier Transform. The results show that Artificial Neural Networks provides a better approach for short-term horizons considering either time frequency, ARIMA with Fourier Transform has the best approximation for the monthly time series and either time horizons and ARIMA with Wavelet Transform has the best approximation for medium-term and long-term periods with either time frequency.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The conservation of angular momentum is instrumental in understanding how the interactions between gas, particulate solids, and chamber walls influence the formation of a rotating solids bed. Therefore, this work applies the conservation of angular momentum to derive a model that gives the average angular velocity of solids in terms of gas injection velocity, wall-solids bed drag coefficient, gas and particle properties, and chamber geometry. Three datasets from published studies, comprising 1 g-Geldart B- and d-type particles in different vortex chambers, validate the model results. Using a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the effect of input variables on the average angular velocity of solids, average void fraction, and average bed height. Results indicate that the top and bottom end-wall boundaries exert the most significant braking effect on the rotating solids bed compared with the cylindrical outer wall and gas injection boundaries. The wall-solids bed drag coefficient appears independent of the gas injection velocity for a wide range of operating conditions. The proposed model is a valuable tool for analyzing and comparing gas–solid vortex typologies, unraveling improvement opportunities, and scale-up.","The research leading to these results has received funding from Laboratorios Legrand under the project MATISSE with contract number UN-OJ-2019-43912, and Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología (FPIT) under contract number UN-OJ-2021-51879.",,Chemical Engineering Journal,,,,2023-02,2023,,2023-02,457,,141222,Closed,Article,"Orozco-Jimenez, Alberto J.; Pinilla-Fernandez, Daniel A.; Pugliese, Victor; Bula, Antonio; Perreault, Patrice; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo","Orozco-Jimenez, Alberto J.

In the present study, the Chilean isolate FP99, from the gills of a diseased, farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), was characterized using phenotypic and genomic analyses. Additionally assessed was pathogenic activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that isolate FP99 belonged to the genus Epilithonimonas, an average nucleotide identity value of 100% was detected with the Chilean isolate identified as Epilithonimonas sp. FP211-J200. In silico genome analysis, mechanisms for toxins production, and superantigens, adhesion, or other genes associated with virulence were not detected. However, genes encoding proteins for antibiotic resistance were found, including the chrA gene and the nucleotide sequence that encodes for multiple antibiotic resistance MarC proteins. Furthermore, the blaESP-1 gene (87.85% aminoacidic sequence identity), encoding an extended-spectrum subclass B3 metallo-β-lactamase and conferring carbapenem-hydrolysing activity, and the tet(X) gene, which encodes a monooxygenase that catalyses the degradation of tetracycline-class antimicrobials were carried by this isolate. Phenotyping analyses also supported assignment as E. ginsengisoli. Challenge trials against healthy rainbow trout resulted in no observed pathogenic effect. Our findings identify for the first time the species E. ginsengisoli as associated with fish farming, suggesting that this isolate may be a component of the microbiota of the freshwater system. Notwithstanding, poor environmental conditions and any stressors associated with aquaculture situations or lesions caused by other pathogenic bacteria, such as F. psychrophilum, could favour the entry of E. ginsengisoli into rainbow trout.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID, Chile) through the grants from Fondo de Financiamiento de Centros de Investigación en Áreas Prioritarias from Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR) [FONDAP 1522A0004].

In this study, we sequenced and assembled the mitochondrial genome of Macrotus waterhousii and characterized in detail this genome and that of the congeneric M. californicus. Then, we examined the phylogenetic position of Macrotus in the family Phyllostomidae based on protein coding genes (PCGs). The AT-rich mitochondrial genomes of M. waterhousii and M. californicus are 16,792 and 16,691 bp long, respectively, and each encode 13 PCGs, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a putative non-coding control region 1,336 and 1,232 bp long, respectively. Mitochondrial synteny in Macrotus is identical to that reported before for all other cofamilial species. In the two studied species, all tRNAs exhibit a 'typical' cloverleaf secondary structure with the exception of trnS1, which lacks the D arm. A selective pressure analysis demonstrated that all PCGs are under purifying selection. The CR of the two species feature three domains previously reported in other mammals, including bats: extended terminal associated sequences (ETAS), central (CD), and conserved sequence block (CSB). A phylogenetic analysis based on the 13 mitochondrial PCGs demonstrated that Macrotus is monophyletic and the subfamily Macrotinae is a sister group of all remaining phyllostomids in our analysis, except Micronycterinae. The assembly and detailed analysis of these mitochondrial genomes represents a step further to continue improving the understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the species-rich family Phyllostomidae.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Mitochondrial genomes have been little studied in this clade. We describe and compare different scorpion mitochondrial genomes and analyze their architecture and molecular characteristics. We assembled eight new scorpion mitochondrial genomes from transcriptomic datasets, annotated them, predicted the secondary structures of tRNAs, and compared the nucleotide composition, codon usage, and relative synonymous codon usage of 16 complete scorpion mitochondrial genomes. Lastly, we provided a phylogeny based on all mitochondrial protein coding genes. We characterized the mitogenomes in detail and reported particularities such as dissimilar synteny in the family Buthidae compared to other scorpions, unusual tRNA secondary structures, and unconventional start and stop codons in all scorpions. Our comparative analysis revealed that scorpion mitochondrial genomes exhibit different architectures and features depending on taxonomic identity. We highlight the parvorder Buthida, particularly the family Buthidae, as it invariably exhibited different mitogenome features such as synteny, codon usage, and AT-skew compared to the parvorder Iurida that included the rest of the scorpion families we analyzed in this study. Our results provide a better understanding of the evolution of mitogenome features and phylogenetic relationships in scorpions.","We thank the University of Tolima and Creative Inquiry and Clemson Think 2, from Clemson University, for supporting this research.",Funding.,Gene,,,"Humans; Animals; Scorpions; Arachnida; Genome, Mitochondrial; Phylogeny; Mitochondria; RNA, Transfer",2023-01-16,2023,2023-01-16,2023-04,859,R Package 1 2018,147189,Closed,Article,"Moreno-Carmona, Manuela; Montaña-Lozano, Paula; Prada Quiroga, Carlos Fernando; Baeza, J Antonio","Moreno-Carmona, Manuela (Maestría en Ciencias Biológicas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad del Tolima, Tolima, Ibagué, Colombia; Grupo de Investigación de Biología y Ecología de Artrópodos.

Extraction and purification of polysaccharides from D. antarctica were performed. They were characterized by FT-IR and GC-MS, identifying isomers of arabinose, fucose, mannose, and galactose. The antioxidant capacity of polysaccharides was analyzed using the ABTS method (14.3 ± 0.5 μmol TE g-1 PS) and the DPPH method (21.82 ± 0.32 μmol TE g-1 PS). The antitumor capacity of polysaccharides was studied by MTT colorimetric assays in human leukemia, colon, breast, and lung cancer cell lines, obtaining the lowest IC50 in colon cancer (19.99 μg mL-1 ). In the line of healthy human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1), an IC50 of 444.39 μg mL-1 was obtained. Flow cytometry in the HL60 cell line showed that polysaccharides at concentrations higher than IC50 inhibited cell proliferation, demonstrating a possible antitumor capacity in vitro. In the proteomic analysis with HGF-1, nine proteins involved in different biological processes were identified. In conclusion, polysaccharides from D. antarctica could be considered powerful nutraceuticals, mainly against colon cancer.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe want to express our gratitude to the Photobiology and Biotechnology of Aquatic Organisms (FYBOA) research group (RNM‐295) for their financial support.

969,pub.1157125299,10.1016/j.rcp.2023.03.001,,,Consumption of Alcohol Upon Admission to the Emergency Department in Patients With Trauma,"Aim For 2016, around 32.5% of the population consumed alcoholic beverages. This is related to 1.6% of the disability-adjusted life years. Also, an association is described between trauma severity and a positive alcohol test on admission to the emergency room. In Colombia, the prevalence of alcohol consumption during the last year is 17.8–42.5%. However, the prevalence of alcohol consumption upon admission to emergency services is unknown. We aim to estimate the prevalence of alcohol consumption in cases admitted to an emergency room. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Data were collected during four months in an emergency room located in a fourth-level hospital. Researchers interviewed participants to complete a questionnaire, additionally, a qualitative alcohol test was carried out with an alcohol-sensor FST, and the AUDIT-C scale was used to screen for alcohol abuse. Results In 2524 patients, there was a prevalence of alcohol consumption on admission to the emergency room of 2.34%, and a median result of the quantitative test of 1.22mg/ml. We found that as ethanol levels increased, there was a greater potential for discrimination among the patients who identified themselves with potential risky consumption based on the scale score. Conclusions Alcohol consumption is associated with high morbidity in patients admitted to the emergency room. This can increase the burden of disease and affect the quality of life. It is pertinent to recognize alcohol consumption as a possible focus to mitigate the impact of this condition on the well-being of patients and resources allocation.","Acknowledgements We want to thank the patients and emergency personnel of the HUSI who supported the information collection process, especially at the beginning of the pandemic.","This study is part of a larger project that has been funded by Colciencias and the Colombian Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (convocatory ID 777-2017).

FDI in large-scale smelting furnaces presents several challenges, as it requires the understanding of complex thermal and chemical reactions occurring inside the structure. Furthermore, the impossibility of having full operational information about the process makes the use of model-based methods very complex or unfeasible. This article introduces a methodology to develop a data-driven FDI system for the detection of incipient and intermittent failures in a network made out of 322 thermocouples located on the shell of the furnace. Statistical metrics over fault counter time windows (FTCWs) were used to identify different types of sensor failures, which led to establishing a baseline of known failure events and to create a dataset to train the machine learning (ML) classification models. A data-driven approach was proposed based on the sensors’ physical (neighboring) redundancy, which led to some type of physical redundancy. A postprocessing stage was used to stabilize the model’s response in time, determining that the proposed FDI system successfully detects faults while reducing reported false negatives.",,"This work was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation through “Convocatoria para el registro de proyectos que aspiran a obtener beneficios tributarios por inversión en CTeI” under Grant 786.",IEEE Sensors Journal,,,,2023-12-25,2023,2023-12-25,2024-01-15,24,4,5215-5223,Closed,Article,"Cárdenas, Diego A.

Scientific articles published between 2010 and 2020 were included in this systematic review, including in vitro and in vivo models, to define the gastroprotective role of fruit extracts. Studies were selected by Rayyan using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. The keywords for the search strategy were: ""gastric injury,"" ""gastric ulcer,"" ""fruit,"" ""indomethacin,"" and ""aspirin."" Twenty-two articles with animal models of gastric ulcers were included. The NSAIDs used were aspirin and indomethacin. To know the damage caused by these, the ulceration index and biomarkers, such as aggressive/defensive factors involved in the gastric ulceration process, were measured. Most studies have shown that fruit extracts have antiulcer activity, with the most abundant metabolites being flavonoids, followed by terpenes and alkaloids. Possible antiulcer activities such as antioxidant, cytoprotective, gastric acid antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, or angiogenesis stimulant were declared, manifested mainly as a reduction of lipid peroxidation products, an increase in antioxidant enzymes and prostaglandins, and by the formation of a protective film through protein precipitation in the ulcer area. This systematic review demonstrates the importance of fruit extracts as gastric protectors.",,The content of this study was part of the FONDECYT project 1130601 (Chile).,Journal of Medicinal Food,,,"Rats; Animals; Stomach Ulcer; Antioxidants; Fruit; Gastric Mucosa; Plant Extracts; Rats, Wistar; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Indomethacin; Aspirin",2023-10-30,2023,2023-10-30,2023-11-01,26,11,777-798,Closed,Article,"Garrido-Valdes, Mariana; Díaz-Velis, Leonor; Valdes-Gonzalez, Marisela; Garrido-Suárez, Barbara B.; Garrido, Gabino","Garrido-Valdes, Mariana (Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Díaz-Velis, Leonor (Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Valdes-Gonzalez, Marisela (Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Garrido-Suárez, Barbara B.

894,pub.1167537785,10.1061/ajrua6.rueng-1156,,,Robust Optimal Control Method to Improve Bus Schedule Adherence Considering Stochastic Bus Operations under Mixed Traffic,"Mixed traffic often results in large deviations in bus schedules due to the influence of stochastic factors on bus operations. In order to improve bus schedule adherence, signal priority is often employed at signalized intersections by adjusting signal timing. However, traditional deterministic optimization methods that treat bus travel time as a constant are not effective in meeting the challenges posed by changes in bus operations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a robust signal priority control method that aims to improve the reliability of bus operations. However, because of the limited adjustable range of signal timing, signal control used independently only works a little in large bus headways. In order to further enhance control performance, bus holding is introduced in this study, leading to the development of an integrated robust signal priority and holding control (RHC) method. The RHC method improves bus schedule adherence and reliability in bus operations and is designed based on a bus schedule deviation model that takes stochastic bus speed and the number of queuing vehicles at intersections into account under mixed traffic. Through simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed calculation models is verified. Furthermore, the RHC method can boost bus schedule adherence by 38% while limiting the negative impact on car delays to only 3%.","This work was supported in part by Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education (Grant No. 23YJCZH120), Shanghai University Students’ Project for Innovation and Entrepreneurship under Grant Nos.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the United States exerted economic and military influence on the region, due to its guano resources and proximity to the Isthmus of Panama and Nicaragua. As a result, the Archipelago has a rich maritime cultural heritage, including several shipwrecks caused by the area’s complex geography and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. However, historical documentation of the Archipelago, including nautical information, is scarce, as much of it was lost or destroyed during the War of Independence (1810–1824). Consequently, the maritime cultural landscape of the Archipelago is poorly documented, and most information about the seascape comes from narratives and other literary genres. This study analyzes literary narratives from the fifteenth to the early twentieth centuries to explore the Archipelago’s maritime cultural landscape and its relationship with shipwrecks. By analyzing narratives, this study deconstructs the connection between shipwrecks and environmental conditions as described by castaways, seafarers, and authors, which shapes the maritime cultural landscape. The article provides a database of 14 shipwrecks culled from various literary genres, shedding light on the experiences of survivors, the complexities of seafaring in the region, and the relationship between the Archipelago and the California Gold Rush. The study’s findings emphasize the significance of narratives for historical archaeology, and they provide a better understanding of the Archipelago’s maritime cultural landscape, including the many shipwrecks in the region.","We extend our gratitude to Dr. Michael Chenoweth, for providing valuable information on historical hurricanes.

The city hosts both the country's largest touristic and coastal industrial sectors and is home to vulnerable coastal communities whose health and livelihoods are impacted by pollution. These marginalized artisanal fishing communities lack basic water and health services but have finally been recognized in a new intersectoral committee for Cartagena Bay's environmental management. To support the governance of these complex socioenvironmental challenges, the Cartagena Bay Observatory has been developed as a scientific tool to monitor the bay's conditions and forecast the effects of future sediment remediation plans. Cartagena Bay receives large freshwater discharges from the Dique Canal, draining from the 260,000 km 2 Magdalena River watershed where 80% of the national population resides. This runoff transports sediment loads of 2.3 Mt/year, dispersing large plumes that affect the marine ecosystems and tourism and make the bay one of the Caribbean's largest sediment‐receiving estuaries. Following decades of watershed deforestation and erosion, the upward trending sediment inputs and accretion of the Dique delta have resulted in deposition rates of 1.8 cm/year, and the need for frequent dredging. Mercury dumped by a chemical industry in the 1970s can be found in concentrations as high as 18.8 μg/g buried below the bay's bottom. Mercury has also been found in the bay's biota and human populations, and so the dredging needed for the port's sustainability thereby presents a health risk by allowing this trapped mercury to surface.

726,pub.1165379421,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103876,,,Addressing pedestrian perceived externalities influenced by motor vehicles: A perspective from curb space typologies,"Pedestrian externalities are usually generated by motor vehicles on urban infrastructure. There is a part of such infrastructure, called curb space, that separates pedestrians from motor vehicles. The literature proposes four main curb space typologies regarding the right-of-way (i.e., no lateral separation, lateral separation with no vertical barriers, lateral separation with vertical barriers, and on-street parking). However, there is little research reporting on how pedestrians perceive the externalities, or on the effects of externalities considering the previously mentioned curb space typologies. The purpose of this study is to identify the influences of externalities on pedestrians from the latter’s perspective and considers their interaction with the built environment. To do so, we collected 1014 pedestrian responses related to their relationship with motor vehicles on 30 different sidewalks and some objective information (e.g., sidewalk width) on those sidewalks. Using a structural equation model approach, we identified a latent variable related with the pedestrian perceived externalities, which was defined based on a multiple indicators and multiple causes model for each of the curb space typologies. It was found that socio-demographic characteristics have a greater influence on the perceived externalities on curb spaces with no vertical barriers. In contrast, for curb spaces with vertical barriers, it is the built environment and operational characteristics that have a greater influence. We also identified the built environment and operational attributes influencing the perceived externalities on each of the curb space typologies. This research provides the tools to propose public policies related to transportation infrastructure interventions to reduce pedestrian perceived externalities.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

719,pub.1161674875,10.1177/25148486231187799,,,Privatizing water in the Atacama Desert and the resurgence of Atacameño indigeneity,"Until the mid-1980s, the Atacameño indigenous people were broadly caricatured as Chilean peasants or herders. In the 1980s, they began a process of resurgence as indigenous in order to attain legal recognition. Structural approaches to indigeneity have explored this phenomenon by seeing Atacameños as passive subjects whose identity has been imposed, fixed, or mediated by the law and by external actors (e.g. bureaucrats, intellectuals, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)). Problematizing these viewpoints, I argue here that Atacameños, rather than adopting indigeneity based on predetermined structural factors or instrumental motivations, are active agents in their resurgence and the articulation of their identity against cultural assimilation and extractive industries. Based largely on oral evidence collected from indigenous leaders and other key actors, I show that the dispossession and threats that the neoliberal Chilean Water Code brought to the Atacameños served as critical historical sediment for the resurgence and articulation of their indigeneity. The results problematize the hegemonic perspective that presents authenticity as a requisite for indigeneity and indigenous people as colonial power victims. Instead, Atacameños are situated agents who revived their identity within a broader process in order to challenge dominant structures concerning access to resources, principally water.","I extend my profound gratitude to everyone who participated in the research for generously sharing their time, experiences, and opinions.

Design/methodology/approach By analyzing the content of the Sharing of Information on Progress reports from PRME signatories, this study identified significant developments in the strategies business school use to implement sustainability. However, it seems that a framework that business schools can apply to accomplish that goal is still lacking. This paper proposes a framework that addresses four components of the integration process and stresses the important role of stakeholders. The authors discuss the results from 2021 in comparison to the results of a previous analysis of the first 100 signatories from 2010 and analyze the findings in relation to the developed framework.   Findings This study shows that business schools have improved their sustainability engagement in many areas (e.g. education offerings and teaching methods, campus practices and engaging stakeholders). However, less attention has been paid to other aspects, such as reviewing and assessing, capability development or communication, which could slow the transformation process. The authors discuss further implications of the findings for enhancing the PRME signatories’ ability to implement the underrecognized aspects.   Originality/value While the analysis focuses on the status and progress of the integration of PRME within business schools during the past decade, the framework may enable higher education institutions to analyze their potential to implement change and plan future transformation strategies.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Several authors review the different LIB recycling methodologies, including pyro- and hydrometallurgy processes. However, the characteristics, main stages, and achievements of LIB emerging recycling are still missing. This study reviews the diverse emerging approaches for recycling critical materials from spent LIB in the last five years. A classification for emerging recycling technologies is provided, including terms like development stage and eco-friendly status. The main stages of recycling LIB are opening, phase separation, and materials recovery. Among the emerging proposals with the highest industrialization potential are direct recycling techniques due to low costs and simple procedures. Concerning phase separation, froth flotation and ultrasound-assisted methods are discussed. The former divides black mass into pure anodic and cathodic materials, while ultrasonication is employed to physically detach active materials from foils or enhance binder degradation. As to materials recovery, several recent approaches show high recovery efficiency for different elements, mainly in leaching. The use of new organic acids, deep eutectic acids, and some salts are worth noting as leaching agents due to their low environmental impact. In addition, leaching methods assisted by ultrasound and microwave irradiation increase valuable metal recovery, reducing time consumption and the number of leaching reactants. As a part of the hydrometallurgy process, metallic ion purification is performed by solvent extraction and ion exchange, while selective precipitation can be achieved by specific chemical agents or electrochemical processes.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that may influence the work reported in this paper.

A total of 123 Pseudo-nitzschia strains were identified to 11 species based on sequencing of the ITS region of the nuclear rDNA and on ultrastructural and morphometric analyses of the frustule in selected representatives of each clade: P. australis, P. bucculenta, P. cf. chiniana, P. cf. decipiens, P. fraudulenta, P. hasleana, P. multistriata, P. plurisecta, P. cf. sabit, the new species P. dampieri sp. nov., and one undescribed species. Partial 18S and 28S rDNA sequences, including the hypervariable V4 and D1-D3 regions used for barcoding, were gathered from representative strains of each species to facilitate future metabarcoding studies. Results showed different levels of genetic, and at times ultrastructural, diversity among the above-mentioned entities, suggesting morphological variants (P. bucculenta), rapidly radiating complexes with ill-defined species boundaries (P. cf. decipiens and P. cf. sabit), and the presence of new species (P. dampieri sp. nov., Pseudo-nitzschia sp. 1, and probably P. cf. chiniana). Domoic acid (DA) was detected in 18 out of 82 strains tested, including those of P. australis, P. plurisecta, and P. multistriata. Toxicity varied among species mostly corresponding to expectations from previous reports, with the prominent exception of P. fraudulenta; DA was not detected in any of its 10 strains tested. In conclusion, a high diversity of Pseudo-nitzschia exists in Chilean waters, particularly offshore.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A psychological network model was applied to evaluate the estimation, stability, and accuracy of the network during the analysis sequence. The results indicated that the inability to perform activities at work, school, or home was the most central symptom in the entire network. However, the presence of high instability in the centrality indices indicates that the central node may differ in other cultural contexts. The networks were invariant according to sex. The most influential node in the women's group was their inability to perform activities at work, school, or home. In men, the most central node was the presence of health problems due to bereavement.

Both its origins and current expansive movement are theoretically and geographically diverse. Chile, the mother country of the influential biologists Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana, represents one of its roots, but also, as the variety of contributions in this special issue shows it, one of its fields of new blossoms. In this editorial introduction, regarding the roots, we focus on the enactive approach developed by Francisco Varela and its relationship with Maturana’s autopoietic theory. We discuss the way in which the particular theoretical and historical horizons of these two research programs conditioned, to a large extent, their philosophical stances regarding cognition. Regarding the new blossoms, we introduce the seven articles composing the present special issue and briefly comment on their contributions in terms of methodology, practical applications, theoretical extensions, and conceptual reflection.","Mario Villalobos wants to thank the University of Sussex (Department of Philosophy, School of Media, Arts and Humanities) for hosting him as an Associate Researcher during the elaboration of this article.

This study uses secondary analysis to explore how globalisation has affected Taiwan’s disability politics. It selects three different themes to illustrate the development of disability politics in Taiwan: special education, disability terminology, and disability classification. These cases show that missionaries, colonisers, and international organisations were the main actors in changing Taiwan’s traditional understandings of disability. However, this development, which differs markedly from that in Western industrialised countries, mainly followed a top-down approach, lacking the political mobilisation of disabled people on the ground. Consequently, the implementation of disability human rights failed to empower Taiwanese disabled people effectively and led to some unexpected outcomes for them. Furthermore, medical and traditional charity-focused thinking about disability has not been altered and remains prevalent in Taiwan.",,"This work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

We tested this hypothesis in the shrimp Chernocaris placunae which inhabits the mantle cavity of the saddle oyster Placuna ephippium in the Indo-West Pacific. At two study sites in Nha Trang, Vietnam, C. placunae inhabits the mantle cavity of host individuals as heterosexual pairs more often than is expected by chance alone. At Tre Island, a tight correlation between the host and shrimp body size in both males and females was observed and pairing in shrimps was size-assortative; the carapace length was positively correlated between males and females forming pairs. Altogether, the information above suggests that C. placunae is socially and sexually monogamous in Tre Island. In turn, at Mun Island, no correlation between the host and shrimp body size was observed and shrimp pairing was not size-assortative, suggesting that C. placunae is socially but not necessarily sexually monogamous (and probably promiscuous) in this second study site. Host body size and abundance was lower at Tre Island compared to Mun Island suggesting that refuge (=host) trait drives, at least to some extent, the observed differences in the mating system of C. placunae. Tre Island is also a heavily polluted site suggesting that pollution might also be driving the mating system of the studied species. We have described shifts in the mating system of a marine invertebrate. Whether similar changes in the mating system of other marine organisms are occurring due to contemporary changes in seascapes is a relevant topic that deserves further attention. Manipulative experiments are needed to understand how shifts in community components driven by global change affects the social behavior of marine organisms.","Alyssa Baker edited the English and provided numerous comments that improved previous versions of this manuscript.

We follow a theoretical model of cost efficiency that considers spatial interactions and spillover effects among neighboring jurisdictions. Our findings suggest that Chilean municipalities reach an optimum population level at around 700,000 inhabitants, which is high considering that only two cities qualify. When differentiating for levels of economies of scale according to levels of market potential, municipalities with a low potential reach their optimum at around 28,000 inhabitants, those with a medium potential reach it at approximately 124,000, and those with a high potential reach it at approximately 680,000.",Declaration of competing interest None.,,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,87,,101590,Closed,Article,"Chavez, Alicia; Paredes, Dusan","Chavez, Alicia (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Paredes, Dusan (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)","Chavez, Alicia (Catholic University of the North)","Chavez, Alicia (Catholic University of the North); Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157887421,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Enhanced via public record digitisation, crowd-sourced data input, and consumer genetics testing, interest in one’s ancestral roots has never been higher. Recognising the public interest in personal lineages, the BBC launched the docuseries Who Do You Think You Are? in 2004. Focusing on celebrities’ family backgrounds and how their hitherto-unknown forebears’ experiences shaped their lives and careers, the format was quickly adapted for other national audiences with nearly 20 versions around the world. This article examines the phenomenon of mediated genealogical research through the twinned prisms of race and postcolonialism. Employing close readings of episodes from the American (Emmitt Smith) and South African (Jabulani Tsambo/HHP) adaptations, as well as the original British series (Naomie Harris), this intervention interrogates the ways in which power and privilege in white settler colonies are unpacked through carefully-curated spatial narrations of private pasts meant for popular consumption. Using approaches drawn from more-than-representational geography, I view these seemingly ‘individual’ performances of genealogy as instead affect-inducing ‘collective’ journeys to sites of pain, prejudice, and power(lessness), which in turn serve to shape transnational perceptions of place and space.","I wish to thank Alex Hastie and Joe Thorogood for bringing me on board with this special issue and the most excellent collaboration along the way.

This work analyzes temporal variations of loco and kelp abundances and landings at increasing spatial scales, investigating which would be a TURF size that could dampen the influence of natural variations on fishers’ income enough for it to be tolerable. We analyzed loco and kelp abundance and landings data from hard bottom TURFs in Atacama (n = 22) and Coquimbo (n = 61) regions of Central Chile, which represent 81.4% of the total TURFs in these regions. Income variations less than 39% were considered tolerable, according to a study conducted by the National Consumer Service, where 61% of a person’s salary is necessary to cover essential needs in Chilean family. Loco and kelp landings variations exceeded that criterion at all analyzed spatial scales, suggesting that they cannot rely solely on those fisheries within a TURF. Even increasing the size of TURF including the coast of an entire region, does not dampen variability to a tolerable value. This explains the reason for former fisher migrations within these fisheries, something present regulations prevent, generating a complex situation which is necessary to revise in order not to maintain an incentive to side step regulations.","Acknowledgements We thank all the artisanal fishers of the different caletas of the Atacama and Coquimbo regions who contributed enormously to the making of this study.

An interpretative approach,"As a result of recent socio-environmental disasters, mine tailings have become an environmental liability, raising concern among local communities, civil society and the State. This paper describes the present state of the art of research into tailings deposits in Chile through the analysis of academic publications. The study uses a subject classification model to reveal the dynamics and transformation of research over the last decade. The results show two main areas of research: one concerning the impact of tailings on the country and communities; and the other to the interventions that seek to reduce further impacts of tailings. The discussion section offers an interpretative analysis, which shows that in addition to the attention that is already being constantly paid to the impact of tailings, there has also been a considerable increase in the number of technical studies focused on providing new tailings management solutions during the period from 2015 to 2020. In both research approaches there have been case studies showing the adverse effect of regional agglomeration dynamics and national tailings similarities aimed at a better analysis, monitoring and governance.

Understanding the origin of deep saline groundwater can be challenging using only hydrogeochemical and common isotope methods. New 87Sr/86Sr, δ11B, δ7Li, and 234U/238U values of dissolved salts have been added to previously known chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, inorganic dissolved carbon, and sulfate. In this extremely arid area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of coastal springs primarily reflect the concentration of salts from atmospheric wet and dry deposition, which accumulate in the topsoil and dissolve during the occasional heavy rainfall events. These events recharge the aquifer with sodium-chloride type, high salinity water, with rock weathering contributing minimally to the chemical composition of groundwater. However, high salinity water of the calcium chloride and sodium-calcium chloride types in the deep fractured aquifer have a significantly different chemical and isotopic composition. In this investigation, it has been concluded that the salinity of these last waters is due to remnants of ancient marine water, mineral alteration and interaction with predominantly andesitic volcanic rocks in the Cordillera de la Costa. The deep saline groundwater has δ11B values between 17.3‰ and 20.7‰, and 87Sr/86Sr values below 0.706, suggesting mixing with recharge groundwater. The δ7Li composition of the deep groundwater varies between 23.5‰ and 31.5‰, pointing to a contribution of salts of marine origin and mineral alteration. However, the low Li concentrations relative to B in recharge water and in deep groundwater shows a preferential Li removal from pore water. Uranium and uranium isotopes data are limited to shallow groundwater due to the very low U concentrations in deep groundwater following reduction of U, and point to enhanced water–rock interaction in a rock-dominated environment. The dissolution of old buried saline deposits at shallow depth as a source of salinity is ruled out.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The feasibility of adopting the same approach should be thoroughly studied to assess its compatibility with institutions and countries that employ an academic credit system based on student workload, such as the European Credit Transfer System. This approach was applied here for the Chilean system, which is highly consistent with the European case. The resulting methods can be automated and integrated into institutional databases for the management of teaching-learning processes to enhance decision-making. Special attention is devoted to the methods for estimating the credit points and the relative position of each course in the curriculum sequence chart of a university degree. As an example of application, we discuss the curriculum redesign of the B.Sc. degree in Physics offered by the Universidad Católica del Norte. The analysis is based on the statistical report of performance indicators of this undergraduate program during the follow-up period 2015–2019 (five years). We report a certain correspondence between the problem of credit allocation and the behavior in the student progression, which represents an empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the associated credit points estimation.","Authors thanks Arancibia-Carvajal and Guevara Baldelomar for their support concerning the SCT-Chile system, as well as by their many valuable suggestions since the early development of this research.

Nonetheless, variations of As concentration within different types of volcanic rocks and questions related to the original source of As in magma are not yet fully understood. We compiled published As data from the abundant Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the Altiplano-Puna plateau, considered the main source of As for waters in the region. These data indicates that volcanic rocks in the Altiplano-Puna have a mean As concentration of 9.1 mg/kg, which is almost 2 times higher than the upper continental crust. Arsenic increases within the more silicic compositions such as dacites and rhyolites as well as from mafic monogenetic volcanic edifices to stratovolcanoes of intermediate composition, silicic calderas and ignimbrite fields. The rate and composition of crustal assimilation by the magmas (enhanced by the crustal thickness up to >70 km) strongly influence the As concentration in volcanic rocks. The assimilation of argillaceous shale-type sediments represents the most important source of As in the magmas. The eruption dynamics has an enormous effect on As concentration. The higher the explosivity of an eruption, the higher the amount of ash that will be formed. Arsenic can be sorb onto ash particles so that fall deposits produced during explosive volcanic eruptions are prone to high As concentrations. Large volume ignimbrites formed after caldera collapses in the Altiplano-Puna are often the result of sustained explosive eruptions related to low, dense pyroclastic fountaining eruptions where highly concentrated pyroclastic density currents (PDC, flowing pyroclastic mixtures of particles and gas) are able to maintain high temperatures for long periods. Then As released from volatiles may remain for longer time in the emplacing PDC and can be sorbed onto ash particles, resulting in deposits with a higher As concentration. Post eruption hydrothermal alteration and sulfide mineralization produce As enrichment up to 100 times in the volcanic rocks (957 mg/kg) of the region, but can be very heterogeneous. Volcanism and its related products are the main source of As in the region. Once As is released from the volcanic sources, the semiarid climate, the occurrence of Na-HCO3 water types, and alkaline pH further enhance As concentrations in surface water and groundwater.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The suggested model is maximally stable and robust by considering sensitivity analysis results which demonstrates a new performance analysis approach based on T2NFN sets. The proposed model deals with the input and output criteria and considers existing uncertainties arising from insufficient information and the dynamic structure of the industries. The model's basic algorithm has a unique structure compared to the previous performance analysis technique, and it does not require applying additional weighting techniques to identify the criteria weights. To the best of our knowledge, the extended version of the EATWIOS technique based on the T2NFN set is presented for the first time. The developed model provides reasonable and logical results to practitioners because it deals with satisfactory outputs instead of optimal outputs. This model is an immensely strengthened version of the EATWIOS technique, as the T2NFN sets treat predictable and unpredictable uncertainties. The suggested T2NFN-EATWIOS is then applied to a real-world assessment problem in the container shipping industry. The obtained results are pretty reasonable and logical. Moreover, the results of a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with three stages approve the robustness of the suggested model.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,218,,119596,Closed,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Görçün, Ömer Faruk; Çanakçıoğlu, Mustafa; Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Department of Business Administration, Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences, Kadir Has University, İstanbul, Turkey); Çanakçıoğlu, Mustafa (Istanbul Gelisim University, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Department of E-Trade and Management, Cihangir Avenue, Şehit Jandarma Komando Er Hakan Öner St. No:1 Avcılar, Istanbul, Turkey); Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee (Department of Industrial Engineering, Istinye University, Istanbul, Turkey)","Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee (Istinye University)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Kadir Has University); Çanakçıoğlu, Mustafa (Gelişim Üniversitesi); Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee (Istinye University)",9,9,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154790563,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Overcoming the barriers small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) face in developing countries during the transition to the RRBM is a considerable challenge. RRBM has quite different barriers than other circular economy business models (e.g., product life extension, product-service systems, etc.). The aim of this study is to present a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology to evaluate possible solution strategies by analyzing RRBM barriers. First, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on the barriers to implementing RRBM. Working with the expert decision-making group through semi-structured forms, the micro, macro, and Meso-level barriers were finalized by considering the emerging economies. The importance levels of the twenty-five barriers were determined in the second stage using the Improved Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (IMF-SWARA) method. With the IMF-SWARA method, it was convenient to get straightforward, expert opinions, and inconsistency was no problem. In the third stage, eight main solution strategies were analyzed to see to what extent they could overcome the barriers. At this point, the Fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (F-MARCOS) was used to evaluate the decision-maker's opinions more accurately, which may not be confident within the scope of the criteria. While the most critical barriers to be considered are collaboration problems, global secondary material supply chain problems, and quality problems of the recovered resources, the solutions to be considered are financial support, design for circularity, and industrial symbiosis. In addition, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to test its validity after the proposed model was applied. This study's key contribution is to highlight the barriers that may occur in the context of emerging economies during the adoption of the RRBM as well as the solutions that should be prioritized. Thus, it became evident which actions SMEs, representing the most significant proportion of businesses in emerging economies, should take to execute the resource recovery business model.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2023-08,2023,,2023-08,413,,137362,Closed,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Görener, Ali; Toker, Kerem","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Görener, Ali (Faculty of Business, Istanbul Commerce University, İmrahor Street 88/2, Istanbul, 34445, Turkey); Toker, Kerem (Faculty of Health Sciences, Bezmiâlem Vakif University, Silahtarağa Street 189, Istanbul, 34050, Turkey)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Görener, Ali (Istanbul Commerce University); Toker, Kerem (Bezmiâlem Vakıf Üniversitesi)",14,14,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157915945,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

The evaluation was carried out on the third day after the intervention by measuring the pain intensity using Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). This research used Wilcoxon and ordinal logistic regression for data analysis. The results showed a difference in pain intensity before and after SEFT intervention in patients with advanced breast cancer with a p-value of .001 (p < .05) with a change in intensity from severe to mild pain. This study's novelty is that SEFT intervention can be used as a nonpharmacological therapy for pain management in patients with advanced breast cancer. The limitations are only limited to measuring the patient's pain and less analysis related to the patient's emotional and spiritual problems.

8502,pub.1157699048,,37128416,PMC10148321,Predicting patients who are likely to develop Lupus Nephritis of those newly diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"Patients diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suffer from a decreased quality of life, an increased risk of medical complications, and an increased risk of death. In particular, approximately 50% of SLE patients progress to develop lupus nephritis, which oftentimes leads to life-threatening end stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires dialysis or kidney transplant1. The challenge is that lupus nephritis is diagnosed via a kidney biopsy, which is typically performed only after noticeable decreased kidney function, leaving little room for proactive or preventative measures. The ability to predict which patients are most likely to develop lupus nephritis has the potential to shift lupus nephritis disease management from reactive to proactive. We present a clinically useful prediction model to predict which patients with newly diagnosed SLE will go on to develop lupus nephritis in the next five years.",,,AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,,,"Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Nephritis; Quality of Life; Renal Dialysis; Prognosis; Biopsy; Preventive Medicine; Datasets as Topic; Electronic Health Records; California; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; ROC Curve; Reproducibility of Results",2023-04-29,2023,2023-04-29,,2022,,221-230,Closed,Article,"Bechler, Katelyn K; Stolyar, Liya; Steinberg, Ethan; Posada, Jose; Minty, Evan; Shah, Nigam H","Bechler, Katelyn K (Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.); Stolyar, Liya (Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.); Steinberg, Ethan (Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.); Posada, Jose (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA.; Department of Systems Engineering and Computing, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Minty, Evan (O'Brien Institute for Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Canada.); Shah, Nigam H (Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.; Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA.)",,"Bechler, Katelyn K (Stanford University); Stolyar, Liya (Stanford University); Steinberg, Ethan (Stanford University); Posada, Jose (Stanford University; Universidad del Norte); Minty, Evan (University of Calgary); Shah, Nigam H (Stanford University; Stanford University)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157699048,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

These novel records of pollution include two rock types (plastiglomerates and quartz plastisandstones), two altered plastic types (pyroplastics and plasticrusts), two soil types (plasticlasts and anthrosols), and a series of artifacts (fossils) found near human settlements. All of them were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Polyester, high-density polyethylene, and copolymers of alkyl acrylates or methacrylates were identified as the principal polymers forming these rocks. This research provides new insights into the petrology of these emerging new forms of pollution, for which humans are primarily responsible for their generation and distribution. Similarly, the results presented emphasize that plastics are generating a deluge of pollutants in terms of variety and volume, overwhelming natural environments globally. Controlling or even eliminating their use has become one of the most significant challenges of the 21st Century.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of mitigation strategies have exacerbated these conditions of vulnerability. COVID-19 led to an increase in prevalence and awareness of existing mental health problems and healthcare gaps. Children and adolescents' mental health worsened as the pandemic progressed; their daily routines and development opportunities were affected mainly by school closures, limited peer interaction, and changed family dynamics. Understanding how various vulnerabilities can position children and adolescents at greater risk of developing a mental illness, partly because of their neuropsychological immaturity, should be a priority in this population given psychological stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest in relation to the content of this review.

For this task, the solvent effects are commonly included in theoretical computations based on either implicit or explicit solvent approaches. In the present study, we evaluate and compare the performance of some of the most widely applied methods based on these two approaches. For studying the solvent effect on thermochemistry with an explicit solvent, we demonstrate that partial normal mode analysis with frozen geometry of solvent molecules for multiple solute-solvent configurations can yield quite accurate and reliable results for a drastically reduced computational cost. As a case study, we consider the evaluation of the equilibrium constant for the boron isotope exchange between boric acid and borate (k3-4) in pure and saline water which is of high geochemical importance. Employing three different rigorous and high-precision theoretical approaches, we provide a reliable estimation of k3-4 which is a value within 1.028 to 1.030 for both pure and saline water which is in excellent agreement with experimental data.",This project has received funding in the framework of European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 643084.

One of the most allergenic species is the storage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank). Protein extracts are produced from this mite for tests that help the clinical diagnosis (via prick test), treatment, and monitoring of disease progression in patients who had positive results for allergic reactions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the cell viability of RAW 264.7 and L929 cells when exposed to in-house raw protein extracts of T. putrescentiae compared to a commercial product, as well as quantify TNF-α secretion by RAW 264.7. Additionally, this study quantified the effect of these extracts in IgE secretion in total blood of people affected by this mite. The study found similarity between the in-house extract and the commercial extract as they had equivalent TNF-α secretion. Additionally, viabilities of RAW 264.7 and L929 exposed to the in-house extract were compatible with viabilities of cells exposed to the commercial extract, with no cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested. Results corroborated the hypothesis that the extract produced in-house would be equivalent to the commercial extract in allergic patients when the IgE was quantified. This study is the first to show the cytotoxicity of T. putrescentiae extracts, and to provide a quantitative analysis of TNF-α and IgE.","The authors are grateful to Universidade do Vale do Taquari - Univates and FAPERGS (21/2551-0000083-0) for their financial support, scholarships and for providing the material required to conduct this study.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the levels of PRFs of five work centers and reliability and validity aspects of RGIII.
METHOD: The RGIII was applied to 1458 workers (806 women and 652 men) from five workplace in the industrial sector of Ensenada (Mexico), and the level of risk of the PRFs was analyzed, as well as their reliability and validity through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).
RESULTS: The PRFs with medium, high and very high-risk levels are Workload, Lack of control over work and Workday. The RGIII presents adequate reliability with Cronbach's α, Alpha ordinal RHO and Omega of 0.93, 0.95 and 0.95, respectively. The EFA shows all five subscales maintain factor loadings greater than 0.43, although Leadership and relationships at work has better saturation values, and Work environment ended with only three items. The CFA indicates Leadership and work relationships with a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) goodness of fit index of 0.072.
CONCLUSION: The RGIII allows the identification and evaluation of the level of risk of PRFs. It complies with sufficient internal consistency. It does not have a clear factorial structure, because it does not meet the minimum values of goodness-of-fit indexes that would allow confirming the structure proposed in RGIII.",The authors would like to express their gratitude to the work centers and their employees for their trust and willingness to collaborate in this study.,None to report.,Work,,,"Male; Humans; Female; Reproducibility of Results; Mexico; Surveys and Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Workplace; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Psychometrics",2023-09-11,2023,2023-09-11,2023,76,1,189-203,Closed,Article,"Cano-Gutiérrez, Julio César; Olguín-Tiznado, Jesús Everardo; Camargo-Wilson, Claudia; Barreras, Juan Andrés López; García-Rivera, Blanca Rosa; García-Alcaráz, Jorge Luis","Cano-Gutiérrez, Julio César (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico); Olguín-Tiznado, Jesús Everardo (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico); Camargo-Wilson, Claudia (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico); Barreras, Juan Andrés López (Faculty of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico); García-Rivera, Blanca Rosa (Faculty of Administrative and Social Sciences, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico); García-Alcaráz, Jorge Luis (Departament of Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing, Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez, Ciudad Juárez, Mexico)","García-Alcaráz, Jorge Luis (Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez)","Cano-Gutiérrez, Julio César (Autonomous University of Baja California); Olguín-Tiznado, Jesús Everardo (Autonomous University of Baja California); Camargo-Wilson, Claudia (Autonomous University of Baja California); Barreras, Juan Andrés López (Autonomous University of Baja California); García-Rivera, Blanca Rosa (Autonomous University of Baja California); García-Alcaráz, Jorge Luis (Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155619979,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",

Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the fats of caiman fed with diets enriched with flaxseeds (Linus usitatissimun) rich in n-3 fatty acids, lignans and antioxidants. Caimans were fed six days a week with: a control diet (C), and a diet enriched with ground flaxseed = 90% C + 10% flaxseed ground (FS), during 30 (FS30) and 60 (FS60) days. Animals fed the flaxseed-enriched diets increased linolenic acid content and reduced the n-6/n-3 ratio of fats relative to controls, and this improvement increased over time. The proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid also increased, but there was no difference at the time the enriched diets were offered. Caiman fat of the FS30 and FS60, showed a decrease in lipoperoxidation (24% and 40%) and reactive oxygen species (44% and 76%) accompanied by an increase in antioxidant systems. Consumption of a flax-enriched diet by caimans increases the content of essential fatty acids and improves the lipoperoxidative status of fat. This provides an enriched fat with potential for the development products for human consumption.","The authors thank Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), and other members of the Proyecto Yacaré for their help and support.","This work was supported by CAI + D oriented 2016, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), PICT 2019 N°04300 (to Leiva), with the support of FUNDACIÓN NATURA, COMFAUNA and funding from GORDON AND BETTY MOORE FOUNDATION (GRANT 9258).",Tropical Animal Health and Production,,,"Humans; Animals; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Alligators and Crocodiles; Dietary Supplements; Flax; Diet; Fatty Acids; Animal Feed",2023-05-05,2023,2023-05-05,2023-06,55,3,194,Closed,Article,"Valli, Florencia E.; Leiva, Pamela M.L.; Lavandera, Jimena; Contini, María C.; Gerstner, Carolina; Piña, Carlos I.; Simoncini, Melina S.; González, Marcela A.","Valli, Florencia E.

CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man with a history of catatonia, refractory epilepsy and functional impairment, required frequent changes in his anticonvulsant and antipsychotic treatment, due to adverse effects. During 2019, in the month of July, clozapine was changed to amisulpride, in September he developed fever, muscle stiffness, stupor, diaphoresis and tachypnea over a two-week period; paraclinical tests showed elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and leukocytosis, so NMS was considered. The antipsychotic was withdrawn and he was treated with bromocriptine and biperiden, with a good response. Ten days after discharge, he began treatment with olanzapine, which generated a similar episode to the one described in December, with subsequent management and resolution.
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis is based on the use of drugs that alter dopamine levels, plus altered state of consciousness, fever, autonomic instability and paraclinical tests showing leukocytosis and elevated CPK. Differential diagnoses must be ruled out. Early diagnosis generally leads to total remission, although some patients will suffer complications, long-term sequelae or recurrences. The recurrence in this case derived from the early reintroduction of the neuroleptic after the first episode. Treatment should be individualised according to severity to avoid mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical antipsychotics are rarely suspected of generating NMS. Moreover, the time to reintroduction after an episode must also be taken into account.",,,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,Male; Humans; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome; Dopamine; Leukocytosis; Amisulpride,2023-01,2023,2023-04-06,2023-01,52,1,78-81,Closed,Article,"Mogollon Díaz, Johana Patricia; Lizcano Toloza, Linda Yurani; Serrano García, Angie Yarlady; Alquichire Luna, Camilo Andrés; García Bohorquez, Diego Fernando; Chaparro Durán, María Fernanda; Cáceres Valero, María Valentina","Mogollon Díaz, Johana Patricia (Departamento de Salud Mental, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia.); Lizcano Toloza, Linda Yurani (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia.

DESIGN: Systematic review and a meta-analysis.
SETTING: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, PEDro, Scielo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dialnet, Scopus, and MEDLINE from inception to November 2021.
PATIENTS: Patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.
INTERVENTIONS: Randomized controlled trials assessing motor control exercises versus inactive control, placebo or minimal intervention, and other exercises.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain intensity, disability, and physical activity were considered as primary outcomes.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 1356 patients were finally included in the systematic review, of which only 13 randomized clinical trials could be meta-analyzed. Statistically significant results were found in favor of the motor control group for the comparison with other exercises in disability at postintervention term (Mean Difference, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], -3.13 [-5.87 to -0.38], P = 0.03); for the comparison with inactive control, placebo, or minimal intervention in pain at postintervention term (MD, 95% CI, -18.10 [-30.79 to -5.41], P = 0.008); and for comparison with general exercises (MD, 95% CI, -12.70 [-20.80 to -4.60], P = 0.002).

These algorithms compute a link budget to define the data rate and the transmission power. However, the performance of these algorithms must be evaluated in industrial environments that pose challenging conditions to wireless communications due to obstacles, interference, and movement. Therefore, this article compares the performance of LoRaWAN with six different ADR algorithms using a realistic propagation model from an industrial environment. This research uses the framework for LoRa (FLoRa) environment in objective modular network testbed in C++ (Omnet) to compare the packet delivery ratio and energy consumption with different gateway locations and data traffic. Results show that the algorithms that decrease the link budget in poor channel conditions have better performance in industrial scenarios.

The proposed model introduces the use of the peak amplitude of the average horizontal-to-vertical ratio of the spectral response of the site obtained from earthquake records. The site effects model is implemented within a GMM estimated using ground-motion records from northern South America. The research compares the performance of the proposed site function with other formulations based on V S30 or site predominant period. This approach yields a smaller within-event variability than alternative methodologies, providing confidence for the reliability of the proposed site classification scheme as a viable alternative for the estimation of site effects, especially for sites for which V S30 measurements are not available.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the special cooperation agreement #03 of 2020 between the Colombian Geological Survey, and Fundación Universidad del Norte (SCOA#03-2020-SGC-UNINORTE).",Earthquake Spectra,,,,2023-02-25,2023,2023-02-25,2023-05,39,2,1109-1139,Closed,Article,"Mercado, Vicente; Pajaro, Cesar A; Arteta, Carlos A; Díaz, Fernando J; Montejo, Julián; Arcila, Mónica; Abrahamson, Norman A","Mercado, Vicente (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pajaro, Cesar A (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arteta, Carlos A (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Díaz, Fernando J (Colombian Geological Survey (SGC), Bogota, Colombia); Montejo, Julián (Colombian Geological Survey (SGC), Bogota, Colombia); Arcila, Mónica (Colombian Geological Survey (SGC), Bogota, Colombia); Abrahamson, Norman A (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA)","Mercado, Vicente (Universidad del Norte)","Mercado, Vicente (Universidad del Norte); Pajaro, Cesar A (Universidad del Norte); Arteta, Carlos A (Universidad del Norte); Díaz, Fernando J (Colombian Geological Survey); Montejo, Julián (Colombian Geological Survey); Arcila, Mónica (Colombian Geological Survey); Abrahamson, Norman A (University of California, Berkeley)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155743363,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Several prediction models have been developed worldwide to predict the dynamic modulus from aggregate, binder, and mixture properties with corresponding frequency and temperature. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction models have shown better accuracy than regression-based models. In this study, two ANN-based prediction models were developed for the Colombian hot-mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures. One model (W-ANN) has similar input variables as the Witczak model, and the other model (H-ANN) has similar input variables as the Hirsch model. The ANN-based dynamic modulus prediction models were trained, validated, and tested using 972 data points. The coefficient of determination (R2), RMS error (RMSE), absolute average error (AAE), and Se/Sy indicated that the two ANN-based models performed better than the previous models. The W-ANN had slightly better performance than the H-ANN model. The parameters for both ANN-based models are reported to reproduce dynamic modulus values for future use and testing with high accuracy. A standalone closed-form equation was extracted from each ANN model, which makes the developed models easier for and more accessible to practitioners. Sensitivity analysis showed that both models are sensitive to binder and mixture properties. These models can be utilized in Colombia for the existing and future development of pavement design packages, and will reduce the necessity of extensive testing in the future.","The authors confirm their contribution to the paper as follows: study conception and design: M.

OBJECTIVE: This research aims to analyse the teleworking management practices to subside organizations and leaders to improve their performance and enhance workers quality of life.
METHODS: A survey was carried out with teleworkers to obtain their perception of the analyzed factors, using the survey monkey tool. The collected data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).
RESULTS: The validated model for the practices analysis is composed of the constructs: business management, physical and people infrastructure, leadership, self-esteem, and job satisfaction. Based on the analysis carried out, it is suggested that organizations establish organizational telework policies, follow government policies and provide communication and competence plans. Moreover, it is crucial providing technologies and support to them and develop people management practices in teleworking. Leaders must provide confidence, a teleworking culture, professional advancement, integration, well-being, negotiation of goals and a training plan. The teleworker's satisfaction is due to the sustainability related to the work model and its choice defined by personal motivation, balance between personal and professional life and a sense of belonging.

The aim of this study is to assess the genetic association between VDR polymorphisms: TaqI, ApaI, Bsml and FokI and SLE with serum levels of Vitamin D in the Colombian Caribbean population. Method Case and control study. One hundred and thirty-three patients with SLE and 100 healthy individuals were included. VDR polymorphism were genotyped by RT-PCR and Taqman® probes. Allelic, genotypic and haplotype associations were estimated. Serum vitamin D concentrations were quantified by Elisa. Values of 30 to 100 ng/ml were established as a normal reference range. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. Results A high prevalence of SLE was observed in women (94%) and was associated with a higher risk of SLE [OR: 10.8; 95% CI: 4.7–24.6] (p < .05). Moreover, higher risk of SLE was observed in individuals with FokI VDR [rs2228570] [OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.05−2.36] in allelic models.

To determine the prevalence and factors associated with the usage of electronic cigarettes and hookahs in Colombian adolescents. Secondary analysis of data from one study aimed to determine the prevalence of traditional cigarette use (Emtamplona Study). The adolescents were considered consumers if he/she claimed to have consumed at least one cigarette or used a hookah and/or electronic cigarette during the last 30 days. A self-administered and anonymous questionnaire was answered by 812 adolescents aged 14 ± 2 years (438 women). The prevalence of electronic cigarette and hookah use was 1.8% (95%CI 0.9%–2.7%) and 2.8% (95%CI 1.8%–4.1%), respectively. A logistic regression analysis showed that traditional cigarette consumption was associated (OR 10.46, 95%CI 3.64–30.97) with electronic cigarette use. On the other hand, being in sixth-seventh grade (OR 5.19 95%CI 1.08–25.01) and belonging to a private school (OR 10.54 95%CI 3.95–28.13), smoking (OR 15.38 95%CI 3.45–68.62) was associated with hookah use.

1886,pub.1156189626,10.1109/tla.2023.10068854,,,Design of a wearable device for respiratory rate monitoring and detection of anomalous values,"Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a persistent reduction in airflow. Symptoms gradually worsen and shortness of breath, dyspnea, increases over time to even appear at rest. Regarding measurement technology, spirometry is the reference standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of said condition. This test requires specialized equipment that does not allow it to be performed on an outpatient basis or for constant monitoring. For this reason, the doctor must systematically look for the presence of symptoms that may go unnoticed by the patient and that can be attributed to age, sedentary lifestyle, or the fact of smoking. Also, prolonged expiration in the trachea during a maximum forced effort can be useful in the early diagnosis of obstruction or when spirometry is not available, which is why it would be important to be able to constantly monitor breathing in order to increase the probability of identifying possible COPD at an early stage. The solution proposed in this article is focused on the design and implementation of a wearable device that allows the monitoring of the respiratory rate. This device will allow this biometric variable to be identified and will notify when it is outside the normal ranges to suggest an airflow test (spirometry) at a possible early stage of the disease. This instrumentation system will be integrated into the frame of a pair of glasses, specifically positioning the sensor on the nasal platelets.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2023-03-14,2023,2023-03-14,,21,3,513-518,Closed,Article,"Narducci, Margarita; Aya, Juan Manuel","Narducci, Margarita (Universidad del Norte); Aya, Juan Manuel (Universidad Javeriana)",,"Narducci, Margarita (Universidad del Norte); Aya, Juan Manuel (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156189626,40 Engineering,

Attachment theory-based interventions (Bowlby, J. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 130(3), 201–210, 1977) that promote maternal sensitivity have shown promising results in improving nurturing environments and increasing attachment in children. However, there are no program validations with participants in socio-economic conditions of psychosocial risk. We present the design and validation of a maternal sensitivity program to promote attachment in children in Colombia’s psychosocial risk context. We follow the guidelines of the Medical Research Council (MRC) (2000) and apply the phases of theoretical review, preliminary modeling of the intervention, validation by expert judges, and pilot test. Kendall’s W test showed adequate asymptotic significance on the judges’ criteria, and their comments allowed us to improve the initial design. We applied the program adjusted to six mother–child dyads, demonstrating the increase generated in the sensitivity and children’s secure base behavior variables. We discuss the applications of the program and its benefits in countries with vulnerable populations.","The authors thank the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, MINCIENCIAS and the Universidad del Norte (Colombia).","Research sponsored by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia, MINCIENCIAS and Universidad del Norte (Colombia).",Trends in Psychology,,,,2023-03-14,2023,2023-03-14,,,,1-20,Closed,Article,"de Jesús Ossa Henao, Yomar; Trejos Herrera, Ana María; Gutierrez Carvajal, Oscar Iván; Molina Machado, Diana Carolina; Ocampo Dávila, Julieth","de Jesús Ossa Henao, Yomar (Universidad del Norte (Colombia), Calle 55 N. 40-15 Apto. 1501 Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia); Trejos Herrera, Ana María (Department of Psychology of the Universidad del Norte, Kilómetro 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gutierrez Carvajal, Oscar Iván (Department of Psychology of the Universidad del Norte, Kilómetro 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Molina Machado, Diana Carolina (Minuto de Dios University Corporation, Uniminuto, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia); Ocampo Dávila, Julieth (Minuto de Dios University Corporation, Uniminuto, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia)","de Jesús Ossa Henao, Yomar (Universidad del Norte)","de Jesús Ossa Henao, Yomar (Universidad del Norte); Trejos Herrera, Ana María (Universidad del Norte); Gutierrez Carvajal, Oscar Iván (Universidad del Norte); Molina Machado, Diana Carolina (Minuto de Dios University Corporation, Uniminuto, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia); Ocampo Dávila, Julieth (Minuto de Dios University Corporation, Uniminuto, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156184898,52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The objective function minimises social costs, including private logistics costs (fares, travel times, transhipment) and external costs. In addition, the proposed approach uses a multinomial logit model as a demand function to incorporate consumer stochastic behaviour when choosing a route and location. The model was applied to the multimodal Colombian freight network. Results show that the social costs of logistics networks are reduced by including terminals that encourage intermodality.

The used methodology included the characterization of base metal, the development of welded joints using two different heat inputs, the microhardness profiles analysis on the cross section of the welded joint, and the microstructural evolution using microscopy. The above-mentioned measurements were complemented with residual stress evaluation using the x-ray diffraction technique, together with analysis of transversal and longitudinal tensile tests of the welded joints. The obtained results in welded joints indicated that yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility behavior have been influenced by heat input compared to base metal and reported values for similar alloys. Residual stress results showed that both the weld metal and adjacent coarse grain zone were subjected to tensile stresses, while the refined grain zone (FGZ) and base metal adjacent to the FGZ were subjected to compressive stresses. Additionally, the magnitude of residual stresses was smaller than maximum tensile stresses, and its behavior was related to both heat input and mechanical properties along welding regions.","The authors would like to gratitude to Universidad del Norte, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, COTECMAR, SENA- Centro Colombo Alemán, and CNPEM/ABTLuS as well as its Laboratório Nacional de Nanotecnologia - LNNano in Campinas, Brazil, for their financial and logistical support to the project.",,Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance,,,,2023-12-28,2023,2023-12-28,2024-04,33,8,3912-3919,Closed,Article,"Niebles-Nuñez, Enrique Esteban; Unfried-Silgado, Jimy; Torres-Salcedo, Jaime Elías; Ramírez, Antonio J.","Niebles-Nuñez, Enrique Esteban (Programa de Ingeniería Mecánica, Facultad de ingeniería, Grupo de investigación IMTEF, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, 080020, Barranquilla, Colombia); Unfried-Silgado, Jimy (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Grupo de investigación ICT, Universidad de Córdoba, 230002, Montería, Colombia); Torres-Salcedo, Jaime Elías (Programa de Doctorado en Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, 081001, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ramírez, Antonio J.

For example, while the VAC study in Lesotho in 2018 showed low incidence rates of emotional violence (6.9 % Females, 3.8 % Males), the average prevalence recorded by the MIC study was as high as 57.8 % for females and 59.2 % for males. On average, the MIC studies displayed a higher incidence and the discrepancy of prevalence of emotional abuse between females and males was small. Calculating a pooled estimate of the prevalence was not possible, due to the heterogeneity of the data.
CONCLUSIONS: In general countries displayed a high prevalence. A standardized use of a uniform definition of emotional abuse might help to display a more homogenous data set in the future, giving the opportunity for pooled estimates of prevalence.",,,Child Abuse & Neglect,,,Male; Female; Adolescent; Humans; Child; Emotional Abuse; Violence; Africa South of the Sahara; Sexual Behavior; Prevalence,2023-03-31,2023,2023-03-31,2023-06,140,,106155,Closed,Article,"Kurtz, M; Kawka, H; Horstick, O; Brenner, S; Deckert, A; Louis, V R; Winkler, V; Lowery Wilson, M; Bärnighausen, T; Dambach, P","Kurtz, M (University Heidelberg, Germany.

Additionally, self-reflection is a powerful tool to observe the development of abstract concepts such as these. This qualitative exploratory study examined the extent to which university students in Colombia enhanced their critical consciousness and a sense of active citizenship through projects focused on cases of violence against social leaders in their region. During the project, 93 students in four academic cohorts wrote a total of 155 reflections related to their experiences. These were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with the AtlasTi software. The results evidenced a shift in students’ critical consciousness including a deeper understanding, a recognition of significance, an acknowledgement of privilege, and an awareness of the connection between local and global issues in relation to the topic of the project. In addition, traits of active citizenship were observed such as a sense of collective responsibility, a desire to contribute, a sense of empowerment, and growth in empathy. This research demonstrates the potential for authentic locally based project topics for developing active citizenship and enhancing critical consciousness as well as reinforcing the potential for reflections to demonstrate such development.",,,Reflective Practice,,,,2023-05-11,2023,2023-05-11,2023-09-03,24,5,591-603,Closed,Article,"Keogh, Conor; Corrales, Kathleen A.","Keogh, Conor (Foreign Languages Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corrales, Kathleen A.

However, the extent of monitoring systems is usually limited by their elevated cost and complex use and maintenance. This paper presents the development and testing of a new low-cost and versatile instrument for measuring water column pressure in dynamic environments. This instrument -named BlueLog- can measure gravity waves, tides, and water levels in various aquatic environments due to its versatile temporal resolution from 1 to 10 Hz. It can also be used for wave flumes experiments in the laboratory. Among its outstanding characteristics, BlueLog is configured in open-source language, its batteries are rechargeable and commercially available, includes a modular housing that allows replacing the pressure sensor in case of damage, and a set of LED lights indicates the status of communication, configuration, and sampling. As demonstrated here by a set of laboratory and field tests, BlueLog is ready and open to be validated in different scientific and technical applications.

The adsorption energy of the impurity adatoms in their stable position ranged from −1.46 eV for Te to −4 .44 eV for Pt. Regarding the atomic substitution, Pt impurities exhibited the highest stability in the intermediate position, with a formation energy of −150.5 meV , followed by Sn with a formation energy of −90.40 meV . We further investigated the impact of atomic impurities on the electronic properties of the material and found that the bandgap energy was significantly reduced, resulting in a semiconductor-to-metal transition. These results highlight the effectiveness of defect engineering for electronic band tuning. Furthermore, we discovered that a selenium monolayer with substitution of an Sn or Te atom in the intermediate layer exhibits a maximum value of the dimensionless figure of merit (including electronic and phononic contributions) of 0.51 and 0.52, respectively, while the clean selenium monolayer has a maximum value of Z T = 0 . 43 . These finding suggest that selenium monolayer with Sn defects could be a promising thermoelectric materials that offer an alternative for recovering waste heat and transforming it into electricity.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The characterization and mechanical models obtained are used to predict the elastic behavior of a prosthetic foot and the failure of a prosthetic knee manufactured with FFF.   Design/methodology/approach Tension tests were carried out and the elastic modulus, yield stress and tensile strength were evaluated for different material directions. The material elastic constants were determined and the influence of infill density in the mechanical strength was evaluated. Yield surfaces and failure criteria were generated from the tests. Failures over prosthetic elements in tridimensional stresses were analyzed; the cases were evaluated via finite element method.   Findings The experimental results show that the material is transversely isotropic. The elasticity modulus, yield stress and ultimate tensile strength vary linearly with the infill density. The stresses and the failure criteria were computed and compared with the experimental tests with good agreement.   Practical implications This research can be applied to predict failures and improve reliability in FFF or fused deposition modeling (FDM) products for applications in high-performance industries such as aerospace, automotive and medical.   Social implications This research aims to promote its widespread adoption in the industrial and medical sectors by increasing reliability in products manufactured with AM based on the failure criterion.   Originality/value Most of the models studied apply to plane stress situations and standardized specimens of printed material. However, the models applied in this study can be used for functional parts and three-dimensional stress, with accuracy in the range of that obtained by other researchers. The researchers also proposed a method for the mechanical study of fragile materials fabricated by processes of FFF and FDM.","The authors acknowledge William Fuentes for his advice during the Continuous Media Mechanics course of the PhD in Mechanical Engineering of the Universidad del Norte.

We analyzed the 2015-2021 collection of twenty-six award winning books for younger children. We found at least ten pathways of peacemaking that families engage in through their multimodal literacy practices. Drawing on family-centric peacemaking episodes, we present analytically rich portraits of how peacemaking unfolds at textual, ideational, and interpersonal levels across time, space, and generations.

FMR1 alleles are classified as normal (N), intermediate (I), premutation (PM), and full mutation (FM). FXS patients often carry an FM, but size mosaicism can occur. Additionally, loss of methylation boundary upstream of repeats results in de novo methylation spreading to FMR1 promoter in FXS patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This pilot study investigated the methylation boundary and adjacent regions in 66 males with typical and atypical FXS aged 1 to 30 years (10.86 ± 6.48 years). AmplideX FMR1 mPCR kit was used to discriminate allele profiles and methylation levels. CpG sites were assessed by pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: 40 out of 66 FXS patients (60.6%) showed an exclusive FM (n = 40), whereas the remaining (n = 26) exhibited size mosaicism [10 PM_FM (15.15%); 10 N_FM (15.15%); 2 N_PM_FM (3%)]. Four patients (6.1%) had deletions near repeats. Noteworthy, a CpG within FMR1 intron 2 displayed hypomethylation in FXS patients and hypermethylation in controls, demonstrating remarkable specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy when a methylation threshold of 69.5% was applied.

However, methodologies for quantifying these impacts and strategies to minimize them are still in need of development. In this study, we assessed the coastal response to a WEC array on the La Guajira coast in the Colombian Caribbean using a two-step numerical strategy. We used the Delft-3D model to estimate the wave field, which was then transferred to the XBeach model to compute morphological changes. This modelling strategy was applied to three WEC array layouts and compared the morphological responses in terms of the distance and relative orientation of the WEC array to the coast. The results showed that the impact of the simulated WEC array on the beach response varied significantly depending on its distance from the coast, the configuration of the array, and its orientation. These findings highlight the need for further research to develop effective strategies for minimizing coastal erosion impacts on coastal ecosystems through innovative alternatives. Developing such strategies will be crucial to ensure the sustainable implementation of WEC arrays and other renewable energy technologies near the coast.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Yeison Berrio reports financial support was provided by Colombian Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation.

However, the fault location methods formulation presents great challenges for these types of networks because the operating changes that occur them, such as changes in topology, DER connection/disconnection and microgrids operating modes. Several fault location solutions have been proposed; nevertheless, these are strongly dependent on robust communication systems. This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based master–slave strategy for the estimation of the fault section in active distribution networks and microgrids using dispersed measurements. The strategy is composed by two stages. The master stage uses a genetic algorithm that determines the location and number of devices which maximize the faulted location e performance. The slave stage uses artificial neural networks to predict the fault section by using local voltage and current measurements trough an intelligent electronic device (IED). This approach is useful because it neglects the need of a robust communication systems and synchronization process between measurements. Here, each IED estimates the faulted section and then sends it through the single communication system to the distribution system operator control center. The presented method is validated on the modified IEEE 34-nodes test feeder where the accuracy of the strategy was 95%. The results obtained and its easy implementation indicate potential for real-life applications.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTEI del sistema general de regalías SGR, and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación - COLCIENCIAS (now Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - Minciencias) by call contest ‘‘Convocatoria 809 de 2018: Formación de capital humano de alto nivel para las regiones - Atlántico ’’ and ‘‘Convocatoria 852 - Conectando conocimiento de 2019’’ – Project Integra2023, code 111085271060, contract 80740-774-2020.",,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,148,,108923,Closed,Article,"la Ossa, J.

Its pathogenesis is attributed to multiple factors, being the increase in sebum production and the alteration in the quality of sebum lipids, one of the main ones, in addition to follicular hyperkeratinization, inflammatory processes, and Cutibacterium acnes proliferation. Acne management is usually combined and varies according to the severity of the disease, from topical treatments with retinoids, topical and oral antibiotics, combined oral contraceptives in women, the use of isotretinoin in severe cases and laser to manage sequelae and scars. There is now evidence indicating that the use of botulinum toxin (intradermal and intramuscular) significantly decreases sebum production and excretion, contributes to the appearance of pores, reduces inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions and improves skin quality, which may be promising for the treatment of acne-prone oily skin.

To efficiently implement RED on a larger scale, pretreatment units are critical in limiting fouling effects, providing a path to increased energy density and overall efficiency. This paper aims to review the significance of water pretreatment in RED systems by increasing the power density. An analysis of the existing literature was performed in the SCOPUS database by Boolean Operators. Throughout this research, we observed pretreatment is one of the most critical phases for RED systems. Besides, many scientists are investigating ways to remove natural organic matter and scaling from water since previous studies have identified their adverse effects on power generation. Conventional pretreatment has proven to be enough to assist RED systems, but up to 45.6 % power density increase has been reported through non-conventional water pretreatment. Still, cost-effectiveness analyses, specific parameters, and acceptable thresholds to evaluate the RED applications' economic viability are lacking in the literature. Water pretreatment has immense potential for increasing RED performance, and ongoing studies are focused on developing them and scaling up to commercial scales.",Declaration of competing interest The authors have no relevant financial or non-financial interests to disclose.,"This research was funded with resources from ‘PATRIMONIO AUTÓNOMO FONDO NACIONAL DE FINANCIAMIENTO PARA LA CIENCIA, LA TECNOLOGÍA Y LA INNOVACIÓN FRANCISCO JOSÉ DE CALDAS’ by ‘Ministerio de Ciencias, tecnología e innovación de Colombia (MINCIENCIAS)’ developed under the contingent reclamation financing agreement No. 80740-538-2020.",Journal of Water Process Engineering,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,56,,104548,Closed,Article,"Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo; Maturana-Córdoba, Aymer; Fernández-Rojano, Stefany","Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maturana-Córdoba, Aymer (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fernández-Rojano, Stefany (Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Mejía-Marchena, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Maturana-Córdoba, Aymer (Universidad del Norte); Fernández-Rojano, Stefany (Universidad del Norte)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165982939,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

As a result, firms developed innovations with a social focus that contributes to solving these challenges. These occur in an economy of rapid, uncertain, and unprecedented change. Therefore, flexible enterprises and a theoretical framework are required to guide managerial decision-making. The innovations with a social focus have unique and distinctive characteristics determined by a group of factors related to the firm (internal) and its context (external); the study on these factors needs to be more conclusive and is still debatable. This paper used a structured approach through a systematic literature review to examine the factors that can influence the development of this type of innovation. Findings reveal that research in this area has an upward trend and quantitative approach predominates. The theory of resources and capabilities and the institutional have highlighted as theoretical references. There is a strong orientation toward environmental issues and a notable orientation toward the analysis of developed countries. The research also revealed that internal and external factors, and the agents' motivations, simultaneously affect the development of innovations with a social focus.

1628,pub.1166407817,10.1177/14647001231209902,,,Domestic service and Chilean literature: fictional experiments in narrating the household,"This article shines light on the interconnectedness of reproductive labour and Latin American literature through two Chilean novels that explore the relationship between peripheral capitalism and domestic servitude: José Donoso's The Obscene Bird of Night and Diamela Eltit's Mano de Obra. The study of these texts allows for a periodisation of the reproductive sphere under different phases of capitalist accumulation, and exposes an association between the literary treatment of domestic service and the achievement of highly experimental narratives in Latin America. My reading of Obscene goes beyond viewing this novel as postmodernist fiction, by showing how its nightmarish poetics are a consequence of the transformation of the oligarchic household vis-a-vis the collapse of systems of bonded labour in the 1960s. Whereas the prose of Obscene provides a harrowing descent into the intimate connections between master and servant at the moment of their decline, Mano de Obra unveils a surgical prose capable of expressing the new impersonality of social reproduction in the subsequent neoliberal period. Of special interest to this analysis is how Eltit suggests that even the proletariat household can recreate exploitative patterns of domestic servitude to guard against complete immiseration. Three main conclusions result from this reading. First, Latin American fiction is an important literary archive from which capitalism's exploitation of the reproductive sphere can be excavated. Second, Latin American literature shows formal uniqueness when representing domestic service in the periphery. Lastly, fictional representations of domestic service help us understand the institution not as remnant of previous modes of production, but as capitalist strategy for the reproduction of social forces that underpay the cost of life-making processes.",,,Feminist Theory,,,,2023-11-26,2023,2023-11-26,2024-04,25,2,162-174,Closed,Article,"Sánchez-Russo, Daniella","Sánchez-Russo, Daniella (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Sánchez-Russo, Daniella (Universidad del Norte)","Sánchez-Russo, Daniella (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166407817,"44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

This article systematically reviews sixty-seven studies spanning 2009 to 2023, concentrating on technologies for locating survivors within land-based disaster contexts. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, the review delineates the literature landscape, unveiling unmanned vehicles, radars, wireless sensors, smartphones, and Wi-Fi as prominent modalities. Significant challenges include limited actual-physical world validation, on-site deployment logistics, reliance on communication infrastructure, and power consumption. Nevertheless, innovative strategies such as multi-sensory integration and on-site processing using TinyML, exhibit the potential to reduce these limitations, signifying promising opportunities for future research. The conclusions take a practical perspective, excluding less mature technologies unsuited for early physical world implementation, given the prevalence of studies based on unrealistic assumptions—a major criticism of the literature. In terms of contributions, a conceptual framework, the Ground Disaster Information Management System, is introduced. This framework accentuates the importance of emerging technologies and communication protocols for efficient deployment and standardized data exchange. Ultimately, by synthesizing merits, constraints, and knowledge gaps, this review discerns challenges in survivor detection while underscoring technology-driven resolutions to enhance rescue operations. These encompass pragmatic paradigms for sensing, computation, communication, and coordination, targeting device deployment, in-situ sensors, communication systems, multi-sensory modalities, and augmented autonomy.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Angelo Joseph Soto Vergel reports financial support was provided by Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia.

Our analysis points that the MnC 4 monolayer stabilizes at extremely rich C conditions. Also, the MnC 4 monolayer possess positive phonon branches, evidencing its dynamic stability. Further, it confirms that this monolayer is also stable up to 300 K. This new monolayer has an antiferromagnetic alignment with spin‐channels along the [‐110] direction and metallic behavior, being a strong candidate in the formation of exchange‐biased systems when forming a van der Waals heterojunction with other Ferromagnetic materials.","Acknowledgements The authors thank DGAPA‐UNAM projects IA100822, IN105722, and IN101523, and Conacyt project A1‐S‐9010 for partial financial support.

1499,pub.1163084772,10.1111/jasp.13006,,,Tertiary transfer effect (TTE) of contact with sexual minorities in a sample of Colombian heterosexual and gay participants,"Abstract  Contact with sexually diverse people predicts attitude transformation towards the whole group membership (i.e., the primary transfer effect) and may potentially generalize to other group memberships (i.e., The secondary transfer effect). However, the effect of contact may extend beyond this known attitudinal transformation, comprising also cognitive growth and likely impact other types of psychological outcomes or Tertiary Transfer Effect (TTE). This study used a cross‐sectional design with a convenient sample of respondents of gay ( N = 320) and heterosexual ( N = 320) sexual orientation to test whether the relationship between contact with sexual minorities and well‐being was accounted for by positive stereotype content and cognitive flexibility. Mediation analyses corroborated a small but significant indirect effect of positive stereotype content and cognitive flexibility sequentially, within the relationship between contact and well‐being, both in heterosexual and gay participants. Thus, partially supporting the hypothesized TTE of contact in this sample. The study of TTE is still in its infancy, future research would benefit from exploring the effect of contact as a promising tool to promote psychological well‐being in both parts involved within the social exchange. It may be profitable for anti‐prejudice efforts to incorporate this generalization principle to expand the reach of inclusion programs targeting sexual minorities.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to all the participants who donated their time to participate in this study.

These parameters were energy absorption capacity ( g ) and strain at peak stress ( ε p c ) under uniaxial tension. This purpose was achieved using importance analyses of input variables and partial dependence plots (PDPs). The numerical models were developed using the R statistical language and 34 input variables, 600 observation databases, including 50 experimental results. Direct tensile tests were conducted on 46 dogbone specimens to verify the prediction capacity of both the model and the results obtained from the PDP analysis. The tests were carried out in accordance with the JSCE recommendations for eighteen UHPC series resulting from the combination of two cementitious matrices with compressive strengths of 124 and 156 MPa and three-fiber monofiber reinforced systems at three volumetric dosage levels (i.e., 1%,2%, and 3%). The findings indicated that it is more likely to reach exceptional values of the considered responses ( ε p c ≥0.3% and g ≥50 kJ/m3) when using deformed high-strength steel macro fibers than with another type. Additionally, g rose with the compressive strength value. Nevertheless, the ε p c value decreased with the increase of the cementitious matrix compressive strength up to the value of 190 MPa, after which the trend is reversed, and ε p c presents exponential growth due to the improvement in the adherence between the matrix and the fiber caused by the enhancement of the matrix microstructure.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We report on the behavior of NdFeB magnet samples exposed to four different acid media for digestion. NdFeB magnets are becoming a significant source of neodymium, a rare-earth element critical to many technologies and a potential substitute for traditional mining of the element. To address this, we meticulously tested nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and citric acid, all at a concentration of 1.6 M, as economical and environmentally friendly alternatives to the concentrated mineral acids commonly used in the leaching of these materials. The pivotal stage involves the initial characterization of samples in the solid state using SEM-EDX and XPS analysis to obtain their initial composition. Subsequently, the samples are dissolved in the four aforementioned acids. Finally, neodymium is quantified using ICP-OES. Throughout our investigation, we evaluated some analytical parameters to determine the best candidate for performing the digestion, including time, limits of detection and quantification, accuracy, recovery of spike samples, and robustness. After careful consideration, we unequivocally conclude that 1.6 M nitric acid stands out as the optimal choice for dissolving NdFeB magnet samples, with the pretreatment of the samples being the critical aspect of this report.",,"R.C. and D.V. thank project UCN19101 for financial support.

As WMA technology, Iterlow T (a chemical additive) was selected. For both types of asphalt mixtures, the RCA dosages of 0, 15, 30 and 45% by weight of coarse aggregates were considered. Notably, four different RCA sources were assessed, and the alkali-silica reaction and attached mortar quantity were analyzed for each one. In order to examine the effect of the coarse RCA on the performance-related properties of the asphalt mixtures, a test protocol was conducted. This protocol comprised four tests, i.e., stiffness modulus, moisture susceptibility, rutting resistance, and fatigue life. Additionality, a sustainability-criteria verification was performed employing the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) methodologies. Respectively, the LCA and LCCA estimate each alternative's environmental impacts and production costs. Consequently, the main finding obtained were: (i) as the coarse RCA content increases, asphalt mixtures exhibit a reduction in their mechanical performance; (ii) the performance-related properties of the HMAs and WMAs with a 15% RCA dosage are acceptable, but more elevated amounts generate highly noticeable deterioration; and (iii) 15% of coarse RCA minimizes the environmental burdens and maximizes the cost-effectiveness of the asphalt mixtures fabrication. Thus, the main contribution to the literature that achieves this research is to perform a comprehensive multi-criteria examination on the potential of the RCA as a recycled material to minimize the depletion of non-renewable resources.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1394,pub.1167258628,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.123157,38142808,,Spatial distribution of microplastics in a coastal upwelling region: Offshore dispersal from urban sources in the Humboldt Current System,"In coastal waters, higher concentrations of microplastics (MPs) are generally related to densely populated and industrialized areas, but intense upwelling and offshore transport in the Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) may influence this pattern. The Humboldt Current System (HCS) along the coast of northern-central Chile represents a perfect model to test whether the abundance of MP at the sea surface decreases with distance from land-based sources, e.g., river mouths, harbors, and submarine wastewater outfalls. The sea surface was sampled with a manta trawl to examine the abundance, composition, and distribution of floating MPs, and Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were performed to examine the relationship between MP abundance (particles km-2) and the distance to putative sources. MPs were found in all 57 net tows, with an average of ⁓120,000 MP km-2 and maximum values of ⁓1,500,000 MP km-2. The composition of MPs was dominated by fragments (>50% of the total count) and over 80% of all MPs were ≥1 mm. The combined effect of the various sources, spatially concentrated in urban areas, makes it difficult to distinguish their relative contributions, but the MP composition suggested that rivers are more important sources, followed by submarine wastewater outfalls and then harbors. A significant and steep negative relationship with the ""distance to source"" explained 15.2% of the variance of ""MP abundance"", suggesting rapid offshore displacement within the HCS. This is the first study to report this pattern along the edges of the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG), revealing that continuous offshore transport of microplastic from land-based sources is occurring over large scales and contributing to the accumulation of microplastics in the center of the SPSG. However, the findings additionally suggested that processes at meso- and submeso-spatial scales (driven by geographic and seasonal variables) are disrupting the general pattern.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Martin thiel reports financial support was provided by Catholic University of the North Coquimbo Campus. 8.

Initially, a general sequence of logical steps is presented to carry out the design process from the displacement requirements and the kinematic constraints of the system. Once this sequence has been defined, the effect of saturation on the required force, speed, acceleration, power, and energy consumption in drives for manufacturing robots in pick-and-place applications is investigated, focusing on generic robot system that move a constant inertia load and are not equipped with regenerative devices. A set of methods is proposed for the choice of this saturation, among which are thumb rules, analytical methods, and graphical methods. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through its application in a case study. It was determined that by not applying the proposed methodology in the case study, the required power and energy consumption increased by more than 15.7% and 100%, respectively, with respect to the optimum values.",,,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,2023-04,125,9-10,4309-4319,Closed,Article,"Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez; Ramírez, Heriberto Enrique Maury; Manotas, Victor Javier Pugliese","Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez (Mechatronics Engineering Department, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ramírez, Heriberto Enrique Maury (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Colombia); Manotas, Victor Javier Pugliese (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Colombia)","Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez (Universidad Simón Bolívar)","Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Ramírez, Heriberto Enrique Maury (Universidad del Norte); Manotas, Victor Javier Pugliese (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155192532,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

However, due to the high contents of cement and silica fume usually necessaries for achieving this packing density, UHPC's final cost and carbon-footprint are far higher than standard concretes. Therefore, over the last few years, the spotlight of UHPC’s research has focused sharply on the analysis of locally available supplementary cementitious materials as partial replacement of cement and silica fume. This article presents an investigation to analyze the effect of rice husk ash (RHA) as partial substitution of cement in a previously optimized mixture of recycled-glass-UHPC by means of several statistical tools. Cementitious materials employed in this research involved silica fume, limestone powder, recycled glass powder and ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Based on the results, it can be concluded that RHA addition in the optimized glass UPHC yields to a significant decrease in the workability of concrete and a slight decrease of compressive strength. Results also demonstrated the high interaction between the RHA and water contents, which could be ascribed to the water absorption and internal curing provided by RHA particles.",Special thanks to Cementos Argos SA for donating most of the materials used in the research described herein.

The model is based on partial differential equations, and takes into account seven sub-populations which are, concretely, susceptible, exposed, infected (asymptomatic or symptomatic), quarantined, recovered and vaccinated individuals along with migration. The goal is to propose and analyze an efficient computer method which resembles the dynamical properties of the epidemiological model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A non-local approach is utilized for finding approximate solutions for the mathematical model. To that end, a non-standard finite-difference technique is introduced. The finite-difference scheme is a linearly implicit model which may be rewritten using a suitable matrix. Under suitable circumstances, the matrices representing the methodology are M-matrices.
RESULTS: Analytically, the local asymptotic stability of the constant solutions is investigated and the next generation matrix technique is employed to calculate the reproduction number. Computationally, the dynamical consistency of the method and the numerical efficiency are investigated rigorously. The method is thoroughly examined for its convergence, stability, and consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: The theoretical analysis of the method shows that it is able to maintain the positivity of its solutions and identify equilibria. The method's local asymptotic stability properties are similar to those of the continuous system. The analysis concludes that the numerical model is convergent, stable and consistent, with linear order of convergence in the temporal domain and quadratic order of convergence in the spatial variables. A computer implementation is used to confirm the mathematical properties, and it confirms the ability in our scheme to preserve positivity, and identify equilibrium solutions and their local asymptotic stability.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.

 The Fe 2 O 3 /NiO nanocomposite was prepared through facile mixing of pure Fe 2 O 3 and NiO nanoparticles. Pure metal oxides were synthesized by the glycine aided hydrothermal method. The crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly show that the NiO nanospheres were homogeneously distributed on Fe 2 O 3 nanoplates. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra reveal that functionalization by glycine induces carboxylic and amino groups on the surface of nanoparticles. The optical properties such as light absorption behavior and band gap of the Fe 2 O 3 /NiO nanocomposite were determined by UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS UV-Vis). The roxarsone (ROX) sensing behavior of the Fe 2 O 3 /NiO nanocomposite was evaluated by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) – photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) that allowed quantitative sensing of the ROX@Fe 2 O 3 /NiO complex. The photoacoustic signals of ROX were clearly observed in the FTIR-PAS spectra, particularly in the range of 1700 to 1000 cm −1 without spectral interference from the composite. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square (PLS) regression models were applied to calibrate and validate ROX quantification. The PLS model exhibited the best performance in predicting the ROX concentration through ROX@Fe 2 O 3 /NiO samples. This proof of concept suggests that the Fe 2 O 3 /NiO nanocomposite has improved adsorption and spectral features by FTIR-PAS for sensing of organometallic compounds such as ROX.","RS acknowledges the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), Santiago, Chile, for financial assistance in the form of a post-doctoral fellowship (Fondecyt project no: 3160499) and the doctoral scholarship of Ángela Álvarez (CONICYT no. 21161209).

A total of 20 different types of asphalt mixtures were comparatively evaluated and divided into two groups, namely: one group for the asphalt mixtures with stripping and another group for the asphalt mixtures without stripping. It was observed that the aggregate gradations of asphalt mixtures prone to stripping were mostly fine graded, and that, the effect of aggregate gradation was more pronounced than that of the asphalt binder content. Additionally, even though the average OT peak loads for all the asphalt mixtures were similar, the numbers of OT load cycles to failure for the fine-graded asphalt mixtures were over twice higher than those with coarse aggregate gradations. Also, whilst the VP deformation and cracking of the asphalt mixtures with stripping were positively correlated, the response-trends for the non-stripping asphalt mixtures were indeterminate. In general, the stripping characteristics were found to be related to the cracking resistance potential, further suggesting that the occurrence of stripping could be largely due to adhesive fracturing between the asphalt binder and the aggregates. Overall, the test results and study findings indicated a potential feasibility to predict and estimate the performance indices (i.e., deformation, rutting, stripping, cracking resistance, etc.) from amongst each other for the asphalt mixtures that are prone to stripping.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This study was supported by the National Key RD Program of China (2021YFB2601200), Texas Department of Transportation (6658), National Natural Science Foundation of China (52078025), The Project of Construction and Support for high-level Innovative Teams of Beijing Municipal Institutions(BPHR20220109), and Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture Fund (X23011).",Construction and Building Materials,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,408,,133581,Closed,Article,"Ling, Meng; Ji, Jie; Tanvir, Hossain; Fuentes, Luis; Walubita, Lubinda F.","Ling, Meng (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Beijing University of Civil Engineering Architecture, Beijing, China); Ji, Jie (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Beijing University of Civil Engineering Architecture, Beijing, China); Tanvir, Hossain (Central Structural Discipline, Subsea 7, Houston, TX 77094, USA); Fuentes, Luis (Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Walubita, Lubinda F.

Economic losses were evaluated for a group of four 20-story archetype buildings located in Santiago, Chile. The methodology developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center was considered to estimate economic losses. The expected annual loss (EAL) and the present value (PV) of the losses in 50 years were used as measures of economic loss. A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, which considered the seismicity of central Chile, was performed to estimate both metrics. The results show that when the lateral stiffness of the building increases, the EAL also increases. This implies that stiffer buildings are more vulnerable from an economic point of view. This counter-intuitive finding results from the higher seismic hazard of stiffer buildings and the minimum design base shear required by DS61 that governed the design of the studied buildings. Additionally, it was found that the EAL and the PV of losses in 50 years for the four archetypes do not exceed 0.3% and 7.8% of the total construction cost of the buildings, respectively. These monetary losses are relatively low, which is consistent with the outstanding seismic performance of reinforced concrete shear wall buildings.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Per this new permit, SHAs are to install soil based BMPs that can absorb the 85th percentile of a 24-hour stormwater event. The area used for this purpose is typically the road embankments/slopes located adjacent to the roadside, best known as Clear Recovery Zone (CRZ). The CRZ must be traversable and recoverable to meet roadside traffic safety standards. A major concern for SHAs is the uncertainty on how these BMPs will affect the safety of a vehicle should that vehicle leave the roadway and interact with the soft soils. Considering this concern, the study described in this paper has assessed the impact of soil amendments on the compaction characteristics, hydraulic conductivity, and sinkage potential of six native soils of the state of California. These six soils were amended with four of the most used BMPs by the California State of Transportation (Caltrans). The results showed the hydraulic conductivity drops when the percentage of organic matter increases in the soil. They also showed that soils with a soaked surface had much larger sinkage than soils with an intact surface, this sinkage potential increase at the soak condition is proportional to the soil’s clay content.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Inter-nodal archaeology in the Atacama desert Pampa (c. 7000 BP-400 BP),"We present a synthesis of our investigation into pre-Hispanic pathways of the Atacama Desert Pampa -one of the driest and harshest environments on our planet- where we have identified a variety of mobility strategies and dynamics deployed by the different communities that inhabited both the Pacific coast and the inland oases of this region. Specifically, we focus on the inter-nodal archaeological and biogeochemical data that provides direct evidence of the presence of individuals from myriad regions traversing this area from the Middle Archaic to Late periods (c. 7000 BP-400 BP). Moreover, we analyze how, beginning in the Formative Period, this multiplicity of peoples employed different mobility systems, circulation, relationships, and social exchanges to integrate this apparent “empty space”. In doing so, we discuss and reformulate the classic highland caravanning model of the Andes, which considered highland caravanning groups as the only agents promoting long-distance mobility and exchange.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, students’ perceptions of ELF in virtual exchange (VE) projects remain largely unexplored. This mixed-methods study investigates students’ attitudes towards ELF interactions in the context of online collaborations involving four countries in the Global North and South. The students participated in a six-week VE and collaboratively completed tasks set by their teachers. Results of the qualitative and quantitative data show that the students’ attitudes towards ELF interactions varied in different contexts and that the experience encouraged reflections, for instance, on students’ linguistic effectiveness in intercultural situations. The findings show a (re)evaluation of native and non-native English and attitudinal shift for some students. The results indicate that online intercultural exchanges can be a catalyst for students to reflect on international English usage and global ownership. The article provides implications for setting up ELF-VE projects regarding its potential to (trans)form ELF identities and gives advice for ELF practitioners.",,"Research funding: The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of English as a Lingua Franca,,,,2023-09-01,2023,2024-01-12,2023-09-01,12,2,137-157,Closed,Article,"Gruber, Alice; Bailey, Angela C.; Eady, Jeries H.; Weinberg, Linda R.; Brath, Brigitte; Carroza, Jorge","Gruber, Alice (Augsburg Technical University of Applied Sciences, Augsburg, Germany); Bailey, Angela C.

1280,pub.1156159638,10.1177/03611981231155188,,,Quantifying Uncertainty with Pavement Performance Models: Comparing Bayesian and Non-Parametric Methods,"An important part of pavement management systems is accurately estimating the performance-time-degradation relationship. One common approach to establishing this relationship is to use performance family curves. These curves are developed by collecting performance data at specific points in time and collectively shifting pavements of various ages to identify the probable underlying function. This paper compares two alternative methods for characterizing such a family curve function. First, a Bayesian method (Method-A) is used, which fits both the family curve and the shift factor function in parallel by assuming a Beta distribution for pavement performance condition rating (PCR). Second, a non-parametric method (Method-B) is developed, which fits the model in two steps; (1) by fitting the family; and (2) by horizontal shift to minimize the error. PCR values from flexible pavements in North Carolina (NC-PCR) are used for this comparison. These data include a total of 30,988 pavement sections segregated according to surface type and traffic level. Data from 2013 to 2015 are used for model calibration, and data from 2016 are used for model validation. The root means square error and k-fold cross-validation test are used to conduct the comparison, and Method-A is found to be preferred. The uncertainty in both models is quantified and compared. On the basis of this uncertainty, the Bayesian method is preferred, but in cases with large data sets, a non-parametric method does result in lower uncertainty.","The authors thank and acknowledge the North Carolina Department of Transportation, especially Camille Coombes in the Pavement Management Section, for their extensive support in providing the data, insightful comments, and granting approval for this study.","Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2023-03-12,2023,2023-03-12,2023-07,2677,7,661-679,Closed,Article,"Karanam, Gnana Deepika; Goenaga, Boris; Underwood, Benjamin Shane","Karanam, Gnana Deepika (Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC); Goenaga, Boris (Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Underwood, Benjamin Shane (Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC)","Karanam, Gnana Deepika (North Carolina State University)","Karanam, Gnana Deepika (North Carolina State University); Goenaga, Boris (North Carolina State University; Universidad del Norte); Underwood, Benjamin Shane (North Carolina State University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156159638,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

First it was shown that the HWTT and RLPD test results were not well correlated, which might be due to the differences in the boundary condition and the impacts of moisture damage and stripping in the HWTT. The analysis results suggested that the shape parameter (γ) of the DM master-curves could be utilized to assess the rutting resistance potential of the asphalt mixtures from the RLPD test, compared to other rheological parameters such as the inflection point frequency and β. The |E*| at the RLPD test condition was well correlated to the rutting performance compared to the asphalt mixture’s rutting parameter |E*|/sinδ and the |E*| at the inflection point frequency. A novel rutting parameter (VERIndex) was developed to assess the rutting resistance potential of the asphalt mixtures, which simultaneously accounts for the |E*| and slope of the DM master-curves. Thereafter, the cracking and rutting performance thresholds were proposed, and, correspondingly used in the performance space diagram to aid with implementing the balanced mix design approach using the viscoelastic characteristics of asphalt mixtures.",,This work was supported by Texas Department of Transportation [grant number 6658] and Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture Fund [grant number X23011].,International Journal of Pavement Engineering,,,,2023-08-11,2023,2023-08-11,2023-12-06,24,1,2240472,Closed,Article,"Ling, Meng; Lee, Sang Ick; Ji, Jie; Fuentes, Luis; Walubita, Lubinda F.","Ling, Meng (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Lee, Sang Ick (Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Austin, TX, USA); Ji, Jie (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Fuentes, Luis (Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Walubita, Lubinda F.

Six vehicles were instrumented and monitored under actual conditions for 3 months. Their location, speed, and fuel consumption were recorded. Additional tests were conducted to determine their drag (∼0.47) and rolling resistance coefficients (0.02 and 0.03, for paved and unpaved roads, respectively). Results showed that the autorickshaws' fuel consumption (3.18 L/100 km) and CO2 emissions (79 CO2 g/km) are smaller than the most efficient commercial gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicle. This result is due to small engine size (∼10 HP) and reduced curb vehicular weight (337 kg). This fact makes them appropriate for short-distance travels at low speeds (<40 km/h) for transporting people and goods under circumstances where safety is not an issue. Electrification of these vehicles will address their main drawbacks (poor energy efficiency and emissions of air pollutants).",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Nonetheless, measuring these parameters requires complicated and delicate tests in which minor variations in test performance might render the findings invalid. This research is aimed at creating four different machine-learning algorithmic regressions for estimating the uniaxial tensile performance of UHPFRC. Hence, the first crack stress σ cc , the maximum post-cracking strength σ pc , and its associated strains, ε cc , and ε pc , were modeled through the Random Forest algorithm. The developed approaches showed a high goodness-of-fit for regression measured in the test subset, presenting R2 values of 0.894, 0.909, 0.930, and 0.911 in guesstimating the behavior of UHPFRC under direct tensile stress (viz., σ cc , σ pc , ε cc , and ε pc ). The proposed models are a tool for assessing UHPFRC under ductility requirements and reducing the experimental campaign's time and costs by pre-selecting the available constituents with the proper performance on the algorithmic approaches.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

On the plate a structural damping may or may not act, and on the membrane a damping of Kelvin–Voigt type may or may not be present; free boundary operators for the plate are considered in the coupling with the membrane. We prove well‐posedness of the problem and higher regularity of the solution. Depending on the damping and on the presence of the rotational term, we establish strong stability, exponential stability, lack of exponential stability, polynomial stability, and analyticity of the semigroup associated to the transmission problem.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful for the valuable comments and recommendations of the referees, particularly in relation to Remark 4.16, item (c).

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a two-year study to explore five types of informal entrepreneurs (musicians, street vendors, artists, owners of informal smoke shops and street food vendors). The authors used semi-structured interviews and applied thematic analysis (ATA) of popular music and narratives to shed light on their attitudes, motivations and practices.   Findings The study shows how potential service participants freely exclude themselves from services and transformative service initiatives, preventing them from realizing opportunities and embracing change that can improve their well-being. The study also demonstrates that to serve human needs fairly, service designers need to recognize that some actors require more attention and resources than others to achieve their potential.   Originality/value The study challenges the notion that any population experiencing vulnerability wants help and chooses to participate in transformative service initiatives. Service participants can, in fact, exclude themselves from services and transformative service initiatives by free will, demonstrating that service exclusion is a multidirectional phenomenon, not unidirectional.

Two bacterial strains according to their 16S rRNA gene sequences closely related to At. ferridurans and At. ferrivorans were obtained from the industrial sulfide heap leaching process at Minera Escondida (SLH), named D2 and DM, respectively. We applied statistical and data mining analyses to the abundance of At. ferridurans D2 and At. ferrivorans DM taxa in the industrial process over 16 years of operation. In addition, we performed phylogenetic analysis and genome comparison of the type strains, as well as culturing approaches with representative isolates of At. ferridurans D2 and At. ferrivorans DM taxa to understand the differential phenotypic features. Throughout the 16 years, two main operational stages were identified based on the D2 and DM taxa predominance in solution samples. The better suitability of At. ferrivorans DM to grow in a wide range of temperature and in micro-oxic environments, and to oxidize S by reducing Fe(III) revealed through culturing approaches can, in a way, explain the taxa distribution in both operational stages. The isolate At. ferridurans D2 could be considered as a specialist in aerobic sulfur oxidation, while isolate At. ferrivorans DM is a specialist in iron oxidation. In addition, the results from ore samples occasionally obtained from the industrial heap suggest that At. ferridurans D2 abundance was more related to its abundance in the solution samples than At. ferrivorans DM was. This dynamic coincides with previously obtained results in in-lab cell-mineral attaching experiments with both strains. This information increases our knowledge the ecophysiology of Acidithiobacillus and of the importance of diverse physiological traits at industrial bioleaching scales.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they are not aware of any actual or potential conflict of interest in the work reported in this paper.

1231,pub.1154918695,10.1177/03611981221149436,,,Early Friction and Texture Evolution After an Asphalt Overlay,"Recent studies have shown that friction and, more notably, macrotexture reduce markedly when pavements are newly overlaid. However, past studies have not identified whether these effects are temporary and, if so, how long they may last. These effects must be quantified to inform strategies for best monitoring and managing friction and the surface characteristics of a pavement network. This paper uses a group of sites that received a surface overlay at some point between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021. At each site, friction and texture were measured sequentially after construction in the center of the lane (CL) and in the right-wheel path (RWP). These observations were used to evaluate the early friction and texture evolution after an asphalt overlay. First, seasonal effects were evaluated using the CL measurements, presumed to be unaffected by traffic, which indicated friction is affected by seasonality, whereas texture is not. A friction seasonal effect model was calibrated and then used to remove the seasonal variation from the RWP observations. The results showed that friction initially increases after an overlay but then, after reaching a maximum, starts to decrease. The average traffic volume needed to reach the point of maximum friction was 15.5 million repetitions. Four parameters, computed from the texture profile, were used to represent macrotexture. The macrotexture was found to generally increase after overlay construction, but in some sites the magnitude and number of peaks decayed with time.",The authors would like to thank the engineer Jason Jones from KPR engineering for collecting the field measurements presented in the paper.,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the financial support of the North Carolina Department of Transportation under the research project 2020-11: “Evolution of Pavement Friction and Macrotexture after Asphalt Overlay” and the research project 2022-05: “Development of Friction and Texture Performance Models”.",Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2023-01-27,2023,2023-01-27,2023-06,2677,6,573-593,Closed,Article,"Goenaga, Boris; Underwood, B.

Therefore, if a part more considerable than the working volume is required, the part is produced in parts and joined together. Among the many methods of joining thermoplastic parts, adhesives and mechanical interlocking are considered. This study aims to characterize and optimize mechanically stressed adhesive joints combined with female and male mechanical interlocking on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) specimens made with fused filament fabrication (FFF) so that the joint strength is as close as possible to the strength of the base material.   Design/methodology/approach This study characterized the subject’s state of the art to justify the decisions regarding the experimental design planned in this research. Subsequently, this study designed, executed and analyzed the experiment using a statistical analysis of variance. The output variables were yield strength and tensile strength. The input variables were two different cyanoacrylate adhesives, two different types of mechanical interlock (truncated pyramid and cylindrical pin) and the dimensions of each type of mechanical interlock. This study used simple and factorial experiments to select the best adhesive and interlocking to be optimized using the response surface and the steep ascent method.   Findings The two adhesives have no statistical difference, but they show different data dispersion. The design or yield stress was a determining factor for selecting the optimal specimen, with cylindrical geometry exhibiting higher resistance at initial failure. Geometry type is crucial due to the presence of stress concentrators. The cylindrical geometry with fewer stress concentrators demonstrated better tensile strength. Ultimately, the specimen with a mechanically reinforced joint featuring a cylindrical pin of radius 5.45 mm and height of 4.6 mm exhibited the maximum tensile and yield strength.   Originality/value Previous research suggests that a research opportunity is the combination of bonding methods in FFF or fused deposition modeling, which is not a frequent topic, and this research to enrich that topic combines the adhesive with mechanically interlocked joints and studies it experimentally for FFF materials, to provide unpublished information of the performance of the adhesive joint with mechanical interlocking, to designers and manufacturers of this technology.","To 3D Ingeniería BQ SAS for printing the specimens, the Universidad Autónoma del Caribe for carrying out the tests, and the Universidad del Atlántico for licensing the software used for the modeling of the samples and statistical analysis of the tests, as well as for the time provided to the researchers for carrying out the research.",,Rapid Prototyping Journal,,,,2023-08-21,2023,2023-08-21,2023-10-18,29,9,1984-2000,Closed,Article,"Alvarez, Erwin Molino; González, Sergio Andres Quintana; Taborda, Luis Lisandro Lopez; Nuñez, Enrique Esteban Niebles","Alvarez, Erwin Molino (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlantico, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Sergio Andres Quintana (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlantico, Barranquilla, Colombia); Taborda, Luis Lisandro Lopez (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlantico, Barranquilla, Colombia, ; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, and Department of Development, Research and Innovation, 3D Ingenieria BQ SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia); Nuñez, Enrique Esteban Niebles (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Autonoma del Caribe, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Taborda, Luis Lisandro Lopez (University of Atlántico; Universidad del Norte)","Alvarez, Erwin Molino (University of Atlántico); González, Sergio Andres Quintana (University of Atlántico); Taborda, Luis Lisandro Lopez (University of Atlántico; Universidad del Norte); Nuñez, Enrique Esteban Niebles (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163374574,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

The treatment developed here is based on a formulation of Laplace Transform on time scales that includes continuous and discrete cases, to obtain concise expressions for such explicit formulas. Moreover, this formulation of Laplace Transform allows to obtain discrete counterparts of some important properties in the context of fractional calculus. As main results in this work, we study the relationship between an abstract resolvent family and its infinitesimal generator, along with the main properties of resolvent families, and the existence of solutions for abstract dynamic equations on time scales. In addition, we introduce formulas for resolvent families as solutions of several types of dynamic equations of order 0<α≤1$$0 < \alpha \le 1$$ on continuous, discrete and quantum time scales.","The authors are grateful for the valuable feedback of the referees, as well as the editor, which were helpful in delivering the final version of this work.",,Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis,,,,2023-12-08,2023,2023-12-08,2024-02,27,1,218-246,Closed,Article,"Grau, Rogelio; Pereira, Aldo","Grau, Rogelio (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pereira, Aldo (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile)","Pereira, Aldo (University of La Serena)","Grau, Rogelio (Universidad del Norte); Pereira, Aldo (University of La Serena)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166831567,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4904 Pure Mathematics,

Apart from his works on the Sophists, which do not claim to faithfully expose the ‘philosophy’ of their authors, we find in Plato’s dialogues comments and sometimes quotations from the Presocratics, from Thales to Philolaos. In some cases, Plato adds the name of the quoted philosopher, but sometimes he leaves to the reader the task of finding out who the commented or quoted author is. This is the case with Melissos in a passage of the Sophist (244b), where his name is not quoted, but an anonymous monistic philosopher expounds a literal quotation of the philosopher: ἓν μόνον ἔστιν (fr.

Two dosages with partial substitution of cement and MS were used in addition to another without any substitution as a reference. UHPFRC samples were obtained by adding a 2% (vol.) of steel micro-fiber to these three UHPC dosages. Incorporating calcium carbonate and recycled glass into concrete enhanced rheological properties, thereby decreasing the need for chemical admixtures and increasing cost-effectiveness. The findings demonstrated that the partial substitution of cement and MS reduced the drying shrinkage of both UHPC and UHPFRC with respect to the reference dosage. It was also observed that the reinforcement with micro-fibers, and the narrowing of the dosages of cement and MS, reduced the drying shrinkage up to 40% compared with the reference UHPC. The shrinkage of traditional UHPC concrete, after 2% straight steel fibers, reduced by 10.8, 18.1, 12.1, and 12.2% at 5, 15, 20, and 25 days, respectively. Nevertheless, by incorporating this volume of fibers into the calcium carbonate and glass powder mix, a considerable reduction (40.4, 28.3, 25.0, and 18.1%) was achieved at the same ages.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

According to the IUCN, the three species are categorized as 'vulnerable', 'endangered', and 'near threatened', respectively. In this study, we assembled and characterized in detail the mitochondrial genome of Leptonycteris spp. and examined the phylogenetic position of this genus in the family Phyllostomidae based on protein coding genes (PCGs). The mitogenomes of L. nivalis, L. curasoae, and L. yerbabuenae are 16,708, 16,758, and 16,729 bp in length and each encode 13 PCGs, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a putative control region (CR). Mitochondrial gene order is identical to that reported before for the family Phyllostomidae. All tRNAs exhibit a 'cloverleaf' secondary structure, except tRNA-Serine-1 that is missing the DHU arm in the three species. All PCGs are exposed to purifying selection with atp8 experiencing the most relaxed purifying selection as the ω ratio was higher for this gene compared to the other PCGs in each species. The CR of each species contains three functional domains: extended termination associated sequence (ETAS), Central, and conserved sequence block domain (CSB). A phylomitogenomic analysis revealed that Leptonycteris is monophyletic and most closely related to the genus Glossophaga. The analysis also supported the monophyly of the family Glossophaginae in the speciose family Phyllostomidae.

Here, we studied the effect of the mass of a copper sheet, the pH of the solution, and the concentration of LL in the removal of the organic matter present in this water. Before the reaction with landfill leachate, the copper sheet used in the reaction was constituted by Cu+ and Cu2O, respectively. The results showed that in a volume of 0.5 L of a pretreated LL, the higher removal of organic matter resulted using a mass of 2.7 g of the copper sheet, a pH of solution of 5, and a concentration of LL of a 10%, obtaining a final value of C/C0 of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.34, 0.54, 0.66, and 0.84 for concentrations of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, respectively, and 0.0041, 0.0042, 0.0043, and 0.016 for concentration of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, respectively, of C/C0 of humic acids. The photolysis on LL at its natural pH using solar UV removes very little humic acid and COD, going from 9.4 to 8.5 and 7.7 Abs254 for photolysis and UV + H2O2, obtaining 8.6 and 17.6% of removal, respectively, and 2.01 and 13.04% removal of COD, respectively. Copper sheet applied under Fenton-like conditions results in 65.9% removal and an increase of 0.2% for humic acid and COD, respectively. Removal using only H2O2 for Abs254 and COD was 11.95 and 4.3%, respectively. Raw LL produced a 29.1% inhibition of the biological activated sludge rate after the adjustment to pH 7 and the final process of inhibition was 0.23%.Graphical Abstract",,"Financial support is provided by Fondecyt N° 1210841, the Solar Energy Research Center (SERC) “FONDAP project No. 15110019,” and Fondecyt N° 1200672, and the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte provided equipment support.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,"Iron; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Copper; Hydrogen Peroxide; Humic Substances; Oxidation-Reduction",2023-04-28,2023,2023-04-28,2023-05,30,25,67513-67524,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Rodríguez, Carlos Anibal; Carrasco, Claudia; Herrera, José; Salazar-González, Ricardo","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos Y Medioambiente, Antofagasta, Chile); Rodríguez, Carlos Anibal (Multidisciplinary Research Institute for Science and Technology, Universidad de La Serena, 1305 Raúl Bitrán Av, La Serena, Chile); Carrasco, Claudia (Departamento de Ingeniería de Materiales, Universidad de Concepción, 270 Edmundo Larenas St, Concepción, Chile); Herrera, José (Facultad de Química Y Biología, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Casilla 40, Correo 33, Santiago, Chile); Salazar-González, Ricardo (Analysis, Treatment, Electrochemistry, Recovery and Reuse of Water Research Group, WATER2, Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Rodríguez, Carlos Anibal (University of La Serena); Carrasco, Claudia (University of Concepción); Herrera, José (University of Santiago Chile); Salazar-González, Ricardo (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157589426,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

Micro calcium carbonate and ground waste glass were employed as partial substitutes for cement and microsilica (MS) to achieve this goal. A three-factor design of experiments was used to achieve the most desirable rheological and mechanical properties with minimal quantities of cement and MS. In this context, the cement dosage (factor A), water-to-binder ratio (factor B), and superplasticizer dosage (factor C) were taken into account. By utilizing Andreasen & Andersen's (MAA) particle packing theory, dense particle packing was achieved throughout the experimental design. Regression models were developed to simulate the time-dependent rheological and mechanical properties of the UHPC. It was observed that the mathematical optimization was valid experimentally with reduced absolute deviations between 0.22 % and 1.23 % for slump flow and 3.49 % to 4.62 % for compressive strength at 28 days. The study showed that approximately 590 kg/m3 of cement would be most effective for recycled glass UHPC mixes. The proposed design will likely produce a compressive strength exceeding 150 MPa with satisfactory rheological properties at a lower cost.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Specifically, ammonia is a versatile compound that prevails in various spheres of the environment, and if not properly managed, this chemical species could pose severe ecological pressure and toxicity to different receiving environments and its biota. The notorious footprints of ammonia could be traced to anoxic conditions, an infestation of aquatic ecosystems, hyperactivity, convulsion, and methaemoglobin, popularly known as the ""blue baby syndrome"". In this review, latest updates regarding the sustainabilities, advancements and challenges for the removal of ammonia from aqueous solutions, i.e., river and waste waters, are briefly elucidated in light of future perspectives. Viable routes and ideal hotspots, i.e., wastewater and drinking water, for ammonia removal under the cost-effective options have been unpacked. Key mechanisms for the removal of ammonia were grossly bioremediation, oxidation, adsorption, filtration, precipitation, and ion exchange. Finally, this review denoted biological nutrient removal, struvite precipitation, and breakpoint chlorination as the most effective and promising technologies for the removal of ammonia from aquatic environments, although at the expense of energy and operational cost. Lastly, the future perspective, avenues of exploitation, and technical facets that deserve in-depth exploration are duly underscored.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Since there is no specific information about which parameters help to improve the treatment efficiency when using fly ash (FA) in a sonophotoreactor, this research focuses on evaluating the use of an ultrasound process (US) combined with a photo-Fenton process, with FA as a catalyst for the first time. The removals of colour, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and aromatic compounds (UV 254) present in landfill leachates were studied using a factorial design, where the effect of different loads of FA (1, 1.5, and 2 g FA/L), pH (pH = 3, 6, and 8.9), and US frequency irradiation (576, 864, and 1138 kHz) on the efficiency of photo-Fenton was evaluated. The highest removals of COD (40.7%), colour (36.8%), and UV 254 (50.8%) were achieved adjusting the pH to 3, adding 2 g of FA/L, and applying 576 kHz of US frequency. It was found that pH is the parameter that has the highest effect on pollutant removal (95% confidence level). In addition, the removals of COD, colour, and UV 254 increased at lower pH values and US frequency. Also, the presence of Fe2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 in the FA under UV irradiation and ultrasound process, improved the removal of complex organic matter present in the landfill leachate, where HO• was the most important radical.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The biosimilars market is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade as a cost-effective alternative to expensive patented biologics. The drivers for the growing demand include needs for affordable health care, the prevalence of chronic diseases, expiration of patents for numerous biologic medicines and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico have implemented regulatory frameworks for the approval of biosimilars as well as for investment in local manufacturing capacity, sale, and distribution. Some LA countries face challenges related to low quality institutional frameworks and deficient public policies for regulatory harmonization of these medicines.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this article is to analyze the broad window of opportunity for biosimilars in LA (Brazil, Mexico and Argentina) in the next decade, considering their regulations and institutional quality, as well as an affordable cost for patients with chronic diseases and highlight the biosimilars approved in the three countries studied. Likewise, the future contribution of AI in the drug R&D process is considered.

The seagrass is classified as endangered and grows only clonally, but there are no data on its physiology and growth. However, this information is important to gain insights into its acclimation potential and how disturbances may affect them. We therefore studied H. nigricaulis at 27° and 30°S, and determined their growth and physiology among seasons and depths over one year. Biomass was higher at 27° than at 30°S, and was always higher in summer than in autumn and winter. Increased photosynthesis supported growth in summer, and in winter carbonic anhydrase activity was in place to maintain these evergreen meadows. Our results suggest that these seagrass meadows are adapted to local conditions, which, together with their asexual reproduction, could make them more vulnerable to disturbance. Therefore, our results serve as a basis for future studies on seagrass growth dynamics, and are important for protection and management plans.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Presently, definitive therapy is not available, and the investigation into optimal wound care is influenced by the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of developing therapies. Accumulating evidence demonstrated the potential role of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy in several tissue injuries and diseases due to their high proliferation and differentiation abilities along with an easy collection procedure, low tumorigenesis, and immuno‐privileged status. MSCs have also accelerated wound repair in all phases through their advantageous properties, such as accelerating wound closure, improving re-epithelialization, elevating angiogenesis, suppressing inflammation, and modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In addition, the beneficial therapeutic impacts of MSCs are largely associated with their paracrine functions, including extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes and microvesicles are the two main subgroups of EVs. These vesicles are heterogeneous bilayer membrane structures that contain several proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. EVs have emerged as a promising alternative to stem cell-based therapies because of their lower immunogenicity, tumorigenicity, and ease of management. MSCs from various sources have been widely investigated in skin wound healing and regeneration.

In particular, the proposed model constructs characteristic curves for the concentrations of several metals (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, Sb, and Zn) in soils and plants based on the experimental data retrieved from several bibliographical sources comprising 305 vegetal species. The proposed model is an extension of previous models of characteristic curves in phytoremediation processes developed by Lam et al. for root measurements using the bioconcentration factor. However, the proposed model extends this approach to consider roots, as well as aerial parts and shoots of the plant, while at the same time providing a less complex mathematical formula compared to the original. The final model shows an adjusted R2 of 0.712, and all its parameters are considered statistically significant. The model may be used to assess samples from a given plant species to identify its potential as an accumulator in the context of soil phytoremediation processes. Furthermore, a simplified version of the model was constructed using an approximation to provide an easy-to-compute alternative that is valid for concentrations below 37,000 mg/kg. This simplified model shows results similar to the original model for concentrations below this threshold and it uses an adjusted factor defined as plant/soil$$\left[ {} \right]_{plant} /\sqrt {\left[ { } \right]_{soil} }$$ that must be compared with a threshold depending on the metal, type of measurement, and target (e.g., accumulator or hyperaccumulator). The full model construction shows that 90 out of the 305 species assessed have a potential behavior as accumulators and 10 of them as hyperaccumulators. Finally, out of the 1405 experimental measurements, 1177 were shown to be accumulators or hyperaccumulators. In particular, 85% of the results coincide with the reported values, thus validating the proposed model.",,Not applicable.,Environmental Geochemistry and Health,,,"Soil; Soil Pollutants; Plant Roots; Metals, Heavy; Plants; Biodegradation, Environmental",2023-01-27,2023,2023-01-27,2023-12,45,12,9477-9494,Closed,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Keith, Brian F.; Bech, Jaume; Gálvez, María E.; Rojas, Rodrigo; Alvarez, Fernando A.; Zetola, Vicente; Montofré, Ítalo L.","Lam, Elizabeth J.

The TransMilenio system in Bogota has serious drawbacks due to the lack of information in congestion situations. In this work we present a computer vision method that estimates the number of people in TransMilenio stations using deep learning techniques. We offer free use of the TransMilenio-Javeriana database with nearly 900,000 head labels on buses and stations. From these images a deep learning architecture tuned for crowd counting was trained to generate density maps around the heads in the scene. Several head count methods were evaluated on the density maps. After testing the method with 10,800 images, the results show a mean absolute error of 1 head per frame, equivalent to 11% relative error. The accuracy of this method is much better than its manual counterpart. This method is also scalable and low cost, which indicates that it has great potential to provide information for the planning and operation of public transport systems.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2023-05-17,2023,2023-05-17,,21,4,537-545,Closed,Article,"Rendon, William David Moreno; Anillo, Carolina Burgos; Jaramillo-Ramirez, Daniel; Carrillo, Henry","Rendon, William David Moreno (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Anillo, Carolina Burgos (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia); Jaramillo-Ramirez, Daniel (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia); Carrillo, Henry (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia)",,"Rendon, William David Moreno (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Anillo, Carolina Burgos (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Jaramillo-Ramirez, Daniel (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Carrillo, Henry (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158131917,40 Engineering,

To perform US pre-treatments, one group of samples were first pre-treated by US (38 W/L, 25 kHz) for 15 and 30 min and then immersed in the probiotic solution for 15 or 30 min, and another group of samples were submerged in the probiotic solution simultaneously applying US (US-assisted) for 15 and 30 min. After pre-treatments, the samples were convectively dried at 60 °C. Based on the results, all US pre-treatments improved the drying rate (up to 59%) and reduced the drying time (up to 31%) to reach 25% moisture compared to non-sonicated samples. The reduction in drying time (from ∼6 h to ∼4 h for US pre-treated samples) was crucial for maintaining the probiotic viability in the dehydrated guavas. These samples showed counts of 6.15 to 7.00 CFU∙g-1 after 4 h, while the control samples reached counts of 4.17 to 4.45 CFU∙g-1 after 6 h. US pre-treatment did not affect the color parameters of the samples before drying (p > 0.05). The functional compounds were reduced during drying (p < 0.05), however, all US pre-treated samples had lower reductions in vitamin C content (up to 20%), phenolic compounds (up to 41%) and antioxidant capacity (up to 47%) compared to control samples (up to 52%, 81% and 61%, respectively). Therefore, US pre-treatment (highlighting the US-assisted probiotic incorporation for 30 min) reduced the drying time for guava slices and minimized the thermal impact on probiotic viability and functional compounds, being a strategy to produce potentially probiotic dehydrated guava.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The replacement of cement and silica fume with sustainable alternatives to RPC may provide significant benefits, however, there are challenges to overcome. In this study, calcium carbonate and ground waste glass powder were introduced as mineral mixtures to develop an environmentally friendly and cost-effective RPC mixture. The best flowability, proper compressive strength, and reduced cement content were achieved using a multi-objective simultaneous optimization approach based on the Derringer & Suich methodology. As a result of the study, 603 kg/m3 of cement was determined as the most suitable dosage for RPC. Additionally, the optimized mix contained 368 kg/m3 of waste glass and 118 kg/m3 of calcium carbonate, which had a beneficial impact on both cost and environmental considerations. As a result of numerous experimental tests, including compressive strength, elasticity modulus, chloride ion penetration, and drying shrinkage, the developed RPC's properties were validated and were comparable to the control mixture while showing superior drying shrinkage behavior. A further benefit of adding these admixtures was the reduction of superplasticizer dosage. Despite the optimized RPC's lower mechanical and chloride ion penetration performance at early ages, the performance discrepancy diminished over time due to the pozzolanic properties of waste glass powder. A significant characteristic of the optimized RPC was its superior drying shrinkage behavior throughout the testing period resulting from its reduced water dosage. Ultimately, the study highlights the potential of the addition of calcium carbonate and waste glass powder to RPC for sustainable concrete production at a low cost.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

New field data, deformation and petrographic observations, whole-rock major element, mineral composition and P-T determinations of the Peltetec metaophiolite allow determining the metamorphic-geodynamic events of a section of the active western margin of Gondwana during the Mesozoic. Two metamorphic events are proposed: (i) ocean-floor metamorphism during the formation of oceanic lithosphere under low-pressure amphibolite facies conditions (M0), followed by (ii) prograde metamorphism up to the greenschist facies along an intermediate (Barrovian) P/T gradient (M1; ~315°C and ~ 3.9 kbar, ca. 23°C/km). The first metamorphic event occurred under near-static stress conditions and rocks did not suffer significant deformation. During this event, pyroxenes were replaced by hornblende while plagioclase recrystallized. The second event produced strongly recrystallized and foliated greenschist facies rocks with a peak assemblage of actinolite + chlorite + albite + epidote + titanite ± phengite. We interpreted that this assemblage developed during the closure of a back-arc basin and the emplacement of the ophiolite onto the continental margin in the late Triassic or possibly by compressive events in the Early Cretaceous and/or Late Cretaceous. Later processes are related to the regional mostly strike-slip Peltetec fault/shear zone that produced displacement and mixing of blocks, as indicated by cataclastic structure present in most of the slivers, but without differentiable metamorphic recrystallization overprint.","We greatly appreciate editorial handling and constructive comments by Dr. Yamirka Rojas-Agramonte, Guest Editor, and Dr. Robert Stern, Editor-in-chief, and we thank Dr. Alejandro Piraquive and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive reviews that improved the original manuscript.

To improve sustainability in this process, ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and natural aggregates (NA) have been replaced by recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to reduce the negative issues to the environment. However, the use of SCMs can be challenging due to their complex chemical composition, and RCAs are often of inferior quality compared to NAs, leading to reduced concrete strength. To address these issues, an artificial neural networks (ANN) model has been used for calculating the compressive strength of concrete mixes that oodórate SCMs and RCAs. To train the model, 1181 concrete mixtures from 116 sources were included, considering parameters such as hydraulic reactivity, silica, and alumina modulus. In this research was found that the ANN model is an effective instrument to predict concrete strength even with the use of SCMs and RCAs. The analysis of input variables using the Connection Weight Approach (CWA) concludes that silica fume is the external material that, when mixed with RCA, significantly improves the resistance of concrete, followed by the reactivity modulus of cementitious materials, cement content, silica modulus, fine NA content, and coarse NA dosage. Conversely, excessive ood dosage, high ood/cement ratio, and excessive RCA content (fine and coarse) negatively affect concrete strength.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The lobster Jasus frontalis inhabits two oceanic island groups, the Juan Fernández Archipelago and the Desventuradas Islands, separated by 800 km. Since this species is primarily exploited in the Juan Fernández Archipelago, knowledge of the connectivity patterns among islands is foundational for species management. Here, we used variability at single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individual-based modeling (IBM) to estimate the genetic structure and connectivity between J. frontalis populations in these island groups. The variability at 9090 SNPs suggests two genetic populations, one in the Juan Fernández Archipelago and one in the Desventuradas Islands. Furthermore, IBM suggests an asymmetric connectivity pattern, with particles moving from the Juan Fernández Archipelago to the Desventuradas Islands but not vice versa. Since the IBM analysis suggests asymmetric larval movement between the islands, and the genetic analysis indicates isolation between the Juan Fernández Archipelago and the Desventuradas Islands, larval retention mechanisms such as small-scale oceanographic processes or behavior could hinder larval movement between islands. This study highlights the importance of using more than one methodology to estimate population connectivity.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The overall removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 63% and 15% using FP and CPC, respectively. Also, for the overall removal efficiency of polyphenols, a percentage of 73% and 43% were obtained using FP and CPC, respectively. When ozone was used in the solar photoreactors, the resulting trends were similar. COD and polyphenol removal, using an FP photoreactor in the solar photo-Fenton/O3 process, resulted in values of 98.8% and 86.2% after the process. COD and polyphenol removal, using solar photo-Fenton/O3 process in a CPC, resulted in values of 49.5% and 72.4%, respectively. The economic indicators of annual worth and economic treatment capacity established that FP reactors represent lower costs than CPCs. These results were corroborated by the economic analyses of the evolution of costs versus COD removed as well as by the cash flow diagrams projected for 5, 10, and 15 years.",The authors wish to thank the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for providing equipment support.,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,"Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Polyphenols",2023-05-05,2023,2023-05-05,2023-06,30,27,70213-70228,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Bakit, José","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos Y Medioambiente, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, 1780000, Coquimbo, Chile); Bakit, José (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, 1780000, Coquimbo, Chile)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Bakit, José (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157784871,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,

Nanomaterials have emerged as a promising alternative to developing new nanostructures with imaging applications. In this study, a heterostructure based on barium titanate (BT), zinc oxide (ZnO), and erbium (Er) was prepared and coated with Chitosan (CS) to investigate their stability and compatibility with biological systems. The structure, particle morphology, luminescence properties, stability, and cytotoxicity of different nanoparticles (NPs) were assessed. The results demonstrated the formation of a [BT@ZnO:Er]-CS heterostructure, which is consistent with the relative intensities and positions of peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) with an average crystallite size of ~76 nm. The electrokinetic measurement results indicate that the coated NPs are the most stable and have an average size close to 200 nm when the pH is between 3 and 5. Finally, we presented a cytotoxicity study of naked and CS-coated NPs. The results indicate that naked NPs exhibit varying cellular toxicity, as indicated by decreased cell viability, morphological changes, and an increase in an apoptotic marker. The CS-coated NPs prevented the cytotoxic effect of the naked NPs, demonstrating the significance of CS as a stabilizing agent.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1063,pub.1155397977,10.1109/tpwrs.2023.3243550,,,Automated Correction of GIS Data for Loads and Distributed Energy Resources in Secondary Distribution Networks,"Currently, utilities are making significant efforts to correct their secondary models in geographic information systems (GISs) to capture the distribution system performance due to the increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as renewable energy resources, distributed energy storage, and electric vehicles (EVs). However, their databases are often not reliable in terms of GIS coordinates of elements such as loads and DERs resulting in an approximate representation of the secondary distribution network. This paper presents an automated tool for accurate secondary network topology GIS coordinates correction. The proposed automated tool provides a more accurate feeder topology for utilities to estimate and operate distribution systems by assigning the load and DER nodes to their corresponding customer location. To simplify the complexity of the proposed new tool, only two commonly available inputs are being used as input data: municipal parcel GIS delimitation data, and utility secondary feeder topology database. A three-stage framework is proposed to develop the automated tool: the first stage reads and processes the raw input data; the second stage works automatically with no human intervention to assign the load and DER nodes to their associated location; the third stage provides the load and DER coordinates and physical address. The proposed procedure is implemented on an actual feeder from an electrical utility with high penetration of DERs.The results show that the proposed method provides a more accurate estimation of the topology of the feeder in terms of coordinates.",,This work was supported by Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy under Award DE-AR00001858-1631.,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,,,,2023-02-14,2023,2023-02-14,,39,1,1628-1636,Closed,Article,"Montano-Martinez, Karen; Ma, Shanshan; Vittal, Vijay; Rojas, Cynthia","Montano-Martinez, Karen (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Ma, Shanshan (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Vittal, Vijay (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Rojas, Cynthia (Arizona Public Service, Phoenix, AZ, 85072, USA)","Vittal, Vijay (Arizona State University)","Montano-Martinez, Karen (Arizona State University); Ma, Shanshan (Arizona State University); Vittal, Vijay (Arizona State University); Rojas, Cynthia (Arizona Public Service, Phoenix, AZ, 85072, USA)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155397977,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

For collecting information, a phenomenological interview with twelve professors from public and private universities in the city of Manizales (Colombia) was used.   Findings The results reveal the experiences had in education from the relationships that have left their mark on the subjects and discover education as a relationship with the Other of welcome, hospitality, vocation and responsibility.   Originality/value The originality of the study is in the particular method, heterological phenomenology, which investigates the experience of human relationships as a scenario for constructing a reality in which the starting point is the narrative that the Other (research subject) makes of his encounters with his-Other (subject present in the narrative).",,,Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,,,,2023-01-17,2023,2023-01-17,2023-11-22,15,5,1664-1674,Closed,Article,"Noreña, Jhon Fredy Orrego; de la Ossa Robinson, Susana; Miraz, Pedro Vázquez","Noreña, Jhon Fredy Orrego (Universidad de Caldas, Manizales, Colombia); de la Ossa Robinson, Susana (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia); Miraz, Pedro Vázquez (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia)","Miraz, Pedro Vázquez (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)","Noreña, Jhon Fredy Orrego (University of Caldas); de la Ossa Robinson, Susana (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Miraz, Pedro Vázquez (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154514083,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

In this paper, we analyze the behavioral and emotional effects of 1 year of coronavirus‐related lockdown in Colombia. A cross‐sectional correlational design was used on a sample of 1853 participants from different regions, and with different levels of education, income, and employment situations. We applied the fear of coronavirus scale, the use of preventive behaviors scale, and a scale to measure pleasant and unpleasant emotions based on the circumplex model of affect. Our data shows that women, participants who were unemployed during the lockdown, and participants that study or work in legal, computational, or related fields, have been more affected in terms of unpleasant emotions. In addition, we observed a trend towards a relation between higher income and educational levels with lower degrees of fear, higher degrees of pleasant emotions, and a greater use of preventive behaviors related to the pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is a result of a project called Psychosocial Effects of Isolation due to the COVID‐19 Pandemic, sponsored by the Parque Científico de Innovación Social, UNIMINUTO (Call for scientific research and artistic creation 2020; registration number C121‐200‐001).

Despite the proliferation of A. catenella blooms over the last few decades, the role of sedimentary resting cysts in the recurrence of harmful algal blooms and the species' northward expansion across Chilean Patagonia is not well understood. As a resting cyst-producing species, the sediment-cyst dynamics of A. catenella likely contribute to the geographical expansion and bloom recurrence of this species. For this purpose, we analyzed a decade of A. catenella surface sediment cyst records across the two ecoregions of the Chilean Patagonian System that were further stratified into five subregions based on water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient characteristics. We also analyzed spatio-temporal cyst dynamics in a pre-, during-, and post-bloom scenario of the Chiloense ecoregion (more northern) of the Magellanic province. Our results indicated highly variable A. catenella resting cyst abundances, with a maximum of 221 cysts cm-3 recorded in 2002 after an intense bloom. Generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models found that sampling season, subregion, and Total Organic Matter (%) explained resting cyst presence and density. The results also demonstrated the presence of A. catenella cysts in northern subregions, evidencing the northward geographical expansion observed during the last few decades. The risks of A. catenella bloom recurrence from small, patchy resting cyst distributions across broad geographical areas and under changing environmental conditions are discussed.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Since some EM are involuntary, these prevent spoofing attacks. While prior research requires feature extraction manually from EM data to identify a person, we use a deep convolutional architecture that processes it as an image. The eye movements were treated as a signal, then transformed as a spectrogram of frequencies, and its image is the input for a convolutional architecture. We investigated two types of signals: Cartesian coordinates, and gaze angle over time. The proposal consists of a convolutional network architecture applied to the DOVES dataset, where stimuli are natural images. We obtained the accuracy for the eye angle spectrogram, on DOVES, about 73%, and for the eye coordinates spectrogram, 65%.

An online standardized survey collected from 140 practicing veterinarians was conducted between March and July 2020. The surveyed participants reported the occurrence of brucellosis, ringworm, scabies, cat scratch disease, anthrax, toxocariasis, salmonellosis, pediculosis, and flea infestation among veterinarians. The clinical signs and symptoms related to these events include diarrhea, allergies, and muscle pain. Mild and severe traumatic injuries were also declared by the participants, in which the frequency of severe trauma increased as the time of professional practice increased. Nevertheless, the use of professional healthcare was low among the surveyed veterinarians.

This study considers the significant changes that have transformed the Colombia-Venezuela border landscape over the past two decades. The essential function that trochas play in sustaining these cross-border interactions is underscored, as is the resilience of local inhabitants who eke out a living through informal labor and participation in various illicit markets along this border segment. The ethnographic evidence presented is derived from multiple visits to the region conducted from 2016 to 2022, offering an illuminating portrayal of these border zones and the variety of trade relations that prevail within the named cities.

This study aimed to evaluate how the Olive Ridley turtle, Lepidochelys olivacea, uses the territorial sea off the nesting beaches in Puerto Escondido, Puerto Ángel, Santa María Huatulco, and Morro Ayuta, in Oaxaca, Mexico. Between December 2017 and August 2018, 2394 individuals were sighted in the territorial sea engaged in the following activities: feeding (6 individuals), mating (164 individuals), swimming (2172 individuals), and resting (49 individuals). We analyzed the diet and body condition of L. olivacea and identified which biophysical factors affect the distribution of these sea turtles in the region. We also recorded direct interactions with fishers and tourism service providers. We captured 40 individuals, collected morphometric data, and analyzed esophageal content to characterize feeding habits, which were correlated with a body condition index. Diet items included crustaceans, tunicates, four commercially important fish species, jellyfish, mollusks, and algae. Approximately 95% of turtles exhibited very good body condition. The largest turtle aggregations were recorded in Morro Ayuta (898 individuals) and Puerto Ángel (808 individuals). In situ sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations from satellite images were used to characterize the territorial sea. Sea surface temperature was negatively correlated with turtle abundance. Management and conservation actions are needed for sea turtles that address the negative interactions with fishers (e.g., competition for commercially important fish species) and tourism service providers that occur in the territorial sea off nesting beaches to protect these crucial reproductive habitats in the long term.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors that explain the intention to study a medical specialty in medical students.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey of medical students was conducted with 266 valid responses (58.7% response rate). The instrument measured the intention, attitude, subjective norms, and self-perception of abilities toward studying a medical specialty. This instrument was verified for its reliability and validity. We used the Structural Equations Model (SEM) through partial least squares (SEM-PLS) to estimate the whole model.
RESULTS: Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, composite reliability, and Dijkstra-Hernseler's indicator of each item showed adequate values. Regarding the structural model, the size effect test indicated that two of the three constructs are relevant to explaining the intention. Bootstrapping tests showed the predictive relevance of the model. The overall fit of the model was adequate.

Fecal volatile organic compounds (FVOCs) can serve as disease biomarkers. The objective was to compare nutritional condition, feeding habits, and FVOCs into low-risk and high-risk (HR) T2DM developed in the Mexican population. A cross-sectional study was conducted in healthy adult volunteers between 18 and 59 years of age from Tepic, Nayarit, México. The FVOCs p-cresol and acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids were evaluated. The values of body mass index (BMI), body fat, visceral fat index, metabolic age, and basal metabolic rate were higher in the HR group. In addition, high total calorie intakes and high macronutrient calorie intakes were found in the HR group. Both groups showed the same values for the evaluated FVOCs. Through principal component analysis, it was found that when BMI, metabolic age, weight, and visceral fat index increase, adults will be more likely to be at high risk for developing T2DM.",D.L.G.-M. acknowledges CONACYT-Mexico for Grant 771429.,,ACS Food Science & Technology,,,,2023-03-23,2023,2023-03-23,2023-04-21,3,4,658-665,Closed,Article,"García-Martínez, Diana Laura; Alarcón-Domínguez, Edith Efrén; Velasco-González, Luisa Elizabeth; de Lourdes García-Magaña, María; Sánchez-Burgos, Jorge Alberto; Sáyago-Ayerdi, Sonia Guadalupe; Zamora-Gasga, Víctor Manuel","García-Martínez, Diana Laura (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Alarcón-Domínguez, Edith Efrén (Unidad de Medicina Familiar Núm 18, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, 64690, Ixtlán del Río, Nayarit, Mexico); Velasco-González, Luisa Elizabeth (Unidad de Medicina Familiar Núm. 24, “Ignacio García Téllez”, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, 63190, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); de Lourdes García-Magaña, María (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Sánchez-Burgos, Jorge Alberto (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Sáyago-Ayerdi, Sonia Guadalupe (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Zamora-Gasga, Víctor Manuel (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico)","Zamora-Gasga, Víctor Manuel (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico)","García-Martínez, Diana Laura (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Alarcón-Domínguez, Edith Efrén (Mexican Social Security Institute); Velasco-González, Luisa Elizabeth (Mexican Social Security Institute); de Lourdes García-Magaña, María (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Sánchez-Burgos, Jorge Alberto (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Sáyago-Ayerdi, Sonia Guadalupe (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico); Zamora-Gasga, Víctor Manuel (Laboratorio Integral de Investigación en Alimentos, Instituto Tecnológico de Tepic/Tecnológico Nacional de México, 63175, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156455164,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

Land and freshwater vertebrates, and less commonly plants and invertebrates, constitute most of the La Venta fossils. The mammal record has been used to define the Laventan Age/Stage c. 13.5-11.8 million years old. La Venta has been studied for nearly a century, but the last major collecting efforts were done several decades ago. Recently, Colombian and international researchers have begun studies at La Venta, with the valuable participation of the local community. The joint efforts resulted in the establishment of a new La Venta natural history museum (Museo de Historia Natural La Tatacoa). This new wave of paleontological and geological studies has resulted in an improved stratigraphy of La Venta and new paleobiological and evolutionary hypotheses of several vertebrate groups, and in the museum's educational and outreach activities. Here, we review the current geological and paleontological knowledge of La Venta, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss future research directions. A century after the first paleontological expedition, La Venta's fossil record continues to illuminate the evolution of the South American tropical biodiversity during the Miocene. Le biome miocne de La Venta (Colombie): un sicle de recherche et des perspectives d'avenir. Les dpts de La Venta, en Colombie, fournissent l'un des assemblages fossiles les plus riches de l'Amrique du Sud tropicale et offrent une occasion exceptionnelle d'tudier l'effet des changements climatiques du Miocne et l'volution des clades teints et actuels dans un cosystme de basse latitude. Les vertbrs terrestres et d'eau douce, et plus rarement les plantes et les invertbrs, constituent la plupart des fossiles de La Venta. Le registre des mammifres a t utilis pour dfinir l'ge laventien, c. 13.5-11.8 millions d'annes. La Venta est tudie depuis prs d'un sicle, mais les dernires collectes importantes ont eu lieu il y a plusieurs dcennies. Rcemment, des chercheurs colombiens et internationaux ont entam des tudes La Venta, avec la participation prcieuse de la communaut locale. Ces efforts conjoints ont abouti la cration d'un nouveau Muse d'histoire naturelle La Venta (Museo de Historia Natural La Tatacoa). Cette nouvelle vague d'tudes palontologiques et gologiques a permis d'amliorer la connaissance de la stratigraphie de La Venta et de formuler de nouvelles hypothses palobiologiques et volutives pour plusieurs groupes de vertbrs. Nous faisons ici le point sur les connaissances gologiques et palontologiques actuelles de La Venta, identifions les lacunes de connaissances et discutons des orientations futures de la recherche. Un sicle aprs la premire expdition palontologique, les archives fossiles de La Venta continuent d'clairer l'volution de la biodiversit tropicale sud-amricaine au cours du Miocne. El bioma mioceno de La Venta (Colombia): un siglo de investigacin y perspectivas para el futuro. En los depsitos fosilferos de La Venta, en Colombia, se registra una de las biotas fsiles ms ricas de la porcin tropical de Suramrica, lo que representa una oportunidad excepcional para estudiar los efectos de los cambios climticos del Mioceno y la evolucin de clados existentes y extintos en un ecosistema de latitudes bajas. Los vertebrados terrestres y acuticos son los fsiles mayormente representados; mientras que registros de plantas e invertebrados son menos comunes. Se destaca, dentro de los grupos de vertebrados, una diversa comunidad de mamferos, la cual ha sido usada para definir el Piso Laventense c. 13.5-11.8 Ma. A pesar que La Venta ha sido estudiada por cerca de un siglo, los ltimos grandes esfuerzos de colecta se dieron hace varias dcadas. Recientemente investigadores colombianos y extranjeros, junto con la comunidad local, han llevado a cabo nuevas expediciones, que han dado como fruto el establecimiento de un nuevo museo de historia natural, el Museo de Historia Natural de La Tatacoa. Esta nueva ola de investigacin en la geologa y paleontologa de La Venta ha llevado a una mejora del registro estratigrfico, al desarrollo de nuevas hiptesis sobre la evolucin de varios grupos de vertebrados y al crecimiento y la mejora de las actividades de divulgacin y educacin del museo. En este trabajo presentamos una revisin de la informacin geolgica y paleontolgica de La Venta, identificamos vacos en el conocimiento y discutimos direcciones de investigacin en el futuro. Un siglo despus de la primera expedicin paleontolgica en La Venta, su registro fsil contina esclareciendo la historia evolutiva de la biodiversidad tropical de Suramrica en el Mioceno.","We thank E.

Excessive truck traffic, low density of railways in service, and no accessible river routes seem to be major determinant factors. This article proposes a balanced linear transshipment (BLT) model to estimate the optimal origin-destination (OD) multimodal freight transportation network for the mentioned city to seven main destinations in the country. This research also provides an appropriate framework for assessing several hypothetical transportation scenarios. Thus, based on national transport statistics, this study evaluates three main criteria: freight transportation cost, number of nodes, and number of routes. The results of analysis suggest that if alternative modes of transportation are implemented in Bogotá, the three mentioned criteria will improve substantially. The analysis is limited by the size of the OD transportation network considered, the assumptions associated with the research methodology, and the scope and diversity of data sources used as reference. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to examine the optimal OD transportation network in Bogotá by using a BLT model.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The effect of the ethanol percentage in the extracting solvent, static time, pressure and temperature on global extraction yield (YGE), total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AA) was evaluated. The extract from pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was characterized and compared to that obtained from Soxhlet and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). It appears that the increase of ethanol concentration in the solvent favored response variables, while the increase in static time and pressure did not affect the extraction. The temperature (125 ºC) provided an increase in YGE and the highest levels of active compounds were obtained after using 70% (v/v) ethanol in the extracting solvent (15 mL g−1) and 30 min. The different techniques evaluated provided similar YGE, while PLE providing greater extraction of TPC and AA, and Soxhlet favored the extraction of steviol glycosides and total flavonoids.",This work was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) [process number 88882.449245/2019-01].,,The Journal of Supercritical Fluids,,,,2023-02,2023,,2023-02,193,,105813,Closed,Article,"Raspe, Djéssica Tatiane; da Silva, Camila; da Costa, Silvio Cláudio","Raspe, Djéssica Tatiane (Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência de Alimentos, Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Av.

Tiny object detection (TOD) is a challenging task in computer vision due to the low resolution, insufficient geometric cues, and high noise levels. A recent trend for detectors is introducing more granular label assignment strategies to provide promising supervision information for classification and regression. However, most previous Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) based methods suffer from two main drawbacks, including (1) low tolerance of IoU for bounding box deviations in tiny objects and (2) deficient guidance for optimization caused by inter-sample and intra-sample imbalance. We propose two novel components to address these problems: the Gaussian probabilistic distribution-based fuzzy similarity metric (GPM) and the adaptive dynamic anchor mining strategy (ADAS). GPM aims to address the issue of inaccurate similarity measurement between small bounding boxes and pre-defined anchors, providing a more accurate basis for label assignment. ADAS adopts a dynamically adjusted strategy for label assignment to address the distribution bias between positive and negative samples, ensuring that the label assignment is consistent with the distribution of objects in the image. Extensive experiments are conducted on AI-TODv2 and other tiny object detection datasets to evaluate the proposed ADAS-GPM method’s performance. The results demonstrate that incorporating ADAS-GPM into an anchor-based object detector yields significant outperformance over state-of-the-art methods on the challenging AI-TODv2 benchmark. The proposed ADAS-GPM method exhibits good results, clearly demonstrating its validity and potential.","Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LZ22F020005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (62076185, U1809209).",,Neurocomputing,,,,2023-07,2023,,2023-07,543,,126285,Closed,Article,"Fu, Ronghao; Chen, Chengcheng; Yan, Shuang; Heidari, Ali Asghar; Wang, Xianchang; Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Mansour, Romany F.; Chen, Huiling","Fu, Ronghao (College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China; Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Changchun 130021, China); Chen, Chengcheng (School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang 110136, China); Yan, Shuang (College of Instrumentation and Electrical Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China); Heidari, Ali Asghar (Key Laboratory of Intelligent Informatics for Safety Emergency of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou 325035, China); Wang, Xianchang (College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China; Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education, Changchun 130021, China; Chengdu Kestrel Artificial Intelligence Institute, Chengdu 611730, China); Escorcia-Gutierrez, José (Department of Computational Science and Electronics, Universidad de la Costa, CUC, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Mansour, Romany F.

                    In this paper, the authors present an empirical framework that incorporates different factors of the impact of COVID-19 on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in La Rioja, Spain, in relation to the value chain, gender and family business and allows the evaluation of these impacts on the SMEs' outcomes.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The authors conduct exploratory research based on phone interviews with 329 business managers from SMEs in La Rioja (Spain), from June 1 to June 30 2021, using ordinary least squares linear regression and matching procedures to test the study hypotheses.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The results show that the impact of COVID-19 related to primary activities in adding value, such as inbound logistics, operations and marketing, have a positive influence on innovation outcomes in SMEs, as do female managers. Family SMEs present poorer innovation outcomes.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    At the organizational level, this paper may be of interest to management, and at the national and regional levels to policymakers, since it could help to develop policies that support SMEs' sourcing, operations and marketing in order to prepare for potential value chain disruptions. Additionally, this research may help decision-makers to foster and promote innovation in SMEs as a way of ensuring their resilience.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    In this paper, the authors provide novel evidence about the effect of COVID-19 in SMEs. Moreover, it has been shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the redefinition of supply chains at the organizational level.","Funding: This study has been supported by the Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, project B0036.",,International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research,,,,2023-02-28,2023,2023-02-28,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,Closed,Article,"Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio; González-González, Inés; Cerdá-Suárez, Luis Manuel; Seguí-Amortegui, Luis Alberto","Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, Madrid, Spain); González-González, Inés (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, Madrid, Spain); Cerdá-Suárez, Luis Manuel (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, Madrid, Spain); Seguí-Amortegui, Luis Alberto (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, Madrid, Spain)","Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja)","Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); González-González, Inés (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Cerdá-Suárez, Luis Manuel (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Seguí-Amortegui, Luis Alberto (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155756762,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

On the one hand, I explore part of literature on legislative studies to account for one of the communicative limits faced by legislation (Xanthaki, 2010, 2019) and on the other, present the instrumental nature of plain language to overcome this limit and achieve the widest possible dissemination of legislative messages for lay audiences. The work is based on a descriptive-analytical review of three public initiatives that inhabit three Latin America countries that, in turn, have in common a collective phenomenon called «Plain Language Networks». These Networks involve the parliaments of each country, and they are implementing (or have implemented) a very similar initiative: ‘Ley Fácil’ (Chile), ‘Ley Simple’ (Argentina) and ‘La ley en tu lenguaje’ (Uruguay). The paper draws, methodologically, on the results of a questionnaire sent to those responsible for the three initiatives, designed to understand their implementation in greater depth. Arguably, the initiatives are aimed and are framed by principles of open parliament, institutional strengthening, transparency, trust, and citizen participatory; my argument is that Ley Fácil (‘Eays Law’ (Chile)), Ley Simple (‘Simple Law’ (Argentina)) and La Ley en tu lenguaje (‘Law in your Language’ (Uruguay)) are, essentially, political pedagogy tools to increase the «ability of people to (i) access and (ii) understand the laws that govern their lives» (Roznai & Mordechay, 2016).","I would like to thank the public managers of the initiatives studied for their collaboration.

Such systems have generally used non-faradic, label-free impedance spectroscopic methods for harnessing the signal from the IDEs. While there is an increasing need for sensors (or sensor systems) to be sensitive, smaller, easier to operate, and cost-effective, the development and use of IDE-based sensors in multiple application domains make it very challenging. Thus, a state-of-the-art review of interdigitated electrode-based sensors is justified and is the primary focus of this paper. This paper reviews the working principles, mathematical models, design architectures, and fabrication methods of IDE-based sensors in three specific application domains (gaseous, biological, and inorganic). The performance of the IDE-based sensors across different applications, along with their limitation, have been illustrated. The emerging trend of 3-D interdigitated electrodes as sensing platforms has been discussed with additional perspectives on their overall future research needs.",,,IEEE Sensors Journal,,,,2023-11-28,2023,2023-11-28,,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,"Gutierrez, Heiner Castro; Panigrahi, Suranjan","Gutierrez, Heiner Castro (Purdue University, United States); Panigrahi, Suranjan (Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA)",,"Gutierrez, Heiner Castro (Purdue University West Lafayette); Panigrahi, Suranjan (Purdue University West Lafayette)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166444895,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

As such, color has been relegated to an invisible status, despite its essential visible qualities and color’s importance in the region’s social, symbolic, economic, and political processes. This article focuses on color and polychromy by studying objects from different funerary sites associated with the end of the regional pre-Columbian chronological sequence (ca. 1000–1500 AD). We present descriptions of the iconography and the symmetry of the motifs of these objects, and the first physicochemical characterization of the mineral paintings obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and hyperspectral imaging. With four new radiocarbon dates, we establish their chronology, associated in two cases with isotope measurements to evaluate the origin of the leather used. The research reveals a dual and simultaneous practice: while painted motifs demonstrated a visible interregional flow of information, paintings’ chemical analysis testifies to a pigment production probably associated with the local exploitation of mineral coloring matter. In contrasting visual and material productions, we explore mineral pigments’ social value and role during the late Atacama pre-Columbian period. Using an interdisciplinary approach regarding the materiality of color, we subsequently evaluate the social implications of mineral polychromy in this south-central Andean region.","We are grateful to the different museums visited during this investigation to preserve and share these fabulous archeological masterpieces: Ethnologische Museum del Staatliche Museen of Berlin and Manuela Fischer, Museo Regional de Iquique and its director Luis Perez, and Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, in particular to Cristian Becker and Francisco Garrido for their reception and support.

Materials and Methods: An electronic search without date restriction was carried out in the PubMed and Scopus databases. The articles were selected, and their characteristics, objectives, and methods were analyzed using the following keywords: “manual toothbrush,” “electronic toothbrush,” “interdental brush,” “dental plaque,” “gingivitis,” “periodontitis” and “mechanical cleaning.” Ten relevant studies investigating the uses and applications of manual versus electronic toothbrushes were selected for this review.   Results: The studies determined the efficacy of electronic and manual toothbrushes for the reduction of gingivitis and plaque, detailing the characteristics of the populations. Some studies evaluated the effectiveness of the two classes of brushes using different dental plaque indexes. One study determined plaque removal by comparing an interactive versus manual toothbrush, and two studies evaluated the effectiveness of the brushes in plaque reduction in a pediatric population. Based on the research articles, it was evident that some studies found no significant difference in biofilm removal in the use of electronic toothbrushes versus manual toothbrushes.   Conclusion: In summary, it is not possible to give a conclusion because there is a discrepancy between the authors, and further studies are needed to corroborate and contrast the usefulness of manual and electronic toothbrushes.",,,Journal of International Oral Health,,,,2023-11,2023,2023-12-29,2023-11,15,6,500-508,Closed,Article,"Castro, Sofía; Garay, Sedany; Espinoza-Carhuancho, Fran; Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel; Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo; Barja-Ore, John; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank","Castro, Sofía (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villareal, Lima, Peru); Garay, Sedany (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villareal, Lima, Peru); Espinoza-Carhuancho, Fran (Grupo de Bibliometria, Evaluacion de evidencia y Revisiones Sistematicas (BEERS), Human Medicine Career, Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Peru); Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (Academic Department, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Barja-Ore, John (Department of Research, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villareal, Lima, Peru)",,"Castro, Sofía (Federico Villarreal National University); Garay, Sedany (Federico Villarreal National University); Espinoza-Carhuancho, Fran (Scientific University of the South); Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel (Federico Villarreal National University); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Federico Villarreal National University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167543971,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

However, SMA has some limitations, such as getting trapped in local optima when dealing with multimodal or combinatorial functions. To overcome these limitations and improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation abilities, a local dimensional mutation strategy and an all-dimensional neighborhood search strategy for SMA, known as LASMA, were introduced. To evaluate the performance of LASMA, experiments were conducted on 30 benchmark functions from the CEC2014 competition, and the results were compared with up to 27 peers. The experimental results were then synthesized, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate the performance of LASMA. The results showed that LASMA outperformed other algorithms in terms of solution accuracy, stability, and convergence speed, with at least a 53.3% improvement in optimization performance on the 30 tested functions. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability of LASMA to feature selection problems, a binary version of LASMA called bLASMA was developed and compared with eight binary classification algorithms on 18 datasets from the UCI repository. The experimental results showed that bLASMA not only had faster convergence speed and higher convergence accuracy in handling optimization problems but also performed well in feature selection applications. Thus, LASMA is a promising optimization tool for handling global and binary optimization problems, and its binary version, bLASMA, can be used for feature selection tasks. By addressing the limitations of SMA and improving the algorithm's exploration and exploitation abilities, LASMA provides a robust and effective solution for various optimization problems.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The study approach is quantitative, non-experimental and cross-sectional. A questionnaire is used involving 116 students from 3 universities in Chile, who are studying in the Propaedeutic Programmes developed in these institutions (north, centre and south of the country). The results show differences between students; those studying at the university in the centre of Chile reveal a better understanding of teacher leadership competencies for inclusion through the promotion of technology, having observed that the leader dedicates much of their time management and effectiveness to student education, demonstrates human and technical qualities and deals with all forms of exclusion and inequality. Findings show that the presence of competent leadership encourages greater promotion of technologies in Chilean universities because, to the extent that the teacher fosters a climate of empathy and motivation and integrates ICTs, this contributes to inclusion in the Propaedeutic Programmes, constituting an experience that strengthens inclusive culture and pedagogical practice.",,,IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,,,,2023-10-12,2023,2023-10-12,2023-11-01,18,4,365-373,Closed,Article,"Villalobos-Egaña, Lenin; Delgado-García, Manuel; Villegas, Francisco Javier Villegas","Villalobos-Egaña, Lenin (Continuing Education Center, University of Antofagasta, Antofagasta, 1240000, Chile); Delgado-García, Manuel (Faculty of Education, Psychology and Sports Sciences, Department of Pedagogy, University of Huelva, 21007, Huelva, Spain); Villegas, Francisco Javier Villegas (Directorate of Curriculum Development, Teaching Innovation Management Area, University of Antofagasta, Antofagasta, 1240000, Chile)","Delgado-García, Manuel (University of Huelva)","Villalobos-Egaña, Lenin (University of Antofagasta); Delgado-García, Manuel (University of Huelva); Villegas, Francisco Javier Villegas (University of Antofagasta)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164935741,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education
359,pub.1159715870,10.1111/jace.19260,,,Exploring the luminescence of tin‐incorporated nickel‐sensitized lithium gallate short‐wave‐infrared phosphors,"Abstract  A series of Ni 2+ ‐sensitized LiGa 5 O 8 nanocrystals doped with varying amounts of Sn 4+ were synthesized via a high‐temperature solid‐state method. X‐ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were employed to investigate the microstructure of the LiGa 5 O 8 host, and optical spectroscopy was used to examine the effects of Sn 4+ addition on the emission spectra and persistent luminescence (PersL) properties, which indicated a homogeneous distribution of the constituent elements in the phosphor. The Sn 4+ incorporation led to an approximately sixfold enhancement of photoluminescence intensity at room temperature and decrease in the energy transition of Ni 2+ ( 3 T 2 ( 3 F)→ 3 A 2 ( 3 F)), which resulted in ∼65 nm bathochromic shift in the photoluminescence emission maxima. However, the addition of Sn 4+ dopant led to a decrease in the quantum yield of luminescence compared to that of the original phosphor. Temperature‐dependent thermoluminescence measurements revealed that doping of LiGa 5 O 8 with Sn 4+ interfered with the Ni 2+ trap centers. Moreover, Ni 2+ ‐sensitized Sn 4+ ‐doped LiGa 5 O 8 nanocrystals exhibited an afterglow effect that persisted for up to 300 s.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was made possible through the generosity of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, Military Engineering (USACE‐ERDC‐ME) with the support of Project Number 487706 and 508433.

324,pub.1165052876,10.1016/j.jcp.2023.112576,,,Approximated decompositions for computational continuum mechanics,"Solid and fluid mechanics problems often involve the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. One has short algebraic expressions for the Euler equations and the perfect gas equation of state. However, algebraic expressions for solid mechanics models can become substantial. Computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors algebraically for different models can become cumbersome. Also, larger formulae may result in increased overall computational time. Internal energy plays a significant role in modeling the medium, and thermodynamic consistency is indispensable. The models should correctly capture heat transfer, mechanical response, and fluid flow, e.g., in mechanocaloric and bone remodeling (BR) problems. In mechanocaloric problems, temperature variation occurs because of load and unload stresses. In BR problems, several mathematical models were developed for modeling its behavior. Flexibility for testing different models is an essential requirement. Hence, our goal is to propose and test approximated eigensystem and singular value (SVD) decompositions for continuum mechanics problems. We tested the resolution and accuracy of our propositions in benchmarking CFD problems. For the solid mechanics, we solved a few classical problems, verified the accuracy, and solved mechanocaloric tests and bar under tension. Although more expensive, the approximated eigensystem decomposition is more flexible. It is high-order and high-resolution, can capture heat transfer, fluid flow, discontinuities, and mechanical response, and can model real-world applications. The SVD is a viable possibility and can be used to adjust the computational time of severe situations, but it needs to be improved.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Computational Physics,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,495,,112576,Closed,Article,"Borges, Rafael B.deR.; Colman, Flávio C.; da Silva, Nicholas D.P.; Dicati, Gabriela W.O.; Gubaua, José E.; Shu, Chi-Wang","Borges, Rafael B.deR.

Another tool that would help improve educational delivery quality is the Service-Learning methodology that enables students to experience hands-on learning by working with real-life cases and firms. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a significant challenge in many areas, and education has not been an exception. Most educational institutions have moved from traditional brick-and-mortar to online or hybrid modern settings. However, teachers and students were not prepared for that significant movement, uncertain about how to deliver and receive it, respectively. Educational institutions faced issues developing competencies with teachers into students effectively. Research Questions: The research question is whether the application of the Agile and Service-Learning methodologies in a software engineering-related course of the “Ingeniería en Información y Control de Gestión” major at the Universidad Catolica del Norte in Chile would make a positive impact in both students and partners. Methodology: A mixed-methods approach with quantitative and qualitative analysis was used to understand and evaluate the underlying situation and outcomes. Findings: Our findings show that this setup of Service-Learning and agile framework increased teamwork, time management, and overall work satisfaction through a case study conducted in the course. Students positively evaluated the setting of goal expectations with community partners (i.e., an SME) and other critical learning aspects. Also, the community partners were more satisfied with the product delivery.",,"This work was supported in part by the “Fondo de Investigación en Docencia (FID 2021),” Universidad Católica del Norte.",IEEE Transactions on Education,,,,2023-09-22,2023,2023-09-22,2023-10-01,66,5,431-441,Closed,Article,"Duarte, Vannessa; Cleveland-Slimming, Margareth; Vidal, Cristian; Contreras, Sergio","Duarte, Vannessa (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, 1780000, Chile); Cleveland-Slimming, Margareth (Centro de Innovación Metodológica y Tecnológica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, 1780000, Chile); Vidal, Cristian (Escuela de Ingeniería en Desarrollo de Videojuegos y Realidad Virtual, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Talca, Talca, 3460000, Chile); Contreras, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, 1780000, Chile)","Duarte, Vannessa (Catholic University of the North)","Duarte, Vannessa (Catholic University of the North); Cleveland-Slimming, Margareth (Catholic University of the North); Vidal, Cristian (University of Talca); Contreras, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164298686,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education
323,pub.1162888274,10.1017/s001447972300011x,,,Kaolin particle film mitigates supra-optimal temperature stress effects at leaf scale and increases bean size and productivity of Coffea canephora,"Summary  In young plants of Coffea canephora , fine particle film based on calcined kaolin (KF) causes a decrease in leaf temperature (T leaf ), minimizing the damages to the photochemical apparatus, especially in summer season, but no report about the ecophysiological responses to KF over phenology is available on this species. We hypothesized that greater ecophysiological effects of KF would occur during the summer phenophase of leaf area and berry expansion (BE) compared with autumn berry maturation phase (BR), and that those benefits will have impact on bean productivity and physical quality. In this sense, the present study aimed to analyze the effects of KF on some ecophysiological parameters in the last phenophases of C. canephora biennial cycle, bean productivity, and bean size classification. During the complete phenological cycle, eight applications of KF were performed, totaling 80 kg of KF ha −1 in two years. KF applications and ecophysiological measurements occurred during the BE and BR phenophases. Firstly, we documented temporal dynamics in responses of field-grown C. canephora adult plants to KF application. KF reduced T leaf and crop water stress index and increased the thermal index of relative stomatal conductance and relative chlorophyll content (SPAD index) observed in the autumn BR (opposite to young plants). The positive impact of KF on chlorophyll a fluorescence was proportionally similar among the observed phenophases. Secondly, KF increased bean size 16 by 50% and increased total productivity. The plants treated with KF increased productivity by 1.7 t ha − commercially useful bean mass compared to the control. The kaolin dose of 40 kg ha −1 distributed four times per year was highly effective as a protection strategy against high-light and elevated T air .",,,Experimental Agriculture,,,,2023-07-31,2023,2023-07-31,2023,59,,e13,Closed,Article,"de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino; de Matos Roda, Newton; Krohling, Cesar Abel; Campostrini, Eliemar; Rakocevic, Miroslava","de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil); de Matos Roda, Newton (Department of Exact, Environmental and Technological Sciences (CEATEC), Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC), Campinas, SP, Brazil); Krohling, Cesar Abel (Institute Capixaba for Research, Marechal Floriano, ES, Brazil); Campostrini, Eliemar (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil); Rakocevic, Miroslava (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil)","Rakocevic, Miroslava (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil)","de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil); de Matos Roda, Newton (State University of Campinas); Krohling, Cesar Abel (Institute Capixaba for Research, Marechal Floriano, ES, Brazil); Campostrini, Eliemar (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil); Rakocevic, Miroslava (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162888274,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

As a direct consequence, it broadly affects plant growth, and photosynthetic efficiency is strongly influenced by nutritional imbalance. To deepen our understanding of how nutritional deficiencies affects photosynthesis, we removed the supply of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, S) one element at a time at hydroponic tobacco cultivation. Essential macronutrient deficiencies affected both photochemical and carboxylative steps of photosynthesis. In addition, interference on light absorption, energy quenching and the electron transport chain influenced carbon reactions. In particular, deficiencies in N and S depleted potential CO2 assimilation, while Ca deficiency affected CO2 diffusion (mainly gs), and light reactions were affected as well. P deficiency promoted severe damage to the antenna complexes and reaction centres of the photosystems. All deficiencies  increased  energy dissipation (ɸDo) and nonphotochemical dissipation (Kn). Reduction of ETR and probability of electron transport of QA− for plastoquinone (ΨEo and ɸEo) following distinct levels of damages to ETC were observed.","Thanks to Krzysztof Sitko at University of Silesia in Katowice (Poland) for encouragement and supporting to pipeline models, and Eliemar Campostrini and Guilherme Rodrigues de Souza at State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for supporting JIP-test.

Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes were used for very bright objects which were not observed by Gaia. The Ti II based distance estimation procedure is similar to the well known Ca II-method (Megier et al., 2005, 2009). However, there are at least 3 advantages of the Ti II method: in contrast to interstellar Ca II H and K lines, blending of Ti II with stellar lines is not an issue even for late B stars; Ti II is to a much less extent influenced by the saturation effect; only a single line must be measured, i.e. there is only a single measurement error to be taken into account. The relation of between Ti II $$EW$$ and distance is given by simple equation $$d\approx 30EW$$, where $$d$$ is the distance in pc and $$EW$$ is the equivalent width of the Ti II $$\lambda$$ 3383.759 line in mÅ.","This research has made use of the services of the ESO Science Archive Facility and the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France (https://simbad.unistra.fr/simbad/) and partially based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programmes 65.I-0379 (A), 68.C-0024 (A), 078.C-0403 (A), 194.C-0833 (A), 0102.C-0699 (A), 106.20WN.001.",GAG made data processing and analysis with the aid of instruments developed at Special Astrophysical Observatory with the financial support of grant No. 075-15-2022-262 (13.MNPMU.21.0003) of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation.,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2023-12,2023,2024-03-02,2023-12,78,4,550-556,Closed,Article,"Galazutdinov, G.

Here we report, the evaluation of the crystal size of graphene oxide(GO) quantum dots(QD) using optical and Raman spectroscopy. Raman studies indicate the D, G, and D¨ band, indicating the formation of GO-QD. Crystal size was estimated using the Raman spectra, which is 4.2 nm, comparable to Bohr size, indicating the synthesis GO is a QD. XRD, FTIR, FESEM, and EDAX were used to explore GO-QD and structural and physicochemical features. The XRD pattern revealed reflection planes (001) at 2θ = 9.50°. Crystal size was estimated using the Scherer equation, which is 2.2 nm. Moreover, the Optical spectra-based Brus model and Hyperbolic Band (HB) models have been used for the estimation of size. An FTIR was used to confirm the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups in GO. FESEM revealed that GO quantum dots have a sheet-like morphology. The zeta potential is used to determine the surface charge of dispersed components in the solution and the stability of the produced Nanofluid. The results indicate that small suspended particles resist aggregation and are distributed uniformly in solution. Thus, the synthesized GO-QD exhibit several exciting and unique qualities that make them suitable for numerous energy storage and conversion applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Our protagonist is a notion called disequilibrium, advanced some 25 years ago. We discover that, in the simple case of the Harmonic Oscillator, the QCT can easily be visualized and described in terms of the ratio between the disequilibrium and the frequency. If the disorder–degree is large, the classical treatment works fine. For small disorder–degree, one needs quantum recipes. We encounter that for a quantal HO in an excited state containing just two phonons one already enters the transition semi classical zone.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Physics Letters A,,,,2023-08,2023,,2023-08,480,,128981,Closed,Article,"Pennini, F.; Plastino, A.","Pennini, F.

Our investigation revolves around a five-dimensional spacetime, with the four-dimensional Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker geometry embedded within it. Additionally, we assume that the scalar field exists in this five-dimensional geometry (bulk) and possesses a nonzero mass. The resulting field equations constitute a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. We apply the Lie symmetry condition to identify all functional forms of the scalar field potential, ensuring that the field equations remain invariant under one-parameter point transformations. Consequently, we find that only the exponential potential exhibits Lie symmetries. Finally, the Lie invariants are used to construct similarity transformations, which enable us to derive exact solutions for the system.","AP was partially financially supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Numbers 131 604).

Objective: To determine the factors associated with the interruption of the use of contraceptive methods during the quarantine by COVID-19 in Peruvian women.   Methods: Analytical and cross-sectional study, which included 342 women who used a contraceptive method before the COVID-19 quarantine, to whom a virtual questionnaire disseminated on social networks was applied. Pearson's chi-square evaluated associations between method discontinuation and the factors studied.   Results: Of the total number of women, 45% discontinued the use of contraceptive methods during the COVID-19 quarantine. The predominant age range was from 18 to 34 years (93.9%). The factors associated with this interruption were age (p = 0.044), marital status (p < 0.001), parity (p < 0.001), sexual relations (p < 0.001), and searching for information by digital means (p = 0.044). The main reason for stopping use was fear of contagion by COVID-19 (42.8%).   Conclusion: About half of contraceptive method users interrupted their use during the COVID-19 quarantine, and the factors associated with said interruption were personal, reproductive, and informational.

Countries from the Global South are chiefly responsible for this shift. The research note draws attention to service investment that originates in Southern economies and is directed at markets of the same (sub)continent. Such dynamics have been neglected by academic debates focussed on global value chains and offshored, largely generic services. The authors argue that direct integration into global markets is often disadvantageous for firms from the South, as they tend to play a subordinate role, face the risk of disinvestment and hardly upgrade. Regional markets offer better opportunities. These ideas are applied to Argentina and South Africa. The fDi Markets database and qualitative information from secondary sources are used to get a better grasp of the expansion of Argentinean and South African providers of advanced services into Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. It is shown that regional markets matter.

The syntheses were carried out by a high temperature solid state reaction. The orthorhombic phase was prepared by pressing the parent compounds into pellets of 13 mm diameter. The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Luminescence up-conversion measurements were analyzed using a tunable continuous wave (CW) Ti:sapphire laser system tuned at 975 nm. The results show that the green up-conversion emission is more intense than the red one in both polymorphs. To gain further clarity on this matter, we have also conducted a study on down-shifting emission spectra measured at 378 nm, where only the strong green emission is observed. The pump power dependence and the decay curves of the (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) transition were also evaluated.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

These operational risks decrease the availability of drawpoints and impact compliance with the short-term mine production schedule. In these cases, the mine production schedule has to be updated, modifying the amount of mineral extracted from the drawpoints and often producing sub-optimal results. This study proposes a new methodology to incorporate operational risks in the short-term scheduling process in Block Caving mines. The proposed methodology employs a logistic regression model to define the drawpoints at high-risk and a multi-objective optimization model that determines the daily production to meet the grades and tonnage targets, and at the same time, minimize the operational risk. The proposed methodology is implemented in a case study in which the methodology is shown to reduce tonnage at high-risk of experiencing an event of inrush of fine material while meeting the production targets. The results of the present work demonstrate that it is possible to integrate operational risk in the short-term production scheduling of Block Caving mines, allowing the planner to modify the hierarchy of objectives to adapt to the mine's requirements.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Raul Castro reports financial support was provided by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo.

IV. Applications to stochastic matrices, Duke Math. J., 19, 75-91, 1952] and Rado’s theorem [B N Parlett, Symmetric matrix pencils, J. Comput. Appl. Math., 38, 373-385, 1991.]. These results allow us to change eigenvalues of the original matrix pencil without altering its regularity and in a quite simple way, even allowing to change infinite eigenvalues. We also present an extension of Rado’s theorem that allows changing eigenvalues of a regular symmetric matrix pencil without altering its symmetric structure, and we show how to use these results in order to change the eigenvalues of a quadratic polynomial matrix. Finally, we present numerical examples that confirm the expected results with the new extensions of these theorems.",,,Physica Scripta,,,,2023-06-28,2023,2023-06-28,2023-07-01,98,7,075230,Closed,Article,"González-Pizarro, Javier; Salas, Mario; Soto, Ricardo L","González-Pizarro, Javier (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

279,pub.1157105752,10.1007/s10668-023-03198-w,,,An investigation of supplier development through segmentation in sustainability dimensions,"Supplier segmentation is a strategic activity that evaluates suppliers, identifies different approaches, and identifies the most proper criteria to establish various segments. The main purpose is to form different supplier groups to adopt appropriate strategies for each group. Supplier development is another strategic activity designed to promote suppliers’ functions to create and maintain a network of competent suppliers that significantly affects a producer’s competitive advantage. To allocate scarce resources more efficiently, it is necessary to design some strategies to develop the suppliers for their different segments. This research has employed the sustainability approach that includes economic, environmental, and social dimensions to evaluate and then segment the suppliers. In the next step, the results of this segmentation have been utilized as a basis for supplier development. The sustainability approach is significant since it guarantees companies' short- and long-term interest by reducing expenditures and absorbing stakeholders who respect environmental and social values. To date, the sustainability approach has been used little for segmentation purposes. Using our supplier segmentation, the purchasing company was able to determine the economic, environmental, and social potential of its suppliers. As a result, the company can apply the appropriate development strategies that we proposed for each segment of its supplier base. We have employed an Interval Best–Worst Method and a Simple Additive Weighting in the grey environment to segment the suppliers and proposed a conceptual model to develop the suppliers in different segments (The proposed framework has been applied to a manufacturing company).",,,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",,,,2023-04-07,2023,2023-04-07,2024-06-01,26,6,14369-14403,Closed,Article,"Paybarjay, Hossein; Fallah Lajimi, Hamidreza; Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz","Paybarjay, Hossein (Industrial Management, Rahedanesh Institute of Higher Education, 47157-47441, Babol, Iran); Fallah Lajimi, Hamidreza (Department of Industrial Management, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, University of Mazandaran, 47416-13534, Babolsar, Iran); Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North)","Paybarjay, Hossein (Industrial Management, Rahedanesh Institute of Higher Education, 47157-47441, Babol, Iran); Fallah Lajimi, Hamidreza (University of Mazandaran); Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157105752,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3002 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies",

Our current research is focused on the development of carbon-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that incorporate low-temperature titanium oxide electron transport layers (ETLs) to enhance their photovoltaic performance. In our approach, we introduce potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) material into the pre-solution of the MAPbI3 perovskite to fabricate a light-harvesting layer. This promising technique has shown great potential in improving the overall performance of PSCs. This additive reduces the formation of non-radiative recombination centers, resulting in a perovskite layer that is desirable and free from defects. Furthermore, photovoltaic devices based on potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) exhibit reduced transfer resistance, leading to faster charge transfer at the interfaces of TiO2/perovskite and perovskite/carbon electrodes. As a result, the efficiency of PSCs can be improved by up to 14.89%, which is significantly higher than the recorded efficiency of unmodified PSCs at 12.05%. In addition, PSCs based on potassium hexacyanoferrate show greater stability in ambient air compared to their unmodified counterparts.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no competing financial interest.,"The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.",Optical Materials,,,,2023-08,2023,,2023-08,142,,113986,Closed,Article,"kumar, Anjan; Sayyed, M.I.; Sabugaa, Michael M.; Seemaladinne, Ramanjaneyulu; Gavilán, Juan Carlos Orosco; Singh, Parminder; Sharma, Amit; Kumar, T.

The electrochemical behavior was studied using cyclic voltammetry, revealing a cathodic wave at −0.46 V (Co(III)/Co(II)), an anodic wave at +0.20 V (Co(II)/Co(III)), and a reversible curve at −0.83 V vs Ag/AgCl, attributed to the Co(II)/Co(I) transition. The presence of a carboxylic acid group in cobaloxime allows anchoring of the complex to nanocrystalline titanium dioxide thin films. The adsorption equilibrium was investigated using the Langmuir isotherm, yielding a Kad value of 4.7 × 104 M−1. Furthermore, upon addition of NaBH4 to a TiO2 film sensitized with cobaloxime, new bands appeared in the visible spectrum at 450 and 700 nm. The origin of these bands was investigated through theoretical calculations at the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G+(d) level of theory, which can be described as metal-to-ligand charge transfer.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Sebastian Pizarro reports financial support was provided by University of La Serena.

To overcome this obstacle and increase its scientific productivity, Cuba drove scientific collaboration with countries in Europe and Latin America. This study explores the role of Cuban scientific collaboration with the U.S. in the absence of diplomatic relations between those countries. The results suggest that Mexico acts as a bridge for increasing scientific collaboration between Cuba and the U.S.—measured as the number of coauthored papers published in WoS and Scopus. When the number of papers co-authored by Cuban academics with their Mexican peers doubled, the number of articles coauthored by Cuban and U.S. scientists in Scopus grew 9.31 times 23.22$$2^{3.22}$$ and 8.11 times 23.08$$2^{3.08}$$. in WoS. The findings support the hypothesis that scientific collaboration favors an increase in the productivity and scientific visibility of countries. Furthermore, the results suggest that scientific collaboration helps to lay bridges between science systems in the absence of diplomatic relations and even in the presence of political and economic hostility between them. Strengthening international scientific collaboration makes it possible for the science systems of developing countries to overcome limitations on resources and carry out cutting-edge research, and also to incorporate their scientists in mainstream research in the areas that promote their technological-scientific development.",The author thanks four reviewers’ encouraging suggestions to a previous version of the manuscript.,"The author received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.",Scientometrics,,,,2023-03-07,2023,2023-03-07,2023-04,128,4,2301-2315,Closed,Article,"Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando","Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando (Vicerrectoría de Desarrollo Estratégico y Calidad, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709, Antofagasta, Chile; Departamento de Turismo, Universidad de Holguín, Avenida XX Aniversario, 80100, Holguín, Cuba)","Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando (Catholic University of the North; University of Holguín)","Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando (Catholic University of the North; University of Holguín)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156019642,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

This feature make them potential candidates for many technological applications, including thermoelectrics. In this work, we combined density functional theory calculations with the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism to investigate the electronic and thermoelectric properties of recently synthesized quantum dots in graphene nanoribbons under the presence of an applied gate voltage, and for different temperatures. We find that the electronic states at the band edge are highly localized in the inner region of the quantum dot, and can be lifted to higher energies by applying a gate voltage, which subsequently enhances figure of merit. Moreover, at zero gate voltage and room temperature, we estimate the lower bound for Z T to be approximately 0.25. Interestingly, this lower bound can exceed unity by smoothly increasing the gate voltage for values above 6 V. The overall results regarding the enhancement of Z T suggest that quantum dots in graphene nanoribbons would be promising candidates for thermoelectric applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The recently found nitrogen-rich (N-rich) metal-poor field stars are promising candidates of these GC escapees, since N enhancement is the fingerprint of chemically enhanced populations in GCs. In this work, we discuss the possibility of identifying N-rich metal-poor field stars with the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). We focus on the main survey camera with NUV, u, g, r, i, z, y filters and slitless spectrograph with a resolution about 200. The combination of UV sensitive equipment and prominent N-related molecular lines in the UV band bodes well for the identification: the color–color diagram of (u − g) versus (g − r) is capable of separating N-rich field stars from normal halo stars, if metallicity can be estimated without using the information on u-band photometry. Besides, the synthetic spectra show that a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is sufficient to identify N-rich field stars. In the near future, a large sample of N-rich field stars found by CSST, combined with state-of-the-art N-body simulations will be crucial to deciphering GC-Galaxy co-evolution.","J.Z., B.T., C.L., and L.W. gratefully acknowledge support from the China Manned Space Project Nos.

 Perovskite solar cells with carbon electrodes (C-PSCs) are one of the low-cost and new-generation solar cell technologies to solve global energy demands. In the current research, an additive engineering approach to a perovskite precursor based on sodium azide (NaN 3 ) material was employed to fabricate stable and efficient C-PSCs. The NaN 3 additive boosted perovskite solution spreading on the SnO 2 electron transport layer (ETL), resulting in a well-oriented perovskite layer with improved micro-morphology. The NaN 3 additive reduced non-radiative charge recombination through the reduction of the trap density within the perovskite layer. This increased the photovoltaic performance and generated C-PSCs with a champion efficiency of 14.90%, higher than the 12.94% obtained for the unmodified C-PSCs. Indeed, the NaN 3 modifier increased the J SC and fill factor (FF) parameters by reducing charge transfer resistance ( R ct ) and increasing charge recombination resistance ( R rec ). In addition, it was observed that the NaN 3 -modified C-PSCs present higher shelf and ambient stability than the unmodified C-PSCs, revealing the potential of the NaN 3 material for assembling efficient and stable C-PSCs.",,,New Journal of Chemistry,,,,2023-04-24,2023,2023,2023-04-24,47,16,7765-7773,Closed,Article,"Kumar, Anjan; Sayyed, M.

The modified shallow water system is consisted by three hyperbolic first-order partial differential equations. The admitted Lie symmetries form a four-dimensional Lie algebra, the A 3,3 ⊕ A 1 . However, for the viscosity free model, the admitted Lie symmetries are six and form the A 5,19 ⊕ A 1 Lie algebra.

These compounds were treated with a strong base, obtaining the precursors 3a and 3b, respectively. In the case of compound 3c, this was synthesized by direct nitration of o-vanillin. Finally, compounds 3a-3c were methylated, obtaining compounds 4a-4c. The synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques, where the structures of 3a-3c, and 4b-4c were confirmed by X-ray diffraction techniques. The intermolecular contacts were studied by Hirshfeld surface analyses. Crystal topology was analyzed by energy framework studies in order to observe further physical chemical properties, such as the development of potential high-dose prolonged-release drugs for long-term control of Parkinson's disease in advanced patients, related to entacapone derivates.","Authors thank the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT-México) and the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID-Chile) for the financial support of this research (Grants No. 294810 and 3190500, respectively), of NMR facilities (Grant INFR-2011-3-173395), and of X ray facilities (Grant INFR-2014-224405) and Tecnológico Nacional de México (TecNM grant 13920.22-P).

The strong fluorescence was observed at 468 nm for Cu2+ ions over other tested metal ions by R, which could be attributed to the constraint of the CHN isomerization mechanism and provoked chelation enhanced fluorescence effect (CHEF) upon interaction with copper ions. According to Job’s plot, the binding proportion between R and copper ion is 2:1 and further validated by mass analysis and quantum chemical studies. Based on the emission titration, the limits of detection (LOD) were determined to be 0.194 μM. The obtained results designate that the receptor R serves as a significant nominee for an expeditious recognition of Cu2+ ions. Further, R was fruitfully useful in molecular keypad locks, and molecular logic gate circuits and it could be applied to find out the trace quantity of Cu2+ ions in water samples.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The lattice parameters computed with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional were decreased as phosphorus (P) impurities were substituted for Sn cations. The band structure of PTO computed with the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional showed an optical energy bandgap widening effect, because of a large Moss-Burstein shift and a small exchange–correlation-induced bandgap narrowing. Also, the P impurities in SnO2 induced shallow donor P-3s states in the conduction band minimum near Fermi level. The electron effective mass of the systems was calculated to be 0.25 m0 . DFT calculations also predicted a 5.9 × 1020 cm−3 electron density for PTO, which could increase the electrical conductivity of SnO2. These features make PTO a promising material for transparent conducting applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In contrast with previous proposals, it is found that the transition is not due to a progressive closing of the initial band gap but to the inversion of the relative stability of two different polymorphs under pressure. The Fermi surface of the new metallic state under low pressure (polymorph V′) is discussed, and the possible occurrence of as yet unknown incommensurate phases is suggested. The reason for the inversion of stability of the two polymorphs is discussed.","This work was supported by Spanish MICIU (Grants No. PID2022-139776NB-C61 and No. PID2021-128217NB-I00) and Generalitat de Catalunya (Grants No. 2021SGR01519 and No. 2021SGR00286).

This sound fills the onset position of vowel initial verbs in Sepedi, and is responsible for the drastic alternation when the verb comes into contact with a reflexive prefix or an object concord. This article examines the effect of morphophonological realisation on inflected verbal roots with initial vowel sounds in Sepedi. The data collected through documents and semi-structured interviews shows that the glottal catch makes verbs follow the CV syllable pattern. The vowel reflexive prefix which threatens to create a hiatus is repaired through epenthesis by adding a sound to the interior of a word (at the beginning of prosthesis). This repair strategy ensures that the CV syllable structure of Sepedi is maintained. This article provides new data that offers innovative understanding of Sepedi on the concepts such as epenthesis and hiatus, relating to alternations in morphophonological environments using the optimality theory.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2023-05-04,2023,2023-10-13,2023-05-04,43,2,122-130,Closed,Article,"Letsoalo, Napjadi","Letsoalo, Napjadi (Deparlment of Linguistics and Modern Languages, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa)","Letsoalo, Napjadi (University of South Africa)","Letsoalo, Napjadi (University of South Africa)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164932260,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

CG samples were stored at 6, 10 and 20 °C for 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days. Each day samples were imaged, evaluated by a sensory panel and characterized in physicochemical composition. The best region of interest in hyperspectral images was selected, then a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed. The time-related PC2 scores were extracted, used to build kinetic charts and fit to zero-order reaction (R2 > 0.82). From the sensory evaluation, we defined cut-off value of -0.3576, corresponding to the sample stored at 20 °C for 6 days. Finally, the shelf life was estimated at 7.5 days, 15.4 days and 20.5 days for cape gooseberry stored at 20, 10 and 6 °C, respectively. In conclusion, we developed a non-contact method based on NIR-HSI to estimate the shelf life of cape gooseberry, which is related to global degradation, being more realistic.","Declaration of Competing Interest None.

We specifically examine a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker universe with a dust fluid source, employing fQ$$f\left( Q\right) $$-theory of gravity. Our goal is to analyze the dynamical evolution of cosmological parameters to reconstruct the cosmological history. We reproduce previous findings; nevertheless due to the presence of the dust fluid, new asymptotic solutions exist. We emphasize the significance of selecting the appropriate connection, as it dramatically change the cosmological dynamics. Additionally, we show that for the simple power-law fQ$$f\left( Q\right) $$ model, there exist a non-coincidence connection where the field equation reconstruct the main epochs of the cosmological history, that is, inflation, radiation epoch, matter era and the late-time acceleration is attributed to the de Sitter solution, which is the unique attractor of the solution trajectories.

The incorporation of β-MnO2 NRs and the formation of 6-PICA nanowires are verified by SEM, TEM, Raman, powder XRD, and XPS, where the nanowires perform as an electroactive material and also as an environment to disperse the β-MnO2 nanorods, at different concentrations. The study as a supercapacitor material shows that the specific capacitance of 6-PICA|β-MnO2 NRs is 61.35 mFcm−2, higher than that of 6-PICA (43.01 mFcm−2) deposited on the ITO conductive glass electrode. These results indicate that the presence of pure phase β-MnO2 in the form of nanostructure enhances the specific capacitance and ion diffusion in the charge-discharge process of 6-PICA at higher current densities without losing significant stability after 1000 cycles.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This study formally tested whether complete mitochondrial genomes of R. diazi can be assembled from non-enriched metagenomic libraries generated from eDNA (field droppings) using Illumina 300 bp pair-end reads. Using a direct assembly strategy, the mitogenome of R. diazi was assembled and circularised using the pipeline GetOrganelle with a coverage of 18.5× from one eDNA sample. A second strategy in which reads were first mapped to a reference mitochondrial genome and then assembled using the software SPAdes retrieved a second nearly complete mitogenome (2.7×) of R. diazi from a second eDNA sample. Complete or nearly complete mitochondrial genomes were not retrieved from two other eDNA samples. The organisation of the complete or nearly complete mitochondrial genomes recovered from eDNA samples is identical to that already described for the studied species. A phylomitogenomic analysis based on all protein coding genes (PCGs) demonstrated that the mitochondrial genomes assembled from eDNA can and do reliably identify the sequenced samples as belonging to R. diazi and distinguished the same samples from closely and distantly related cofamilial species. This study demonstrates the feasibility of retrieving fully accurate whole and nearly complete mitochondrial chromosomes of host species from eDNA without enrichment strategies and using straightforward bioinformatics pipelines. This new genomic resource developed for R. diazi represents a new tool to boost conservation strategies (bioprospecting and/or biomonitoring) and improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of this endemic and endangered species.",Many thanks to Dr Vincent P.

In particular, in Jaque and San Martin (J Differ Equ 266:3580–3600, 2019) was studied the definition of topological entropy by using separated and spanned sets, respectively, associated to a certain pseudosemimetric. Besides, it was proved that for regular impulsive semiflows the notion obtained by using separated sets can be computed trough a suitable conjugacy with a continuous system. In this paper, we will show that the same result holds for the entropy defined by spanning sets by adding a mild condition on the semiflow.

We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics by investigating the stationary points and reconstruct the cosmological history. This analysis gives important information for the initial value problem in Weyl integrable spacetime. We study three cases, in which the scalar field mass depends only on the density of the ideal gas, with or without cosmological constant term, and when there exists an exponential scalar field potential. We conclude that the existence of the nonzero potential function is essential in order that a spatially flat FLRW universe which can describe inflation can be a future attractor.","AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION Andronikos Paliathanasis: Methodology; writing—original draft.

Within this context, the progression of research efforts aimed at enhancing the yield of this crop holds paramount importance. In this regard, the application of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) during pivotal growth and developmental phases of L. esculentum emerges as a subject of profound interest. A multitude of investigations have elucidated that zinc, when administered within optimal thresholds, exerts dual roles as both a biofertilizer and a biopesticide, concurrently displaying potential to elevate the nutritional content of consumable fruits, thereby heralding transformative perspectives for conventional agricultural practices. Against this backdrop, this study aims to delineate the nuanced impact of various concentrations of biogenically synthesized ZnO NPs on the growth and maturation trajectory of L. esculentum (tomato). The research trajectory encompassed the synthesis of ZnO NPs and their subsequent characterization. Sequentially, a planned inoculation regimen was orchestrated, comprising six distinct experimental cohorts. Following emergence, a series of assessments were conducted, each spanning a 30-day interval, wherein an array of growth and developmental parameters were meticulously gauged, encompassing variables such as stem elongation, stem thickness, leaf density, floral abundance, cluster profusion, and fruit setting. A judicious amalgamation of empirical data acquisition and statistical scrutiny unveiled discernible differentials among the experimental modalities, significantly signifying the propitious influence of zinc oxide nanoparticles on the scrutinized variables. Consequently, it is unequivocally deduced that the sixth treatment regimen, characterized by the administration of 99.076 ppm ZnO NPs, engenders a constructive modulatory effect upon the stature of stem elongation, stem thickness, leaf density, floral abundance, cluster profusion, and fruit yield concerning L. esculentum. This discovery corroborates the potential of ZnO NPs to prognosticate an effective augmentation in the growth and development of this pivotal crop species.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A flexible dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) architecture is preferred for such applications. A key component of the DSSC is the dye-sensitized photoanode. Herein, we examine different nanoparticle composites within the semiconductor anode formulation and their effect on device performance. Mesoporous titania particles (TiO2) modified with Au-nanoparticles (TiO2@AuNPs) were synthesized using precipitation strategies to assess the solvent effect on the particle size and the efficiency of the devices. The materials were then fully characterized through SEM, XRD, and DRS before and after thermal treatment. A paste prepared from the synthesized semiconductors was applied onto the substrate using the doctor blading technique. The use of high thermal treatment for glass substrates (HTT), low-temperature thermal treatment (LTT), and LTT combined with 2 h of UV curing (LTT_UV) was explored. In the case of ITO/PET (flexible substrate) only low temperature thermal treatment were used (LTT and LTT_UV). After characterization (XRD and DRS), the anodes were loaded using a metal-free dye. To complete the comparison, several groups of cells were characterized: considering solvent (EtOH and EtOH:H2O), thermal treatment (HTT, LTT, and LTT_UV), and semiconductor material (TiO2 and TiO2@AuNP). Rigid (glass anode-glass cathode) and semiflexible (flexible anode-glass cathode) DSSCs were obtained with efficiencies from 0.03% to 2.4%, with a substantial performance difference seen using different thermal treatments, and a mild to low effect on semiconductor composition and the used substrate.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Mixtures substituting 5, 7, and 10% of wet sludge (WS) and 5, 10, and 20% of calcined sludge (CS) were produced. For the macro scale analyses, the specimens were tested by water absorption, compressive and tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity. Carbonation, leaching, microtomography 3D, and SEM were carried out for the micro-scale analyses. From the results obtained, it can be observed that the WS significantly reduces the strength of concrete, not being indicated for applications in structural concrete. The replacement of up to 20% of sand with CS. In addition to increasing the compressive strength of the concrete, increased porosity, water absorption, and carbonation depth requires attention to durability aspects for using this residue in the production of structural and non-structural concretes. Using wastewater treatment sludge can contribute to circularity in the construction industry in line with sustainable development goals.Graphical Abstract","The authors thank the Itaipu Concrete Technology Laboratory for supporting the experimental project and the Sanepar&#x27;s research support.

Currently, L. longicaudis is considered ‘near threatened’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. This study renders the first genomic resource for L. longicaudis; its mitochondrial genome was assembled and characterised in detail. The AT-rich mitochondrial genome of L. longicaudis was 16,436 bp in length and encoded 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a 994 bp long putative control region (CR). The heavy use of CTA (Leu), ATA (Met), and ATC (Ile) codons in PCGs contributes to the AT-rich nature of this genome. Out of 22 tRNAs, tRNA-Ser (AGY) (trnS1) lacked a typical ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structure. In the CR, numerous microsatellites and two tandem repeats were detected as well as multiple ‘hairpin’ structures. Ka/Ks values estimated for all but one PCG were < 1, indicating purifying selection in most PCGs. atp8 experienced neutral selection. A phylogenomic analysis based on PCGs confirms the monophyly of the family Mustelidae and also supports the monophyletic status of the subfamilies Guloinae, Helictidinae, Melinae, Mustelinae and Lutrinae; Ictonychinae was found to be polyphyletic. In the Lutrinae, L. longicaudis had an early branching position. The characterisation of a complete mitochondrial genome in the Neotropical otter L. longicaudis constitutes the first step towards supporting conservation efforts using genomic tools in this and other mustelids inhabiting aquatic neotropical environments under considerable contemporary anthropogenic disturbance.","The authors are grateful to Dr Vincent P.

For the Industrial IoT to function as an infrastructure for data collection of shop floor equipment, cloud computing is required; distributed computing would move to the edge due to speed requirements for real-time processing of massive data. The method describes the standard manufacturing system built on a private cloud system that gathers data in real time from smart technologies linked to shop-floor objects.The study aims to design a general structure for information and data acquisition, processing, and collection at the edges of massive production controllers, where the approach is determined by the collection of shop-floor objects. The implementation of a multi-criteria adaptive scheduling technique that conducts accurate and effective scheduling or rescheduling of production processes in real time while taking shop-floor data and condition-based services into consideration. To move towards the Internet of Things, the different parts of the created cyber-physical mechanism will be applied in a cloud setting. The entities are made up of industrial assets that embed work-in-progress on items throughout their production phase of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), which work together intelligently in such systems to achieve and maintain the manufacturing process's optimum, manage disruptions, and adapt to changing circumstances.The CPPS architecture joins a system with the IoT nodes made up of IoT accesses, and instruments, including PC-style terminals holding the resource agents with such a private cloud service. The decentralized MES network of a semi-hierarchical cloud-based CPPS controlling system is comprised of both networks. The development of the manufacturing process, controlling, monitoring, including optimization, as well as the archiving of historical data, are the major functions of the management system. The assessment of power consumed is presented together with an implementation framework.

To this aim, a representative model of aluminum nitride (AN) nanocage scaffold and two of its boron and gallium doped forms (BAN and GAN) were investigated towards the adsorption of thiotepa (Tep) anticancer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to evaluate the stabilized structures and their corresponding electronic features. The results indicated the contribution of N-head and S-head of Tep to interactions with each scaffold resulting six complexes; NTep@AN and STep@AN, NTep@BAN and STep@BAN, NTep@GAN and STep@GAN. In each complex model, the characteristic features were obtained based on the interactions details and frontier molecular orbitals related features. In this regard, the investigated scaffolds were found suitable for adsorbing the Tep substance with different strengths and frontier molecular orbitals levels yielding the possibility of assigning specified recovery time and conductance. As a consequence, the models of investigated scaffolds were found suitable to work as possible carriers of Tep anticancer for approaching the nano-based drug delivery purposes.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In addition to geological and mineralogical descriptions, bulk chemistry of the host rocks, microthermometric and sulfur isotropic analyses were performed to elucidate ore‐forming characteristics of the three orebodies. Chemical data of the host rocks indicate a subalkaline calc‐alkaline affinity with enrichment of the incompatible LILEs, displaying a typical pattern of igneous rocks formed in subduction zones as a general characteristic of the Jurassic‐Lower Cretaceous magmatic arc. Chalcopyrite is the predominant hypogene copper mineral, that variously occurs as veinlets, disseminations and breccia matrix. Fluid inclusions data indicate formation temperatures of the hypogene mineralization ranging mostly from 186 to 377°C, with a high‐salinity range of 30.1 and 45.0 wt% NaCl. The sulfur isotopic ratios (δ 34 S CDT ) of pyrite and chalcopyrite present a narrow range of values from −10.6 to −7.5‰. The negative values in the limited range imply that sulfide minerals of the Pelusa area were formed under a relatively oxidizing and/or neutral pH condition, compared with other Chilean IOCG deposits.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was performed as a graduate thesis of the first author, and the staffs of SCM Franke are appreciated for their kind cooperation.

It is shown that the multimodal Sotolongo Costa distribution fits better than current models for antropogenic seismic real data. The value of the entropic parameter q in many cases varies significantly for the different modes in the multimodal Sotolongo Costa distribution. Thus, changes are shown for the correlation structure in the low energy tremors and the high energy ones. The seismic hazard are compared using unimodal and multimodal models. We show that the first models in many cases underestimate the occurrence probability of damage quakes compared to the multimodal models, which can lead to misinterpretations on the evolution of mining-related seismicity.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Besides, it is a requirement for the factories to be run, Industries to be developed, cities to have functioned, and populations to fulfill their needs and expectations. Thus, energy has a strategic position among nations and countries. Align with sustainability, nations want to have energy justice among various generations. In this regard, this study developed a comprehensive framework based on a complete literature review, to evaluate energy poverty (EP) by addressing the energy demand, clean generation of the energy, its strategic position, and energy justice among the nations. As a consequence, the EP framework consists of three pillars. The first one is for society to address the demand, access, and affordability of energy. The second pillar is administration to ensure the accessibility to the sources of energy as well as aligning the energy market by their import policies. The third EP pillar is sustainability and refers to the emissions which result from the energy generations and level of renewable energy sources to satisfy the energy demand. By considering these three pillars, energy would be accessible, affordable, and sustained among various generations.

The cases of Gatico and Ollagüe,"The Antofagasta region, now part of northern Chile, belonged to Bolivia until the so-called War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Since the end of the nineteenth century, with the irruption of foreign and national capitals, the area witnessed intense industrialisation and mining expansion. Industrial mining modified local communities’ livelihoods, social practices, landscapes, and ecologies. Gatico (coast) and Ollagüe (highlands) were two mining centres that agglutinated a significant migrant workforce to produce copper and sulphur, respectively. Now dismantled, both peripheric extractive spaces form an ‘industrial topology’ structured outside the national margins. Abandoned industrial infrastructures and the chemical debris of mining activities reconfigure the current geopolitics of memory among local communities. Tensions and dissonances emerge from the touristic and economic ‘museumification’ of these sacrifice zones and their industrial ruins.","The authors would like to thank Tiziana Gallo, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful insights.","This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT, ANID Chile) [grant number 11180932 and 11220113] and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",International Journal of Heritage Studies,,,,2023-02-23,2023,2023-02-23,2023-04-03,29,4,243-259,Closed,Article,"Galaz-Mandakovic, Damir; Rivera, Francisco","Galaz-Mandakovic, Damir (Dirección de Investigación, Postgrado y Transferencia Tecnológica, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Rivera, Francisco (The Archaeology Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)","Rivera, Francisco (University of Toronto; Catholic University of the North)","Galaz-Mandakovic, Damir (University of Tarapacá); Rivera, Francisco (University of Toronto; Catholic University of the North)",4,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155685789,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",

                    This paper aims to analyse whether the degree of formal financial access in a country affects love money investment, defined as capital provided to entrepreneurs from family and friends to finance their businesses, in early-stage entrepreneurial activities.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The authors use multilevel mixed-effect regression models and an extensive database of over 700 thousand individuals from 53 countries between 2007 and 2017 taken from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor adult population survey.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    This paper finds that a country’s level of accessibility to bank debt and venture capital is positively associated with the likelihood of an individual becoming a love money investor. It also finds that the amount of capital invested by love money investors is positively correlated to the level of access to bank debt and venture capital. The results of this paper confirm the hypothesis of complementarity between the financial system and friends and family financing in the capital market for early-stage entrepreneurs.

The Strength Reduction Factor (SRF) methodology was used in conjunction with the MPM, NLA, and FEM to analyze the stability of this structure under dry and saturated conditions. In this paper, we introduced a methodology for applying the SRF technique within the framework of the MPM in a three-dimensional (3D) context. The paper compares and discusses results from the three analysis methods concerning the factor of safety and failure mechanisms. In particular, the failure surface and the run-out condition were also evaluated for a hypothetical case with large deformations using MPM. The results obtained from the three numerical methods exhibited good consistency. Regarding FEM, NLA required the least computational cost to get the safety factor, being a more appealing tool for its estimation, and the MPM allowed consideration of large deformations in the simulations without any additional numerical treatments like remeshing. The current work demonstrates a potential strategy for combining MPM, NLA, and FEM approaches to determine the failure mechanism and the post-rupture processes with large deformations.",,"The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.",Geotechnical and Geological Engineering,,,,2023-11-27,2023,2023-11-27,2024-06,42,4,2601-2622,Closed,Article,"Fernández, Fabricio; Juajinoy, David Sebastian Calpa; Vargas, Eurípedes; Velloso, Raquel Quadros; Dias, Daniel","Fernández, Fabricio (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Juajinoy, David Sebastian Calpa (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Vargas, Eurípedes (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Velloso, Raquel Quadros (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Dias, Daniel (Antea Group, Antony, France; CNRS, Grenoble INP, 3SR, University of Grenoble Alpes, 38000, Grenoble, France)","Fernández, Fabricio (Catholic University of the North)","Fernández, Fabricio (Catholic University of the North); Juajinoy, David Sebastian Calpa (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Vargas, Eurípedes (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Velloso, Raquel Quadros (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Dias, Daniel (Antea Group (France); Grenoble Institute of Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166400085,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Using the finite element simulation (FEM) and continuous damage mechanics (CDM) model, a fatigue life database is built. The stacked machine learning (ML) model's iterative optimization during training enables precise fatigue predictions (2.41% root mean square error [RMSE], R 2 = 0.975) for diverse structural components. Outliers are found in regression analysis, indicating potential overestimation for thickness transition specimens with extended lifetimes and underestimation for open-hole specimens. Correlations between fatigue life, stress factors, nominal stress and temperature are unveiled, enriching comprehension of LCF, thus enhancing solder behavior predictions.    Design/methodology/approach  This paper introduces stacked ML as a novel approach for estimating LCF life of SAC305 solder in various structural parts. It builds a fatigue life database using FEM and CDM model. The stacked ML model iteratively optimizes its structure, yielding accurate fatigue predictions (2.41% RMSE, R 2 = 0.975). Outliers are observed: overestimation for thickness transition specimens and underestimation for open-hole ones. Correlations between fatigue life, stress factors, nominal stress and temperature enhance predictions, deepening understanding of solder behavior.    Findings  The findings of this paper highlight the successful application of the SMLA in accurately estimating the LCF life of SAC305 solder across diverse structural components. The stacked ML model, trained iteratively, demonstrates its effectiveness by producing precise fatigue lifetime predictions with a RMSE of 2.41% and an “ R 2 ” value of 0.975. The study also identifies distinct outlier behaviors associated with different structural parts: overestimations for thickness transition specimens with extended fatigue lifetimes and underestimations for open-hole specimens. The research further establishes correlations between fatigue life, stress concentration factors, nominal stress and temperature, enriching the understanding of solder behavior prediction.

In this context, this paper aims to analyse the influence of construction practices, organised by factor in sustainability dimensions. For this, a survey with 80 project managers from the construction industry was performed. The participants answered about the sustainable management practices used in their projects, as well as their performance in relation to indicators in the social, economic and environmental dimensions. The data were analysed through confirmatory factor analysis and logistic regression. It was possible to verify that not all of the analysed factors (as well as the practices that compose them) could be considered significant to explain all dimensions of sustainability. Another interesting finding is that the influence levels of the factors vary widely, indicating that some factors are more important than others in the pursuit of (one or more) sustainability dimensions. In addition, contrary to expectations, not all factors (and therefore not all practices) have a positive impact on the sustainability of construction projects. The resource management and pollution factor negatively influences economic sustainability.

Although this is the case, the literature shows that the environmental problems of abandoned mines have received more attention from scholars than their physical hazards and other related problems. This review paper discusses the physical hazards of abandoned mines with a special focus on the situation of these mines in South Africa. The systematic review of the literature including scientific articles published in journals indexed to the Web of Science and Google Scholar database and other grey literature accessible through Google Search was conducted to investigate the different physical hazards of abandoned mines in South Africa. The review looked at the safety hazards and risks of disused mine shafts, surface excavation, ground subsidence, and other objects such as dilapidated buildings, infrastructure, old equipment, as well as residue waste. The last part of the paper deliberates on the practical approach for effectively closing abandoned mines in the country with the aim of addressing their hazards to support sustainable alternative uses of the closed abandoned mine sites. The conclusion emphasized the importance of incorporating a vigorous awareness campaign and effective post-closure monitoring and maintenance into the program of closing abandoned mines in South Africa.",,,The Extractive Industries and Society,,,,2023-09,2023,,2023-09,15,Can.

We report the novel use of imine derivatives as a source of radical species for modifying a glassy carbon (GC) surface using electrochemical grafting. Based on the above work related to imine compounds, we designed and synthesized two structural isomers, ferrocenyl-nitro imine derivatives. These electroactive ferrocenyl and nitro functional groups served as redox signaling. In order to identify which part of the imine derivatives was grafted on the GC surface, they were subjected to electrolysis at a constant potential to monitor changes in its imine fragment response. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical results suggested that just one of two synthesized isomers (η5-C5H4-CH=N-C6H4-NO2)Fe(η5-C5H5) produced a radical species by electrochemical oxidation of the imine with bond cleavage. After the electrolysis process, the cyclic voltammetry and spectroscopic studies showed that a covalent modification of GC surfaces took place via forming a new bond from a nitro-aryl species on the GC surface. Due to imine bond cleavage, the ferrocenyl scissioned fragment was lost far from the electrode surface.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Using data on 149 countries from 1993 to 2020, we find that some countries with low pesticide use are “catching-up” slightly. From a Markov chain analysis, we also note that the distribution of pesticide use per hectare is characterized by a low inter-class mobility, more pronounced in the head and tail of the distribution. This suggests a lock-in phenomenon once “unsustainable” agricultural systems are adopted. We complement this temporal analysis by exploring the role of “proximity” between countries in the use of pesticides and its dynamics. Three definitions of proximity are considered. The first is geographical, the second and third are based on crops produced at the country level and on countries’ GDP per capita respectively.

The energy needed for RO water treatment has decreased, but energy costs remain a challenge, especially in communities where drinking water consumption is far from seawater. This study explores the best RO configuration for energy efficiency in scenarios where solar and gravity energy are available. A case study is presented for the community of La Higuera (Coquimbo, Chile), that includes two small villages, La Higuera and Chungungo. The study evaluated two alternative hydraulic systems for operating the RO plant and delivering drinking water to the main tanks in Chungungo and La Higuera, completely independent of the power grid. The results showed that the most energy-efficient system uses solar energy and filtered seawater accumulated at high altitudes in a coastal mountain range. A 20-y evaluation showed that while the investment may not be fully recovered, the implementation of this RO scheme would have significant economic gains with the addition of public financial incentives and reduction of CO2 emissions.",,,Desalination and Water Treatment,,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,292,,34-48,Closed,Article,"Soto, Joel Barraza; Ramirez, Juan Antonio López; Merino, Germán E.; Millar, Carlos Basulto; Morales, Macarena; Martinez, Matías; Miranda-Godoy, Brayan; Isidoro, Jorge M.G.P.","Soto, Joel Barraza (Departamento de Acuicultura, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Ramirez, Juan Antonio López (Environmental Engineering Department, University of Cádiz, P.° de Carlos III, 28, 11003, Cádiz, Spain); Merino, Germán E.

226,pub.1158569202,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739744,,,Biases in quantitative genetic parameters estimations caused by self-fertilization in the Caribbean pectinid Argopecten nucleus (Mollusca: Bivalvia),"Inbreeding can cause an important bias in the estimates of quantitative genetic parameters, which in turn can affect the estimated potential for a selection response in species that are simultaneous hermaphrodite with partial self-fertilization. In the present study, the biases caused by self-fertilization on heritability (h 2 ) estimates for productive traits were assessed at different ages in the tropical hermaphrodite pectinid Argopecten nucleus. Self-fertilization rates were estimated in both oocytes and adults, as the percentage of zygotes formed from unfertilized oocytes and by paternity analysis using microsatellite genetic markers, respectively. Fifty sexually mature individuals were individually spawned and genotyped using microsatellite markers. The sperm of one individual used as a male was used to fertilize the oocytes of 4 other individuals, generating 10 half-sibling families (HS) and 40 full-siblings families (FS). At the age of 3.5 months, the total weight, and the length, height, and width of the shell of 60 animals per FS family were individually measured. At the age of 9 months, the same measurements were repeated in the same individuals, which were then euthanized to weigh the soft tissues. In addition, the fecundity was estimated in each individual (number of oocytes produced), and a paternity analysis was performed. No significant differences were found in the average inbreeding rates estimated in oocytes and adults. However, no significant correlation was observed in the estimates of family self-fertilization rates when using both methods. The individuals derived from crossbreeding showed higher average values for productive traits than those produced by selfing, although interactions between the genotype and the depth of culture were observed in both groups. The h 2 estimates using statistical models that consider self-fertilization in adults (models II and III) were lower than those observed when self-fertilization rates were estimated in oocytes, or not included in the model. However, the genetic correlations between the traits were similar using both methods for estimating self-fertilization rates. The present results suggest that self-fertilization results in inbreeding depression and induces an overestimation of the h 2 for productive traits, but it does not affect estimates of genetic correlations or genotype by environment interactions.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare do not have any conflicts of interest related to this manuscript.

The mentioned study aims to evaluate the impact of country's natural resources on economic growth. This analysis seeks to empirically investigate the ‘Resource Curse Hypothesis’. To ensure the purpose of the study, the work utilized panel data of 161countries from 1980 to 2021. Estimation is conducted using the panel ordinary least squares (OLS) and Bootstrapped Panel Quantile Regression (BPQR) methods. In global panel data, the outcomes indicate that natural resources playhazardous role in explaining the economic growth at 25th quantile, on the other side, in remaining quantiles (50th and75th) the natural resources induce the growth. In addition to this, the outcomes are sensitive to developed and developing economies. The findings also imply that capital formation, financial development, trade and government expenditure are constructive determinants of economic growth.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The reclamation of water from this sludge becomes particularly crucial in arid regions. This study is the first of its kind to focus on recovering water from sludge produced during the aquaculture of scallops and the subsequent disinfection of this water to remove heterotrophic microorganisms. The method employed involved a solar still followed by a condensation system for water recovery. We obtained 250 kg of wet sludge from the industrial production of scallop culture (Argopecten purpuratus) through the rotary drum filter, which is used for lantern washing. This sludge was subjected to drying in a solar still dryer. The vapor generated during the drying process was condensed using a heat exchanger, resulting in the recovery of 1680 mL of water, accounting for 91% of the sludge mass, with a Gain Output Ratio of 1.6. The recovered water underwent disinfection using various methods, including UV-A, UV-A/O3, UV-C, UV-C/O3, and O3. Among these, the UV-C/O3 process demonstrated the highest removal of Total Cultivable Bacteria, achieving complete disinfection within 60 min of treatment. UV-C was the second most effective treatment, with a bacteria removal rate of 99.92% in the same timeframe. Electrical energy used to reduce bacteria concentration by one order of magnitude was 12.96 kWh/m3 when UV-C process was applied, and 32.92 kWh/m3 when UV-C/O3 process was applied. In conclusion, this study showcases that a significant quantity of water can be reclaimed from scallop sludge through a combination of solar drying and a condensation system. Moreover, this recovered water can be efficiently disinfected using the UV-C/O3 process.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The primary purpose of this research is to integrate land use and land cover data and local ecological knowledge-based data with geographical information systems through a participatory approach to enhance natural resource management. We selected the Pariac-Rajucolta watershed as a study area because it is a typical landscape in the high-Andean mountains, with half of its territory inside a protected area. The methods involved a six-month participatory approach quantifying the benefits and exchange values of 33 provisioning ecosystem services, compiling the primary data from the locals and spectral information from Sentinel-2A. The results show that only agricultural and artificial areas delivered multiple benefits and offered the highest commercialization value of ecosystem services. The community mainly benefits from nutrition, materials, or energy from cultivated terrestrial plants, reared animals, wild plants, and surface water at the watershed level. At the same time, the services with high exchange proportions were mainly short -only meat of guinea pigs, manure, wild fruits, mushrooms, and wild plants for food. The abundance and the spatial distribution of benefits and exchange values of ecosystem services displayed a pattern of high quantity for the downstream and low in the basin's top and midstream of the watershed (inside the protected area). In conclusion, the study shows the importance of knowing ecosystem services benefits and exchange values as an initial approach to developing participatory strategies for managing and conserving natural resources.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Historically, Lysmata intermedia and Lysmata moorei were the only two ‘long-branch’ species inhabiting the southwestern Atlantic. Here we describe, based on morphological, molecular and colour pattern data, a new species of Lysmata possessing a long accessory branch from Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Our maximum-likelihood analysis recovered Lysmata elisa sp. n. as a sister species to Lysmata jundalini . Both species are closely related to Lysmata holthuisi and L. intermedia . The four aforementioned species comprise the L. intermedia species complex. The new species may be morphologically distinguished from the other closely related species by different sets of characters, which include details of the dorsolateral antennular flagellum, armature of ischium of the second pair of pereiopods, intraorbital process shape and relative proportions of pereiopods. Our results reinforce the importance of refining biodiversity data through the application of integrative taxonomic approaches to expand the knowledge of local and global biodiversity. The biodiversity of Lysmata deserves special attention, as they are intensively exploited in the aquarium trade.","R.

The paper focuses on modeling the failure, the run-out, and the final deposition of the failed mass in 3D. The numerical model considers in detail the distribution of materials within the domain. The materials were modeled as elastoplastic with an exponential strain-softening law. In addition, a frictional law was considered for the mass and topography interaction. The results obtained in this work show a good coincidence with the reported data in terms of kinetic energy released, failure mechanism, the final configuration of topography on the characteristic section, affected area by the event, and the formation of a nearly vertical wall in the region of the Daguangbao mountain area. Additionally, the 3D model allowed us to estimate the region affected by the event and understand the possible movement of the mass during the filling process of the Huangdongzi Valley. The analysis of the material deposited along the valley allowed the establishment of zones of potential variation of porosities, an essential characteristic given the formation of the natural dam over the Huangdongzi Valley.",This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001.,,Acta Geotechnica,,,,2023-12-12,2023,2023-12-12,2024-07,19,7,4277-4296,Closed,Article,"Fernández, Fabricio; Vargas, Eurípedes; Muller, André Luís; Sousa, Rita Leal; e Sousa, Luís Ribeiro","Fernández, Fabricio (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Vargas, Eurípedes (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Muller, André Luís (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Sousa, Rita Leal (Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA); e Sousa, Luís Ribeiro (School of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal)","Vargas, Eurípedes (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro)","Fernández, Fabricio (Catholic University of the North); Vargas, Eurípedes (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Muller, André Luís (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Sousa, Rita Leal (Stevens Institute of Technology); e Sousa, Luís Ribeiro (University of Porto)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166946254,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,
224,pub.1164079936,10.1007/s00138-023-01452-9,,,Explainable interactive projections of images,"Dimension reductions (DR) help people make sense of image collections by organizing images in the 2D space based on similarities. However, they provide little support for explaining why images were placed together or apart in the 2D space. Additionally, they do not provide support for modifying and updating the 2D representation to explore new relationships and organizations of images. To address these problems, we present an interactive DR method for images that uses visual features extracted by a deep neural network to project the images into 2D space and provides visual explanations of image features that contributed to the 2D location. In addition, it allows people to directly manipulate the 2D projection space to define alternative relationships and explore subsequent projections of the images. With an iterative cycle of semantic interaction and explainable-AI feedback, people can explore complex visual relationships in image data. Our approach to human–AI interaction integrates visual knowledge from both human-mental models and pre-trained deep neural models to explore image data. We demonstrate our method through examples with collaborators in agricultural science and other applications. Additionally, we present a quantitative evaluation that assesses how well our method captures and incorporates feedback.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant # 2127309 to the Computing Research Association for the CIFellows 2021 Project.

In this study, a numerical model is used to understand the influence of these processes on the evolution of coastal cliffs. This model is based on erosional and tectonic conditions of the Great Coastal Cliff in the Atacama Desert, the tallest and most uninterrupted coastal cliff on Earth. The results show that a faster uplift rate (> 0.3 mm/yr) or an older onset of uplift (3 Myrs) favors the formation of inactive cliffs, whereas active cliffs preferentially form under conditions of a slow uplift (0.2 mm/yr) or a younger uplift onset (1 Myr). Low erosion rates (< 1 m 2/yr) also favor the preservation of sequences of staircase marine terraces, separating the seashore from an inactive coastal cliff. In contrast, high erosion rates (≥ 1 m 2/yr) inhibit marine terrace formation, keeping the cliff active. The effect of erosion on cliff activity is enhanced or reduced by the slope of the initial topography. Steep coasts (> 5–10°) may hamper cliffs from reaching an inactive state. Thus, this model gives insights on the relative importance of these variables on the development of active and inactive cliffs, especially in an environment such as the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We show the symmetry implies a very regular behaviour on the dynamic in the topological and metric sense. Let ( [ − 1 , 1 ] , f ) be the one-dimensional reduction Lorenz map satisfying a well ordered orbit and ( [ − 1 , 0 ] , f ̃ ) be the quotient map, given by the equivalence relation x ∼ − x , the dynamic of f ˜ is described explicitly as a subshift of finite type which generalizes the Fibonacci shifts and this fact is used to compute topological entropy of f . Moreover we show that in general ( [ − 1 , 0 ] , f ̃ ) is related to a factor of the k -bonacci shift. In particular we found that the 1-dimensional Lorenz map replicates an interesting duplicating behaviour of the k -bonacci shift found in Sirvent (1996, 2011).",The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their remarks which helped to improve the article.,,Chaos Solitons & Fractals,,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,169,,113239,Closed,Article,"San Martín, Bernardo; Sirvent, Víctor F.","San Martín, Bernardo (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Sirvent, Víctor F.

223,pub.1163718336,10.1108/pr-05-2023-0399,,,Adoption of competence management practices by industries in an emerging country: an analysis via fuzzy TOPSIS,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine competence management practices in Brazilian industries using ISO 10015 as a framework of analysis, which establishes guidelines for competence management and people development.   Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted with 22 high-qualified human resources management (HRM) professionals (81.8% of participants hold a PhD) with extensive experience in the Brazilian industrial sector (an average of 20.4 years). The experts assessed 13 practices (P) elaborated based on the ISO 10015:2020, considering two categories: large industries (LI) and small and medium-sized industries (SMI). Data analysis was performed using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, frequency analysis, Fuzzy TOPSIS and sensitivity analysis.   Findings The practice “individual competences are correctly defined by organizations at all hierarchical levels” was deemed the best practice for LIs, while the practice “clear definition of activities and their specificities when structuring competence management and people development programs” was considered the best practice for SMIs. The practice “organizations map employees' future competence and development needs on a regular basis” received the lowest rating for both LIs and SMIs. When compared to LIs, SMIs have more severe deficiencies in applying competence management practices. The study's findings can be of great value in assisting managers in implementing structured competence management systems and people development initiatives.   Practical implications The findings of this study can be used by managers of businesses of all sizes and economic sectors to analyze their critical points in order to identify opportunities to improve their competence management systems and people development programs.   Originality/value This study fills a knowledge gap by analyzing the adoption of competence management practices in Brazil, answering the call for HRM research in developing countries. By using ISO 10015 as a framework of analysis, this study also addresses the literature gap regarding this important and relatively new management tool.","The authors are grateful for the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil) under the grants n0 304145/2021-1 and n0 303924/2021-7.

C70 fullerenes doped with nitrogen atoms are effective in removing formaldehyde from the air. In this work, the potential of transition metal- (Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn) functionalized porphyrin C70 fullerenes (MF-PC70Fs) for sensing and removing formaldehyde were investigated using DFT, QTAIM, and NBO. The HOMO-LUMO gaps for Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn-functionalized materials were computed, resulting in values of 1.27, 0.07, 1.84, 1.84, and 1.80 eV, respectively. The absorption energies of formaldehyde onto MF-PC70Fs were computed, revealing that the PC70Fs functionalized with Ti had the highest adsorption strength, while those functionalized with Ni had the lowest. The HOMO-LUMO gap of Cr- and Fe-functionalized PC70Fs was significantly changed after adsorbing formaldehyde. Accordingly, they may be used as conductivity-type sensors for detecting formaldehyde. Also, Cr-, Fe-, and Zn-functionalized PC70Fs can be used as formaldehyde work function type sensors. According to the calculated time recovery of MF-PC70Fs, Fe- and Zn-functionalized PC70Fs are more favourite materials than Cr-functionalized in formaldehyde sensors.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The effect of size on the deposited Cu2S/CdS thin films and its heterojunction parameters are extensively investigated. The sizes of the thin film are estimated through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The optical properties of the Cu2S/CdS thin film are studied using UV–Vis–NIR spectrometer. It is found that increase in the size, the transmittance decreases, consequently the band-gap energy decreases from 2.92eV to 2.86eV. The refractive index and the dielectric constant are calculated from the optical measurements. In addition, the dispersion of the refractive index is discussed in terms of the Wemple-DiDomenico single-oscillator model. The oscillator parameters such as optical dispersion energies, dielectric constant, the average value of oscillator strength, wavelength of single oscillator, plasma frequency and lattice energy are evaluated. To examine the size-dependent electrical parameters of Cu2S/CdS thin film, high-quality vacuum evaporated silver (Ag) is used as front contact. The current-voltage (I–V) curves of the Ag/p-Cu2S/n-CdS/ATO/glass heterojunction device are measured under dark mode at standard testing conditions (STC). The dark measurements of the fabricated device are investigated through the conventional I–V method, Norde method, and Cheung method. It is observed that the potential height of the heterojunction device decreases from 0.89 to 0.76 with an increment of the size of Cu2S/CdS thin films. It is observed that the size strongly influenced the diode parameters viz. ideality factor, saturation current, barrier height, series, and shunt resistance performance.","The authors acknowledge the M.

La investigación moderna ha buscado una explicación satisfactoria respecto de este rito, así como de la función de dichas estatuillas, apoyándose básicamente en información documental. Actualmente, se dispone de información de primera mano proveniente de hallazgos arqueológicos de diferentes cumbres de los Andes. En este trabajo se entrecruzan los datos históricos con los arqueológicos relativos a vestimenta e insignias de la nobleza inca, para proponer que dichas estatuillas simbolizaron a la pareja fundadora del linaje, Mama Ocllo y Manco Capac, en el acto mismo del surgimiento desde la pacarina del cerro Tambotoco, y que representaron por extensión, a los descendientes de tales progenitores. De esta manera, con las estatuillas se habría preservado la memoria de este pasaje crucial del mito de origen de la etnia inca, recordando a la pareja primigenia como creadora del orden social existente, y legitimando a la vez, el origen divino del poder de la élite gobernante.
Abstract  This article proposes a meaning for the offerings of miniature figurines of human beings and camelids in Inca rites, among them the qhapaq hucha or capacocha , the main ceremony of veneration of the huacas that included human sacrifice. Modern research has sought a satisfactory explanation for this rite, as well as for the function of these statuettes, based fundamentally on documentary information. Currently, first-hand information is available from archaeological finds discovered on different peaks of the Andes. In this article, historical and archaeological data related to Inca nobility clothing and insignia are intertwined, to propose that the said statuettes symbolized the founding couple of the lineage, Mama Ocllo and Manco Capac, in the very act of the emergence from the pacarina of Mt. Tambotoco, representing by extension the descendants of such parents. In this way, with the statuettes the memory of this crucial passage of the origin myth of the Inca ethnic group was preserved, remembering the original couple as creators of the existing social order, legitimizing at the same time the divine origin of the power of the ruling elite.","Agradezco especialmente a Verónica Cereceda las conversaciones sostenidas sobre el tema y su cariñosa hospitalidad en Sucre.

The effect of annealing temperature on the thin films and its morphological, microstructural, optical dispersion, linear-nonlinear and electrical, properties are extensively investigated by using various techniques such as field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ultraviolet visible (UV-VIS) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Morphological studies revealed that doped thin films surface is almost homogeneous and well-covered. Peaks associated with Ni, Cd and S elements are present in EDS analysis, which confirm the composition of the films. The energy band calculation using the Tauc plot from the recorded absorption spectra reveals the decrement in the energy gap from 3.75 eV to 3.61 eV and the refractive index is in the range of 2.57–2.62. The effect of annealing temperature on complex dielectric constant are also analyzed. Moreover, the dispersion of refractive index is calculated in terms of Wemple-DiDomenico approach. Third order susceptibility and nonlinear refractive index are calculated of Ni:CdS films. The designed Ag/Ni:CdS/FTO Schottky diode is tested under illumination conditions, and the empirical diode parameters, viz. ideality factor, barrier height, series resistance etc. are influenced by annealing temperature.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

211,pub.1163317812,10.1016/j.paid.2023.112377,,,Dark and Light Triad: A cross-cultural comparison of network analysis in 5 countries,"Personality clusters such as the Dark and Light Triad are going through an exponential investigation. The Dark Triad traits characterize behaviors associated primarily with socially undesirable outcomes, while the Light Triad traits are composed of behaviors linked to prosocial responses. Most studies that sought to map and investigate both triads are performed in North American or European contexts. Thus, we analyzed the structure of two of the most used short composite measures (i.e., Dirty Dozen and Light Triad Scale) in a sample of 2335 adults from Poland, Brazil, Nigeria, Colombia, and Peru. We performed structural equation models to understand better the structure of both instruments in the five countries. Subsequently, we conducted a network analysis to observe the dynamics of both triads in countries with different cultures. Our results found that Machiavellianism is one of the more relevant traits in Latin American and European countries, while humanism is in Nigeria. Other findings reaffirm that light and dark are not opposite traits, but at the same time, they represent distinct constructs.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Personality and Individual Differences,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,215,,112377,Closed,Article,"Ramos-Vera, Cristian; O'Diana, Angel Garcia; Villena, Andy Sánchez; Bonfá-Araujo, Bruno; de Oliveira Barros, Leonardo; Noronha, Ana Paula Porto; Gómez-Acosta, Andrés; Sierra-Barón, Willian; Gerymski, Rafał; Ogundokun, Roseline Oluwaseun; Babatunde, Akinbowale Nathaniel; Abdulahi, AbdulRahman Tosho; Adeniyi, Emmanuel Abidemi","Ramos-Vera, Cristian (Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Lima, Peru); O'Diana, Angel Garcia (Universidad Cesar Vallejo, Lima, Peru); Villena, Andy Sánchez (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Peru); Bonfá-Araujo, Bruno (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada); de Oliveira Barros, Leonardo (Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Brazil); Noronha, Ana Paula Porto (Universidade São Francisco, Campinas, Brazil); Gómez-Acosta, Andrés (Universidad de Pamplona, Pamplona, Colombia); Sierra-Barón, Willian (Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Gerymski, Rafał (Opole University, Opole, Poland); Ogundokun, Roseline Oluwaseun (Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania); Babatunde, Akinbowale Nathaniel (Kwara State University, Malete, Kwara State, Nigeria); Abdulahi, AbdulRahman Tosho (Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Kwara State Polytechnic, Nigeria); Adeniyi, Emmanuel Abidemi (Precious Cornerstone University, Ibadan, Nigeria)","Bonfá-Araujo, Bruno (Western University)","Ramos-Vera, Cristian (Universidad César Vallejo); O'Diana, Angel Garcia (Universidad César Vallejo); Villena, Andy Sánchez (Private University of the North); Bonfá-Araujo, Bruno (Western University); de Oliveira Barros, Leonardo (Federal University of Bahia); Noronha, Ana Paula Porto (Universidade São Francisco); Gómez-Acosta, Andrés (University of Pamplona); Sierra-Barón, Willian (South Colombian University); Gerymski, Rafał (University of Opole); Ogundokun, Roseline Oluwaseun (Kaunas University of Technology); Babatunde, Akinbowale Nathaniel (Kwara State University); Abdulahi, AbdulRahman Tosho (Kwara State Polytechnic); Adeniyi, Emmanuel Abidemi (Precious Cornerstone University)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163317812,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

Therefore, the carbon footprint (CF) needs to be implemented in these institutions for mitigating climate change and its potential risks. Based on this understanding, the university consortium quality and environment (QualEnv) stands out by its main objective – to increase the university's contribution to sustainable development (SD) through the deployment of systematic environmental practices and quality processes. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present the CF of the Latin American universities of the QualEnv consortium.   Design/methodology/approach The study was based on the actions for adopting CF and its implementation at the universities that take part in the QualEnv consortium. The measurement process and report presentation were done properly by the universities and published as institutional documents. Therefore, data were collected and analyzed through a document search, systematic literature review and participant observation.   Findings The results show knowledge deepening and systematization on CF in higher education. In addition, it presents the effort of a group of universities that, through a research network, seek to adopt practices towards a carbon-neutral university, which requires an incremental and systematic change to break out of the traditional system.   Originality/value This paper discusses the practical implications for universities and the need to implement initiatives for measuring and reducing their CF since it shows how the institutions belonging to QualEnv consortium have created their own strategies to mitigate climate change and contribute to SD.","The authors would like to acknowledge support from European Commission, Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency and Erasmus+, in the context of Qualenv Project: Change the Climate: Assuring the Quality of Environmental Strategies in Latin-American Higher Education.

To fill this gap, this study aims to assess the influences of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) on the implementation of the UN SDGs.   Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review of 97 publications was carried out by using the Web of Science database and the support of ATLAS.ti software. In addition, this research also explored how the top 20 Forbes companies are aligned with the SDGs by analysing their sustainability reports.   Findings The findings suggest that the literature and the analysed companies primarily concentrate on certain SDGs while neglecting others, revealing potential areas of interest for future research. Based on the findings, the study provides valuable insights into the connections between SSCM and the UN SDGs, highlighting the potential benefits of SSCM in reducing environmental, social and economic pressures and contributing to sustainable development. It also identifies areas where further research and policy development are needed to maximise the potential benefits of SSCM.   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other studies have conducted a comprehensive exploration of the literature linking SSCM and the SDGs framework. Moreover, the study differs from others since it combines research data with practical information from company reports, to identify specific issues related to supply chain management.",This study was funded by the Inter-University Sustainable Development Research Programme (IUSDRP) and is part of the “100 papers to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals” Initiative.,,The TQM Journal,,,,2023-10-23,2023,2023-10-23,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,Closed,Article,"Filho, Walter Leal; Trevisan, Laís Viera; Eustachio, João Henrique Paulino Pires; Dibbern, Thais; Apraiz, Julen Castillo; Rampasso, Izabela; Anholon, Rosley; Gornati, Beatrice; Morello, Manfredi; Lambrechts, Wim","Filho, Walter Leal (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany); Trevisan, Laís Viera (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); Eustachio, João Henrique Paulino Pires (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany); Dibbern, Thais (State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil); Apraiz, Julen Castillo (University of the Basque Country, San Sebastian, Spain); Rampasso, Izabela (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Anholon, Rosley (School of Mechanical Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil); Gornati, Beatrice (Research Office Standard Ethics, London, UK); Morello, Manfredi (Research Office Standard Ethics, London, UK); Lambrechts, Wim (Faculty of Management, Open University of the Netherlands, Heerlen, Netherlands)","Trevisan, Laís Viera (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul)","Filho, Walter Leal (HAW Hamburg); Trevisan, Laís Viera (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Eustachio, João Henrique Paulino Pires (HAW Hamburg); Dibbern, Thais (State University of Campinas); Apraiz, Julen Castillo (University of the Basque Country); Rampasso, Izabela (Catholic University of the North); Anholon, Rosley (State University of Campinas); Gornati, Beatrice (Research Office Standard Ethics, London, UK); Morello, Manfredi (Research Office Standard Ethics, London, UK); Lambrechts, Wim (Open University in the Netherlands)",8,8,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165138976,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The shrimp Salmoneus carvachoi has been reported to exhibit both male (appendix masculina) and female (brooding embryos) anatomical characteristics simultaneously. Our aim was to examine the sexual system of S. carvachoi and to test the hypothesis of protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism (PSH) in this species. We analysed internal and external features using microscopy and histology techniques. Our analyses support the hypothesis of PSH in S. carvachoi and enabled the identification of male-phase and hermaphroditic individuals. All individuals exhibit a well-developed appendix masculina on the endopods of the second pleopods; however, small male-phase individuals possess only male gonopores, whereas larger hermaphroditic individuals possess both female and male gonopores. Hermaphrodites exhibit both male and female germinative cells in various stages of development, as well as an androgenic gland. Our study describes a novel sexual system for alpheids and provides a detailed description of anatomical traits in S. carvachoi. Studies that describe sexual systems in Alpheidae may shed light on the evolutionary history of gender expression in carideans and how environmental conditions favour sex allocation in decapods and other invertebrates.","We would like to thank the ‘Programa de Pós-Graduação em Zoologia’ of UESC for support, Guidomar Soledade, Patricia Santos, and Renata Lima for their support during the field samplings, and Dr Ray Bauer for suggestions and corrections that improved the revised version of the manuscript.","This work was supported by the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia (FAPESB) for granting a Master scholarship to MVO; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for granting Ph.D. scholarships to ACC-S and RG (Finance Code 001); São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP JP 2005/04707-5 and Biota Intercrusta 2018/13685-5); and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) [grant number PQ#309298/2020-2 to FJZ and PQ#304235/2019-9, PQ#311217/2022-2 to AOA].",Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society,,,,2023-10-14,2023,2023-10-14,2024-07-01,201,3,zlad137,Closed,Article,"Oliveira, Mário Vitor; Baeza, Juan Antonio; Guéron, Rodrigo; Costa-Souza, Ana Carla; Mariano, Rodolfo; Zara, Fernando José; Almeida, Alexandre O","Oliveira, Mário Vitor (Department of Biological Sciences, Universidade Estadual Santa Cruz (UESC), Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil); Baeza, Juan Antonio (Department of Biological Sciences, 132 Long Hall, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, USA; Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, 701 Seaway Drive, Fort Pierce, FL 34949, USA; Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Guéron, Rodrigo (Department of Zoology, Biosciences Centre, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE).

203,pub.1165569078,10.1016/j.compag.2023.108392,,,A Rolling Horizon scheme for rescheduling in agricultural harvest,"Over the last decade, agriculture has evolved from a human-intensive activity to a highly automated process. Multiple technological advances (e.g., harvest machines, sensors, and drones) have been incorporated to collect and transmit information, increasing harvest efficiency and more accurate and timely decisions. These advances have opened new opportunities to apply optimization models during the harvest season. In this context, to apply these models, it is necessary to consider the underlying uncertainty in agricultural operations that comes mainly from weather conditions and the biological characteristics of crops. One of the traditional strategies used to reactively manage these uncertainties in optimization models is the Rolling Horizon (RH) strategy. However, RH is typically myopic about the future, and it can be challenging to implement this approach when commitments with suppliers are signed. This work proposes a non-myopic rolling horizon method to reschedule the agricultural harvest plan. Furthermore, our RH scheme is exemplified by means of olive oil harvesting and production. Our method is based on a baseline plan generation, and after that, an adaptive rescheduling scheme is generated under new conditions. A bi-objective rescheduling problem seeking to maximize production and minimize plan variability is formulated. Computational experiments are conducted to study our methodology’s impact in several rescheduling periods. A good performance in two challenging agricultural scenarios is highlighted. This proposal offers the community a framework for reactively managing complex harvest operations.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Design/methodology/approach This study employed the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), survey and Grey Fixed Weight Clustering modeling techniques. Three experts with extensive academic and practical experience in the subject participated in the AHP process, providing their opinions on the relative importance of eight variables associated with the topic under investigation, thus enabling their prioritization. Concurrently, data were collected through a survey from 23 respondents who have extensive knowledge about the realities of Brazilian startups. The weights derived from the AHP and the survey data were utilized in the Grey Fixed Weight Clustering modeling.   Findings Based on the opinions of the 23 respondents, the level of implementation of practices related to strategic management, brand management, external image management and internal communication management is superficial. In addition, according to the majority of experts, Brazilian startups exhibited a medium level of maturity to address the key challenges related to communication management. Furthermore, this study reveals that the variables “financial resources allocation,” “stakeholder relationship” and “brand management” were deemed the most significant for the model.   Originality/value The contributions presented herein can be beneficial for both researchers and startup managers seeking to enhance communication strategies in their organizations.

It reports on the results of a worldwide survey at higher education institutions, which identified some areas where the pandemic impacted and/or influenced their activities. The survey received 158 responses and a principal component analysis was performed to model the items associated with digital tools boosting SD, innovative business opportunities and ideas, and needs for improvement at HEIs. The results indicate that most part of the respondents developed digital skills and increased their involvement with e-learning and distance learning; however, more digital training is needed. Findings also support the role played by digital technologies in boosting SD at HEIs, and the role of institutions in promoting innovation through digital tools. Apart from an analysis of the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to digital transformation in an SD context in higher education institutions, the paper provides an assessment of trends and recommendations that may guide future developments in a post-pandemic work.",This paper is part of the “100 papers to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals” initiative.,,International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Ecology,,,,2023-07-21,2023,2023-07-21,2024-01-02,31,1,108-123,Closed,Article,"Filho, Walter Leal; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Beynaghi, Ali; Fritzen, Barbara; Ulisses, Azeiteiro; Avila, Lucas Veiga; Shulla, Kalterina; Vasconcelos, Claudio R.

Formal mechanisms protect this appropriability, such as patents or intellectual property (IP) rights. But not all countries respect IP rights and this phenomenon has increased in a complex way. There has been an academic interest in studying the trends regarding IP criminal activities. This study aims to identify the authors, universities and regions that publish the most in IP crime research worldwide. Using the Web of Science database, we analysed 589 articles published between 1991 and 2020 on the topic. The results indicate that approximately 75% of scientific production on IP Crime was written in the last decade, which is of great concern nowadays. The most influential authors come from the USA. This economy has stood out making progress in the establishment of formal mechanisms for the appropriation of innovation as a way to encourage more firms and innovators to develop new productive activities.

Disregarding this information may lead to biased results in the final ore grade block model, subsequently impacting the downstream processes in a mining chain project. In the current practice of ore body evaluation, which is known as stochastic cascade/hierarchical geostatistical modeling, the geological domain is first characterized, and then, within the geological model, the ore grades of interest are evaluated. This practice may be unrealistic in the case when the variability in ore grade across the boundary is gradual, following a smooth transition. To reproduce such characteristics, the cross dependence that exists between the ore grade and geological formations is considered in the conventional joint simulation between continuous and categorical variables. However, when using this approach, only one ore variable is considered, and its relationship with other ore grades that may be available at the sample location is ignored. In this study, an alternative approach to jointly model two cross-correlated ore grades and one categorical variable (i.e., geological domains) with soft contact relationships that exist among the geological domains is proposed. The statistical and geostatistical tools are provided for variogram inference, Gibbs sampling, and conditional cosimulation. The algorithm is also tested by applying it to a Cu deposit, where the geological formations are managed by the local and spatial distribution of two cross-correlated ore grades, Cu and Au, throughout the deposit. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other geostatistical techniques in terms of global and local reproduction of statistical parameters.",The first author is thankful to Nazarbayev University for funding this work via “Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants for 2018–2020 under Contract No. 090118FD5336 and 2021–2023 under Contract No. 021220FD4951”.

These aspects serve as crucial indicators in the selection processes for prospective candidates in higher education institutions and in accrediting the quality of both degree programmes and the institutions themselves. This study examines the perceptions of Marine Biology graduates from a university in northern Chile regarding the quality and relevance of the training they received during their undergraduate studies. The graduates express concerns about deficiencies in transferrable skills, such as ‘teamwork’, ‘effective communication’, and ‘conflict resolution’, as well as some technical skills that are vital for preparing graduates with social competences necessary for success in inter- and transdisciplinary contexts, essential in fostering positive interactions between society and the ocean. The study proposes curriculum updates and a strategy for establishing a bidirectional link with Marine Biology graduates, including mutual feedback, fostering graduate loyalty, strengthening ties to the working world, and implementing accountability processes.

To realize this reconstruction during the inflationary epoch, we consider as attractor the scalar spectral index n s in terms of the number of e -folds N , in the framework of the slow-roll approximation. By assuming a specific function f ( ϕ ) together with the simplest attractor n s ( N ) , we find different expressions for the reconstructed effective potential V ( ϕ ) . Additionally, we analyze the era of reheating occurs after of the reconstruction obtained during the inflationary epoch. In this scenario we determine the duration and temperature during the reheating epoch, in terms of the equation of state parameter and of the observational parameters. In this context, the different parameters associated to the reconstructed model are restricted during the scenarios of inflation and reheating by considering the recent astronomical observations.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, the mineral processing produces a large volume of mine tailings, and their quantity is almost equal to the ores treated. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a challenging environmental problem caused by tailing disposal when it is not well managed. In addition, several copper mining companies employ seawater in their process because they operate in arid or semi-arid regions, including northern Chile, southern Peru, and Australia. For copper sulfide mineral processing, the use of seawater is not a limitation in the flotation process, and positive and negative effects appear compared to using fresh water. However, there are no records in the literature on the impact of seawater on the generation of AMD, considering that it is a solution with a high concentration of different ions. This study aims to evaluate the chemical stability of synthetic tailings with and without seawater by kinetic tests using seven humidity cells. The synthetic tailings are mixtures of pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and quartz. The main results show that the AMD generation kinetics after 25 weeks of testing humidity cells leached with distilled water (acid-generating cells) behaved differently than the humidity cells leached with seawater (non-acid-generating cells). After 25 weeks of testing, the acid-generating humidity cells had a pH value below 2.26, while the non-acid-generating humidity cells had a pH value above 7. It was also shown that fine-particle-size granulometry generates AMD faster than coarse-particle-size granulometry. Finally, the sulfide minerals’ ion dissolution occurred when the humidity cells were leached with distilled water and not when leached with seawater. The results show that using non-desalinized seawater in copper ore processing can help prevent AMD due to the buffering effect of seawater and the protection coat formed by oxyhydroxide and/or bivalent cations.","The authors acknowledge the support of ANID/ACT210027, and Fondecyt, grant no. 1211498.

Using a broad international sample with firms from 47 countries―and through multilevel and panel data analysis―results show a positive and significant influence of CSP on CFP, while country sustainability negatively moderates the CSP–CFP relationship. This is consistent with the idea that in countries with a high level of sustainability, firms have greater difficulty obtaining competitive advantages through actions related to corporate social responsibility. Results also indicate that country sustainability has a direct and positive impact on CFP (Tobin's‐ Q ), regardless of CSP. Additionally, applying country sustainability in a disaggregated manner, we find that social and governance dimensions influence the CSP–CFP relationship, while the environmental dimension does not. Evidence thus confirms that the effect of CSP on CFP varies depending on the institutional context in which the firm is located.",,,Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management,,,,2023-06-07,2023,2023-06-07,2023-11,30,6,3075-3094,Closed,Article,"Vargas‐Santander, Karen Gloria; Álvarez‐Diez, Susana; Baixauli‐Soler, Samuel; Belda‐Ruiz, María","Vargas‐Santander, Karen Gloria (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Álvarez‐Diez, Susana (Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain); Baixauli‐Soler, Samuel (Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain); Belda‐Ruiz, María (Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain)","Vargas‐Santander, Karen Gloria (Catholic University of the North)","Vargas‐Santander, Karen Gloria (Catholic University of the North); Álvarez‐Diez, Susana (University of Murcia); Baixauli‐Soler, Samuel (University of Murcia); Belda‐Ruiz, María (University of Murcia)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158829005,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",

Ecological uniqueness is a valuable metric for this purpose that decomposes beta diversity into local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), thereby measuring the contribution of each site within a region to overall biodiversity variation. LCBD has been used extensively to evaluate ecological uniqueness from community composition data, but biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, and community-based ecological uniqueness may not capture the full range of ecological uniqueness occurring at other levels of biological organization. We investigated ecological uniqueness estimates derived from community and species population levels in a watershed of south-central Chile and analyzed their responses to water and habitat quality variables. Ecological uniqueness was estimated at the community level from fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages and at the population level using genetic and morphological data gathered for two invertebrates, the gastropod Chilina dombeiana and the water bug Aquarius chilensis. Our results revealed low spatial congruence between the levels of ecological uniqueness calculated for these different biodiversity components, with mismatches occurring among sites with high LCBD values. Water and habitat quality were major drivers of beta diversity in this watershed, accounting for 43.8% to 74.3% of the spatial variation in LCBDs, and their effects differed among the ecological uniqueness estimates.

However, little is known about the effect that LDC has on the labor market equilibrium of host territories. This paper addresses this gap for the case of Chile. While LDC is a useful strategy for improving salary and employment on a national scale, our results show a negative effect for residents in host territories (on a local scale), particularly when LDC results in commuters with similar characteristics to residents competing for the same jobs.",,,Journal of Regional Science,,,,2023-12-18,2023,2023-12-18,2024-03,64,2,462-490,Closed,Article,"Carriel, Viviana; Pérez‐Trujillo, Manuel; Lufin, Marcelo; Atienza, Miguel","Carriel, Viviana (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Pérez‐Trujillo, Manuel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Lufin, Marcelo (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Pérez‐Trujillo, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)","Carriel, Viviana (Catholic University of the North); Pérez‐Trujillo, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Lufin, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167125413,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

There are attempts in the literature to consolidate this knowledge, but there are no comprehensive studies using integrative approaches that combine bibliometric softwares and systematic content analysis. The objective of this study is twofold: (i) to identify and discuss the evolution of themes that relate sustainability and project management; (ii) propose a research agenda to advance knowledge in this interconnected area. The Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool (SciMAT) was used to analyze a sample of 851 articles defined through the PRISMA protocol. The study covered three time periods: 2007 to 2011, 2012 to 2016 and 2017 to May/2023. For each period, a longitudinal maps, strategic diagrams and cluster networks generated by SciMAT were analyzed with the support of content analysis. Sustainable construction project management it is an important topic throughout the development of the area, with great influence in all clusters. Cross-cutting themes were identified, which have the potential to become motor themes in the coming years, with an emphasis on competencies needed by managers to lead sustainable projects. The research agenda includes themes related to decision support systems, new sustainability frameworks and paradigms (circular economy, digital transformation and industry 5.0), smart cities and industry 4.0.

In this work, an adapted compost in different airlift bioreactors was used to depurate a complex, toxic and old landfill leachate without treatment (raw leachate) and after pretreatments (coagulation/flocculation; coagulation/flocculation and filtration; coagulation/flocculation, filtration and photo-Fenton process). After the complete pretreatments, a high removal of organic matter was achieved, with a global removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and humic acids of 72.4% and 83.4%, respectively; besides, copper and iron in the landfill leachate presented a total removal of 91.1% and 65.8%, respectively. On the other hand, after the contact of raw leachate with compost in the airlift, there was a decrease of COD, copper and iron, while for humic acids there was a slight increase. The same trend was observed when the leachate was submitted to the different pretreatments and subsequently subjected to the biologic process with compost. The respirometric analyses showed that the raw leachate was toxic, although this tendency decreased along the treatments, with inhibition values of 41.8%, 27.5%, 22.0% and 12.1% for raw and pretreated leachate (by coagulation/flocculation, filtration and photo-Fenton processes), respectively. Also, in order to improve our knowledge about the composition of the microbial assemblages in compost samples and their possible role in pollutants removal from LL, we analysed samples from both an adapted and a non-adapted compost before and after being in contact with the raw leachate by applying Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetota and Deinococcota were the most abundant phyla in all samples, being present in the 50 most abundant Amplified Sequence Variants (ASVs) of the study, which represented 56.5% of the total analysed sequences and were considered as our core community. Chryseolinea, Herbinix, Proteiniphilum, Pseudomonas and Sphaerochaeta seemed to be the most resilient genera when the compost was in contact to LL. Moreover, our results showed that the metabolisms related to chemoheterotrophy, fermentation and the nitrogen cycle were the most relevant in all samples. In general, the microbial community was able to adapt to adverse conditions and remove pollutants, as heavy metals.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This paper aims to identify the motor themes and subthemes of academic research that relate supply chain management (SCM) maturity and business models (BMs).   Design/methodology/approach The Science Mapping Analysis Tool (SciMAT) was used to conduct a seven-step bibliometric analysis of 889 documents indexed in the Scopus database clustering by relatedness of works and keywords. The methodological approach included content analysis of the literature, longitudinal analysis and strategic diagram analysis.   Findings The thematic evolution analysis revealed that three themes drive the studies on SCM maturity and BM: industry 4.0 (motor theme), environmental management (transversal theme) and product management (highly developed and isolated theme). The strategic diagrams and co-word networks allowed to graphically identify the main topics connecting SCM maturity and BM. Considering this connection, the scientific mapping emphasizes the significance and strength of the link between digital technologies, technology management and manufacturing management in Industry 4.0. In addition, the connections between the subthemes revealed that circular economy and green human resource management are important concepts to advance theory and practice on the connection between SCM maturity and BM.   Originality/value This research extends the knowledge base by providing an analysis of the key themes and the links with subthemes in the literature that relate to SCM maturity and BM. Key studies are analyzed and linked with the key topics identified using the SciMAT software. Future research avenues are outlined, providing new insights to advance theory and practice.","The authors are grateful for the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil) under the grant nº 304145/2021-1.

Nevertheless, an on-time diagnosis of heart disease can play a significant role in healthcare; since it can reduce the chances of death and save much money in case of necessary treatment. This article develops an efficient and accurate system that uses artificial neural networks (ANN), feature selection (FS) methods, and multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to diagnose heart disease. Appropriate features are selected by utilizing five feature selection methods. Then, three artificial neural networks for CVD prediction were implemented, and their performances were checked according to eight solid criteria. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) has been utilized to select the optimal hyperparameters to reach high accuracy. A novel integrated weighting method using MEREC and BWM is developed to consider experts’ statements and data evaluation in the criteria weighting operation to choose the best feature selection-artificial neural network method for heart disease detection. Then, an extended version of ELECTRE III is introduced to assess fifteen alternatives, which has proven to be more accurate than other ELECTRE methods in this research. Results validation has been done by utilizing eight MCDM techniques, the Pearson correlation coefficient test, and criteria weights sensitivity analysis by implementing ten scenarios to assess our methodology’s robustness. Finally, the outcomes indicate that LASSO-CNN, AdaBoost-CNN, and AdaBoost-MLP are the top 3 approaches with the accuracy of 99.51%, 98.54%, and 98.54%, respectively.

With the development of virtual space and video games in recent years, players are looking for quality games in terms of content and graphics. This research examines the various dimensions of video game development, obtaining player satisfaction and increasing the profit from attracting players. A descriptive and informative evaluation procedure is investigated in this research to address this issue. According to previous studies, the necessity of an accurate evaluation is demanding in the video game industry. Therefore, this research deals with a multi-directional evaluation procedure where different descriptive criteria are weighted using a novel Gray FUCOM approach. The value of the proposed novel approach is linked with uncertainty or lack of consensus, which deals with given linguistic terms of opinion significance. Perspectives about the video game industry are introduced as video game criteria for Gray-FUCOM-based evaluation of uncertain opinions. Then, it is compared with the existing crisp FUCOM to show the reliability of this evaluation. This research also clarifies the definition of gray numbers and their integration with the FUCOM optimization methodology in a new aspect. The Deviation From sub-criteria (DFC) as a performance measure (objective function) is calculated to be non-zero, as illustrated by the inconsistency of experts’ uncertain opinions. Furthermore, the results show that developing video games that benefit from suitable multiplayer and rich quality and storyline regarding maps, personalization, various missions, challenging skills, and supporting regulated modes can attract many players and increase the developers' incomes.

Specifically, we propose a new deformation mechanism related to thrusting belt systems induced by positive tectonic inversion processes in the western flank of the Domeyko Cordillera in northern Chile. Thrust belt systems have been rarely understood for the outer Andean forearc; in fact, the mention of thrusting is scarce and structural interpretations are restricted only to strike-slip faulting and positive tectonic inversion processes. In this study, we have constructed novel balanced cross-sections from new structural fieldwork and combined them with 2-D reflection seismic line re-interpretations, thus offering new ideas about the evolution and development of the forearc of the Central Andes. Based on this, we propose integrated kinematic models that describe the relationships between inherited extensional structures, positive tectonic inversion structures, and the formation of thrust systems. The proposed balanced cross-sections have been restored to a pre-shortening condition. In this way, two structural styles are proposed for the western flank of the Domeyko Cordillera. The first corresponds to west-directed positive tectonic inversion structures, which expose and extrude the Middle Jurassic syn-rift deposit of the ancient Mesozoic rift basin. The second consists of east-directed thin-skinned thrust systems, mainly affecting the Upper Cretaceous to Eocene volcano-sedimentary synorogenic sequences. The interaction between inversion structures and thrust system structural styles would generate a west-directed intracutaneous wedge. Finally, the minimum shortening obtained from our balanced cross-section restorations is ca. 11% for the Río Loa and the San Salvador Canyons segment and ca. 56% for the Quebrada Mala segment. The formation of thrusting structures is controlled by a major detachment fault activated from a regional-scale angular unconformity, which we have named the Quebrada Mala detachment fault. An important part of the shortening was taken up and accommodated by buttressing structures and their associated intraformational detachment-thrust levels.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Blockchain has been deemed a “Game Changer” for its potential benefits but also has several limitations due to its properties and SMEs’ limited resources. Small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) have more problems employing Industry 4.0 Technologies in practice than larger companies. So, the employment of BC in SMEs’ supply chains, as the economy’s backbone, deserves a full investigation which has been addressed in this paper. We use the Technology–Organization–Environment framework to examine both positive and negative factors affecting blockchain adoption in SMEs. A Delphi method was used to refine a list of 42 factors down to the 22 most essential ones. These factors were then prioritized using the Fuzzy Logarithmic Additive Weights Methodology based on expert preferences. The findings indicate that while financial factors play a crucial role in adoption, transparency, and traceability are significant benefits that motivate organizations to adopt blockchain. The organizational dimension also has a substantial impact on decision-making. In this study, we conclude that SMEs must carefully consider their circumstances before adopting blockchain technology, given its infancy state. The barriers to adoption are just as significant as incentives, and SMEs must weigh the financial and organizational factors before making the decision. This study extends the literature by comprehensively looking at all possible factors influencing BC adoption by SMEs. Furthermore, we have highlighted valuable insights for policymakers and SME owners to make the best decision.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,,,,2023-08,2023,,2023-08,123,,106169,Closed,Article,"Asadi, Mandana; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Pamucar, Dragan; Salimi, Jalil; Saberi, Sara","Asadi, Mandana (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Pamucar, Dragan (Department of Operations Research and Statistics, Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia); Salimi, Jalil (Department of Management, Science and Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran); Saberi, Sara (Robert A.

167,pub.1165284290,10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104290,,,"Sulfate sources, biologic cycling, and mobility in Atacama Desert soils revealed by isotope signatures","A set of 55 surface samples from Atacama Desert gypsisols was collected along four altitude transects and analyzed for ∆17OSO4, δ18OSO4, δ34SSO4, and 87Sr/86Sr in order to identify the main depositional mechanisms and quantify the proportional contribution of sulfate sources across the desert's main topographic units – the Coastal Cordillera, the Central Depression, and the Precordillera. Sulfate deposited at any location in the Atacama Desert may derive from up to five different source and process endmembers that can principally be identified by their isotopic composition. Three aerosol sources dominate sulfate deposition and accumulation in gypsisols throughout the Atacama. These are secondary atmospheric Ca- and Na-sulfate derived from global volcanic SO2 oxidized by ozone and its derivates, and a marine sulfate aerosol that is roughly a 9:1 mixture of sea salt (primary) sulfate from evaporated sea spray, and secondary non-sea salt sulfate, i.e., dimethyl sulfide (DMS) mainly oxidized by ozone. These marine sources dominate sulfate deposition in the Coastal Cordillera. Unlike in most places on Earth, the positive mass-independent ∆17OSO4 signature of secondary atmospheric sulfate is ubiquitous in Atacama Desert soils and is never completely erased by biologic cycling. Hence, biologic cycling of the sulfate inventory – i.e., the reduction of sulfate, subsequent oxygen isotope exchange with water, and re-oxidation – is apparently not quantitative in any of the Atacama Desert environments sampled here, including the most biologically active permanent salt lakes. The preservation of highest ∆17OSO4 values (∼ 1.0‰) at altitudes of the Coastal Cordillera above the 1200 m altitude cut-off level of fog advection suggest that episodic rainfall events are insufficient for significant in situ biologic sulfate turnover. At lower altitudes and regular fog advection, moisture supply appears to be sufficient for limited in situ biologic sulfate turnover. Overall, biologically recycled sulfate constitutes a fourth major contributor to the desert's gypsisol sulfate inventory. This may comprise fluvially redeposited sulfate from older sediments, particularly on the debris fans protruding from the Precordillera into the Central Depression. In the Central Depression, Sr-isotopes may allow for a further distinction between redeposition-dominated and aerosol-dominated sedimentation environments. On the Precordillera, rainfall and run-off provide sufficient moisture for significant but still incomplete in situ biologic sulfate cycling. Hydrothermal non-evaporitic Na-sulfate – the fifth potential source – likely originates from larger outflow events or mobilization from rock veins over the course of the Atacama's geologic history may contribute locally to the sulfate inventory. The degree of bio-cycling and mobility of sulfate likely reflects a balance between overall water availability and the mixing proportion of very soluble (mobile) Na-sulfate and less soluble Ca-sulfate inherent in the various sulfate sources.",Declaration of Competing Interest None.

The prime example is a meal delivery system. During an operating day, couriers in such a system are used to deliver orders placed at different restaurants to different customer locations. Operating a rapid delivery network is challenging, primarily due to the high service expectations and the considerable uncertainty in both demand and delivery capacity. We seek to fill a gap in the literature by considering courier satisfaction in a rapid delivery system, which may improve retention/loyalty in a highly competitive environment. Under the premise that couriers prefer to operate in relatively small geographic areas to increase their efficiency, we propose the novel concept of dynamic courier regions: small operating regions for couriers which can be dynamically and temporarily expanded to allow delivery capacity to be shared between neighboring regions when necessary to keep customer service performance metrics high. We propose an optimization-based rolling horizon algorithm for courier management that handles both region resizing and delivery task assignment decisions. Experimental results for realistic settings demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully balances customer and courier satisfaction, simultaneously achieving delivery times that are comparable to those of a single operating region and courier satisfaction metrics that are comparable to those achieved by fixed, inflexible regions.",Declaration of Competing Interest None.

Naturally, its seismic network and earthquake database have evolved in tandem with advances in seismology research. Magnitude is one of the most essential factors in determining the size of an earthquake, notably in seismic hazard assessment research. A rigorous and critical examination of these studies was created to compare various interpretations of existing earthquake data in terms of seismic characteristics (date, location, and size) and to determine the most trustworthy interpretation for each tremor. In terms of moment magnitude, the earthquake catalog is homogenized. The catalog compilation technique, the elimination of redundant events, the consolidation of magnitude scales, and the declustering process are used to remove dependent events, and its completeness analysis is well explained. Several magnitude-conversion method relationships, corresponding to known locals and regionals, have been constructed to offer uniform estimates of the moment magnitude for the whole collection.",,,Sādhanā,,,,2023-10-21,2023,2023-10-21,,48,4,225,Closed,Article,"Pallavi; Joshi, Sandeep; Das, Ranjit; Bairwa, Amit Kumar","Pallavi (Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India); Joshi, Sandeep (Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India); Das, Ranjit (Universidad Catolica Del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Bairwa, Amit Kumar (Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India)","Joshi, Sandeep (Manipal Academy of Higher Education)","Pallavi (Manipal Academy of Higher Education); Joshi, Sandeep (Manipal Academy of Higher Education); Das, Ranjit (Catholic University of the North); Bairwa, Amit Kumar (Manipal Academy of Higher Education)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165129352,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

In this paper, we present an alternative view that emotion regulation can generate resources, and we investigate amplification of positive emotions, a potential resource-generating strategy. In study 1, using a field design, we demonstrate that amplification of positive emotion is positively related to employee psychological resources. Furthermore, we show that amplification of positive emotion may reduce absenteeism. In study 2, using a longitudinal lab design, we demonstrate that amplification of positive emotions predicts changes in employee psychological resources over time and does so above and beyond positive affect. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings for emotion researchers, the practical applications of our findings for managers, and areas that require future research.",,,Journal of Business and Psychology,,,,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,2023-06,38,3,539-560,Closed,Article,"Lapalme, Matthew L.; Rojas-Quiroga, Felipe; Pertuzé, Julio A.; Espinoza, Pilar; Rojas-Córdova, Carolina; Ananias, Juan Felipe","Lapalme, Matthew L.

Currently, several raw materials are employed to develop Janus nanoparticles. Among them, silica nanoparticles exhibit significant advantages over other starting materials due to their relatively simple synthesis and modification, high porosity, excellent adsorption capacity, extraordinary colloidal stability, and biocompatibility. Therefore, this review aims to offer a systematic assessment of silica-based Janus nanoparticles, providing a clear description and illustration of the available synthesis methods, which for clarity have been classified into three main categories: masking, self-assembly, and phase separation. The review also discusses the most convenient paths for determining the amphiphilic character of these particles due to the relevance of this property, as well as their potential application in three main areas, including medicine, environment, and energy. Additionally, the reader can find an account of the SiO2-based JNPs shapes reported in the literature, which are summed up in tables to facilitate the identification of their properties and proved applications. The last section is dedicated to discussing the prospects for the synthesis methods of JNPs, the behavioral prediction, and approaches for their characterization and further application.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Also, at the same time, if decision-makers cannot select as proper to needs, the cost of being idle of these kinds of machines is very high. According to the comprehensive literature review and the paper's findings, evaluating turret trucks is complex, complicated, and time-consuming for decision-makers, as many conflicting criteria and uncertainties affect the evaluation processes. Hence, it is required to employ a practical, powerful, and practical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that can handle ambiguities to solve these kinds of problems. For this purpose, the current paper proposes an extended version of a hybrid decision-making tool consisting of FUCOM (Full Consistency Method) and the WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) technique with the help of the intuitionistic fuzzy Dombi aggregation operators. It can help to select the appropriate turret trucks that can help reduce the costs of remaining idle and provide economic effectivity of logistics and warehousing operations. According to the outcomes of the suggested model, the width, lift motor power and lift height of the turret trucks are the most critical and influential criteria, as they determine the corridor width, accordingly space utilization, warehousing capacity, and unit warehousing costs. Finally, the intuitionistic fuzzy model is applied to solve the turret truck selection problems. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis consisting of three phases was performed to test the validation of the proposed model and its obtained results. The sensitivity analysis results approve the proposed model's applicability and validity. Thus, the analysis results validated that the proposed approach is a robust and practical MCDM framework, and its results are accurate and reasonable.",,,Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering,,,,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,2023-11,48,11,15561-15595,Closed,Article,"Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Görçün, Ömer Faruk; Küçükönder, Hande","Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Department of International Logistics and Trade at Kadir Has University, Kadir Has University, Cibali Av.

1029,pub.1149349970,10.36367/ntqr.12.2022.e625,,,Perception about leisure and free time and how it has affected university students,"This research is based on the Teaching Innovation and Improvement Project 2021/2022 aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on health, well-being and quality education, comprehensively addressing the challenges of sustainable educational systems. The appearance of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has increased concern for the physical and mental health of the young and university population, producing serious negative consequences due to the decrease in physical activity and the psychological repercussion caused by social isolation. The research objective has been: ""Analyze leisure and free time activities based on healthy life indicators developed in University of Salamanca to develop a healthy leisure guide"". The research design has been based on content analysis, creating a table of categories and an open response questionnaire for data collection. Among the main results, it can be highlighted that for university students, leisure and free time is synonymous with fun, health and mental balance and time to pursue their hobbies. Among the main reasons for not enjoying their free time and leisure, the lack of time and the academic load stand out. Among the places near their place of residence, where they can carry out leisure and free time activities, parks and gardens, sports venues and bars stand out. The students highlight that the pandemic has caused their social relationships to be considerably reduced and that they value and enjoy more things and activities that they did not previously take into account. The use of a qualitative methodology for this type of work has helped to understand the reasons for the poor quality in the use of their leisure time, in an exhaustive and close way.",,,New Trends in Qualitative Research,Entrepreneurship in doctoral programs: Perspectives of doctoral students and professors on the content of the courses,,,2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,,12,,e625-e625,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Lorenzo-Sánchez, Oscar; Sánchez-Gómez, María Cruz; Martín-Cilleros, María Victoria; Martín-Sevillano, Rocío; Cabanillas-García, Juan Luis; Verdugo-Castro, Sonia","Lorenzo-Sánchez, Oscar (Universidad de Salamanca, España); Sánchez-Gómez, María Cruz (Universidad de Salamanca, España); Martín-Cilleros, María Victoria (Universidad de Salamanca, España); Martín-Sevillano, Rocío (Universidad de Salamanca, España); Cabanillas-García, Juan Luis (Universidad de Salamanca y Universidad de Extremadura, España); Verdugo-Castro, Sonia (Universidad de Salamanca, España)",,"Lorenzo-Sánchez, Oscar (University of Salamanca); Sánchez-Gómez, María Cruz (University of Salamanca); Martín-Cilleros, María Victoria (University of Salamanca); Martín-Sevillano, Rocío (University of Salamanca); Cabanillas-García, Juan Luis (Universidad de Salamanca y Universidad de Extremadura, España); Verdugo-Castro, Sonia (University of Salamanca)",0,0,,0.0,https://publi.ludomedia.org/index.php/ntqr/article/download/625/658,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149349970,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

As a consequence of the so-called ‘racial laws’ of anti-Semitic content enacted in Italy in 1938, Terracini, one of the main figures in the studies on languages in twentieth century Italy, moved to Argentina and worked during the 1940s at the University of Tucumán as professor of Linguistics. Our main focus is the conceptual and methodological ‘turn’ that occurred in the Tucumán years of Terracini’s production, a turn that is materialised with the emphasis on the question of subjectivity and style. We relate this conceptual turn of Terracini with some lines of work, which were at that time powerful in philological studies in Argentina, especially the impulse of stylistic studies undertaken by the Spaniard Amado Alonso during his time as director of the Institute of Philology of the University of Buenos Aires, whose last stage coincides with Terracini’s exile from Tucumán. Also taken into consideration are the glotopolitical implications of the Argentine production of the Italian linguist starting, fundamentally, from the concept of ‘linguistic freedom’.",,,Diaspore,"Dal Mediterraneo all’America Latina | Del Mediterráneo a América Latina

The study was based on the interpretive paradigm, qualitative approach, and phenomenological typology, using the technique of interviewing thirteen experts in school education who dialogued based on data from a previous macro study and their own experience. The changes perceived were that platforms in general improved in organization and arrangement of materials but not in contents that did not overcome initial biases of centralism and thematic adaptation. Accordingly, the expected changes point to overcoming the described deficiencies, as well as unifying the didactic resources equally for all subjects and providing accurate feedback to students on the use of the platforms. The conclusions are: a) the technological resources of the strategy lack what is found in the rest of the Region, which calls the attention of those responsible for educational systems to better address national virtual educational strategies; b) a methodology that could be used in similar contexts is left behind; and c) specifically for Peru, the results can be used by the teachers’ supervisors, due to the valuable information provided.",,,"Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research",Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on International Studies in Social Sciences and Humanities (CISOC 2022),"Daniel Barredo-Ibáñez, Farrah Bérubé, Paulo Carlos López-López, Daniel H.

Systematic Literature Review,"The objective of this systematic review was to document the research trends in audiovisual production applied to the creation of digital content for the YouTube platform, in Ibero-America, between 2010–2021. The research considered the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) methodology for the selection of scientific literature from the EBSCO, Scielo, and Dialnet databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were also applied to find the articles that respond to the research question. Thus, it was possible to find texts in Spanish, publications related to the research topic, and academic articles published between 2010 and 2021. As a search result, 10 articles were obtained for the review. The findings documented the trends, for example, the country with the most publications registered for the research was Spain. In turn, between 2017 and 2020, the highest number of articles on this topic were published. Furthermore, four informative trends were recorded: resources and techniques employed by content creators, types of content and subject matter preferred by users, strategies for content management, and audiences interested in YouTube content creation. Finally, in the process, limitations such as the limited number of articles on the research topic and articles with incomplete information were found.",,,"Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research",Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on International Studies in Social Sciences and Humanities (CISOC 2022),"Daniel Barredo-Ibáñez, Farrah Bérubé, Paulo Carlos López-López, Daniel H.

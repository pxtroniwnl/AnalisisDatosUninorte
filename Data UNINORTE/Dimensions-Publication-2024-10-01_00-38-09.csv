Thirty-two hand dimensions were chosen and 120 males and 86 females were measured. Results indicated that there were differences between the dimensions of the hand for men and women, showing that men are larger. Also, there was a comparison made between some measurements of other studies in different regions of Colombia, the USA, Chile, Jordan, Korea and Japan. The results indicated important physiological differences between regions in Colombia and across countries. It was therefore concluded that differences in anthropometric measurements must be included in the design and procurement of machinery and apparatus in order to avoid productivity loss, occupational injuries or illness.",The authors would like to thank all those who reviewed the manuscript and provided constructive feedback as well as Mr James Newton who reviewed the English language of the manuscript.

However, limitations in these prognostic scores have led to increasing interest in finding biomarkers that might provide additional information. To date, the role of these biomarkers has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline, Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, and LILACS databases. We included studies that assessed the accuracy of biomarkers for the prediction of in-hospital or ≤30-day mortality, in hospitalized adults with CAP. Two independent investigators extracted patient and study characteristics, which were thereafter pooled using a random effects model. Relationships between sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers and prognostic scores were plotter using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: We included 24 articles and 2 databases from 1069 reviewed abstracts, which provided 10,319 patients for analysis. Reported mortality rates varied from 2.4% to 34.6%. The highest AUC values for predicting mortality were associated with pro-adrenomedullin (0.80) and prohormone forms of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.79), followed by cortisol (0.78), procalcitonin (0.75), copeptin (0.71), and C-reactive protein (0.62). There were no statistically significant differences between the AUCs of the studied biomarkers, other than for copeptin and C-reactive protein, which performed comparatively poorly. When compared with the CAP-specific scores, the AUCs were not significantly different from those of most biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified biomarkers are able to predict mortality with moderate to good accuracy in CAP. However, biomarkers have no clear advantage over CAP-specific scores for predicting mortality.",,"Universidad del Norte (PE0031/2014DViasus), Colombia; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad – Instituto de Salud Carlos III (grants 11/01106 and 14/00580), and Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge, España.

APPROACH: The proposed method uses long-range dependencies taking into consideration time-lags between the brain activity and the execution of the motor task. In addition, the proposed method models the dynamics of the task executed by the subject and uses information about these dynamics as prior information during the classification stage.
MAIN RESULTS: The results show that incorporating temporal information about the executed task as well as incorporating long-range dependencies between the brain signals and the labels effectively increases the system's classification performance compared to methods in the state of art.
SIGNIFICANCE: The method proposed in this work makes use of probabilistic graphical models to incorporate temporal information in the classification of finger movements from electrocorticographic recordings. The proposed method highlights the importance of including prior information about the task that the subjects execute. As the results show, the combination of these two features effectively produce a significant improvement of the system's classification performance.","This work was partially supported by Universidad del Norte (Colombia), the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey under Grant 111E056, and by Sabanci University under Grant IACF-11-00889.",,Journal of Neural Engineering,,,"Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Electrocorticography; Fingers; Humans; Models, Statistical; Movement; Psychomotor Performance; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",2016-05-03,2016,2016-05-03,2016-06-01,13,3,036017,Closed,Article,"Saa, Jaime F Delgado; de Pesters, Adriana; Cetin, Mujdat","Saa, Jaime F Delgado (Universidad del Norte, Biomedical Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Barranquilla, Colombia; Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed.); de Pesters, Adriana (National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies, Schalk Lab, Albany, NY, USA); Cetin, Mujdat (Sabanci University, Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey)",,"Saa, Jaime F Delgado (Universidad del Norte; Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed.); de Pesters, Adriana (National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies, Schalk Lab, Albany, NY, USA); Cetin, Mujdat (Sabancı University)",12,3,0.34,1.83,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059161977,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

As with other infectious diseases, in recent years there has been a marked increase in resistance to the antibiotics commonly used against the pathogens that cause CAP. Antimicrobial stewardship denotes coordinated interventions to improve and measure the appropriate use of antibiotics by encouraging the selection of optimal drug regimens. Areas covered: Several elements can be applied to antibiotic stewardship strategies for CAP in order to maintain or improve patient outcomes. In this regard, antibiotic de-escalation, duration of antibiotic treatment, adherence to CAP guidelines recommendations about empirical treatment, and switching from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy may each be relevant in this context. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies, such as prospective audit with intervention and feedback, clinical pathways, and dedicated multidisciplinary teams, that have included some of these elements have demonstrated improvements in antimicrobial use for CAP without negatively affecting clinical outcomes. Expert commentary: Although there are a limited number of randomized clinical studies addressing antimicrobial stewardship strategies in CAP, there is evidence that antibiotic stewardship initiatives can be securely applied, providing benefits to both healthcare systems and patients.",,"This study was supported by Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Instituto de Salud Carlos III [grant 11/01106 and 14/00580] - co-financed by European Development Regional Fund ‘A way to achieve Europe’ ERDF, Spanish Network for the Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI), and the Institut d’Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Spain; and Universidad del Norte, Departamento del Atlántico and Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Colciencias), Colombia.",Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy,,,"Administration, Intravenous; Administration, Oral; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community-Acquired Infections; Disease Management; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Dosage Calculations; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Humans; Pneumonia, Bacterial; Practice Guidelines as Topic",2016-12-27,2016,2016-12-27,2017-04-03,15,4,351-359,Closed,Article,"Viasus, Diego; Vecino-Moreno, Milly; De La Hoz, Juan M.; Carratalà, Jordi","Viasus, Diego (Faculty of Medicine, Health Sciences Division, Hospital Universidad del Norte and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vecino-Moreno, Milly (Faculty of Medicine, Health Sciences Division, Hospital Universidad del Norte and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); De La Hoz, Juan M.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the frequency of resistance to the antimicrobials such as β-lactams or macrolides which have habitually been used against the causative pathogens. Solithromycin, a next-generation macrolide, is the first fluoroketolide with activity against most of the frequently isolated bacteria in community-acquired pneumonia, including typical and atypical bacteria as well as macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Areas covered: A detailed assessment of the literature relating to the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, efficacy, tolerability and safety of solithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia Expert commentary: Recent randomized controlled phase II/III trials have demonstrated the equivalent efficacy of oral and intravenous solithromycin compared with fluoroquinolones in patients with lower mild-to-moderate respiratory infections, and have shown that systemic adverse events are comparable between solithromycin and alternative treatments. However, studies of larger populations which are able to identify infrequent adverse events are now needed to confirm these findings.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which every male patient (n = 40) was matched with three female patients of the same age (±5 years) and racial/ethnic group; disease activity as per the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and disease manifestations at the time of diagnosis were compared.
RESULTS: Alopecia and anti-Ro antibodies were more frequent in female patients. No statistically significant difference in any other disease characteristics was found. However, male gender was associated with a risk of severe disease activity at the time of diagnosis (as determined by SLEDAI ≥12 score) independent of age, racial/ethnic group, anti-Ro positivity or time to criteria accrual (OR: 3.11 95% CI, 1.09-8.92; p = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: In newly diagnosed SLE patients, male gender is associated with higher disease activity despite the fact that male and female patients seem to experience similar overall disease manifestations.",,,Lupus,,,"Adult; Alopecia; Antibodies, Antinuclear; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Young Adult",2016-07-11,2016,2016-07-11,2016-10,25,11,1217-1223,Closed,Article,"Muñoz-Grajales, C; González, L A; Alarcón, G S; Acosta-Reyes, J","Muñoz-Grajales, C (Division of Rheumatology, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellín, Colombia; Division of Rheumatology, Universidad of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); González, L A (Division of Rheumatology, Universidad of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Alarcón, G S (Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA); Acosta-Reyes, J (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Acosta-Reyes, J (Universidad del Norte)","Muñoz-Grajales, C (Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe; University of Antioquia); González, L A (University of Antioquia); Alarcón, G S (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Acosta-Reyes, J (Universidad del Norte)",19,4,0.75,4.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063903618,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

In addition, the majority of road traffic crashes, fatalities and injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries. All young drivers are at risk due to a breadth of age- and inexperience-related factors; however it is well recognised that young drivers may also intentionally engage in risky driving behaviours which increase their crash risk. The aim of this paper is to examine the self-reported risky driving behaviour of young drivers in Australia, New Zealand (high-income countries), and Colombia (middle-income country), and to explore the utility of a crash risk assessment model in these three countries. Young drivers aged 16-25 years completed the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS), in addition to self-reporting crash involvement and driving offences. A hierarchical segmentation analysis via decision trees was used to study the relationship between self-reported crashes and risky driving. Young drivers in Colombia reported more risky driving than young drivers in New Zealand, and considerably more risky driving than young drivers in Australia. Significant differences among and across countries in individual BYNDS items were found, and 23.5% of all participants reported they had been involved in a road crash. Handheld mobile phone usage was the strongest predictor of crashes, followed by driving after drinking alcohol, and carrying friends as passengers. Country of origin predicted mobile phone usage, with New Zealand and Colombia grouped in the same decision tree branch which implies no significant differences in the behaviour between these countries. Despite cultural differences in licensing programs and enforcement, young drivers reported engaging in a similar breadth of risky behaviours. Road crashes were explained by mobile phone usage, drink driving and driving with passengers, suggesting interventions should target these three risk factors. Whilst New Zealand and Australia have implemented graduated driver licensing programs, are geographical neighbours, and are high-income countries, the finding that behaviours of young drivers in New Zealand and Colombia were more similar than those of young drivers in New Zealand and Australia merits further investigation.","AcknowledgementsThe first author is supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Research Fellowship.

M7","The organochlorine insecticide γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH, lindane) and its non-insecticidal α- and β-isomers continue to pose serious environmental and health concerns, although their use has been restricted or completely banned for decades. In this study we report the first evidence of the growth ability of a Streptomyces strain in a mineral salt medium containing high doses of α- and β-HCH (16.6 mg l−1) as a carbon source. Degradation of HCH isomers by Streptomyces sp. M7 was investigated after 1, 4, and 7 days of incubation, determining chloride ion release, and residues in the supernatants by GC with µECD detection. The results show that both the α- and β-HCH isomers were effectively metabolized by Streptomyces sp. M7, with 80 and 78 % degradation respectively, after 7 days of incubation. Moreover, pentachlorocyclohexenes and tetrachlorocyclohexenes were detected as metabolites. In addition, the formation of possible persistent compounds such as chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols were studied by GC–MS, while no phenolic compounds were detected. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that Streptomyces sp. M7 can degrade α- and β-isomers individually or combined with γ-HCH and could be considered as a potential agent for bioremediation of environments contaminated by organochlorine isomers.","This work was supported by the Secretaría de Ciencia, Arte e Innovación Tecnológica, of Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (SCAIT), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), and Universidad del Norte Santo Tomas de Aquino (UNSTA).

An Immunohistochemical and Morphometric Study of Angiogenesis and Vascular Related Factors,"Increased angiogenesis is related to boosted growth and malignancy in carcinomas. “Chronic Persistent Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation” (CPLDIR) exposure increases incidence and aggressive behavior of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (CCRCC). The aim was to study the biology of angiogenesis, including microvessel density (MVD), in human clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas (CCRCC) originating from a radio-contaminated geographical area (Ukraine) and to compare with similar tumors diagnosed in non-contaminated regions of Europe (Spain, Valencia) and Latin America (Colombia, Barranquilla). MVD was comparatively examined in 124 patients diagnosed with CCRCC from three geographical areas by means of digital micro-imaging and computerized analysis. Additionally, 50 adult normal kidneys were used for controls (autopsy kidneys from Valencia and Barranquilla). Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study of several vascular related growth factors was undertaken using a similar methodology. MVD as well as VEFG are the most discriminating factors associated with an aggressive behavior of CCRCC. Their expression increased in proportion to the level of exposure to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation in Ukrainian patients in the 25 years since the Chernobyl accident substantiated by comparison with the two control groups of renal carcinomas present in non-irradiated areas (Spain and Colombia).

However, many WURS items are not specific to ADHD. Here, we investigated the effect of excluding these items on the performance of the WURS in predicting adult ADHD based on previous diagnosis and current clinically significant symptoms. The study was conducted on a sample of adults (n = 1014; 48 % male) participating in a family-based investigation of ADHD. Participants completed the 61-item WURS questionnaire and the 66-item Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the performance of the eight-item WURS (WURS-8) and the longer WURS-25 in predicting previous ADHD diagnosis and current clinically significant ADHD symptoms. WURS-8 and WURS-25 have approximately the same power to predict adult ADHD, based on either previous diagnosis or current symptoms (area under the ROC curves >0.8). WURS-8 performs at least as well as the longer WURS-25 in predicting adult ADHD. This 8-item questionnaire is thus a valid instrument and is especially useful for screening for ADHD in large epidemiological samples.","The authors are grateful to the families who participated in this research.

Each of the groups was exposed to a different episode of the Colombian television series Revelados, desde todas las posiciones. The results showed that greater identification with the main character of the episode transmitting a prevention message was associated with greater cognitive elaboration, which in turn led to more favorable attitudes toward the topics addressed. However, counterarguing was not observed to play a significant mediating role. The findings of this study allow us to conclude that getting people to think and reflect can help persuade them, which suggests that narrative persuasion models and dual models of rhetorical persuasion can be compatible in certain contexts, such as when messages are designed in such a way that characters make explicit arguments that endorse a prosocial message through dialogues.",,,Journal of Health Communication,,,Adolescent; Audiovisual Aids; Cognition; Female; Health Education; Humans; Male; Narration; Persuasive Communication; Social Identification; Television; Young Adult,2016-01-05,2016,2016-01-05,2016-03-03,21,3,293-300,Closed,Article,"Igartua, Juan-José; Casanova, Jair Vega","Igartua, Juan-José (Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Casanova, Jair Vega (Department of Social Communication, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Igartua, Juan-José (University of Salamanca)","Igartua, Juan-José (University of Salamanca); Casanova, Jair Vega (Universidad del Norte)",67,16,1.75,23.12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025623504,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

METHODS: In 2012, using a cross-sectional design, trained interviewers surveyed health care providers in a sample of 798 medical units, of which 756 corresponded to the first and second levels of medical care. One health care professional from each unit was interviewed for the study. The sampling method was systematic and representative of the national and regional levels. Relative frequencies and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using the weighting factor assigned to each medical unit.
RESULTS: Regarding the indicator about recommendations provided to the population regarding early screening for and risk factors and clinical signs of breast cancer, the average number of health care professional responses in accordance with the Mexican standard was 10.7 (95% CI 10.0-11.4) out of a maximum of 28 points, which corresponds to an average rate of 38.2% of responses (95% CI 35.6-40.8). The percentage of correct answers increased in all areas of breast exam knowledge as training hours in the previous year increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals are unaware of the current standards on breast cancer; therefore, these recommendations are not routinely translated into health care practice, which is a barrier to increasing the coverage of screening programs in health care services.","The authors appreciate the collaboration of Rodrigo Valdivia and Jessica Lombana who in 2012 were INMUJERES staff, an institution that funded this study.",,Preventive Medicine,,,"Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mammography; Middle Aged; Morocco; Primary Health Care; Risk Factors; Secondary Care",2016-03-02,2016,2016-03-02,2016-05,86,,147-152,Closed,Article,"Ortega–Olvera, C.; Torres–Mejía, G.; Sánchez–Zamorano, L.M.; Ángeles–Llerenas, A.; Martínez–Matsushita, L.; Rojas–Martínez, R.; Montemayor–Varela, E.; Navarro-Lechuga, Edgar; Lazcano–Ponce, E.","Ortega–Olvera, C.

5582,pub.1015749860,10.1097/yco.0000000000000279,27584709,,Epidemiology of eating disorders in Latin America,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Eating disorders are currently not considered to be limited to Western culture. We systematically reviewed the existing literature on the prevalence of eating disorders in Latin America.
RECENT FINDINGS: Of 1583 records screened, 17 studies from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela were included in the analysis. Most studies reported point-prevalence rates and only three studies provided lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates. We found a mean point-prevalence rate of 0.1% for anorexia nervosa, 1.16% for bulimia nervosa, and 3.53% for binge-eating disorder (BED) in the general population. Heterogeneity for bulimia nervosa and BED was large. This meta-analysis indicates that the prevalence of anorexia nervosa seems to be lower, whereas the prevalence of bulimia nervosa and especially of BED seems to be higher in Latin America than in Western countries.
SUMMARY: Our findings show that eating disorders are common mental disorders in Latin America. However, some facets of Latin American culture might be protective for the development of anorexia nervosa and increase the risk for bulimia nervosa and BED. Further studies investigating the epidemiology of eating disorders and their relation to culture in Latin America are needed.

During practical sessions, students were required to rotate between aligned audio-visual radiology presentations, osteology/anatomical models, and prosection/dissection learning stations. After completing the course, students were invited to complete a survey to establish their opinions on radiology as a mode of learning and their satisfaction with radiological integration in anatomical practical sessions.ResultsMost students were not familiar with radiology prior to attending our university. All our students agreed or strongly agreed that learning to read radiographs in anatomy is important and most agreed that radiology is a valid assessment tool. Sixty percent stated that radiology facilitated their understanding of anatomy. The majority believed that radiology was best suited to clinically relevant anatomy and X-rays were their preferred learning tool.ConclusionsThe practical approach to integrating radiology into undergraduate musculoskeletal anatomy described here did not place strain on existing academic resources. Most students agreed that radiology should be increased in anatomy education and that learning to understand radiographs in anatomy was important for clinical practice.",,,Irish Journal of Medical Science,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Anatomy; Comprehension; Curriculum; Dissection; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Learning; Lower Extremity; Male; Perception; Radiography; Radiology; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2016-07-29,2016,2016-07-29,2017-05,186,2,409-417,Closed,Article,"Davy, S.; O’Keeffe, G.

4105,pub.1023801406,10.1016/j.nedt.2016.08.012,27541947,,A systematic review examining the effectiveness of blending technology with team-based learning,"BACKGROUND: Technological advancements are rapidly changing nursing education in higher education settings. Nursing academics are enthusiastically blending technology with active learning approaches such as Team Based Learning (TBL). While the educational outcomes of TBL are well documented, the value of blending technology with TBL (blended-TBL) remains unclear. This paper presents a systematic review examining the effectiveness of blended-TBL in higher education health disciplines.
OBJECTIVES: This paper aimed to identify how technology has been incorporated into TBL in higher education health disciplines. It also sought to evaluate the educational outcomes of blended-TBL in terms of student learning and preference.
METHOD: A review of TBL research in Medline, CINAHL, ERIC and Embase databases was undertaken including the search terms, team based learning, nursing, health science, medical, pharmaceutical, allied health education and allied health education. Papers were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP).
RESULTS: The final review included 9 papers involving 2094 student participants. A variety of technologies were blended with TBL including interactive eLearning and social media.
CONCLUSION: There is limited evidence that blended-TBL improved student learning outcomes or student preference. Enthusiasm to blend technology with TBL may not be as well founded as initially thought. However, few studies explicitly examined the value of incorporating technology into TBL. There is a clear need for research that can discern the impact of technology into TBL on student preference and learning outcomes, with a particular focus on barriers to student participation with online learning components.","AcknowledgementIsabelle Raisin, Academic Liaison Librarian, helped to conduct the literature search in multiple databases.",,Nurse Education Today,,,"Attitude of Health Personnel; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Nursing; Group Processes; Health Personnel; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Nursing Education Research; Social Media; Social Networking; Videotape Recording",2016-08-12,2016,2016-08-12,2016-10,45,,185-192,Closed,Article,"River, Jo; Currie, Jane; Crawford, Tonia; Betihavas, Vasiliki; Randall, Sue","River, Jo (Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Currie, Jane (Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Crawford, Tonia (Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Betihavas, Vasiliki (Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Randall, Sue (Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia)","River, Jo (The University of Sydney; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia)","River, Jo (The University of Sydney; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Currie, Jane (The University of Sydney; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Crawford, Tonia (The University of Sydney; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Betihavas, Vasiliki (The University of Sydney; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia); Randall, Sue (The University of Sydney; Sydney Nursing School, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia)",55,16,1.96,12.15,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023801406,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study is to compare HRQOL trajectories in stroke survivors to a group of healthy controls from Colombia first year post-stroke. METHODS Forty individuals diagnosed with stroke and 50 controls were recruited from the Psychological Attention Center of Antonio Nariño University. RESULTS Hierarchical linear models suggested that trajectories of all eight indices of HRQOL were lower over time in stroke individuals compared to controls. Stroke patients showed gains in the HRQOL domains of physical functioning, role limitations - physical, role limitations - emotional, pain, and social functioning, although only pain in stroke individuals approached that of controls at 12 months. Despite these improvements, seven of the eight indices of HRQOL in stroke individuals remained very low over time, suggesting that the vast majority of rehabilitation gains in HRQOL, even when present, were extremely limited.

Over the past 30 years, different countries have implemented HTA organizations. Colombia established by law its own HTA agency (IETS) in 2011 which started operations in November 2012. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting and using HTA to inform decision-making in this context. Through a qualitative approach, ten ""drivers"" emerged with the ability to help or hinder HTA development in this context: availability and quality of data, implementation strategy, cultural aspects, local capacity, financial support, policy/political support, globalization, stakeholder pressure, health system context, and usefulness perception.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key HTA researchers, after following rigorous transcription, and thematic content analysis, those aspects that may be barriers or facilitator for HTA development and use in Colombia were identified.
RESULTS: Although HTA has become a tool to inform decision-making around the world, its use may vary according to setting. Determining those aspects which may enable or interfere with HTA development and use in Colombia may be useful for other countries when considering the establishment of HTA systems.

Due to its extremely modified morphology, it is well circumscribed among living taxa, but that is not the case of the two extinct species ascribed to the taxon, Chelus colombianus and Chelus lewisi. These were originally described for the Miocene of Colombia and Venezuela, respectively, and are known mostly from post-cranial material. Few traits have been considered diagnostic for these fossil taxa, and their shared geographic and temporal distributions raise doubts about their distinctiveness. Here, we describe new turtle remains from the early Miocene Castillo Formation, at Cerro la Cruz, northwestern Venezuela, assigning them to C. colombianus. We also review the taxonomy and diagnostic features of the fossil species of Chelus, comparing them with the variation recognized within C. fimbriatus. All alleged differences between the fossil Chelus species were found in our sample of the extant species, and may represent intraspecific variation of a single fossil species. Further, we reviewed the fossil record of Chelus spp. and proposed a paleobiogeographic hypothesis to explain its present geographic range.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Evangelos Vlachos for the discussions about nomenclature, the editor-in-chief of The Science of Nature Sven Thatje, and the reviewers (W.G.

METHODS: Descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study, conducted in the cities of Pereira and Manizales, Colombia, in a care facility between 1 August 2013 and 30 March 2014. A total of 238 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 who had been undergoing treatment with conventional or analogue insulin for at least 6months. Comparison of the results of the Diabetes 39 (specific) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) (generic) tools it was performed. Comparisons between the results of the two instruments were performed. Tests for parametric and non-parametric distribution (Pearson's correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, Student's t-test and Wilcoxon test) were used.
RESULTS: The mean age was 57.7±16.6years. Conventional insulin was prescribed to 69.6% of patients, and analogue insulin was prescribed to 30.4% of patients. Diabetes-39 (D-39) showed 24.7% of subjects with a high quality of life. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing patients prescribed conventional or analogue insulin (p=0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.375-1.419). In the EQ-5D survey, 45.7% claimed to have a high quality of life, without statistically significant differences between groups (p=0.56; 95%CI: 0.676-2.047).
CONCLUSIONS: No differences between patients receiving conventional insulin versus analogue insulin were detected in terms of quality of life.

METHODS: We studied SLE patients from GLADEL, an inception longitudinal cohort from nine Latin American countries. The main predictor was DLE onset, which was defined as physician-documented DLE at SLE diagnosis. The outcome was time from the diagnosis of SLE to new lupus nephritis. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted to examine the association of DLE onset with time to lupus nephritis.
RESULTS: Among 845 GLADEL patients, 204 (24.1%) developed lupus nephritis after SLE diagnosis. Of them, 10 (4.9%) had DLE onset, compared to 83 (12.9%) in the group of 641 patients that remained free of lupus nephritis (hazard ratio 0.39; P = 0.0033). The cumulative proportion of lupus nephritis at 1 and 5 years since SLE diagnosis was 6% and 14%, respectively, in the DLE onset group, compared to 14% and 29% in those without DLE (P = 0.0023). DLE onset was independently associated with a lower risk of lupus nephritis, after controlling for sociodemographic factors and disease severity at diagnosis (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.71).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that DLE onset reduces the risk of further lupus nephritis in patients with SLE, independently of other factors such as age, ethnicity, disease activity, and organ damage. These findings have relevant prognosis implications for SLE patients and their clinicians. Further studies are warranted to unravel the biological and environmental pathways associated with the protective role of DLE against renal disease in patients with SLE.",,,Lupus,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Latin America; Longitudinal Studies; Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Nephritis; Male; Prognosis; Protective Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; Young Adult",2016-07-11,2016,2016-07-11,2017-01,26,1,73-83,Closed,Article,"Pons-Estel, G J; Aspey, L D; Bao, G; Pons-Estel, B A; Wojdyla, D; Saurit, V; Alvarellos, A; Caeiro, F; Salinas, M J Haye; Sato, E I; Soriano, E R; Costallat, L T L; Neira, O; Iglesias-Gamarra, A; Reyes-Llerena, G; Cardiel, M H; Acevedo-Vásquez, E M; Chacón-Díaz, R; Drenkard, C","Pons-Estel, G J (Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Institut Clínic de Medicina i Dermatologia, Barcelona, Spain); Aspey, L D (Department of Dermatology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA); Bao, G (Division of Rheumatology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA); Pons-Estel, B A (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Provincial de Rosario, Rosario, Argentina); Wojdyla, D (GLADEL Consultant, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Rosario, Argentina); Saurit, V (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Privado, Córdoba, Argentina); Alvarellos, A (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Privado, Córdoba, Argentina); Caeiro, F (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Privado, Córdoba, Argentina); Salinas, M J Haye (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Privado, Córdoba, Argentina); Sato, E I (Departamento de Medicina, Universidade Federal da São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, Brazil); Soriano, E R (Sección de Reumatología, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Fundación Dr Pedro M Catoggio para el Progreso de la Reumatología, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Costallat, L T L (Divisao de Reumatologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil); Neira, O (Sección de Reumatología, Hospital del Salvador, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Iglesias-Gamarra, A (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia); Reyes-Llerena, G (Servicio Nacional de Reumatología, Centro de Investigaciones Médico Quirúrgicas (CIMEQ), La Habana, Cuba); Cardiel, M H (Centro de Investigación Clínica de Morelia, Morelia, México); Acevedo-Vásquez, E M (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Nacional ‘Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen’, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); Chacón-Díaz, R (Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Universitario, Caracas, Venezuela); Drenkard, C (Division of Rheumatology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA)","Drenkard, C (Emory University)","Pons-Estel, G J (Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Institut Clínic de Medicina i Dermatologia, Barcelona, Spain); Aspey, L D (Emory University); Bao, G (Emory University); Pons-Estel, B A (Hospital Provincial de Rosario); Wojdyla, D (National University of Rosario); Saurit, V (Hospital Privado); Alvarellos, A (Hospital Privado); Caeiro, F (Hospital Privado); Salinas, M J Haye (Hospital Privado); Sato, E I (Federal University of São Paulo); Soriano, E R (Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires; Fundación Dr Pedro M Catoggio para el Progreso de la Reumatología, Buenos Aires, Argentina); Costallat, L T L (State University of Campinas); Neira, O (Hospital del Salvador); Iglesias-Gamarra, A (National University of Colombia); Reyes-Llerena, G (Servicio Nacional de Reumatología, Centro de Investigaciones Médico Quirúrgicas (CIMEQ), La Habana, Cuba); Cardiel, M H (Centro de Investigación Clínica de Morelia, Morelia, México); Acevedo-Vásquez, E M (National University of San Marcos); Chacón-Díaz, R (Hospital Clínico Universitario de Caracas); Drenkard, C (Emory University)",8,1,0.42,1.93,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050742816,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Recently, research has indicated that the circumstances surrounding poverty can significantly influence children’s development. In this study, we aimed to measure the developmental level of children living in low-income, rural areas in northern Colombia. A total of 629 children (aged 0–5 years) were assessed using the Battelle Developmental Inventory. Results indicated that 17 % of the participants had a general developmental delay for their age group. This was especially true for scores on cognitive development (35.5 %) and communication (21.5 %). Moreover, the number of children with developmental delay increased at 6 months of age and continued to increase after 1 year in the communication and cognitive domains. The findings of this study suggest that impoverished social contexts—such as the one studied herein—offer opportunities that favor the development of the social domain, but restrict the development of the cognitive domain. Therefore, to promote cognitive development, individuals within children’s environment need to actively and intentionally stimulate them. Thus, there is a need for interventions that will improve environmental conditions; especially those that will help parents improve their caregiving practices and train educational staff to recognize and respond to the stimulation needs of children, especially those developmental domains that are affected by the environment.",The authors would like to thank all of the field staff and the Neurolab Team Uninorte.,,Journal of Child and Family Studies,,,,2016-08-19,2016,2016-08-19,2016-12,25,12,3637-3643,Closed,Article,"De los Reyes-Aragon, Carlos Jose; Amar Amar, Jose; De Castro Correa, Alberto; Lewis Harb, Soraya; Madariaga, Camilo; Abello-Llanos, Raimundo","De los Reyes-Aragon, Carlos Jose (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Amar Amar, Jose (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); De Castro Correa, Alberto (Humanities and Social Sciences Deanship, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lewis Harb, Soraya (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Madariaga, Camilo (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Abello-Llanos, Raimundo (R&D and Innovation Office, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","De los Reyes-Aragon, Carlos Jose (Universidad del Norte)","De los Reyes-Aragon, Carlos Jose (Universidad del Norte); Amar Amar, Jose (Universidad del Norte); De Castro Correa, Alberto (Universidad del Norte); Lewis Harb, Soraya (Universidad del Norte); Madariaga, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Abello-Llanos, Raimundo (Universidad del Norte)",8,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041204367,52 Psychology,1 No Poverty; 4 Quality Education

METHODS: Recommendations were developed by a group of 48 specialists of rheumatologists, members of other medical disciplines (orthopedics and physiatrists), and three patients, one for each location of OA. A systematic review of existing articles, meta-analyses, and guidelines for the management of hand, hip, and knee OA published between 2008 and January 2014 was undertaken. The scores for Level of Evidence and Grade of Recommendation were proposed and fully consented within the committee based on The American Heart Association Evidence-Based Scoring System. The level of agreement was established through a variation of Delphi technique.
RESULTS: Both ""strong"" and ""conditional"" recommendations are given for management of hand, hip, and knee OA and nonpharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical modalities of treatment are presented according to the different levels of agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations are based on the consensus of clinical experts from a wide range of disciplines taking available evidence into account while balancing the benefits and risks of nonpharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatment modalities, and incorporating their preferences and values.

Patients with sporadic AD (sAD) from a genetic isolate in the extremes of the AOO distribution were whole-exome genotyped. Single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effects models were used to identify functional variants modifying AOO. A posteriori enrichment and bioinformatic analyses were applied to evaluate the non-random clustering of the associate variants to physiopathological pathways involved in AD. We identified more than 20 pathogenic, genome-wide statistically significant mutations of major modifier effect on the AOO. These variants are harbored in genes implicated in neuron apoptosis, neurogenesis, inflammatory processes linked to AD, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and memory processes. This set of new genes harboring these mutations could be of importance for prediction, follow-up and eventually as therapeutical targets of AD. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","We express our highest sentiment of appreciation and gratitude to the patients from the Paisa community and their relatives enrolled in this study for more than 25 years.

A cada sujeto se le entregaron 2 portaobjetos para la toma del líquido preeyaculatorio y un recipiente para la toma de muestra del líquido seminal; se tomó primero y por autoestímulo la muestra preeyaculatoria y posteriormente la muestra para el espermiograma; la búsqueda de espermatozoides en el líquido preeyaculatorio se realizó en al menos 10 campos a un aumento de ×20 y en los 2 portaobjetos. El líquido seminal se procesó según normas de la OMS.ResultadosLos líquidos preeyaculatorios examinados no tenían espermatozoides. Todos los sujetos del estudio tenían espermiogramas con recuento total de espermatozoides superiores a 100 millones de espermatozoides, una movilidad superior al 50%; el pH promedio fue de 8,2±0,5.ConclusionesEl líquido preeyaculatorio secretado por las glándulas de Cowper y Littre durante la estimulación sexual no contiene espermatozoides, siempre que haya al menos 2 días de abstinencia eyaculatoria previa y, por lo tanto, no puede ser responsable de los embarazos ocurridos en la práctica del contacto sexual del pene sobre los genitales externos femeninos ni en la práctica del coito interrumpido como método anticonceptivo.AbstractObjectiveTo determine the presence or absence of sperm in pre ejaculate fluid.Material and methodsA descriptive, cross-sectional study in 25 college male volunteers, aged between 18 and 25 in Barranquilla (Colombia). Each subject was given two slides for making pre-ejaculatory fluid and a container for sampling of seminal fluid; pre-ejaculatory sample was taken first by self-stimulation, and subsequently the sample for semen analysis was collected. Search for sperm in pre-ejaculatory liquid was held in at least 10 fields at ×20 magnification and the two slides. The seminal fluid was processed according to WHO standards.ResultsNone of the pre-ejaculatory fluids examined had sperm. All study subjects had spermiograms with total count in excess of 100 million sperm mobility greater than 50%; the average pH was 8.2±0.5.ConclusionsPre-ejaculatory fluid secreted by the glands of Cowper and Littre during sexual stimulation, does not contain sperm and therefore cannot be responsible for pregnancies occurring in the practice of sexual intercourse where the penis is in contact with the external female genitalia or in practice of withdrawal as a contraceptive method.",,,Revista Internacional de Andrología,,,,2016-07,2016,,2016-07,14,3,86-88,Closed,Article,"Vásquez, Fernando; Hernández, Faruk; Escobar, Andrés; Vásquez, Daniel; Orozco, Elida; Vizcaíno, Idela; Álvarez, Mariel; Carmona, Zenén","Vásquez, Fernando (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernández, Faruk (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Escobar, Andrés (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vásquez, Daniel (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Orozco, Elida (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vizcaíno, Idela (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Álvarez, Mariel (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carmona, Zenén (Grupo de Investigaciones en Salud Sexual y Reproductiva, Programa de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Vásquez, Fernando (Universidad del Norte)","Vásquez, Fernando (Universidad del Norte); Hernández, Faruk (Universidad del Norte); Escobar, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Vásquez, Daniel (Universidad del Norte); Orozco, Elida (Universidad del Norte); Vizcaíno, Idela (Universidad del Norte); Álvarez, Mariel (Universidad del Norte); Carmona, Zenén (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038176662,,

In dealing with traumatic outcomes psychology must overcome the mutually constitutive interaction between the (dis)order of a given macro or microsocial context and the mental health of the persons living in it. Social psychologist Ignacio Martín-Baró addressed in a preferential way the study of civil war in El Salvador in terms of intergroup hostility and polarization. He also approached the aftereffects of war by means of a theoretical core assumption: that traumatic experience rooted in collective violence (a human-made stressor) should be understood bearing in mind its social roots (pretraumatic situation), its personal and collective harm (collective injury), and the destruction of the social fabric. These are the arguments for his conceptualization of psychosocial trauma. Twenty-six years after the violent murder of Martín-Baró, along with 5 Jesuit priests, a housekeeper, and his teenage daughter, the current authors have adopted his general framework. Based on new theoretical insights and supporting data, the authors propose an expanded 4-dimension theoretical argument on psychosocial trauma: (a) pretrauma conditions based on social distress, (b) shared network of fear leading to breakdown of core social assumptions, (c) the outgroup as a target of negative emotions, and (d) destruction of family ties and community networks.",,,American Psychologist,,,"Fear; Humans; Mental Health; Psychology, Social; Social Control, Formal; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Violence",2016-04,2016,2016,2016-04,71,3,187-198,Closed,Article,"Blanco, Amalio; Blanco, Rubén; Díaz, Darío","Blanco, Amalio (Department of Social Psychology and Methodology, Faculty of Psychology, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.); Blanco, Rubén (Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal.); Díaz, Darío (Department of Psychology, School of Medicine, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha.)","Blanco, Amalio (Autonomous University of Madrid)","Blanco, Amalio (Autonomous University of Madrid); Blanco, Rubén (Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal); Díaz, Darío (University of Castilla-La Mancha)",36,10,0.87,6.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047069836,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

The river originates in the Andean Cordillera at an elevation of 3685m and flows to its mouth in the Caribbean Sea (Bocas de Cenizas). For this study, information on daily flow discharge (Q), suspended sediment transport (Qs) and mean suspended sediment concentration (Cs) from 1990–2010 for the Magdalena River, based on measurements at the Calamar gauging station (the closest station to the mouth), was provided by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM in Spanish). The mean annual suspended sediment load was 169±73×106tyr−1 for the period from 1990–1999 and 145±47×106tyr−1 for the period from 2000–2010, amounting to a 14% reduction in the suspended sediment transport rate between the two periods. The sediment rating curve (Qs=aQb) was also evaluated for these two periods (1990–1999 and 2000–2010). An analysis of the regression coefficients (a, b) for the two periods showed a decrease in b and an increase in a after 1999, which coincides with a decrease in suspended sediment transport. This change might be attributed to natural factors, including the accumulation of sediment in the Depresion Momposina and variation in hydro-climatological patterns in the Caribbean region. Decreases in effective transport were confirmed using three methods (Log-Normal and Normal distribution, and magnitude-frequency histogram) for the study period.","AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by a Universidad del Norte Dirección de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación (Directorate of Research, Development and Innovation).

It is supplied by an artificial channel (Canal del Dique) through a two floodgates system. As a result of excess nutrients and other pollution loads from the drainage basin in recent decades, the Guájaro reservoir suffers eutrophication and other pollution problems; however it still continues being exploited. For this reason, it is necessary to regulate the hydraulic structures that supply this water body, as they play an important role in managing levels, and these in turn for water supply and environmental purposes. The present work is carried out as a sustainability management alternative of the reservoir. The implementation of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and its calibration is achieved using time series of the free surface levels, and comparing the measured velocities and those estimated by the model for two different climatic periods, to assist the operation of the Canal del Dique-Guájaro hydrosystem. The corresponding comparisons showed a good behavior between measured and simulated data. Based on the quantitative results of the Nash-Sutcliffe reliability method, the results are considered quite satisfactory for estimating and predicting the amount of water flowing in and out of the reservoir through the channel reservoir hydrosystem.",,,Environmental Science and Engineering,Recent Advances in Fluid Dynamics with Environmental Applications,"Jaime Klapp, Leonardo Di G.

2735,pub.1018404140,10.1177/0094582x16668312,,,Participation without Power,"Citizen participation has become an important political strategy. A case study of the Barranquilla land-use plan employing Fung and Wright’s theories on countervailing power reveals that the citizen participation promoted to comply with legal requirements was a failure because it was manipulated by the dominant public actor. In societies such as that of Barranquilla, which employs traditional modes of politics, there is little chance of fostering successful participatory processes because there is no countervailing power to offset the established one. The violent context that surrounds the political sphere, low confidence in state institutions, and the convergence of economic and political power prevent the creation of strong and independent countervailing powers. La participación ciudadana se ha convertido en una importante estrategia política. El estudio de caso del plan de usos de terrenos de Barranquilla a través del prisma de las teorías de Fung y Wright sobre el poder compensatorio revela que la participación ciudadana promovida para cumplir con los requisitos legales fue un fracaso porque fue manipulada por el actor público dominante. En sociedades como la de Barranquilla, con sus modos tradicionales de la política, hay pocas posibilidades de fomentar procesos de participación exitosos porque no hay un poder compensatorio que contrarreste el poder establecido.

Implementing sustainable urban drainage systems - SUDS in consolidated urban watersheds is a feasible alternative that allows managing stormwater runoff combined with the traditional infrastructure. However, its use on a massive scale in cities is a challenge for urban planning. This article shows the results from a research oriented to identifying potential areas for applying SUDS as a support for urban planning in order to define strategies for potential application of rain gardens, permeable paving, storage tanks and green roofs by using models from GIS. A case study was conducted to 10 watersheds in Barranquilla (Colombia), which has severe stormwater issues related to runoff volume and peak flow, and where SUDS may be a feasible alternative for runoff management. Physical conditions of the watershed, such as the type of soil, the water table and slope, socio-economic characteristics, land use and other environmental variables were analyzed in a decision making framework model implemented in GIS. The results allowed defining criteria for prioritizing by type of SUDS and location area in order to help ensuring their general effectiveness on the urban watersheds.",,,,World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2016,,,2016-05-16,2016,2016-05-18,2016-05-16,,,106-114,Closed,Proceeding,"Ávila, Humberto; Amaris, Gloria; Buelvas, Jorge","Ávila, Humberto (Ph.D. Civil Engineer, Professor of Water Resources Engineering.

The LC oscillator is based on the BJT cross-coupled pair topology with tuning varactors and a dual supply source so that the tuning range is maximized. The trade-off between the quality factor, tuning range and number of varactors in parallel is analyzed. In addition, the stability of the AGC system is proven by the estimation of the gain and phase margin. Finally, the phase noise (PN) LC-VCO is estimated using the Leeson model. The oscillator shows a tuning range from 4.3MHz to 6MHz (about 330,000 ppm) and an estimated phase noise of -117.2dB /Hz@ 1kHz.

Fieldwork, rainfall and flow rate monitoring, and numerical modeling were conducted to evaluate different scenarios combining storage tank capacity, two types of storage operations, and different locations by land use and watershed sectoring. These results showed that it is possible to reduce significantly the peak flow with small-capacity tanks distributed in the urban watershed with hydraulic structures that divide the discharge during the peak-flow time interval. By storing 3–17% of the runoff volume, equivalent to a dispersed storage capacity from 4 to 19 mm rainfall, it is possible to reduce the peak flow from 25 to 75%. These results demonstrate the advantages of using low impact development for stormwater management in consolidated cities with limited space, if regulatory policies encourage the massive use of LID in existing buildings.","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation—COLCIENCIAS and Universidad del Norte.",,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,,,,2016-07-20,2016,2016-07-20,2016-12,142,12,04016056,Closed,Article,"Avila, Humberto; Avila, Leandro; Sisa, Augusto","Avila, Humberto (Professor of Water Resources Engineering, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Director of the Institute of Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering—IDEHA, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, 081007 (corresponding author).

In this paper, an analysis of a reservoir pressure piston working between two linear flow resistances is performed by considering the friction of the piston cylinder system on the walls. The proposed model is developed to obtain the optimum power output and speed of the piston in terms of first law efficiency. If the friction on the piston–cylinder assembly is neglected, the expressions obtained are consistent with those presented in the literature under laminar regime. It was also demonstrated that for both laminar and turbulent regimes with overall size constraints, the power delivered can be maximized by balancing the upstream and downstream flow resistances of the piston. This paper also evaluated the influence of the overall size constraints and flow regime on the performance of the piston cylinder. This analysis is equivalent to evaluate the irreversibilities in an endo-irreversible Carnot heat engine with heat loss resistance between the engine and its heat reservoirs. The proposed model introduced some modifications to the results obtained from the recent literature and led to important conclusions. Finally, the proposed model was applied to calculate the lost available work in a turbine operating at steady flow conditions with an ideal gas as working fluid.",,,Journal of Energy Resources Technology,,,,2016-11-16,2016,2016-11-16,2017-05-01,139,3,032903,Closed,Article,"Diaz, German Amador; Forero, Jorge Duarte; Garcia, Jesus; Rincon, Adriana; Fontalvo, Armando; Bula, Antonio; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez","Diaz, German Amador (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia e-mail:); Forero, Jorge Duarte (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Antonio Narino, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia e-mail:); Garcia, Jesus (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia e-mail:); Rincon, Adriana (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia e-mail:); Fontalvo, Armando (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia e-mail:); Bula, Antonio (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080003, Colombia e-mail:); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, New South Wales 2480, Australia e-mail:)",,"Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte); Forero, Jorge Duarte (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Antonio Nariño); Garcia, Jesus (Universidad del Norte); Rincon, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); Fontalvo, Armando (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University)",25,3,,3.71,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1062160298,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,

Results show that the adsorption of silicon atoms on the bridge sites is energetically more favored as compared with other possible adsorption sites. Formation energy calculations indicate that the silicon impurity atoms prefer to incorporate in second or deeper GaN surface layers. However, it is concluded that the incorporation of Si atoms in the Ga-substitutional site is energetically more favorable compared with the N-substitution and Si-adsorption on the top layers. At full coverage, calculations show the formation of two-dimensional SiNx layers on the GaN nonpolar surfaces over the entire range of Ga chemical potentials, in agreement with experimental observations. In addition, the electronic structure of the GaN nonpolar surfaces with Si doping was analyzed and compared with those of undoped surfaces.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been carried out with the financial support of Universidad del Norte and Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Research of Colombia) under “Convocatoria 658 - Convocatoria para proyectos de investigación en ciencias básicas año 2014”.",,Thin Solid Films,,,,2016-03,2016,,2016-03,603,,238-242,Closed,Article,"González-Hernández, Rafael; González-Garcia, Alvaro; Martínez, Gustavo; López-Perez, William","González-Hernández, Rafael (Grupo de Investigación en Fsica Aplicada, Departamento de Fsica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González-Garcia, Alvaro (Grupo de Investigación en Fsica Aplicada, Departamento de Fsica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martínez, Gustavo (Grupo de Investigación en Fsica Aplicada, Departamento de Fsica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); López-Perez, William (Grupo de Investigación en Fsica Aplicada, Departamento de Fsica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","González-Hernández, Rafael (Universidad del Norte)","González-Hernández, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); González-Garcia, Alvaro (Universidad del Norte); Martínez, Gustavo (Universidad del Norte); López-Perez, William (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005470643,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

The plane-wave pseudopotential method was used in order to calculate total energies and electronic structures. It was found that the MnGa substitution is the most stable configuration with a formation energy of ∼1.60 eV/Mn-atom. The calculated density of states shows that the half-metallic ferromagnetism is energetically stable for all dopant concentrations with a total magnetization of about 4.0 μB/Mn-atom. The results indicate that the magnetic ground state originates from the strong hybridization between Mn-d and Sb-p states, which agree with previous studies on Mn-doped wide gap semiconductors.

In recent decades, much effort has been concentrated on the development of cleaner fuels to mitigate this externality. However, market shares for cleaner-fueled buses are still modest, which is why it is relevant to evaluate the aspects influencing their acceptance. This article presents an econometric model to evaluate factors influencing demand for transit buses in Colombia powered by cleaner fuels. For this purpose, a stated preference survey was applied to public transportation entrepreneurs. Results suggest that the target population considers acquisition cost and operating cost as the most important variables when choosing fuel technology for their fleets. The power offered by the bus engine was relevant for some alternative fuel alternatives, but not the full range.","The authors would like to thank the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) for having partially financed this work through contracts 470-2014 (Cod. 1215-675-47211) and FP44842-105-2015.",,Journal of Public Transportation,,,,2016-06,2016,2016-06,,19,2,23-37,Closed,Article,"Galván, Janer; Cantillo, Victor; Arellana, Julian","Galván, Janer (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"Galván, Janer (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte)",13,3,,2.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072565933,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",
1919,pub.1092899216,10.1115/power2016-59308,,,Energy Efficiency Increase in Cement Industry Through Implementation of Up and Bottoming Cogeneration Cycles,"Cement industry consumes high energy levels with 4GJ per ton produced in average, 30% of it being electric and 70% thermal [1]. Cogeneration in this type of processes is not widespread; for only a few efforts have been made worldwide to implement methods that take advantage of waste heat stream, given that these contain 36% of the thermal input energy required to produce electricity [2]. Furthermore the implementation of a power generation alternative to feed limestone’s calcinations process is suggested. This paper is focused on the evaluation of thermal energy recovery strategies through the implementation of cogeneration systems, enabling an increase in efficiency and profitability producing electricity in before and after-processes of the cement production process. This will be achieved using methods of computer analysis implementing the ASPEN HYSIS™ software to simulate the behavior of the systems taking the rotary kiln operating conditions as main input or output variables. For the implementation of the system two important steps furnace operation will be taken. First one, related to combustion, is performed to produce the energy required in limestone’s processing entering this system, at this point the commercial gas turbine is used, coupled to a generator subsequently taking the power of oxygen-rich flow at the exhaust which is at a high temperature allowing a post-combustion using an afterburner. Finally, a second stage is evaluated at the downstream of the kiln, where a flow of charged waste gases counts with enough energy to perform an additional phase of power generation using an organic Rakine cycle (ORC).Copyright © 2016 by ASME",,,,ASME 2016 Power Conference,,,2016-06-26,2016,2016-11-01,2016-06-26,,,v001t10a002-v001t10a002,Closed,Proceeding,"Agamez, Cristian Camilo Soles; Corredor, Lesmes","Agamez, Cristian Camilo Soles (Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corredor, Lesmes (Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Agamez, Cristian Camilo Soles (Universidad del Norte); Corredor, Lesmes (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092899216,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

These deliberative methods are subject to criticisms. One issue of concern is that the socio-economic inequalities among members of the deliberative group may severely impede communication and consequently distort deliberative outcomes. To examine such possibility we applied the deliberative methodology in a case study of forest conservation in Colombia. We found that those individuals who assumed social (environmental) leadership positions tended to dominate group discussion. Nevertheless, the variations in the capacity to engage in group deliberation were better explained by participants' personal characteristics than external constraints or group pressure. Also, there was little evidence that leadership and domination in group deliberation significantly influenced participants' stated WTP. We conclude that DMV is vulnerable to the background inequalities among group members. The democratic potential of deliberative methods should be critically examined in terms of the capacity to communicate effectively and equally.","AcknowledgementsThis work would not be possible without the financial and human support of the Strategic Area Program on Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Well-Being of Universidad del Norte, Colombia (2013-DI0025).

A technique meeting this requirement was proposed that uses the C4.5 algorithm to derive decision rules for personality profiling of public safety offenders. The Mini‐Mult test was used to measure the personality profiles of 238 individuals. With the test results as our database, a C4.5 DT was applied to construct rules that classify each profile into one of two groups, those without and those with records of offences against public safety. The model correctly classified 80% of the personality profiles and delivered a set of decision rules for distinguishing the profiles by group, and the principal personality profiles were interpreted. We conclude that DTs are a promising technique for analysing personality profiles by their offender or non‐offender status. Finally, we believe that the development of a classifying model using DT may have practical applications in the Colombian prison system.

1885,pub.1062159303,10.1115/1.4034026,,,Auto-Ignition Control in Spark-Ignition Engines Using Internal Model Control Structure,"This paper analyzes the feasibility of applying model predictive control strategies for mitigation of the auto-ignition phenomenon, which affects the performance of spark-ignition internal combustion engines. The first part of this paper shows the implementation and experimental validation of a two-dimensional model, based on thermodynamic equations, to simulate operating conditions in engines fueled with natural gas. Over this validated model, several control strategies are studied in order to evaluate, through simulation analysis, which of these offer the best handling capacity of the auto-ignition phenomenon. In order to achieve this goal, multivariate control strategies are implemented for a simultaneous manipulation of the fuel/air ratio, the crank angle at ignition, and the inlet pressure. The controlled variable in this research is the temperature at the ignition point. This temperature is obtained through an estimation based on pressure in the combustion chamber at that point, which is located toward the end zone of the compression stroke. If the ignition temperature of the fuel–air mixture is reached during the compression process, then auto-ignition takes place. Proposed control strategies consist of maintaining the temperature in the ignition point below the fuel–air mixture auto-ignition temperature. The results show that auto-ignition is difficult to avoid using a single input–single output (SISO) strategy. However, a multiple input–single output (MISO) approach avoids the influence of the phenomenon without a significant impact over the engine's performance. Among the developed strategies, an approach based on model predictive control and feedforward control strategy shows the best performance, measured through the integral absolute error (IAE) index. These results open the possibility of new ways for improving the control capacity of auto-ignition phenomenon in engines compared to currently available feedback control systems.",,,Journal of Energy Resources Technology,,,,2016-07-12,2016,2016-07-12,2017-03-01,139,2,022201,Closed,Article,"Duarte, Jorge; Garcia, Jesús; Jiménez, Javier; Sanjuan, Marco E.; Bula, Antonio; González, Jorge","Duarte, Jorge (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Antonio Nariño, Barranquilla 080008, Colombia e-mail:); Garcia, Jesús (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia e-mail:); Jiménez, Javier (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia e-mail:); Sanjuan, Marco E.

Participants were 540 people affected by floods in Colombia and by earthquakes in Spain and Chile. Posttraumatic growth was assessed at individual, community, and society levels. Direct and indirect relationships between trauma intensity and posttraumatic growth were analyzed to identify and evaluate the mediating role played by communal coping strategies. Growth and communal coping were reported in all nations, but means for posttraumatic growth at all three levels and communal coping were higher in the relatively more collectivistic countries, Colombia and Chile, than in the relatively more individualistic Spain. Spiritual coping was more frequent in the two Latin American nations, but it also predicted growth even in more secularized Spain. Social support was similar in Spain and Chile, and higher in Colombia, and played a more important mediating role in Spain. Globally, our results confirmed that communal coping strategies and participation in collective gatherings are antecedent of posttraumatic growth not only at individual but also at communal level and in different cultural contexts.","The authors thank City Hall of Lorca (Spain), and Antonio Varón Molina and Dr. Félix Cova (Universidad de Concepción, Chile) for their role in collecting data and their helpful research assistance on Studies 1 and 2.","Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under Grant PSI2011-26315; the University of the Basque Country under Grant IT-666-13 and Grant UFI 11/04; Basque Government’s Post-doctoral Research Staff Improvement Training Fellowship granted to Anna Wlodarczyk under Grant POS_2015_1_0075; and the Directorate of Research and Projects (DIP) of the Universidad del Norte, Colombia.",Cross-Cultural Research,,,,2016-09-12,2016,2016-09-12,2016-10,50,4,325-355,Closed,Article,"Wlodarczyk, Anna; Basabe, Nekane; Páez, Dario; Reyes, Carlos; Villagrán, Loreto; Madariaga, Camilo; Palacio, Jorge; Martínez, Francisco","Wlodarczyk, Anna (University of the Basque Country, San Sebastián, Spain; Universidad Cátolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Basabe, Nekane (University of the Basque Country, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain); Páez, Dario (University of the Basque Country, San Sebastián, Spain; Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile); Reyes, Carlos (Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain); Villagrán, Loreto (Universidad San Sebastián, Concepción, Chile); Madariaga, Camilo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Palacio, Jorge (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martínez, Francisco (University of Murcia, Spain)","Wlodarczyk, Anna (University of the Basque Country; Catholic University of the North)","Wlodarczyk, Anna (University of the Basque Country; Catholic University of the North); Basabe, Nekane (University of the Basque Country); Páez, Dario (University of the Basque Country; University of Santiago Chile); Reyes, Carlos (Autonomous University of Madrid); Villagrán, Loreto (San Sebastián University); Madariaga, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Palacio, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Martínez, Francisco (University of Murcia)",51,20,,11.26,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046246327,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 52 Psychology,

Due to the lack of a stormwater drainage system in more than 90% of its urban area, the runoff flows on the streets during rain events with dangerous flow rates of up to 100 m3/s for a 50-years return period. The permeable areas are little and the steep slopes of the city cause supercritical flow and flash floods on many streets with high velocities. This has negative consequences such loss of human life, damage to infrastructure, and economic losses. A 1D model was setup in PCSWMM to assess the flow rate, velocity and hazard levels on the streets for different rainfall events. This model was performed considering a process of characterization and calibration of the drainage conditions of the city, including land survey and field measuring by using rain gages and flow gauges installed in the monitoring system PLUVIAL.CO (www.pluvial.co). The hazard levels results were compared with the safety criteria for people (1.2 m2/s), obtaining up to 6 m2/s from recorded events in 2014 and 20 m2/s for events with 100-year storm.

The presence of this moisture increases the deterioration rate of the products during storage, handling, and processing periods; drying is one of the most suitable processes that can be applied to these by-products before using them as cattle feed or soil conditioner. This process is certainly one of the most energy consuming found in industry. The selection of an appropriate process control strategies can minimize production and maintenance cost, maximize product quality and reduce environmental pollution. Rotary dryers are normally employed to dry agricultural products because it can give high production rate and high drying uniformity. The aim of this research is to improve the performance of a feedback control strategy for a drying process, based on the implementation design of experiment; this approach allows finding specifics tuning parameters and potential operation conditions that will traduce in a more robust process. The selected criterion to evaluate the performance of the strategy is the integral absolute of the error (IAE) and the analysis is based on a dynamic model of a rotary dryer. The objective of the process improvement is to find an operation region, function of the controller gain, the integral time and derivative time, in which IAE parameter is minimized, this will lead to enhancement of equipment performance and reduction of the wear of the final control element. Once the controlled strategy is described, the methodology states an exploratory stage, for process characterization, establishment of a regression model, to describe the relation between experiment significant factors and response variable, maximum ascent route, exploration of a possible curvature, definition of a new regression model and finally determination of a new optimum operating point.Copyright © 2016 by ASME",,,,Volume 6B: Energy,,,2016-11-11,2016,2017-02-08,2016-11-11,,,v06bt08a018-v06bt08a018,Closed,Proceeding,"Lugo, Ana M.; Durán, Cinthia Audivet; Sanjuán, Marco E.","Lugo, Ana M.

The product of a valuation may be an array of expressions of willingness to pay (WTP) by individuals or a collectively agreed monetary value. Concerns have been raised, however, as to whether this product is an outcome of thoughtful and independent decision-making or influenced by social pressures to conform. Our study examines this issue and addresses concerns about the use of DMV, based on a public deliberation of forest conservation in Colombia. We analyzed the impacts of social conformity on WTP under two different decision scenarios: individual and collective. The results suggest that the impacts of social conformity are greater when a collective decision is required. These findings indicate that tensions between the differing goals of DMV could undermine its democratic promise.","We thank the participants of the deliberative workshop, who crucially contributed to the success of the research project.

The adsorption energy, geometry, formation energy, band structure and density of states of Sc (and Y) adatom/AlN(0001) systems are calculated. The calculations showed that the interaction between Sc (and Y) adatom and the AlN(0001) surface is strong (~3.9eV) and it prefers to adsorb on N-top site (T4). However, formation energy calculations reveal that the incorporation of Sc and Y atoms in the Al-substitutional site is energetically more favorable compared with the adsorption on the top layers, which can be attributed to the lower enthalpy of formation of ScN and YN with respect to that of AlN. The results also suggest that the Sc and Y atoms prefer to incorporate in top AlN surface layers. At full coverage, calculations show the formation of metallic ScxN and YxAl1−xN layers on the AlN polar surface over the entire range of Al chemical potentials, in agreement with experimental observations. In addition, we found that for high coverage Sc atoms couple ferromagnetically in the Al-substitutional sites on the AlN(0001) surface.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been carried out with the financial support of Universidad del Norte and Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Research of Colombia) under “Convocatoria 658 – Convocatoria para proyectos de investigaciòn en ciencias bàsicas año 2014”.",,Journal of Crystal Growth,,,,2016-06,2016,,2016-06,443,,1-7,Closed,Article,"González-Hernández, Rafael; González-Garcia, Alvaro; López-Perez, William","González-Hernández, Rafael (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González-Garcia, Alvaro (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); López-Perez, William (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"González-Hernández, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); González-Garcia, Alvaro (Universidad del Norte); López-Perez, William (Universidad del Norte)",7,2,,0.76,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016236362,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,

Sediment transport and geomorphological change in a high-discharge tropical delta (Magdalena River, Colombia): Insights from a period of intense change and human intervention (19902010). There is strong indication that environmental changes and human interventions have affected freshwater discharge and sediment flux in the Magdalena River (northwestern South America) within the period from 1990 to 2010. Thus, stream flow, suspended sediment load (SSL), and riverbed dynamics were analysed in this study for estimating changes in the suspended sediment transport regime as well as of erosional/depositional patterns in different zones of the delta. It can be shown that stream flow increased at a higher rate than suspended sediment transport, promoting changes in the sediment transport regime. Erosion appeared at the mouth/frontal bar and the outlet zones and modified the sedimentary balance within the prodelta in the early 2000s. There is indication that cycles of erosion and accretion were controlled by the magnitude of fluvial discharge and riverbed scouring in the river outlet, whereas effluent diffusion and sediment dispersion were dominant in the delta front. High freshwater discharge, as buoyancy inputs, promoted the transfer of sediments from the river channel to the outer prodelta through the upper layers of the water column. Total sediment accumulation in the delta corresponded to <5 of the annual mean SSL of the Magdalena River. Overall, delta morphology remained relatively stable, experiencing a slow progradational state with highest sedimentation rates (1430 mm y1) in the deepest zones.","This research was funded by the Research and Projects Office (DIDI) at Universidad del Norte.

1776,pub.1092908058,10.1115/es2016-59291,,,On-Line Early Fault Detection of a Centrifugal Chiller Based on Data Driven Approach,"A district cooling system (DCS) is a system that distributes thermal energy through chilled water from a central source to residential, commercial, or industrial consumers, designated to air conditioning purposes. It is one of the most important part of a heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration systems (HVAC), because a DCS is composed of: Cooling towers, central chiller plant, water distribution systems and clusters of consumer buildings. This research is focused on the central chiller plant, due to it accounts for a substantial portion of the total energy consume of DCS and HVAC systems. The performance of central chiller plant is often affected by multiple faults which could be caused during installation or developed in routine operation. These non-optimal conditions and faults may cause 20–30% waste of energy consumption of HVAC&R systems. Automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tools have potential to detect an incipient fault and help to reduce undesirable conditions and energy consumption, and optimize the facility maintenance. We propose an online data driven fault detection strategy for district cooling system. The main objective is to develop an automated fault detection tool based on historical process data, which can be applied in transient operation. The proposed hybrid strategy is based on unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, and multivariate statistic techniques. Its aim is to identify the operating states of the chiller and evaluate the fault occurrence depending of its current operating state. This strategy uses the K-means clustering method, Naive Bayes classifier and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The developed strategy was evaluated using the performance data of a 90-ton water-cooled centrifugal chiller (ASHRAE RP-1043) and also evaluated using a dynamic model of a chiller (Simscape™.) under similar conditions. The results show the advantages of novel early fault detection technique compared to Conventional PCA method in terms of sensitivity to faults occurrence and reduction of missed detection rate.Copyright © 2016 by ASME",,,,"Volume 1: Biofuels, Hydrogen, Syngas, and Alternate Fuels; CHP and Hybrid Power and Energy Systems; Concentrating Solar Power; Energy Storage; Environmental, Economic, and Policy Considerations of Advanced Energy Systems; Geothermal, Ocean, and Emerging Energy Technologies; Photovoltaics; Posters; Solar Chemistry; Sustainable Building Energy Systems; Sustainable Infrastructure and Transportation; Thermodynamic Analysis of Energy Systems; Wind Energy Systems and Technologies",,,2016-06-26,2016,2016-11-01,2016-06-26,,,v001t11a009-v001t11a009,Closed,Proceeding,"Durán, Cinthia Audivet; Sanjuán, Marco E.","Durán, Cinthia Audivet (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuán, Marco E.

The thermal model developed considers a heat transfer analysis in order to estimate the performance of a photovoltaic solar system due to local temperature variation. The heat transfer model analyzes the photovoltaic cell as a system exposed to radiation and natural convection by carrying out a first law energy balance which takes into account the radiation energy from the sun that hits the panel and the energy lost from the photovoltaic cell through natural convection and radiation. To determine the natural convection heat transfer coefficient, the Grashof number was employed along with Nusselt and Rayleigh number in a dimensionless form. The model has been implemented in the Matlab-Simulink platform that allows to establish a specific empirical correlation among the Nusselt number and Rayleigh for PV statics panels operating under natural convection condition. This experimental process consists in an iterative adjust of the theoretical equations of natural convection with experimental data gathered from a real PV module operation. The variables measured were the surface temperature, the environmental temperature and the solar irradiation provided by a pyranometer. It is found a good agreement between the radiation behavior and the predicted temperature. The higher values of the irradiation and environmental temperature coincides with predicted and observed PV surface temperatures and the thermal performance of the panel. The mean absolute error of the model was 3.09 K and the root mean square deviation 3.47 K.Copyright © 2016 by ASME",,,,Volume 8: Heat Transfer and Thermal Engineering,,,2016-11-11,2016,2017-02-08,2016-11-11,,,v008t10a057-v008t10a057,Closed,Proceeding,"Vega, Mario A.

The P. salmonis iron acquisition mechanisms and its molecular regulation are unknown. Iron is an essential element for bacterial pathogenesis. Typically, genes that encode for the iron acquisition machinery are regulated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein. P. salmonis fur sequence database reveals a diversity of fur genes without functional verification. Due to the fastidious nature of this bacterium, we evaluated the functionality of P. salmonis fur in the Salmonella Δfur heterologous system. Although P. salmonis fur gene strongly differed from the common Fur sequences, it restored the regulatory mechanisms of iron acquisition in Salmonella. We concluded that P. salmonis LF-89 has a conserved functional Fur protein, which reinforces the importance of iron during fish infection.

The last population census revealed that 70.5 % of foreigners in Chile came from South America, and were mainly Peruvians (30.5 %), Argentines (16.8 %), and Colombians (8.1 %). The aim of this cross-sectional study is to describe the social well-being levels reported by Colombian and Peruvian immigrants in northern Chile, as well as their connection to socio-demographic and relational factors. The Spanish version of the Scale of Social Well-being (Keyes in Soc Psychol Q 61:121–140, 1998) was administered to 431 men and women over 18 years old, with a minimum residence of 6 months in the city of Antofagasta. The highest-rated aspect was Social Contribution, and the lowest-rated aspect was Social Acceptance. The relational variables that show statistically significant differences in both populations relate to who the subject lives with, the degree of contact that the subject has with people from Chile, and the subject’s relationship status. There are no differences that indicate a higher level of social well-being in one population more than the other; however, it appears that the Peruvian population has a greater perception of Social Coherence, while Colombians show a greater perception of Social Contribution.","This research is part of the FONDECYT Project #1140843, funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of the Government of Chile—CONICYT and by Convenio de Desempeño UTA-MINEDUC.",,Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health,,,Acculturation; Adult; Chile; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Peru; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors,2016-04-02,2016,2016-04-02,2017-10,19,5,1140-1147,Closed,Article,"Urzúa Morales, Alfonso; Delgado-Valencia, Eric; Rojas-Ballesteros, Mariela; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra","Urzúa Morales, Alfonso (Línea de Investigación en Salud, Bienestar y Calidad de Vida, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

Recent molecular work suggests that neotropical Dacryodes are monophyletic but the genus is paraphyletic; far more robust sampling is needed for resolution of generic limits and circumscriptions as well as for understanding patterns of distribution and ecology.","We thank the herbarium of the Instituto Amazónico de Investigaciones Científicas SINCHI (COAH), notably Nicolás Castaño, and the Herbario Nacional Colombiano (COL), notably Lauren Raz, for greatly facilitating our access to those collections.

Most addressed themes, domestic politics and the citizens’ affairs, were analyzed herein to describe emotions from a qualitative perspective. Findings showed that the internal armed conflict was the main driving force to express the individual’s emotions and judgments. Significant events triggering a wide range of emotions were identified. Two units of meaning emerged: patriotism under siege, to account for people’s love for the nation regardless of their affliction; and fear, the predominant emotion, to explain public distress caused by this intractable conflict. Being aware of the public’s emotional condition questions whether it is worth considering the paradigm of objectivity as an ethical ideal in the journalistic field. It also encourages reporting conflicts through the perspective of peace journalism, emphasizing possible solutions.

1678,pub.1155722360,10.12753/2066-026x-16-197,,,IMPROVING ARGUMENTATIVE SKILLS FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS IN TWO DIFFERENT COLOMBIAN REGIONS.,"The paper presents the most important results from a study in argumentative communication skills, developed in three engineering undergraduate programs from year 2012 until 2014. The work was performed by a multidisciplinary group in two Colombian regions.

During year 2012, professors noted that senior students had problems in both oral and written communication. Therefore, engineering professors decided to join expert faculty in communication skills and to design a long-term project to help students. The project was meant to improve these skills, and it included four phases. Phase one diagnosed basic communication skills. Phase two employed an academic intervention. Phase three developed a new diagnosis in argumentative writing skills. Finally, phase four developed a different intervention for argumentation.

The first two phases included students from the first cohort as the reference group and students from a different cohort as the experimental group. The research evaluated data by means of one rubric and one student opinion survey. Both tools were validated by experts. Results show performance improvement in the second cohort after the intervention. The outcome agrees with related work reported in the literature.

During phase three, professors performed a diagnosis through the curriculum, specifically in argumentation. The study encompasses students enrolled in different courses and semesters from Electrical, Electronics and Systems Engineering at Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla, Colombia), and a course from Electrical Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Colombia (Medell?n Campus). Results show students achievement in argumentation, which was used to design a pedagogical intervention to improve student performance. Phase 4 assessed the same skill in the new cohort, executed the intervention and finally evaluated the results. 

The academic intervention was carefully planned in every phase. During the intervention, the group used multimedia tools as video and Academic Blackboard in order to make a homogeneous strategy in all engineering programs in different places in the country. Additionally, the professors employed a Google Docs form in order to speed up evaluation process.  

The students wrote argumentative essays before and after the intervention, employing the ""Five Paragraph Essay"" technique.  Statistical analysis shows improvement; therefore, we can conclude that it was possible to enhance argumentation skills of the students.",,,eLearning and Software for Education,12th International Conference eLearning and Software for Education,,,2016-04-22,2016,2016-04-22,2016-04-22,3,,138-141,Closed,Proceeding,"Calle, Maria; Soto, Jose; Torres, Luis; Garcia, Lucy; De castro, Adela; Candelo, John; Gonzalez, Ricardo; Schettini, Norelli","Calle, Maria (); Soto, Jose (); Torres, Luis (); Garcia, Lucy (); De castro, Adela (); Candelo, John (); Gonzalez, Ricardo (); Schettini, Norelli ()",,"Calle, Maria (); Soto, Jose (); Torres, Luis (); Garcia, Lucy (); De castro, Adela (); Candelo, John (); Gonzalez, Ricardo (); Schettini, Norelli ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155722360,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,4 Quality Education

The activation of the Rel/NF-κB signaling pathway depends largely in the degradation of IκB proteins and thus, IκBs are a main target for the identification of genes whose expression is controlled by Rel/NF-κB pathway. In order to identify such regulation in bivalve mollusks, the cDNA sequence encoding an IκB protein was characterized in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, ApIκB. The cDNA sequence of ApIκB is comprised of 1480 nucleotides with a 1086 bp open reading frame encoding for 362 amino acids. Bioinformatics analysis showed that ApIκB displays the conserved features of IκB proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of a 39.7 kDa protein, which has an N-terminal degradation motif, six ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal phosphorylation site motif. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high degree of identity between ApIκB and other IκBs from mollusks, but also to arthropod cactus proteins and vertebrate IκBs. Tissue expression analysis indicated that ApIκB is expressed in all examined tissues and it is upregulated in circulating hemocytes from scallops challenged with the pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio splendidus. After inhibiting ApIκB gene expression using the RNA interference technology, the gene expression of the antimicrobial peptide big defensin was upregulated in hemocytes from non-challenged scallops. Results suggest that ApIκB may control the expression of antimicrobial effectors such as big defensin via a putative Rel/NF-κB signaling pathway. This first evidence will help to deepen the knowledge of the Rel/NF-κB conserved pathway in scallops.","AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge William Farías for technical assistance, Germán Lira from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance, and Rodrigo Rojas for bacteria procurement.

Various natural and artificial systems offer conditions under which SGE can be harnessed amongst which river mouths play the prominent role in a global assessment. The theoretical SGE potential at river mouths has been previously estimated to be 15,102TWh/a, equivalent to 74% of the worldwide electricity consumption; however, practical extractable SGE from these systems depends on several physical and environmental constraints that are discussed here. The suitability, sustainability and reliability of the exploitation of this renewable energy are considered based on quantified descriptors. It is shown that practically 625TWh/a of SGE are globally extractable from river mouths, equivalent to 3% of global electricity consumption. Although this is much smaller than the theoretical potential, is still a significant amount of clean energy.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors want to thank COLCIENCIAS (Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia) (Grant number: 567-2013), CEMarin – Center of Excellence in Marine Sciences, Enlazamundos programme (Alcaldía de Medellín), Kellner &amp; Stoll – Foundation for Climate and Environment, and MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences for the funding of this research.

Performance of these systems is highly dependent on several important parameters, which influence not only the long-term efficiency but also its technical and economic feasibility. This paper studies the operation/configuration problem of an ammonia–water power and cooling cycle using an exergetic and statistical analysis. The Modeling developed in Matlab® and REFPROP 9.0 was used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the ammonia–water mixture. The thermodynamic model and properties of the ammonia/water mixture were validated with previous models found in the literature. Optimal operating conditions of the combined cycle were obtained by using response surface technique and the ratio between exergetic efficiency and exergy destruction was used as response variable. The results showed that the response variable is highly influenced by the ammonia concentration, pressure ratio (PR), turbine efficiency, and pinch point temperature in the heat exchanger. Finally, the combined cycle was integrated with a solar field using two types of concentrated solar collectors.",,,Journal of Energy Resources Technology,,,,2016-07-12,2016,2016-07-12,2017-03-01,139,2,022001,Closed,Article,"García, Jesús M.; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Sanjuan, Marco E.","García, Jesús M.

Using surveys of journalists in Colombia and Mexico, we identify two dimensions of perceived autonomy: first, control over story development tasks (the traditional understanding of autonomy in empirical studies); second, the ability to actually publish news on a range of subjects associated with different levels of material or cultural power. We then identify predictors of both dimensions of autonomy. Physical threats, overlapping forms of inequality, and clientelism characterize pressures on autonomy in these two democracies. Journalists can carve out more space for autonomy by gaining professional experience or by creating new organizational arrangements and supporting analytical, change-oriented norms. By examining professional autonomy empirically in a broad range of contexts, we demonstrate that autonomy is more complex, situational, and historically contingent than previously believed.","The authors are grateful for the suggestions of Jeannine Relly and Silvio Waisbord, which greatly improved an earlier version of our manuscript.

The main idea behind this approach is to explore sub-domains of the solution space making use of different metaheuristics. This is developed in three basic steps: a main computing node sends an initial condition to his workers. The workers make use of tabu search and simulated annealing algorithms and submit its optimal solution to the master node; then, the master selects the best solution among all the workers and returns them the best solution as new initial condition. The novelty of this framework is that the relevance of the solution is not in the number of iterations but in the increment of the solution space by increasing the number of instances. Experimental settings are carried out making use of 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 processors (workers) in the Blueridge super computer at Virginia Tech, USA. Instances of the TSP-LIB (Traveling Salesman problem) were chosen in order to perform the tests.

Additional challenges are related to the changes that the presence of DER cause on typical radial characteristics of distribution networks, which were not considered in the formulation of fault location methods. This paper presents a proposal for fault location for power distribution networks in presence of Inverter-Interfaced DER when these working in limiting current. The proposal uses a fault model of the inverter to consider its impact on the fault location. Thus, is assumed that the inverter always operates in limiting current mode when a fault event occurs. It allows estimate its current contribution to the fault point. A case study in the IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder is performed. This system is modeled on ATP/EMTP and modified with the insertion of an Inverter-Interfaced DER. The method is validated by consideration of two scenarios. Scenario 1 - DER penetration level effect and scenario 2 - Fault resistance on the proposed method effect.

Erosions occurring preferentially in feet and joint space narrowing (JSN) in wrists have been described in early RA. Little is known of radiographic progression in Latin American patients with early RA. To describe radiographic changes in a Latin American (LA) early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) multinational inception cohort at baseline, a multicenter observational study. Patients were enrolled in GLADAR (Grupo Latino Americano de estudio De Artritis Reumatoide), the largest longitudinal cohort of early RA (<1 year from onset) in LA, from 2004/2005–2008. Demographic and clinical data were obtained and sets of hand/wrist and foot radiographs were scored using the modified Sharp/ Van der Heijde scoring system. A total of 507 patients with radiographic readings were evaluated. The mean radiographic score was 23.37 at baseline visit; 56.2% had erosions and 97.8% joint space narrowing (JSN). Among patients with JSN, the mean score was 20.97. JSN occurred in hands/wrists (97%) and feet (72%), while erosions were observed in hands/wrists (42.8%) and feet (28.8%). X-rays of 253 patients were assessed after at one-year of follow-up; of 132 without erosions, 14.4% developed erosions; and 100% JSN. No significant differences were observed among patients who progressed according to socio-demographic features, use of DMARDS, use of prednisone and rheumatoid factor positivity. This is the largest radiographic study of Latin American RA patients. Damage occurs early in the disease. Surprisingly, JSN is the most common radiographic change and occurs more often in hands/wrist. Further studies are needed to understand the meaning of the greater breakdown in cartilage compared to erosions in this population. Loreto Massardo, Bernardo A. Pons-Estel, Daniel Wojdyla, Mario H.

Formulator must evaluate a series of parameters related to the emulsion properties and its application. Among these mainly parameters, one must consider the emulsion stability, viscosity (and rheological behavior), droplet size (and distribution) and other variables related to raw materials such as asphalt chemical composition, available surfactants, chemical reagents, etc. Other special considerations must also be taken into account, for example, the handling of the bitumen emulsion and the breaking process. Currently, the use of chemical additives such as asphalt or emulsion modifiers and adhesion promoters can play a significant role in the emulsion formulation. The current study aims to review the current state-of-the-art of asphalt emulsion manufacturing and also aims to provide a practical guide to improve its formulation when trying to fabricate a well-specified asphalt emulsion for its use on road infrastructure.","AcknowledgementsThe authors express their gratitude to the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, to the “Es Tiempo de Volver” program fellowship (656) of COLCIENCIAS, and the research project Diamante Caribe (BPIN: 2014000100012, Contract No 25, May 30, 2014) for the financial support.",,Construction and Building Materials,,,,2016-10,2016,,2016-10,123,,162-173,Closed,Article,"Ronald, Mercado; Luis, Fuentes Pumarejo","Ronald, Mercado (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Luis, Fuentes Pumarejo (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Ronald, Mercado (Universidad del Norte)","Ronald, Mercado (Universidad del Norte); Luis, Fuentes Pumarejo (Universidad del Norte)",77,16,,16.31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046353890,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering,

Taking into account the natural complexity of the process and the large amount of variables involved, this problem is considered as NP-hard in strong sense. Therefore, it is possible to find an optimal solution in a reasonable computational time only for small instances, which in general, does not reflect the industrial reality. For that reason, it is proposed the use of metaheuristics as an alternative approach in this problem with the aim to determine, with a low computational effort, the best assignation of the analysis in order to minimize the makespan and weighted total tardiness simultaneously. These optimization objectives will allow this laboratory to improve their productivity and the customer service, respectively. A Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) is proposed. Computational experiments are carried out comparing the proposed approach versus exact methods. Results show the efficiency of our ACO algorithm.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Advances in Swarm Intelligence,"Ying Tan, Yuhui Shi, Ben Niu",,2016-06-15,2016,2016-06-15,2016,9712,,413-425,Closed,Chapter,"Atencio, Fabricio Niebles; Prasca, Alexander Bustacara; Rodado, Dionicio Neira; Casseres, Daniel Mendoza; Santiago, Miguel Rojas","Atencio, Fabricio Niebles (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 # 55–66, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Prasca, Alexander Bustacara (Programa de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad del Atlántico, Km 7 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Rodado, Dionicio Neira (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 # 55–66, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Casseres, Daniel Mendoza (Programa de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad del Atlántico, Km 7 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Santiago, Miguel Rojas (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua vía Puerto, Sincelejo, Colombia)","Atencio, Fabricio Niebles (University of the Coast)","Atencio, Fabricio Niebles (University of the Coast); Prasca, Alexander Bustacara (University of Atlántico); Rodado, Dionicio Neira (University of the Coast); Casseres, Daniel Mendoza (University of Atlántico); Santiago, Miguel Rojas (Universidad del Norte)",3,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015606097,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Despite the increasing production of tambaqui (annual growth of approximately 8%), no study has addressed the effects of farming on tambaqui's reproductive physiology and growth performance. As part of an institutional portfolio that aims to increase the production of tambaqui per area of cultivation, the present work details the tambaqui's gametogenesis and steroidogenesis during 10months of farming, until they reached the market size. Spermatogenesis is very precocious (750g fish) and apparently is a rapid and constant process in tambaqui testes, with major concentration of mature fish in August. On the other hand, oogenesis is a much longer process that starts only in fish at around 1200g and does not complete before harvesting (no mature female observed). The plasmatic concentration of sex steroids is very similar among immature male and female tambaqui. However, testosterone and estradiol rise in parallel with testis development while only the second rises with ovarian primary growth. Concentration of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone remains at basal levels during spermatogenesis of farmed tambaqui, but it slightly increases during oocyte primary growth. At harvest, the biometrical analysis reveals that female and male tambaqui yield different gutted weight in the order of 16% in favor of the former. Most probably due to the precocious gonad maturation that farmed males go through (5m old), females are heavier at harvest (12m old) and therefore stand out as the most profitable gender to be produced in the tambaqui farming industry.","AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge the financial support of the Brazilian Agency of Innovation (FINEP) and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) to the DARPA project (01.09.0472.00).

Although the systems have different contexts, design and operational characteristics, they have in common that over the last years their service quality has deteriorated, leading to negative users' perception and consequently decrease in patronage levels. Understanding these problematic factors is key for the mobility of these cities as they are both planning to expand their systems and consolidate multi-modal integrated transport systems in the upcoming years. Through a series of interviews with several stakeholders from institutions related to the mobility sector in each city our analysis identifies aspects of conceptual design, planning and implementation of institutional, operational, financial and management frameworks that might have been preventing the systems from achieving a better performance. Moreover, our analysis highlights two factors embedded at the core of the systems' difficulties: First, BRT technology transfer with limited understanding of context and little adaptation to local user's expectations and preferences; and second, design criteria that address financial requirements at the expense of quality of service for people's needs.",AcknowledgementsThis research was developed as part of two projects funded by the British Embassy-Prosperity fund programme. The authors would like to thank the persons in the British Embassy in Panama and Bogota/Barranquilla for the support in the coordination of the interviews and all the people that participated in the meetings for sharing their views and knowledge on the BRT systems and the mobility systems in the cities and to everyone else who supported our field work in the two cities.,,Research in Transportation Economics,,,,2016-11,2016,,2016-11,59,,204-217,Closed,Article,"Ortegon-Sanchez, Adriana; Tyler, Nick","Ortegon-Sanchez, Adriana (Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom); Tyler, Nick (Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom)","Ortegon-Sanchez, Adriana (University College London)","Ortegon-Sanchez, Adriana (University College London); Tyler, Nick (University College London)",5,2,,1.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029819073,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Se analizaron 319 mujeres seniles, provenientes del estudio «Salud osteomuscular del anciano». La determinación de fracturas vertebrales morfométricas se realizó de manera radiográfica, en tanto que los niveles de 25 OH vitamina D se midieron por inmunoanálisis por quimioluminiscencia (CLIA) Liaison® 25 OH vitamina D Total Assay Ref 310600, utilizando el equipo Diasorin Liaison® Analyzer. El índice de masa corporal se obtuvo, según las recomendaciones de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, como el peso en kilogramos sobre la talla en metros al cuadrado; la edad fue verificada con el documento de identidad y el ingreso del mismo a las bases de datos nacionales (SISPRO-FOSYGA).ResultadosEl promedio de edad fue de 74,3 años (DE ±7,2). La prevalencia global de fracturas fue de 17,9%; así mismo, el 54,9% de las participantes tenía valores entre 20 y 29ng/ml de 25 OH vitamina D y el 58,9% tenía valores de índice de masa corporal inferior a 25kg/m2. El promedio de 25 OH vitamina D fue inferior en las participantes fracturadas (19,7 vs. 25,1) (p<0,05); el índice de masa corporal también fue menor en las fracturadas (23,5 vs. 24,6) (p>0,05), pero la edad fue mayor: 78,9 vs. 73,4 (p<0,05). Al comparar los promedios de 25 OH vitamina D en participantes fracturadas y no fracturadas, se encontraron niveles significativamente menores de 25 OH vitamina D en las participantes con fractura mayores de 69 años, y al considerar el índice de masa corporal, los valores de 25 OH vitamina D fueron significativamente inferiores en cada una de las categorías de las participantes con fractura.ConclusiónSe encontró una relación estadísticamente significativa entre poseer fracturas vertebrales morfométricas y tener: 1) niveles bajos de 25 OH vitamina D, 2) mayor edad, y 3) menor índice de masa corporal.AbstractObjectiveTo determine the presence of morphometric vertebral fractures, as well as their relationship with 25 OH vitamin D, body mass index, and age in elderly women.Materials and methodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on 319 elderly women from the study ‘Musculoskeletal Health in the Elderly’.

To rationalize their properties, it is necessary to understand their atomic structure in crystalline and amorphous phases. We have investigated Ti–Si mixed oxide phases by density functional theory and molecular dynamics. A polarizable potential has been developed for  and has been employed to sample the configuration space. Mixed phases are metastable with respect to separate  and  , but they are only slightly higher in energy, and therefore might form under technologically relevant conditions. All Ti–Si mixed oxides considered, regardless of cation coordination, display peaks in IR and Raman spectra in the region of frequencies 880–950  , while Ti‐only phases do not, even if titanium is in a tetrahedral coordination. Our calculations thus confirm that these peaks are a signature of Ti–O–Si links, but they do not deliver information on the actual atomic structure of the material. Phases with titanium in a tetrahedral coordination display a higher electronic band gap than phases with titanium in octahedral coordination.

The present chapter depicts the evolution of convergence as a theoretical framework, from philosophical perspectives such as Simondon’s idea of genesis and McLuhan’s laws of media to the contemporary approaches such as Jenkin’s convergence culture. Instead of thinking of convergence as a contemporary characteristic of communication environment, or merely a technological objectuality, we propose to rethink it as a reloaded term used as a word rather than as an abstract concept in current literature.

Early recognition and treatment of comorbidities is important. We aimed to evaluate the presence of comorbidities in a Mexican mestizo cohort of patients with early-RA. A descriptive, cross-sectional study of patients with early-rheumatoid arthritis (disease duration <12 months) was designed. Information on comorbidities, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) was collected. Data of fifty patients was included in the final analysis, 46 (92.0%) of them were women. Patient's characteristics are shown in Table 1. Mean age was 44.3 ± 13.12 years. Mean disease duration was 6.09 ± 2.91 months. Tuberculosis (TB) infection was found in 12 (24.0%) patients, 7 (58.3%) of them were latent tuberculosis infection. Four cases of extra-pulmonary TB were reported. Hypertension was the second most prevalent comorbidity, being reported in 11 (22.0%) patients. In this cohort of Mexican mestizo patients with early-RA, TB infection was found in 24.0% of the patients. Hypertension was the second most prevalent comorbidity in our cohort, being reported in 22.0% of the patients. Other cardiovascular heart disease risk factors were also reported. Early recognition of these comorbidities is needed because of the higher risk of cardiovascular heart disease in RA-patients in comparison to the general population. Emery, P., Breedveld, F.

                    The purpose of this paper is to test the existence of true persistence in the generation and adoption of product innovations in the context of a developing country.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    A dynamic probit model with random effects is used to test true persistence relying on a panel data set constructed from three waves of the Colombian innovation survey (Encuesta de Desarrollo e Innvovación Tecnológica) covering the time span from 2003 to 2008.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    This paper empirically shows the existence of true innovation persistence for two of the three types of product innovation studied: the adoption of product innovation that is new to the firm; and the adoption of product innovation that is new to the national market. However, the study could not confirm true persistence in the generation of product innovation.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that systematically tests innovation persistence differentiating between the adoption of innovations that are new to the firm and innovation that is new to the national market.

This elasmobranch assemblage provides a unique glimpse into the Caribbean biodiversity at the onset of the Neogene. The assemblage consists of 13 taxa, of which some are reported from Miocene deposits for the very first time. There are also new records of taxa the in southern Caribbean region. The taxonomic composition of the selachian assemblage was used to conduct a paleoenvironmental and paleobathymetric analysis of the lower Uitpa Formation. The maximum likelihood estimation of paleobathymetry suggests that the lower part of the Uitpa Formation was probably accumulated at a water depth of 100 to 200 m. This indicates a rapid increase in relative sea level or basin deepening, providing new insights into the possible causes of marine biota changes in the Cocinetas Basin during the Oligocene/Miocene transition.","This project has been supported by a SENACYT APY-NI10-016A grant (National Secretary of Science and Technology of Panama) and a Swiss National Science Foundation grant 31003A-149605 (to Marcelo Snchez-Villagra).

The questionnaires were applied to 853 Colombian and Peruvian immigrants living in Northern Chilean cities of Arica, Antofagasta and Santiago de Chile.ResultsIn the psychological and social domains, as well as in the overall assessment of QoL, the most beneficial strategies are those where customs are maintained from the homeland, where “integration” then “separation” are the most beneficial. On the contrary, when the strategy for maintaining homeland customs is low, the QoL tends to be lower. The strategy of “marginalized” is associated with a lower QoL.ConclusionsAcculturation strategies mildly or moderately affect the psychological and social domains of quality of life as well as the overall assessment of QoL.","This research was funded by the National Commission on Science and Technology, Government of Chile—CONICYT, through FONDECYT 1140843 project, which had no influence on the study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation of data or preparation, review or approval of this manuscript.",,Quality of Life Research,,,"Acculturation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Chile; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires",2016-12-09,2016,2016-12-09,2017-03,26,3,717-726,Closed,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Ferrer, Rodrigo; Canales Gaete, Valentina; Núñez Aragón, Dominique; Ravanal Labraña, Ivanna; Tabilo Poblete, Bárbara","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

For example, modifying the hydrodynamics of a natural watercourse can result in the suspension and transport of Hg deposits in the water column, which represents an exposure risk for biota. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of seasonality on the dispersion of total Hg in the Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP)-Samuel Reservoir (Porto Velho/Brazil). Sampling campaigns were performed during the three following hydrological periods characteristic of the region: low (Oct/2011), ebbing (May/2012), and high (Feb/2013) water. Sediment profiles, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and aquatic macrophytes (Eicchornia crassipes and Oryza spp.) were collected, and their Hg concentrations and isotopic and elemental C and N signatures were determined. The drainage basin significantly influenced the SPM compositions during all the periods, with a small autochthonous influence from the reservoir during the low water. The highest SPM Hg concentrations inside the reservoir were observed during the high water period, suggesting that the hydrodynamics of this environment favor the suspension of fine SPM, which has a higher Hg adsorption capacity. The Hg concentrations in the sediment profiles were ten times lower than those in the SPM, indicating that large particles with low Hg concentrations were deposited to form the bottom sediment. Hg concentrations were higher in aquatic macrophyte roots than in their leaves and appeared to contribute to the formation of SPM during the low water period. In this environment, Hg transport mainly occurs in SPM from the Jamari River drainage basin, which is the primary source of Hg in this environment.","The authors thank the Wolfgang C.

1419,pub.1006633535,10.1016/j.renene.2016.04.070,,,A biomimetic approach for modeling cloud shading with dynamic behavior,"Clouds are a complex phenomenon which is the result of a strong interaction between multiple variables. Modeling its behavior through physical principles is a task that requires time and is computationally demanding. One of the main effects caused by clouds are the shadows produced over the earth's surface, a phenomenon inherently complex due its origin. This paper proposes a computationally low-demanding model for imitating (not predicting) the behavior of cloud shading by applying a biomimetic approach. This analogy relays on using a bacterial colony growth behavior. The aim of this paper is to establish a methodology to develop a cloud-shading model useful for transient analysis in solar fields. The proposed model is evaluated qualitative and quantitative by comparing it with a model based on fractal surfaces and with real sky images. The qualitative evaluation indicates that shadows created by the proposed model change its shapes and move as seen in the real phenomenon. On the other hand, the quantitative assessment is accomplished through the Fast Fourier Transform analysis. This analysis indicates that the proposed model is able to achieve the performance shown by real cloud images.",,,Renewable Energy,,,,2016-10,2016,,2016-10,96,,157-166,Closed,Article,"García, Jesús M.; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Sanjuan, Marco E.","García, Jesús M.

The current study replicated and expanded on this research by examining the moderating influences of gender of the same-sex peer group, same-sex peer group norms, and classroom gender composition in a sample of early adolescents from Barranquilla, Colombia. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that both relational and physical aggression were positive predictors of peer victimization. Relationally aggressive girls were at a lower risk for victimization while physically aggressive girls were at a higher risk. Relational aggression was a weaker predictor in classes with a larger proportion of girls. Additionally, relational aggression was a weaker predictor in same-sex peer groups with a greater prevalence of relational aggression. These findings provide further evidence of multiple forms of contextual influence on social behavior.

Current approaches for activity detection still struggle to handle large-scale video collections and the task remains relatively unexplored. This is in part due to the computational complexity of current action recognition approaches and the lack of a method that proposes fewer intervals in the video, where activity processing can be focused. In this paper, we introduce a proposal method that aims to recover temporal segments containing actions in untrimmed videos. Building on techniques for learning sparse dictionaries, we introduce a learning framework to represent and retrieve activity proposals. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method in not only producing high quality proposals but also in its efficiency. Finally, we show the positive impact our method has on recognition performance when it is used for action detection, while running at 10FPS.",,,2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),,,2016-12-09,2016,2016-12-09,,,,1914-1923,Closed,Proceeding,"Heilbron, Fabian Caba; Niebles, Juan Carlos; Ghanem, Bernard","Heilbron, Fabian Caba (King Abdullah Univ. of Sci. &amp; Technol., Thuwal, Saudi Arabia); Niebles, Juan Carlos (Dept. of Comput.

The tool has been developed for professionals involved in the study of sediment transport along coastal margins, estuaries, rivers and desert dunes. The algorithm uses several types of statistical analyses to obtain the main textural characteristics of the sediment sample (D50, mean, sorting, skewness and kurtosis). SANDY© includes the method of moments (geometric, arithmetic and logarithmic approaches) and graphical methods (geometric, arithmetic and mixed approaches). In addition, it provides graphs of the sediment size distribution and its classification. The computational tool automatically exports all the graphs as enhanced metafile images and the final report is also exported as a plain text file. Parameters related to bed roughness such as Nikuradse and roughness length are also computed. Theoretical depositional environments are established by a discriminant function analysis. Using the uniformity coefficient the hydraulic conductivity of the sand as well as the porosity and void ratio of the sediment sample are obtained. The maximum relative density related to sand compaction is also computed. The Matlab® routine can compute one or several samples. SANDY© is a useful tool for estimating the sediment textural parameters which are the basis for studies of sediment transport.","Our sincere thanks to the reviewers for their comments and suggestions, which enriched and helped to improve this manuscript and thanks to Gemma Franklin for reviewing the English grammar and her comments about it.",,Computers & Geosciences,,,,2016-07,2016,,2016-07,92,,104-116,Closed,Article,"Ruiz-Martínez, Gabriel; Rivillas-Ospina, Germán Daniel; Mariño-Tapia, Ismael; Posada-Vanegas, Gregorio","Ruiz-Martínez, Gabriel (Departamento de Recursos del Mar, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Mérida 97310, Yucatán, México); Rivillas-Ospina, Germán Daniel (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Instituto de Estudios Hidráulicos y Ambientales (IDEHA), Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 1569, Colombia); Mariño-Tapia, Ismael (Departamento de Recursos del Mar, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Mérida 97310, Yucatán, México); Posada-Vanegas, Gregorio (Laboratorio de Procesos Costeros, Instituto de Ecología, Pesquerías y Oceanografía del Golfo de México, Campeche 24029, México)","Ruiz-Martínez, Gabriel (Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute)","Ruiz-Martínez, Gabriel (Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute); Rivillas-Ospina, Germán Daniel (Universidad del Norte); Mariño-Tapia, Ismael (Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute); Posada-Vanegas, Gregorio (Instituto de Ecología)",8,2,,0.94,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048990627,37 Earth Sciences; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,

1362,pub.1043641418,10.1002/jqs.2899,,,Mid‐elevation ecosystems of Panama: future uncertainties in light of past global climatic variability,"ABSTRACT   Modern changes in regional climates will result in high ecosystem turnover and substantial biodiversity rearrangements. Understanding these changes requires palaeoecological studies at temporal resolutions comparable to the time window at which modern climate change is occurring. Here we present a multi‐proxy, high‐resolution record of forest and lake ecosystem change that occurred during the last 1100 years at middle elevations in Panama. From ∼900 to 1400 CE, regional forest and lake ecosystems were characterized by high seasonality, probably associated with both high El Niño activity and higher global temperatures. At ∼1400 CE, an abrupt transition marked the decoupling of forest and lake responses, with forest responding mostly to local patterns of human occupation, and lake trophic status being controlled mostly by the regional precipitation–evaporation balance, possibly associated with solar irradiance. Factors that played important roles in shaping regional ecosystems during the last 1100 years will probably again play critical roles within the coming decades, i.e. higher precipitation seasonality and higher temperatures. Past responses of the system, together with pervasive human activities, suggest that future conditions will simplify mid‐elevation forests. Given the importance of these geographical locations as hotspots of biological diversity, substantial losses of global biodiversity are foreseen.","We thank the community of San Carlos for granting us access to the lake.

1362,pub.1017421297,10.1007/s00170-016-9348-z,,,Development of a design methodology for reconfigurable injection molds,"Reconfigurable machines are used in various manufacturing processes increasingly, so that the system could be adapted to successive market changes, changes in customer requirements, and competition among manufacturers. This makes necessary designing reconfigurable machines that can get into the market as soon as possible. Injection molding machines are an example of an equipment that requires reconfigurability, and the mold is one of the machine modules requiring further attention. This article provides a design methodology that helps designers to decide which mold configuration is appropriate to produce a molded part family. Proposed methodology brings together classical methodologies and design modern tools, and establishes a sequence of activities during the product architecture. This adjustment provides a useful tool in the conceptual definition of the mold architecture and facilitates the preliminary design of molds. Decisions are based on nature and predominant features of conventional products which are manufactured by injection molding. A characterization of common products obtained by molding is proposed as a support database for developing the methodology. In addition, in this work, a case study is developed in order to illustrate how the methodology can be performed. Benefits and advantages of the model are summarized as well.",,,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2016-08-27,2016,2016-08-27,2017-04,90,1-4,153-166,Closed,Article,"Pugliese, Victor; Mesa, Jaime; Maury, Heriberto","Pugliese, Victor (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Mesa, Jaime (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Antigua Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Pugliese, Victor (Universidad del Norte)","Pugliese, Victor (Universidad del Norte); Mesa, Jaime (Universidad del Norte); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte)",6,1,,1.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017421297,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

This paper addresses this gap by relating two country-level sources of urban primacy (the international economic dependence of Latin American countries and the rural bias of the political process), with three particularities of the Latin American spatial markets (lack of land taxes and exactions, informal mechanisms of access to land, and lobby-oriented oligopolistic formal developers). We develop graphic analytical frameworks where we can hypothesize the interactions between all these elements. In order to enhance the theoretical framework and contrast it with existing evidence, three emerging policies in the continent were added to the analysis: land taxation and exactions, tenure legalization, and global city development. By using the theoretical framework, we conclude that the combined effects of these emerging policies will determine primacy patterns similar to the ones currently prevailing.","The author thanks valuable comments by Colin Lizieri and Aiora Zabala while at the University of Cambridge, and the two anonymous referees of the journal.

Crocodilians from the early to early middle Miocene Jimol and Castilletes formations include gavialoids, recovered from both coastal and shallow marine deposits, and caimanines representing early records of the specialized caimanine taxa Purussaurus and Mourasuchus. Crocodyloid specimens from the Pliocene Ware Formation are assigned to Crocodylus and represent one of the oldest occurrences of the genus in the New World. Records from the La Guajira Peninsula suggest that diverse crocodilian assemblages were already established by the late early Miocene, including several widely distributed lineages that persisted for several million years. Crocodylus is a recent immigrant to South America that occupied habitats left vacant by the extinction of several crocodilian lineages. Citation for this article: Moreno-Bernal, J. W., J.

This SLVC is the substation counterpart of a hierarchical two-level voltage controller being developed at Southern California Edison (SCE) Inc. The controller is based on a linearized local reactive power flow approach for estimating the effects of any switching action within a substation on the corresponding voltage changes at the substation buses. Switching actions include tap changes at different sets of transformer banks, and switching in/out the shunt reactive devices (capacitors and reactors) at the substation. The formulation is tested on a power-flow model of a representative substation in the SCE network through simulations, and the local power-flow results are compared to the large-scale full power flow solutions. Different normal and contingency operation conditions as well as various combinations of switching actions are considered, and it is shown that the proposed formulation can estimate the voltage changes within the local network with acceptably small errors.",,,,2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS),,,2016-01-01,2016,,2016-01-01,,,2508-2517,Closed,Proceeding,"Amelian, Sayed Mohammad; Mani, Venkatasubramanian Vaithianathan; Guerreo, Javier; Badayos, Noah; Habibi-Ashrafi, Farrokh; Abu-Jaradeh, Backer; Salazar, Armando","Amelian, Sayed Mohammad (School of EECS, Washington State University, Pullman, WA); Mani, Venkatasubramanian Vaithianathan (School of EECS, Washington State University, Pullman, WA); Guerreo, Javier (Universidad del Norte Barranquilla, Colombia); Badayos, Noah (Southern California Edison, Los Angeels, CA); Habibi-Ashrafi, Farrokh (Southern California Edison, Los Angeels, CA); Abu-Jaradeh, Backer (Southern California Edison, Los Angeels, CA); Salazar, Armando (Southern California Edison, Los Angeels, CA)",,"Amelian, Sayed Mohammad (Washington State University); Mani, Venkatasubramanian Vaithianathan (Washington State University); Guerreo, Javier (Universidad del Norte); Badayos, Noah (Edison International (United States)); Habibi-Ashrafi, Farrokh (Edison International (United States)); Abu-Jaradeh, Backer (Edison International (United States)); Salazar, Armando (Edison International (United States))",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095382898,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,
1331,pub.1013578819,10.1016/j.conengprac.2016.02.010,,,An improved weighted recursive PCA algorithm for adaptive fault detection,"A novel weighted adaptive recursive fault detection technique based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to address the issue of the increment in false alarm rate in process monitoring schemes due to the natural, slow and normal process changes (aging), which often occurs in real processes. It has been named as weighted adaptive recursive PCA (WARP).The aforementioned problem is addressed recursively by updating the eigenstructure (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of the statistical detection model when the false alarm rate increases given the awareness of non-faulty condition. The update is carried out by incorporating the new available information within a specific online process dataset, instead of keeping a fixed statistical model such as conventional PCA does. To achieve this recursive updating, equations for means, standard deviations, covariance matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are developed. The statistical thresholds and the number of principal components are updated as well.A comparison between the proposed algorithm and other recursive PCA-based algorithms is carried out in terms of false alarm rate, misdetection rate, detection delay and its computational complexity. WARP features a significant reduction of the computational complexity while maintaining a similar performance on false alarm rate, misdetection rate and detection delay compared to that of the other existing PCA-based recursive algorithms. The computational complexity is assessed in terms of the Floating Operation Points (FLOPs) needed to carry out the update.",,,Control Engineering Practice,,,,2016-05,2016,,2016-05,50,,69-83,Closed,Article,"Portnoy, Ivan; Melendez, Kevin; Pinzon, Horacio; Sanjuan, Marco","Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Melendez, Kevin (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pinzon, Horacio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte)","Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte); Melendez, Kevin (Universidad del Norte); Pinzon, Horacio (Universidad del Norte); Sanjuan, Marco (Universidad del Norte)",85,18,,18.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013578819,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",

Agmatinases (AGMs) are enzymes capable of converting agmatine to the polyamine putrescine and urea. AGMs belong to the family of Mn2+-dependent ureahydrolases. However, no AGM from a mammalian source has yet been extracted in catalytically active form. While in human AGM the six amino acid ligands that coordinate the two Mn2+ ions in the active site are conserved, four mutations are observed in the murine enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that similar to its human counterpart murine AGM does not appear to have in vitro catalytic activity, independent of the presence of Mn2+. However, in presence of agmatine both enzymes are very efficient in promoting cell growth of a yeast strain that is deficient in polyamine biosynthesis (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain TRY104Δspe1). Furthermore, mutations among the putative Mn2+ binding residues had no effect on the ability of murine AGM to promote growth of the yeast culture. It thus appears that mammalian AGMs form a distinct group within the family of ureahydrolases that (i) either fold in a manner distinct from other members in this family, or (ii) require accessory proteins to bind Mn2+ in a mechanism related to that observed for the Ni2+-dependent urease.",This research was supported by a grant from VRID-Enlace (no. 251.037.019-1.0).

Shortly after its creation, the city became an important base for trade with Spain. In 1671, the English pirate Henry Morgan waged an attack on Panamá Viejo, which resulted in a fire that destroyed the entire city. A new settlement built a few miles west, called Casco Antiguo or San Felipe, is now the historic district of modern Panama City. The Pb isotopic compositions of the glazes on the surface of sixteenth to seventeenth century majolica pottery sherds from Panama Viejo and Casco Antiguo (both in Panama), and Lima (Peru) were determined via non-destructive laser ablation multi-collector ICP-MS (LA-MC-ICP-MS). The contrast in Pb isotopic compositions in the glazes on ceramics recovered in different locations demonstrate that early majolica pottery production during this period used Pb obtained from the Andes. However, the Pb used in later majolica production in Panama is of Spanish origin. After Panamá Viejo was burned to the ground, Panamanian majolica production ended.","This work was supported in part by the Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowships program, endorsed by the European Commission (“ARCHSYMB”, PIOF-GA-2008-223319) and IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science.

In RA, a good correlation between both diagnostic methods has been demonstrated, being CU more sensitive for detecting subclinical atherosclerosis. Our aim is to determine the association between the presence of carotid plaque and CAC quantification, and, using the presence of carotid plaque as a reference, to determine the cut-off value of CAC score that better predicts subclinical carotid atherosclerosis. We evaluated 127 RA patients without previous cardiovascular events. Carotid ultrasonography was performed by a MyLab 70 scanner (Esaote; Genoa, Italy), equipped with 7–12 MHz linear transducer and the automated software guided technique radiofrequency – Quality Intima Media Thickness in real-time (QIMT, Esaote, Maastricht, Holland). Carotid plaque was defined according to the Manheim Conference Consensus criteria. To determine CAC score, a CT Imaging of coronary arteries using a 32-slice MDCT scanner (Lightspeed, Pro 32, GE Healthcare, USA) was performed. A CAC score ≥100 was considered as a surrogate marker of very high cardiovascular risk. Unilateral and bilateral carotid plaque frequency and the mean CAC score in the different groups are summarized in table 1. Patients without carotid plaques had a mean CAC value of 23 ±49 [range 0–250], being 50 ±116 [0–569] in patients with unilateral plaque and 192± 302 [0–1205] in patients with bilateral plaques, being these differences statistically significant (p<0.001). Using a CAC score ≥100 as a marker of very high cardiovascular risk, the sensitivity to detect carotid plaques was very low (28%). A ROC curve comparing the presence of carotid plaque and CAC quantification was performed, being the area under the curve 0.692. When we used CAC score value score ≥1 as the cut-off value to predict high cardiovascular risk, the sensitivity and specificity for the presence of carotid plaques increased (69.3% and 64.1%, respectively). Positive predictive value for CAC ≥1 was 81.3% in our population, being 48.1% the negative predictive value. Regarding bilateral carotid plaques, the CAC score ≥100 had a sensitivity of 40%. ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.712. Using a CAC score value score ≥1 as the cut-off value to predict high cardiovascular risk, the sensitivity to determine the presence of carotid plaques increased to 76.4% but the specificity decreased to 54.2%. A CAC score value score ≥1 is good predictors of carotid plaques, showing sensitivity close to 70%. Our data support the use of a CAC score value score ≥1 instead of a CAC score ≥100 as the cut-off value to predict high cardiovascular risk in patients with RA.

Chile during that time was the third largest scallop producer worldwide. During the time as one of the leading scallop aquaculture producers, research flourished as well as various engineering aspects to aid this growing industry. Re-circulating aquaculture as well genetic research started targeting the main Chilean scallop species, Argopecten purpuratus, the northern scallop. Also, environmental studies pointing towards comparisons between natural versus cultured populations were performed, management of natural beds became attractive, as well as comparative studies of the presence and intensity of biofouling and potential harmful parasites and/or bacteria. Research has done little with regard to diversification of products, and scallops were mainly sold fresh or quick frozen. This boom lasted only close to two decades, and in the last years the production dropped steadily, with Chile being replaced by Perú, who produces the same species. The scallop aquaculture industry has diminished from a peak of over 26,000mt production of A. purpuratus, to barely reaching 5000mt now. The other exploited two scallop species are distributed in southern Chile, Zygochlamys patagonica and Chlamys vitrea.

La importancia de su detección precoz está en la instauración de un tratamiento adecuado lo antes posible, ya que sus complicaciones son potencialmente letales en caso de no realizarse a tiempo. El caso clínico que presentamos sirve como ejemplo representativo de la heterogeneidad clínica de dicha entidad, ya que la sintomatología larvada del paciente, su forma de presentación oscilante unido a la lenta evolución del mismo plantearon dudas en cuanto al diagnóstico, lo que hizo necesario el estudio diferencial con diferentes patologías. Por otra parte, y aunque hay distintas medicaciones que pueden provocarlo, son los neurolépticos los principales en poder desencadenarlo. La combinación de estos y las fórmulas de liberación retardada favorecen la lentitud en la resolución del cuadro clínico.AbstractNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare disease. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose because of its variability in presentation and evolution. The importance of early detection is the establishment of an appropriate treatment as soon as possible, as its complications are potentially lethal if not treated on time. The clinical case presented serves as a representative example of the clinical heterogeneity of the entity, as the overt symptoms of the patient, its form of oscillating presentation coupled with its slow evolution, raised doubts about the diagnosis. This required a differential study with different pathologies. On the other hand, and although there are various medications that can cause it, neuroleptics are the leading ones that can trigger it.

Recently, the use of support vector machines (SVMs) has achieved remarkable results in statistical process control applications due to its excellent generalization performance. Although there is a lot of research that highlights the superiority of support vector machine over other algorithms used in systems based on data mining control, there are no studies that analyze the design elements of a SVM classifier. Consequently, a comprehensive review, classification and an analysis of information found in the literature are presented in this paper regarding to the SVM classifier. The aim of this research is to provide researchers a starting point to potentiate the performance of the SVM classifier for assuring the best possible classification and improving the detection efficiency. Sixty-one research articles from 2001 to 2015 are critically analyzed based on their methodology following a classification scheme derived from the support vector classification framework. The analysis showed that the feature extraction and selection play a crucial role on the performance of classifiers. Studies revealed that using extracted features or a combination of raw data and feature extraction achieves better classification performances than using only raw data as an input. On the other hand, there is an ample gap to extend the research on internal structure configurations under various types of kernels, multi-classification, and ensemble approaches. Finally, this paper evidences that the application of nature inspired algorithms for kernel parameter selection in auto-correlated SVM-based process monitoring systems remains unexplored.",,,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2016-11-23,2016,2016-11-23,2017-07,91,1-4,485-500,Closed,Article,"Cuentas, Sandra; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita; Garcia, Ethel","Cuentas, Sandra (Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, 0018000, Barranquilla, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, 0018000, Barranquilla, Colombia); Garcia, Ethel (Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, 0018000, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte)","Cuentas, Sandra (Universidad del Norte); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte); Garcia, Ethel (Universidad del Norte)",47,15,,10.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054512456,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

The refined Laspeyres index (RLI) method applied and both aggregated and sectoral changes in CO2 emissions decomposed. Brazil’s and Russia’s economies divided into three economic sectors including agriculture, industry and services. Impact of four main factors, such as economic activity, employment, energy intensity, and carbon intensity in CO2 emissions changes were analyzed. The aggregated decomposition analysis revealed that Brazil is still far from a decoupling between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions where Russia achieved a substantial decline in carbon emissions mainly due to the improved energy intensity. The empirical findings of sectoral decomposition analysis emphasized that the economic activity was the major CO2 increasing factor in Brazil’s economic sectors. On the other hand the economic activity effect followed a reducing impact in Russia’s sectoral emissions until 2000. The structural changes between sectors and their impacts on CO2 emissions were captured by employment effect. Energy intensity and carbon intensity effects underlined that environmental sustainability widely neglected in Brazil and Russia during the study period.

This requires the definition of a time-related event: A customer is profitable when monthly cumulative return is at least one (i.e. cumulative profits cover the outstanding balance). Time-to-profit scorecards were produced for a data set of revolving credit from a Colombian lending institution which included socio-demographic and first purchase individual characteristics. Results show that it is possible to obtain good classification accuracy and improve portfolio returns which are continuous by definition through the use of survival models for binary events (i.e. either being profitable or not). It is also shown how predicting time-to-profit can be used for investment planning purposes of credit programmes. It is possible to identify the earliest point in time in which a customer is profitable and hence, generates internal (organic) funds for a credit programme to continue growing and become sustainable. For survival models the effect of segmentation on loan duration was explored. Results were similar in terms of classification accuracy and identifying organic growth opportunities. In particular, loan duration and credit limit usage have a significant economic impact on time-to-profit. This paper confirms that high risk credit programmes can be profitable at different points in time depending on loan duration. Furthermore, existing customers may provide internal funds for the credit programme to continue growing.",Acknowledgement The authors are grateful to the management team of the data provider who have chosen to remain anonymous for their permanent support.,,European Journal of Operational Research,,,,2016-03,2016,,2016-03,249,2,397-406,Closed,Article,"Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier; Andreeva, Galina; Ansell, Jake","Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte Business School, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Andreeva, Galina (The University of Edinburgh Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, UK); Ansell, Jake (The University of Edinburgh Business School, 29 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, UK)","Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte)","Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte); Andreeva, Galina (University of Edinburgh); Ansell, Jake (University of Edinburgh)",6,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006976322,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,

In other words, it is necessary to find the optimal solution. The solution is the best possible solution because in the real world this problem may have certain constraints by which the solutions found may be feasible, that is, they can be implemented in practice and, unfeasible or that they cannot be implemented. Some of these problems in engineering can be MOP (Multi-Objective Optimization Problem). A general MOP includes a set of n parameters (decision variables), a set of k obj ective functions and a set of m restrictions. The objective and restriction functions are functions of the decision variables where is possible to obtain a set of optimal values. Then the MOP can be expressed as: Optimize $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=(\mathbf{f}1(\mathbf{x}), \ \mathbf{f}2(\mathbf{x}), \ \ldots, \ \mathbf{fk}(\mathbf{x}))$ Subject to $\mathbf{e}(\mathbf{x})=(\mathbf{el}(\mathbf{x}), \ \mathbf{e}2(\mathbf{x}), \ \ldots\\ \mathbf{em}(\mathbf{x})) \ 0$ Where $\mathbf{x}=(\mathbf{x}1, \ \mathbf{x}2, \ \ldots, \ \mathbf{xn})$ X $\mathbf{y}= (\mathbf{y}1, \ \mathbf{y}2, \ \ldots, \ \mathbf{yk}) \ \mathbf{Y}$ The method evolutionary algorithm (EA) refers to searching and optimization techniques based on the evolution model proposed by Charles Darwin. Genetic algorithms are used in several areas especially for searching and optimizations. In the real case the algorithm is implemented by choosing a coding for the possible solutions to the problem. The coding is done through chains of bits, numbers or characters that represent the chromosomes. The crossing and mutation operations are applied in a very simple way through functions of vector value manipulation. The EAs are interesting given the fact that at first glance they seem especially apt to deal with the difficulties presented by MOPs. The reason for this is that they can return an entire set of solutions after a simple run and they do not have any other of the limitations of traditional techniques. In addition, some researchers have suggested that the EAs would behave better than other blind searching techniques.",,,,2016 IEEE International Conference on Automatica (ICA-ACCA),,,2016-10-01,2016,,2016-10-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Donoso, Yezid","Donoso, Yezid (Academic ViceDirector and Head of the Master Program in Information Security, System and Computing Engineering Department, Universidad de los Andes Bogota, Colombia, South America)","Donoso, Yezid (Universidad de Los Andes)","Donoso, Yezid (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094751571,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4903 Numerical and Computational Mathematics,

Evidence reported in vertebrates indicates that ROI can also act as messengers in a variety of cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in innate immunity. In a recent study, an inhibitor of NF-kB transcription factors was identified in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, and its functional characterization suggested that it may regulate the expression of the big defensin antimicrobial peptide ApBD1. In order to give new insights into the messenger role of ROI in the immune response of bivalve mollusks, the effect of ROI production on gene transcription of ApBD1 was assessed in A. purpuratus. The results showed that 48 h-cultured hemocytes were able to display phagocytic activity and ROI production in response to the β-glucan zymosan. The immune stimulation also induced the transcription of ApBD1, which was upregulated in cultured hemocytes. After neutralizing the ROI produced by the stimulated hemocytes with the antioxidant trolox, the transcription of ApBD1 was reduced near to base levels. The results suggest a potential messenger role of intracellular ROI on the regulation of ApBD1 transcription during the immune response of scallops.","We gratefully acknowledge Patricio Cataldo from the Centro Acuicultura Curauma PUCV for scallop procurement and maintenance, and Ramón Ramirez for confocal microscopy assistance.

Because of ELSP complexity, there are a noticeable number of studies that use algorithms based on different approaches in order to deliver a feasible solution. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to introduce a taxonomic classification based on scheduling policies and solving methodologies proposed by authors. Also, a simple data analysis is carried out to understand the evolution of ELSP and to identify potential research areas for further studies. The results show that there is an increasing trend in this topic but there are still much needs from industrial manufacturing systems.

This leads to the problem of mismatch between employee supply and demand. In this work we present a mixed integer linear programming model and a constructive heuristic to address this problem. The proposed methodology applies the concept of multiskilling, an attractive source of flexibility for improving service levels and reducing the costs to firms of staff shortages and surpluses induced by employee demand variability. The model structures the multiskilling characteristics of a set of employees. Initially deterministic, the model is then modified to incorporate a robust optimization approach in which demand uncertainty is explicitly included. A Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the model's robust solutions for different levels of demand variability and decision-maker risk aversion. The methodology creates closed-chain multiskilling structures of different lengths with excellent cost-effective performance for each variability level. Finally, some user guidelines are defined for choosing the appropriate risk aversion level and generating a skills training plan that will ensure most of the total potential benefits of multiskilling are actually obtained with an investment much less than what would be required by the most conservative (i.e., worst case) robust solution.",AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by CONICYT under Grant 499/17-03-2009 and 2012 MISTI Global Seed Funds (MIT-Chile Seed Funds for the 2012-2013 grant cycle: Grant Recipient Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Name project - Assessing the Impact of Labor Flexibility in Shift Scheduling).

Nowadays, from computers to smartphones, technology helps people in their activities, being these personally or cooperativily. Thanks to these advantages, new research has develop to create systems and applications to help with people's health, in our case detecting fall accidents with the use of smartphones. This paper presents an approach to detect falls using different proposed algorithms with the goal of helping people with their health and security. The system es composed of three different components: data collection, location selection, and fall detection. It utilizes the smartphone's built-in sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to identify the location of the smartphone in the user's body (chest, pocket, holster, etc.) and once a location is identified, the fall detection component takes place. A general description on fall detection systems is provided, including the different types of sensors used nowadays. The proposed solution is presented and described in great detail. A total accuracy of 81.3% was calculated from the fall detection proposed algorithm. The top three locations to detect a fall were: texting with a 95.8% fall detection accuracy, pants' side pocket with an 87.5% accuracy, and shirt chest pocket with an 83.3% accuracy.

Interfacial corrosion processes are thermally activated and hence temperature dependent. In addition, concrete resistivity varies with temperature with consequent change in any resistive polarization component that may be present. The present work presents advances in the approach to temperature correction procedures. Galvanic current, electrode potentials and resistivity measurements were determined as a function of concrete temperature in outdoors reinforced concrete slabs where sacrificial point anodes were connected to the steel. Measured values were successfully standardized to an equivalent resistivity/current at a predefined reference temperature, through the application of a master temperature correction equation based on a differential formulation that derived correction parameters from short term fluctuations and filtered long term aging trends. A refined steel cathodic polarization characterization was introduced and demonstrated by accounting for the effect of electrode potential, as an added term to the nominal activation energy of the cathodic reaction.",,,Corrosion,,,,2016-11,2016,,2016-11,72,11,1462-1469,Closed,Article,"Dugarte, Margareth; Sagues, Alberto","Dugarte, Margareth (); Sagues, Alberto ()",,"Dugarte, Margareth (); Sagues, Alberto ()",2,0,,0.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009373159,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Parasites are one of the most serious limiting factors in aquaculture. Therefore, the present investigation was carried out during the period of February-December 2014 to determine the parasitic infections in the African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus, relative to the capability of internal parasites to accumulate heavy metals. Up to 100 catfish were examined for gastrointestinal helminths and 38% of fish were found to be infected with the cestode Polyonchobothrium clarias. The morphology of this parasite species, based on light and scanning electron microscopy, revealed that the adult worm was characterized by a rectangular scolex measuring 0.43-0.58 (0.49 ± 0.1) mm long and 0.15-0.21 (0.19 ± 0.1) mm wide, with a flat to slightly raised rostellum armed with a crown with two semicircles each bearing 13-15 hooks, followed by immature, mature and gravid proglottids which were about 29-55 (45), 16-30 (24) and 15-39 (28) in number, respectively. The mature proglottid contained a single set of genitalia in which medullary testes measured 0.09-0.13 (0.11 ± 0.01) mm long and 0.05-0.08 (0.06 ± 0.01) mm wide; a bi-lobed ovary was situated near the posterior margin of the proglottid, extending laterally up to the longitudinal excretory canals; the tubular uterus arose from the ootype up to the anterior margin of the proglottid; and vitelline follicles were cortical. The greater portion of the gravid proglottid was occupied by a uterus filled with unoperculate and embryonated eggs. Chemical analysis confirmed that the concentrations of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Cd, Ni and Pb) accumulated in P. clarias were higher than in fish tissues and values recommended by FAO/WHO, with the exception of Zn, which was found to be higher in fish kidneys than in the cestode. This supports the hypothesis that cestodes of fish can be regarded as useful bioindicators when evaluating the environmental pollution of aquatic ecosystems by heavy metals.",,,Journal of Helminthology,,,"Animal Structures; Animals; Catfishes; Cestoda; Cestode Infections; Egypt; Environmental Exposure; Gastrointestinal Tract; Kidney; Metals, Heavy; Microscopy; Prevalence; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2016-01-08,2016,2016-01-08,2016-11,90,6,742-752,Closed,Article,"Abdel-Gaber, R; Abdel-Ghaffar, F; Bashtar, A-R; Morsy, K; Saleh, R","Abdel-Gaber, R (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science,Cairo University,Cairo,Egypt.); Abdel-Ghaffar, F (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science,Cairo University,Cairo,Egypt.); Bashtar, A-R (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science,Cairo University,Cairo,Egypt.); Morsy, K (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science,Cairo University,Cairo,Egypt.); Saleh, R (Zoology Department, Faculty of Science,Cairo University,Cairo,Egypt.)","Abdel-Gaber, R (Cairo University)","Abdel-Gaber, R (Cairo University); Abdel-Ghaffar, F (Cairo University); Bashtar, A-R (Cairo University); Morsy, K (Cairo University); Saleh, R (Cairo University)",8,4,0.38,1.34,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006485241,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

Gold-lined seabream (Rhabdosargus sarba), brown spotted grouper (Epinephelus bleekeri) and pompano (Trachinotus blochii) were farmed at one of the research stations (Kat-O) of AFCD, for a period of 340 days. Results indicated that diets containing papain resulted in better fish growth (reflected by relative weight gain and feed conversion ratio) than diets without papain. In general, wet weight gain of fish depends on the amount of papain added in diet rather than the diet composition. Soybean used in conjunction with papain also contributed to a more effective growth than fish fed with the moist pellets alone. A laboratory experiment (using tanks) was conducted to study the effects of the diets on concentrations of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate in the tank water. Results showed that concentrations of ammonia and nitrate were significantly lower (p < 0.05) when the fish were fed with papain-supplemented (with or without soybean meal) diets. It is envisaged that by using plant protein incorporated with enzymes could promote better growth of marine fish and lower the adverse impact of trash fish and fishmeal on water quality of the mariculture zones.","AcknowledgmentsFinancial support from the National Natural Science Foundation (41373090) of China, and Industrial Department of Hong Kong is gratefully acknowledged.

The sample is conformed of 22 people who: are wheelchairs users, are capable of performing professional activities with their upper limbs, have acquired the disability after reaching their physical maturity, are in working-age and that lives in the city of Ambato, Ecuador. Since there are few studies that approach the assessment of the wheelchair as a workstation; this is emphasized in this research where the evaluations are made during the performance of job and/or home tasks since not all the wheelchair users evaluated have a remunerated job but all perform a variety of —s during the day. The results show the urgent need of the user to be able to change the sitting position during the working hours and the postural risk associated to reach objects from that position. Other interesting finding is the high percentage of users that made rudimentary changes in order to adjust the wheelchair to their body size or to facilitate the accomplishment of some tasks, evidencing the need of these types of studies and the development of technical solutions that prioritize the health preservation and the promotion of their capabilities.","This work has been funded by Direction of Investigation and Development (DIDE), of Universidad Técnica de Ambato by financing the project: “Implementation of ergonomic criteria in the design and marketing of equipment to assist people with limited mobility: case standup wheelchair”.",,,2016 IEEE Ecuador Technical Chapters Meeting (ETCM),,,2016-10-01,2016,,2016-10-01,01,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"San Antonio, Thalía; Urrutia, Fernando; Larrea, Anita","San Antonio, Thalía (Facultad de Ingeniería Civil y Mecánica, Universidad Técnica de Ambato, Ambato, Ecuador); Urrutia, Fernando (Facultad de Ingeniería en Sistemas, Electrónica e Industrial Universidad Técnica de Ambato, Ambato, Ecuador); Larrea, Anita (Facultad de Ingeniería en Sistemas, Electrónica e Industrial Universidad Técnica de Ambato, Ambato, Ecuador)",,"San Antonio, Thalía (Universidad Técnica de Ambato); Urrutia, Fernando (Universidad Técnica de Ambato); Larrea, Anita (Universidad Técnica de Ambato)",4,1,,0.93,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094395522,42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

The sample consisted of 682 boys and girls (Mage = 10.21 years) which was divided into three sub-groups: girls in all-girls schools, girls in mixed-sex schools, and boys in mixed-sex schools. Within-sex difference analyses indicated that indirect aggression was more normative than direct aggression for girls; conversely, direct aggression was more normative that indirect aggression for boys. In line with the view that non-normative behaviors are penalized by peers via rejection, direct aggression was more strongly associated with rejection in female groups whereas indirect aggression was more strongly related to rejection in male groups. Specific comparisons of the girls from the all-girl and the mixed–sex schools did not reveal any differences in the normativeness of either type of aggression between these contexts. Consistent with this result, no differences between types of school were found in the extent to which both forms of aggression were associated with rejection in females. This study shows that peer rejection occurs to a higher extent when group members engage in behaviors that are non-normative for their sex group, and that this process does not seem to vary as a function of the availability of a social comparison, as in mixed-sex schools.",,,Journal of Latino/Latin American Studies,,,,2016-01,2016,,2016-01,8,2,47-58,Closed,Article,"Velásquez, Ana M.; Drury, Kate-Mills; Saldarriaga, Lina M.; Santo, Jonathan B.; Stella-Lopez, Luz; Bukowski, William M.","Velásquez, Ana M.

We present an in-depth analysis of the current values of key indicators of research and development in Colombia benchmarked at the international level. A focus of this work is then placed on the higher education sector establishing a clear identification of the prevalent gaps in the research capacity and expenditure. Some of the consequences and implications of the low numbers of these indicators are discussed. In particular these are strongly correlated to the limited number of graduates from doctoral programs as well as the low volume of scientific output and the below world average scientific impact of research publications. We briefly discuss the case study of the Universidad Antonio Nariño of Colombia. This institution that has a broad profile student population and geographical distribution in the country has defined clear scientific policies to position itself in a relatively short period amongst the leading scientific institutions in the country. To conclude a set of recommendations are given in order to suggest specific national strategies that would allow Colombia to bridge the current gaps and consolidate its higher education and research systems at an international level.,,,Knowledge Studies in Higher Education,Trends and Challenges in Science and Higher Education,"Hugo Horta, Manuel Heitor, Jamil Salmi",,2016,2016,,2016,,,67-85,Closed,Chapter,"Losada, Marta","Losada, Marta (Universidad Antonio Nariño, Bogota, Colombia)","Losada, Marta (Universidad Antonio Nariño)","Losada, Marta (Universidad Antonio Nariño)",1,0,,0.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048888069,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

A multicentric study from three Latin-America countries,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was (i) to assess the prevalence of Violent Behavior in Schizophrenia (VBS) in a sample of community-dwelling outpatients in three middle-income countries of Latin America and (ii) to determine the clinical and socio-demographical risk factors associated with VBS and aggression level.
METHODS: The study included 253 stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia and their principal caregivers from 3 public ambulatory psychiatric care centers in Bolivia (N=83), Chile (N=85), and Peru (N=85). VBS was defined according to the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) score and the aggression level was measured by the aggression subscore of the Agitated Behavior Scale of Corrigan. We collected socio-demographic information and clinical data. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were performed to determine which variables were associated with VBS and aggression level.
RESULTS: The prevalence of VBS differed statistically between the three countries (p<0.001) with 3.5% in Chile, 14.6% in Peru and 55.4% in Bolivia. After adjustment for confounding factors, VBS was associated with a younger age, a more severe psychotic symptomatology, a lower family income and unemployment. After adjustment for confounding factors, aggression level was associated with a more severe psychotic symptomatology, a lower family income, a younger age at illness onset and higher number of hospitalizations in the last 3years.
CONCLUSION: These results may guide future health policies to specifically provide social support and rehabilitation care to VBS patients in middle-income countries, including psychoeducation and a more integrated work between the treating medical team and the social workers.","This research was funded by Proyecto UTA-Mayor 3732-16 and also by the Convenio de Desempeño UTA-MINEDUC.

In the present work, we present isotopic data from a sample (n=58) of humans drawn from several cemeteries of the Quitor ayllu, in the San Pedro de Atacama oases, and we use Bayesian mixture modeling to explore the effects of these broad social, economic, and political changes on synchronic and diachronic patterns of dietary variation. A series of hypotheses dealing with both temporal changes in diet and differences between the typical diets of females and males are tested. Ultimately, our research suggests that the disarticulation of the large interregional exchange networks of the south-central Andes at the end of the Middle Period significantly impacted the diets and lifestyle of local populations. This work also shows how the use of linear mixture modeling facilitates a more nuanced interpretation of dietary composition than visual inspection or regression analysis of isotopic data.","AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of UCN-VRIDT 22/2011, and FONDECYT 1120376.

Participants consisted of 608 Chilean university students involved in a romantic relationship, among whom 44.2% of women and 34.7% of men reported inflicting at least one act of violence toward their partner during the previous year. Results from a structural equation model showed that the association between avoidance of intimacy and physical IPV is mediated by perspective taking for both men and women. However, perspective taking mediated the link between attachment anxiety and physical IPV in women only. Our findings underline the importance of the individual's sense of attachment security in relation to their ability to empathize with their partners, as well as prevent the perpetration of physical IPV against them.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by a research grant from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of the Government of Chile (FONDECYT 11100141) to the second author.",Journal of Interpersonal Violence,,,Adult; Anxiety; Female; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Logistic Models; Male; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Students; Universities; Young Adult,2016-02-24,2016,2016-02-24,2018-11,33,22,3439-3458,Closed,Article,"Lafontaine, Marie-France; Guzmán-González, Mónica; Péloquin, Katherine; Levesque, Christine","Lafontaine, Marie-France (University of Ottawa, ON, Canada); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Péloquin, Katherine (Université de Montréal, Québec, Canada); Levesque, Christine (University of Ottawa, ON, Canada)","Lafontaine, Marie-France (University of Ottawa)","Lafontaine, Marie-France (University of Ottawa); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Péloquin, Katherine (University of Montreal); Levesque, Christine (University of Ottawa)",11,1,0.97,1.79,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038248042,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,5 Gender Equality

This study was conducted in the public mental health services in Bolivia, Peru and Chile. The data collected included RI, socio-demographic information, clinical characteristic of the patients and caregiver's QoL using the S-CGQoL questionnaire. A multivariate analysis using multiple linear regressions was performed to determine variables potentially associated with QoL levels. Two hundred and fifty-three patients with their caregivers participated in the study. Caregivers' RI was not significantly associated with overall QoL nor its individual components. The only exception was an unexpected modest inverse association between RI and one QoL dimension (psychological and physical well-being). In contrast, the following caregivers' socio-cultural and economic factors were significantly associated with low QoL level of caregivers: being a mother, identifying with Aymara ethnicity and having lower family income. Among patients, the clinical characteristics of being woman, younger, and having lower age of onset and more severe symptoms was associated with lower QoL. Our study found that socio-cultural, economic and clinical factors were associated with caregivers' QoL.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded in part by CONICYT and BECAS-CHILE Postdoctorado en el Extranjero (74140004), the Convenio de Desempeño UTA-MINEDUC.

The games featured many impressive athletic performances but failed to create the lasting impact organizers had imagined. Timing was bad. Colombia had seen a decade of economic growth after a generation of civil war. However, much of that progress was compromised beginning in the mid-1970s with the escalation of new internal wars fuelled in part by the quick growth of the cocaine sector, controlled in part by a Cali-based cartel. At the same time, games organizers did not grasp that Cali’s modernization problems were in large measure the product of growing urban social inequalities as a function of severe race and class divisions. The inability to recognize that linkage was explored in a low-budget documentary, Oiga, Vea (Listen, Look), released during the games. The film anticipated the impossible distance between grinding urban poverty and games-related projects to modernize the city. In keeping with the film’s criticism of games planners’ narratives on modernization, the manner in which the games were iconified for Colombians reflected that same distance. This is evident in projections of race and identity in games imagery and architecture.",,,The International Journal of the History of Sport,,,,2016-01-14,2016,2016-01-14,2016-01-22,33,1-2,147-163,Closed,Article,"Sheinin, David M.K.","Sheinin, David M.K.

Here, we provide evidence that urban artificial reefs have a high potential to accumulate the diverse forms of litter originating from anthropogenic activities around cities. We test the hypothesis that the structural complexity of urban breakwaters, when compared with adjacent natural rocky intertidal habitats, is a driver of anthropogenic litter accumulation. We determined litter abundances at seven sites (cities) and estimated the structural complexity in both urban breakwaters and adjacent natural habitats from northern to central Chile, spanning a latitudinal gradient of ∼15° (18°S to 33°S). Anthropogenic litter density was significantly higher in coastal breakwaters when compared to natural habitats (∼15.1 items m(-2) on artificial reefs versus 7.4 items m(-2) in natural habitats) at all study sites, a pattern that was temporally persistent. Different litter categories were more abundant on the artificial reefs than in natural habitats, with local human population density and breakwater extension contributing to increase the probabilities of litter occurrence by ∼10%. In addition, structural complexity was about two-fold higher on artificial reefs, with anthropogenic litter density being highest at intermediate levels of structural complexity. Therefore, the spatial structure characteristic of artificial reefs seems to enhance anthropogenic litter accumulation, also leading to higher residence time and degradation potential. Our study highlights the interaction between coastal urban habitat modification by establishment of artificial reefs, and pollution. This emergent phenomenon is an important issue to be considered in future management plans and the engineering of coastal ecosystems.","We greatly appreciate the help of Constanza A.

Puccinellia frigida is a perennial grass that was reported to hyperaccumulate boron in extremely boron-contaminated sites. To further investigate its potential for phytoremediation, we determined its response to boron stress under controlled conditions (hydroponic culture). Also, as a first step towards understanding the mechanisms underlying its extreme tolerance, we evaluated the presence and expression of genes related with boron tolerance. We found that P. frigida grew normally even at highly toxic boron concentrations in the medium (500mg/L), and within its tissues (>5000mg/kg DW). We postulate that the strategies conferring this extreme tolerance involve both restricting boron accumulation and an internal tolerance mechanism; this is consistent with the identification of putative genes involved in both mechanisms, including the expression of a possible boron efflux transporter. We also found that P. frigida hyperaccumulated boron over a wide range of boron concentrations. We propose that P. frigida could be used for boron phytoremediation strategies in places with different soil characteristics and boron concentrations. Further studies should pave the way for the development of clean and low-cost solutions to boron toxicity problems.","We thank Catalina Rámila and Catalina Guzmán for their help in the hydroponic culture experiments and plant analyses, respectively, Fernanda Carrasco and Mauricio Medel for their help in plant care, and Shester Cancino for his help in building the plant chamber.

This has been consistently observed for high-status groups, whereas for members of low-status groups, it remains rather unclear whether system justification exerts a positive or a negative effect. This study tested the palliative effect of system justification on symptoms of anxiety-depression in a gay men and lesbian sample (N = 467) in Chile. Results from moderated mediation analyses revealed that system justification beliefs buffer symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, system justification enhances anxious and depressive symptoms through internalized homonegativity; this mediation effect was significant for gay men. We pose that justifying the social order comprises two contradictory functions: system justification as a coping source and, otherwise, as a source of distress under conditions of in-group derogation, posing a threat to wellbeing among members of low-status groups (as observed in gay and lesbian individuals).

939,pub.1004870822,10.1002/oa.2511,,,No Country for Old People: A Paleodemographic Analysis of Migration Dynamics in Early Andean States,"Abstract In this paper, we present a paleodemographic interpretation of a complete mortuary population from the site of Rio Muerto (southern Peru) affiliated with the early Andean Tiwanaku state (A.D.500–1000). Although advances in biogeochemical paleomobility studies have revolutionized bioarchaeological approaches to certain aspects of migration, paleodemography continues to offer a valuable complementary perspective on migration and population dynamics. Notably, paleodemography, through reference to Uniformitarian age‐at‐death profiles, is uniquely equipped to identify age‐specific subgroups that are missing from the mortuary population. We argue that the marked absence of adult individuals in the M70B cemetery population is the result of the socially regulated movement of older adults or their remains from the state provinces back to the homeland. We suggest that the particular demographic composition of the Rio Muerto M70 cemetery population, when considered within its cultural context and compared to other available paleodemographic data, reveals potential patterns of adult return migration, and carries important implications for the political and social dynamics of early Andean state society.

It argues that the country consolidated a successful process of entry into the expanding world economy. GDP per capita was poor, but alternative indicators suggest a more optimistic picture (e.g., agricultural, copper and silver production increased, population grew and terms of trade improved). Furthermore, there were some positive institutional developments. All these changes made possible the sustained growth that took place from the 1830s and must be seen as more important than the growth record itself during the 1810–1820s.","This paper was funded by Fondecyt, project No. 1150161.

The FNA is a scale that evaluates the needs of families with children with disabilities who are below the age of 18 years. To validate this scale, the research team identified the theoretical background regarding family members’ needs and performed a linguistic adaptation of the scale, which was reviewed to guarantee its validity through cognitive interviews and a pilot study. Results from the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed 72 items distributed in a 4-factor solution. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for each factor and for the overall FNA scale were also estimated. Specifically, alpha computed from the correlation among the 72 items was 0.97 and ranged from 0.85 to 0.95 for the four factors. Findings from this study provided evidence to support the validity of the FNA for families with children with intellectual disability in Colombia. The findings also indicated that the FNA has the potential of contributing to a better understanding of inputs (e.g. needs of families with individuals with disability) with the aim of informing system decisions, enhancing policies, improving services and strengthening family-professional partnerships.",,,International Journal on Disability and Human Development,,,,2016-10-18,2016,2016-10-18,2017-08-28,16,3,311-319,Closed,Article,"Aya-Gómez, Viviana Lucía; Parra, Amalia Alexandra Ovalle; Cabrera-Garcia, Victoria; Muñoz-Gómez, Diana Sthefania; Romero, Claudia Alejandra Duque","Aya-Gómez, Viviana Lucía (Universidad de La Sabana, Campus del Puente del Común, Km. 7, Autopista Norte de Bogotá, Chía, Cundinamarca, Colombia, Chia, Colombia); Parra, Amalia Alexandra Ovalle (Universidad de Ibague, Carrera 22# 67B Ambalá, Ibague, Colombia); Cabrera-Garcia, Victoria (Universidad de La Sabana, Campus del Puente del Común, Km. 7, Autopista Norte de Bogotá, Chía, Cundinamarca, Colombia, Chia 22645, Colombia); Muñoz-Gómez, Diana Sthefania (Universidad de La Sabana, Campus del Puente del Común, Km. 7, Autopista Norte de Bogotá, Chía, Cundinamarca, Colombia, Chia, Colombia); Romero, Claudia Alejandra Duque (Universidad de Ibague, Carrera 22# 67B Ambalá, Ibague, Colombia)","Cabrera-Garcia, Victoria (University of La Sabana)","Aya-Gómez, Viviana Lucía (University of La Sabana); Parra, Amalia Alexandra Ovalle (Universidad de Ibagué); Cabrera-Garcia, Victoria (University of La Sabana); Muñoz-Gómez, Diana Sthefania (University of La Sabana); Romero, Claudia Alejandra Duque (Universidad de Ibagué)",4,3,,1.04,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067538274,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work,4 Quality Education

We characterized two ferritin homologues and their expression patterns in association with early development, growth rate and immune response in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, a species of economic importance for Chile and Peru. Two ferritin subunits (Apfer1 and Apfer2) were cloned. Apfer1 cDNA is a 792bp clone containing a 516bp open reading frame (ORF) that corresponds to a novel ferritin subunit in A. purpuratus. Apfer2 cDNA is a 681bp clone containing a 522bp ORF that corresponds to a previously sequenced EST. A putative iron responsive element (IRE) was identified in the 5'-untranslated region of both genes. The deduced protein sequences of both cDNAs possessed the motifs and domains characteristic of functional ferritin subunits. Both genes showed differential expression patterns at tissue-specific and early development stage levels. Apfer1 expression level increased 40-fold along larval developmental stages, decreasing markedly after larval settlement. Apfer1 expression in mantle tissue was 2.8-fold higher in fast-growing than in slow-growing scallops. Apfer1 increased 8-fold in haemocytes 24h post-challenge with the bacterium Vibrio splendidus. Apfer2 expression did not differ between fast- and slow-growing scallops or in response to bacterial challenge. These results suggest that Apfer1 and Apfer2 may be involved in iron storage, larval development and shell formation. Apfer1 expression may additionally be involved in immune response against bacterial infections and also in growth; and thus would be a potential marker for immune capacity and for fast growth in A. purpuratus.","AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Germán Lira and William Farías for their technical support with animal maintenance.

Knowledge of this fauna is highly uneven and clearly incomplete for almost all regions, sometimes dramatically so. Although the biggest problem remains the completion of the ‘first pass’ of alpha taxonomy, there are in addition great problems relating to biogeography and elucidation of life-cycles. For the latter, molecular data, i.e. matching DNA sequences of larval stages and corresponding adults, may represent a powerful tool that should be used in future studies.

As the cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) are involved in said mechanisms, the possibility for a selective inhibition of COX-2 was analyzed in vitro and in silico. Propolis and grape pomace from Uruguayan species were collected, extracted in hydroalcoholic mixture and analyzed. Based on phenols previously identified, and taking as reference the crystallographic structures of COX-1 and COX-2 in complex with the commercial drug Celecoxib, a molecular docking procedure was devised to adjust 123 phenolic molecular models at the enzyme-binding sites. The most important results of this work are that the extracts have an overall inhibition activity very similar in COX-1 and COX-2, i.e. they do not possess selective inhibition activity for COX-2. Nevertheless, 10 compounds of the phenolic database turned out to be more selective and 94 phenols resulted with similar selectivity than Celecoxib, an outcome that accounts for the overall experimental inhibition measures. Binding site environment observations showed increased polarity in COX-2 as compared with COX-1, suggesting that polarity is the key for selectivity. Accordingly, the screening of molecular contacts pointed to the residues: Arg106, Gln178, Leu338, Ser339, Tyr341, Tyr371, Arg499, Ala502, Val509, and Ser516, which would explain, at the atomic level, the anti-inflammatory effect of the phenolic compounds. Among them, Gln178 and Arg499 appear to be essential for the selective inhibition of COX-2.","Financial support for this research by Proyecto de Desarrollo de Ciencias Básicas (PEDECIBA) and Comisión Sectorial de Investigación Científica (CSIC), Universidad de la República –Uruguay and MECESUP, Chile is gratefully acknowledged.

The design of evaluation systems which allow the combined assessment of prevention factors of overweight and obesity related to a healthy lifestyle is necessary. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a system of for the combined assessment of the physical exercise and diet behaviours, and psychological variables related to adherence. The system has been applied in female university students, comparing results based on their level of physical exercise.MethodThe study included 38 female university students (22.64±2.61) years old, classified into three groups: 12 Athletes, 12 Active women, and 14 Non-Active women. They completed a battery of questionnaires about physical exercise, eating habits, and psychological aspects related to adherence. Their anthropometric measurements were recorded and they performed fitness tests.ResultsThe Athletes group showed greater muscular strength and endurance (P=.003), more minutes of previous exercise practice (P=.019) and current exercise practice (P>.001), and less emotional role (P=.031), compared to the other groups. The main motivations for all participants were health, stress reduction, enjoyment, and cardiorespiratory fitness improvement, the latter being higher in the Non-Active group (P=.043). The barriers score was higher in the Non-Active group, being significantly higher for the “unwillingness to be constant” (P=.001) and “lack of time” (P=.014). No significant differences in diet and mood states were found.ConclusionThe developed and implemented evaluation system allowed us to obtain a holistic approach to the participants, noting a clearly differentiated profile in relation to variables for exercise and fitness, although there was no clear relationship with variables relating to diet and psychological profile.",,,Apunts Sports Medicine,,,,2016-07,2016,,2016-07,51,191,75-83,Closed,Article,"Bonet, Judit; Parrado, Eva; Barahona, Anabel; Capdevila, Lluís","Bonet, Judit (Laboratorio de Psicología del Deporte, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, España); Parrado, Eva (Laboratorio de Psicología del Deporte, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, España); Barahona, Anabel (Laboratorio de Psicología del Deporte, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, España); Capdevila, Lluís (Laboratorio de Psicología del Deporte, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, España)","Parrado, Eva (Autonomous University of Barcelona)","Bonet, Judit (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Parrado, Eva (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Barahona, Anabel (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Capdevila, Lluís (Autonomous University of Barcelona)",4,0,,0.88,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020396268,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,

Afterward, it has been demonstrated that lindane and its isomers may cause serious damage to health in the short and long term. Besides, lindane is known to be persistent in the environment and tends to bioaccumulate along the food chain. Thus, lindane residues remain in the environment for a long time and have been recently found in water, soil, sediments, plants, and animals all over the world, and even in human fluids and tissues. In this context, nowadays, scientists, working all over the world, are involved in developing lindane remediation technologies including physical, chemical, and biological techniques. This article provides updated information on the biologic degradation of lindane using different microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.","This work was supported by Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Secretaria de Ciencia, Arte e Innovación Tecnológica (SCAIT), and Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT).",,Environmental Science and Engineering,Microbe-Induced Degradation of Pesticides,Shree Nath Singh,,2016-09-13,2016,2016-09-13,2017,,,191-212,Closed,Chapter,"Saez, J.

Lungfishes are members of an ancient group of bony fishes, the Sarcopterygii or lobe-finned fishes, which were widespread during the Devonian period. Since the expedition of Carter and Beadle in the year 1931, it has been known that the pirambóia dig burrows and aestivate during low water periods. The black body of this lungfish is very elongated, with two pairs of lobe fins, five gill arches; its length can go upto 1.5 m, it moves slowly and lives in swampy areas. This chapter describes the main characteristics of the South American lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa, and, when necessary, compares it to other lungfishes or teleosts, such as Arapaima and 130Symbranchus that have similar biological or ecological traits. The chapter is divided into sections where general conditions of living dipnoan genera are compared, and the main characteristics of South American lungfish distribution and habitat, aestivation, reproductive, and feeding behavior are reviewed. Additionally, some metabolic adaptations are described, reviewing the literature and discussing some new facts that were studied in our laboratories.","This work was funded by the National Research Council (CNPQ) of Brazil (PNOPG to VMFAV-processes # 400030/11-33) and a CNPq/FAPEAM (Amazon State Research Foundation) PRONEX grant to ALV.

The role of resting cysts and the existence of different regional Chilean populations was studied by culturing and genetic approaches to define: (1) cyst production; (2) dormancy period; (3) excystment success; (4) offspring viability and (5) strain mating compatibility. This study newly revealed a short cyst dormancy (minimum 69 days), the role of key abiotic factors (in decreasing order salinity, irradiance, temperature and nutrients) controlling cyst germination (max. 60%) and germling growth rates (up to 0.36-0.52div.day-1). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) characterization showed significant differences in genetic distances (GD) among A. catenella populations that were primarily determined by the geographical origin of isolates and most likely driven by oceanographic dispersal barriers. A complex heterothallic mating system pointed to variable reproductive compatibility (RCs) among Chilean strains that was high among northern (Los Lagos/North Aysén) and southern populations (Magallanes), but limited among the genetically differentiated central (South Aysén) populations. Field cyst surveys after a massive 2009 bloom event revealed the existence of exceptional high cyst densities in particular areas of the fjords (max. 14.627cystscm-3), which contrast with low cyst concentrations (<221.3cystscm-3) detected by previous oceanographic campaigns. In conclusion, the present study suggests that A. catenella resting cysts play a more important role in the success of this species in Chilean fjords than previously thought. Results from in vitro experiments suggest that pelagic-benthic processes can maintain year-round low vegetative cell concentrations in the water column, but also can explain the detection of high cysts aggregations after the 2009-bloom event. Regional drivers that lead to massive outbreaks, however, are still unknown but potential scenarios are discussed.","AcknowledgementsWe thank Ludmilla Untari, Helen Bond, Sarah Ugalde and Andrea Zuñiga for technical assistance.

The tailing was classified as saline-sodic with high concentrations of metals, especially Cu and Fe, with pH 8.4. Our objectives were to (1) compare the physicochemical properties of the tailing with surrounding soils of the mine under study, and (2) evaluate the effect of two amendments (CaCO3 and compost) and their mixtures on Cu2+, Mn, Fe, Zn, Mg2+, and K+ and Ca2+, SO42−, NO3−, and PO43− leaching. The data obtained were submitted to variance and covariance analysis. The results from the comparison between both substrates showed that in general, the tailing presented greater content of metals. Regarding tailing leaching, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and concentration of the elements of interest were measured. The statistical analysis showed that Cu2+ leaching and immobilization of Fe occurred to the greatest extent with compost. The EC decreased throughout the experiment with irrigation and increased upon treatment with compost. The major interactions found among the chemical parameters were (1) tailings without treatment, Cu2+/Fe and NO3−/SO42−; (2) tailings treated with CaCO3, Cu2+/K+; (3) tailings treated with compost, NO3−/SO4−2 and EC/Cu2+; and (4) tailings treated with both amendments, EC/Fe and Cu2+/Fe. The ANOVA showed that the number of irrigations and the amendments statistically significantly affected the copper mobility and the organic amendment significantly influenced the iron mobility.","This study was carried out in the framework of a CORFO-INNOVA project (08CM01-05), titled “Integrated development of magneto-chemical technologies and phytotechnologies applied to the remediation of heavy metals in mining environmental liability development”.",,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,"Calcium Carbonate; Chile; Copper; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Soil; Soil Pollutants",2016-03-09,2016,2016-03-09,2016-06,23,12,11901-11915,Closed,Article,"Lam, Elizabeth J.; Gálvez, M.

Part I: Surface properties and floatability,"Molybdenite (MoS2) is a naturally hydrophobic mineral with anisotropic surface properties. Its floatability is influenced by a number of factors such as, particle size and shape, face/edge ratio, degree of crystallization, face heterogeneity, pH, etc. Molybdenite is floated by using oily collectors, and its recovery is strongly affected by slime coating phenomena. A number of hydrolyzable cations, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, depress molybdenite in alkaline solutions. Depression of molybdenite in seawater and saline waters is mainly induced by the precipitation of colloidal magnesium hydroxide when pH is raised to depress pyrite. Other metal cations present in recycled process water can also reduce the flotation recovery of molybdenite (e.g., Al3+, Fe2+, Cu2+ ions). The native floatability of molybdenite is highly depressed by natural polymers (starch, dextrin, guar gum, humic acids, etc.) and synthetic polymers (e.g., flocculants of the polyacrylamide type). The advances in understanding the surface chemistry of these systems are reviewed and discussed in this paper.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Water Research Center for Agriculture and Mining (CRHIAM), University of Concepcion; and the Chilean Research Council (CONICYT) for financial support through the FONDAP—15130015 grant.",,International Journal of Mineral Processing,,,,2016-03,2016,,2016-03,148,,48-58,Closed,Article,"Castro, S.; Lopez-Valdivieso, A.; Laskowski, J.S.","Castro, S.

Abstract
                  
                    Between 2007 and 2010, pedestrian surveys, sub-surface soundings, and small excavations were undertaken in the Pearl Island archipelago of Panamá. The most intensive investigations took place on Pedro González Island. This brief preliminary synthesis describes the chronology of the human occupation of this island. The proposed chronology is based on radiocarbon dates and typological comparisons with the ceramic assemblages of the Gran Coclé culture region to the west, where a distinctive polychrome tradition developed between 2350 and 450 cal B.P., and with the area that became the Gran Darién culture area after 800 cal B.P. The most ancient site on Pedro González Island dates to the Preceramic period (6200–5600 cal B.P.). After a long hiatus, ceramic-using groups colonized the island around 2350 cal B.P. We propose five ceramic phases based on the overlapping 2
                    σ
                    ranges of available radiocarbon dates. Between 2350 and 1450 cal B.P., island pottery mirrors the temporal trajectory of the Gran Coclé ceramic complex. Nevertheless, it exhibits other stylistic features found on the mainland immediately to the north and on offshore islands, for example, Taboguilla. Between 1450 and 1200 cal B.P. typological similarities to the Azuero Peninsula, Coclé and Playa Venado (on the south coast of the Canal Area) are so close that it is assumed that this area briefly comprised a single interaction zone whose cultural homogeneity was perhaps linked to maritime trade stimulated by the importance at this time of coral reef shells such as
                    Spondylus
                    . Changes in Pearl Island pottery assemblages between 1200–800 cal B.P. suggest the arrival of a novel population or the readjustment of connections with the mainland, which from now on emphasized the eastern littoral of Panama Bay and nearby regions of Colombia.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2016-09,2016,2017-01-20,2016-09,27,3,378-396,Closed,Article,"Martín, Juan Guillermo; Cooke, Richard G.; Bustamante, Fernando; Holst, Irene; Lara, Alexandra; Redwood, Stewart","Martín, Juan Guillermo (Universidad de Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, (, jgmartin@uninorte.edu.co, )); Cooke, Richard G.

In the southern hemisphere, the bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica is one of the most common floating seaweeds, but phylogeographic studies had shown low connectivity between populations from continental Chile, which could be due to limitations in local supply and dispersal of floating kelps. To test this hypothesis, the spatiotemporal dynamics of kelp strandings were examined in four biogeographic districts along the Chilean coast (28°-42°S). We determined the biomass and demography of stranded individuals on 33 beaches for three subsequent years (2013, 2014, 2015) to examine whether rafting is restricted to certain districts and seasons (winter or summer). Stranded kelps were found on all beaches. Most kelps had only one stipe (one individual), although we also frequently found coalesced holdfasts with mature males and females, which would facilitate successful rafting dispersal, gamete release, and reproduction upon arrival. High biomasses of stranded kelps occurred in the northern-central (30°S-33°S) and southernmost districts (37°S-42°S), and lower biomasses in the northernmost (28°S-30°S) and southern-central districts (33°S-37°S). The highest percentages and sizes of epibionts (Lepas spp.), indicative of prolonged floating periods, were found on stranded kelps in the northernmost and southernmost districts. Based on these results, we conclude that rafting dispersal can vary regionally, being more common in the northernmost and southernmost districts, depending on intrinsic (seaweed biology) and extrinsic factors (shore morphology and oceanography) that affect local supply of kelps and regional hydrodynamics.",,,Journal of Phycology,,A.

Two studies were conducted with a community sample in Bogotá, Colombia. In a pilot study, we developed a measure of positive and negative stereotyping of older adults. In the main study with participants aged between 54 and 83, we explored the relations among endorsement of positive and negative stereotypes, anxiety about aging, perceived and expected physical and mental health, and expectations of social support. We found that perceived lack of social support and negative stereotyping significantly predict more anxiety towards aging, while positive evaluations of one's own mental health predict less anxiety. Surprisingly, greater expectations of social support predict more aging anxiety. In turn, aging anxiety and positive stereotyping predicted evaluations of mental (but not physical) health. Additionally, poorer evaluations of physical health, aging anxiety and negative stereotyping (though only marginally) significantly predict greater expectations of social support.

These paths are very useful to evaluate the performance of models simulating cyclic loading. In this article, an extension of an existing constitutive model is proposed to capture the behavior of the soil under this type of loading. The reference model is based on the intergranular strain anisotropy concept and therefore incorporates an elastic locus in terms of a strain amplitude. In order to evaluate the model performance, a modified triaxial apparatus able to perform multidimensional cyclic loading has been used to conduct some experiments with a fine sand. Simulations of the extended model with multidimensional loading paths are carefully analyzed. Considering that many cycles are simulated (N>30$$N>30$$), some additional simulations have been performed to quantify and analyze the artificial accumulation generated by the (hypo-)elastic component of the model. At the end, a simple boundary value problem with a cyclic loading as boundary condition is simulated to analyze the model response.",,,Acta Geotechnica,,,,2016-09-13,2016,2016-09-13,2016-12,11,6,1263-1285,Closed,Article,"Poblete, M.; Fuentes, W.; Triantafyllidis, Th.","Poblete, M.

These hydrological and hydrogeological parameters were evaluated by an exploratory geostatistical analysis (semivariogram) and a spectral analysis (periodogram). Specifically, the hydrological and hydrogeological data analyses are organized according to three sub-basins, the Del Carmen River (Section I), the El Tránsito River (Section II), and the Huasco River (Section III). Data ranges for rainfall are from 1961 to 2015, for streamflow from 1964 to 2015, and for groundwater levels from 1969 to 2014, available from Water Authority of Chile. The analyses allowed the identification of cycles in the hydrological and hydrogeological records. The study area is located in a transient climatic fringe where the convergence of several climatic systems can be identified in the hydrological and hydrogeological records. Results indicate that the nival areas and the small glaciers are especially important to the recharge processes in the Huasco watershed during the spring-summer snowmelting. Water reservoirs in the main aquifer (Section III) and in the Santa Juana dam are highly sensitive to ENSO oscillation climatic patterns. The main climatic events that control this record are the El Niño and La Niña events. In addition, the climatic influence of the westerlies and the SE extratropical moisture were also identified. Spectral analysis identified the presence of a 22.9-yearcycle in piezometric levels of the alluvial aquifer of the Huasco River. This cycle is consistent with the 22-year Hale solar cycle, suggesting the existence of a solar forcing controlling the ENSO oscillations. Moreover, semivariogram and spectral analysis identified a 10.65-yearcycle and a 9.2-yearcycle in groundwater, respectively, which were attributed to the strong mode of ENSO oscillations.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by CORFO project 05CR11IXM-28 and Anillo project ACT 1203 of the CONICYT of Chile government.

The persistent high UV regime and evolution of the lake biota due to deglaciation make Andean lake ecosystems potential analogues in the search for life on other planetary bodies. Our objective was to identify microbial biomarkers and metabolic patterns that represent time points in the evolutionary history of Andean glacial lakes, as these may be used in long-term studies as microscale indicators of climate change processes. We investigated a variety of microbial markers in shallow sediments from Laguna Negra and Lo Encañado lakes (Región Metropolitana, Chile). An on-site immunoassay-based Life Detector Chip (LDChip) revealed the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogenic archaea, and exopolymeric substances from Gammaproteobacteria. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from field samples confirmed the results from the immunoassays and also revealed the presence of Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria, as well as cyanobacteria and methanogenic archaea. The complementary immunoassay and phylogenetic results indicate a rich microbial diversity with active sulfate reduction and methanogenic activities along the shoreline and in shallow sediments. Sulfate inputs from the surrounding volcanic terrains during deglaciation may explain the observed microbial biomarker and metabolic patterns, which differ with depth and between the two lakes. A switch from aerobic and heterotrophic metabolisms to anaerobic ones such as sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in the shallow shores likely reflects the natural evolution of the lake sediments due to deglaciation. Hydrodynamic deposition of sediments creates compartmentalization (e.g., sediments with different structure and composition surrounded by oligotrophic water) that favors metabolic transitions. Similar phenomena would be expected to occur on other planetary lakes, such as those of Titan, where watery niches fed by depositional events would be surrounded by a ""sea"" of hydrocarbons.

Without understanding how correlates of attitudes toward LGBT individuals are both similar and different across multiple international locations, it is unclear how we can learn to counteract negative prejudices toward these groups. In the current study, we explore how measures of politics, feminism, and religion affect attitudes toward LGBT individuals using Worthen’s (2012) Attitudes Toward LGBT People Scales and data from four college student samples in Oklahoma, Texas, Italy, and Spain (N = 1311). Results suggest three trends: (1) negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals are more pervasive in Oklahoma than in any of the other university samples and are most positive among Spanish students; (2) negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals are related to the individual and multiplicative effects of political beliefs, feminism, and religiosity across all four samples; and (3) constructs related to attitudes toward gays/lesbians differ from those that relate to attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals. Such findings indicate that there are important similarities and differences in prejudices toward LGBT individuals and that attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals should be included in future international comparative research.",,"Support for this research was supported by two sources of funding awarded to the first author from the University of Oklahoma, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Presidential International Travel Fellowship.",Sexuality Research and Social Policy,,,,2016-06-29,2016,2016-06-29,2017-09,14,3,241-258,Closed,Article,"Worthen, Meredith G.

This may sometimes be true but the opposite is also true. In 2010, United Nations peacekeepers unwittingly brought cholera to Haiti and sparked an epidemic. Nearly a million people were made sick and 8,500 died. Legal activists have sought to hold the UN responsible for the harms it caused and win compensation for the cholera victims. However, these efforts have been stymied by the structures of public international law—particularly UN immunity—which effectively insulate the organization from accountability. In short, the UN is empowered, and the cholera victims disempowered, by legalization. The Haiti case powerfully illustrates the dangers of legalism, which have been largely overlooked in discussions of international law, and suggests that law alone is an inadequate arbiter of responsibility in international politics.",,,Perspectives on Politics,,,,2016-03-21,2016,2016-03-21,2016-03,14,1,70-86,Closed,Article,"Pillinger, Mara; Hurd, Ian; Barnett, Michael N.","Pillinger, Mara (); Hurd, Ian (); Barnett, Michael N.

The depositional environment varied from a rocky shoreline to the upper continental slope, with sea-level oscillations and tectonic movements causing numerous local unconformities as well as lateral and vertical facies changes. Geohistory and sedimentological analyses show that the area was close to the concurrent sea level at about 15.3Ma, but at the same time being elevated about 100m above the present sea level. Although the basin then subsided at least 350m until around 6Ma, marine deposition was only recorded after 10.4Ma. This suggests that the sea level initially dropped faster than the rate of subsidence so that subaerial erosion occurred. The period of subaerial exposure before 10.4Ma can be attributed to the presence of a NE-trending branch of the Juan Fernández Ridge below the continental crust at this time, whereas the ensuing subsidence was due to subduction erosion and crustal accommodation in its wake as it migrated south along the South American coastline. The subsequent uplift of at least 250m can be explained by an acceleration in plate expansion and isostatic rebound of the continental crust after being partially submerged in the upper mantle. The uplift–subsidence–uplift pattern mirrors those recorded around the Nazca Ridge in Peru, as well as in similar basins to the south of Caldera. However, a higher southward migration rate of the Juan Fernández Ridge against the edge of the South American Plate and less intense uplift–subsidence–uplift cycles are recorded in the latter basins. This can possibly be attributed to oroclinal bending of the ridge due to friction with the overlying continental plate, which diminished the angle of incidence and the intensity of the stress field, but increased the migration velocity of the ridge relative to the coastline.","The authors are greatly indebted to financial and logistical support from Projects Fondecyt 1010691 and 130006, National Geographic Society Committee on Research Exploration grants 8903-11 and 9019-11, and Project CONICYT/FONDAP 15090013.

It charts shifting alliances between the latter and Guajiro alaulayus (leaders) – who were related by blood or marriage – in the 1760s and 1770s, and between alaulayus and the captains of non-Spanish ships. It argues that conflict and competition among alaulayus determined the contours and limits of such alliances. Conflict and competition among alaulayus, in turn, was fueled by perceived violations of Guajiro law concerning property rights, principally cattle rustling, as well as by conflicts over access to key Atlantic ports. Thus Guajiro kinship, law, property relations, trade, and politics dictated the terms, extent, and success of Spanish engagement, missionary as well as martial. Spanish presence was contingent on the goodwill of one or more Guajiro alaulayus, whose power derived in part from the broader Atlantic trade networks in which they participated, and constrained Spanish imperialism. This view rejects conflict and competition among European imperial agents as the chief determinants of indigenous autonomy. Native peoples such as the Guajiros shaped the course of European empires as much as they were shaped by them.","The author would like to thank the participants in conferences and seminars at the University of Pittsburgh, Rutgers University, Northwestern University, the New School, Vanderbilt University, and New York University, as well as Michael A.

However, it plays a central role in patristic and medieval trinitarian thought, and is a doctrinal affirmation of the Catholic Church. This article seeks to illustrate the significance of the teaching first by examining the contrasting modern trinitarian theologies of Karl Barth and Richard Swinburne, noting how each suffers from a deficit of reference to the doctrine of divine simplicity. The article then presents four aspects of Aquinas’ teaching on divine simplicity. From this a consideration of trinitarian persons ensues that illustrates why the distinction of persons in God can best be understood by making use of Aquinas’ theology of ‘subsistent relations’, while the unified nature of God can best be understood in terms of ‘personal modes of subsistence’. Based on this analysis, the contrasting insights of both Barth and Swinburne can be fully retained, without the contrasting inherent problems that the theology of each presents.",,This essay was written for the 2015 Classical Theism Project of the Philosophy Department of the University of St Thomas (Minnesota).

Organized in three parts, the book presents the methodology for the construction of new indicators, discusses quality of urban life from a geographical perspective, and examines quality of life of different populations. The book focuses on the social, economic, political, geographical and demographic dimensions. It covers a wide range of topics, including the ways to measure social, political and spatial inequalities, the changes in urban quality of life, the construction of a synthetic indicator for the assessment of habitability, the measuring of spatial segregation in midsize and smaller cities by using thematic cartography and synthesis maps, and the concept of habitability.

In considering university histories, it is useful to examine this traditional approach as well as more recent scholarly developments in the study of the history of institutions of higher learning internationally. In South Africa, most universities have some form of published history, although these vary greatly in scope, depth and critical approach. This article briefly considers volumes produced on South African universities and their past in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Trends and approaches evident in this wide variety of publications are highlighted. Questions such as the choice of moments of origin and commemoration, the effect of Apartheid on the retelling of the past and the use of either an autobiographical or a collaborative approach are considered. The comparative lack of histories of former ‘non-white’ universities is also explored, while the predominance of interest in matters of institutional identity in the post-Apartheid context is highlighted.",,,African Historical Review,,,,2016-01-02,2016,2016-10-14,2016-01-02,48,1,56-82,Closed,Article,"Strydom, Bronwyn","Strydom, Bronwyn (University of South Africa)","Strydom, Bronwyn (University of South Africa)","Strydom, Bronwyn (University of South Africa)",5,1,,6.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030926923,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

The number of mobile subscriptions set to surpass seven billion and reach the whole world population in 2014. The explosion of MI business comes together with the development from the old mobile phones into the current smart phones. This is a combination of personal device assistants and mobile phones that use advanced operating systems and permit users to install new applications, be constantly connected to the Internet, and provide multifarious functionalities of both (Norazah Mohd 2013). According to a report from the specialized consultant Analysis Mason, there are 1700 million of smart phones around the world in 2014, which means an annual growth of 32 %. Furthermore, the number of Smartphone connections is set to grow by 136 % in the next 5 years to reach 3.9 billion connections worldwide in 2018 (de Renesse 2014). However, nowadays a small minority of users generates a disproportionate share of the total data volume. These are some of the reasons that justify the huge importance of studying factors, which influence consumer behavior of mobile Internet users (Gerpott and Thomas 2014).",,,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,Rediscovering the Essentiality of Marketing,"Luca Petruzzellis, Russell S.

434,pub.1022398709,10.1002/atr.1384,,,"Estimating freeway route travel time distributions with consideration to time‐of‐day, inclement weather, and traffic incidents","Summary This paper develops an efficient probabilistic model for estimating route travel time variability, incorporating factors of time‐of‐day, inclement weather, and traffic incidents. Estimating the route travel time distribution from historical link travel time data is challenging owing to the interactions among upstream and downstream links. Upon creating conditional probability function for each link travel time, we applied Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the total travel time from origin to destination. A numerical example of three alternative routes in the City of Buffalo shows several implications. The study found that weather conditions, except for snow, incur minor impact on off‐peak and weekend travel time, whereas peak travel times suffer great variations under different weather conditions. On top of that, inclement weather exacerbates route travel time reliability, even when mean travel time increases moderately. The computation time of the proposed model is linearly correlated to the number of links in a route. Therefore, this model can be used to obtain all the origin to destination travel time distributions in an urban region. Further, this study also validates the well‐known near‐linear relation between the standard deviation of travel time per unit distance and the corresponding mean value under different weather conditions.

Additionally, it discusses existing applications of humanitarian operations research, and considers new research efforts that clearly extend existing research and applications.The book is divided into three sections that provide an overview of the subject, a look at the theory, and an examination of applications. The overview section presents chapters on modeling approaches and metrics to evaluate nonprofit operations; chief findings of fieldwork research in disaster response logistics;the use of cash as a form of relief; and measuring markets that supply cash-based humanitarian interventions. The theory section includes chapters that examine the partner proliferation problem in disaster response networks; a case study of humanitarian logistics that examines how humanitarian culture informs change adoption; and a look at the current state of the art for information visibility in humanitarian operations. Finally, the application section focuses on blood products, vaccines, and food assistance, with individual chapters on efficient inventorying and distribution of blood products during disasters; a detailed look at modeling in the context of the vaccine supply chain; a framework for achieving equity, effectiveness, and efficiency in food bank operations; and a spatio-temporal vulnerability assessment of the resilience of a population affected by sudden lack of food.",,,International Series in Operations Research & Management Science,,"Christopher W.

Vatsonga have the tendency of giving nicknames, which act as tokens of appreciation or disapproval. Nicknames are one of the forms of address, which Vatsonga as a nation uses to either praise or show disapproval of a person’s behavior. Amongst Vatsonga, in informal situations, first names are often used interchangeably with nicknames. This form of address is commonly used by peers in particular age groups namely, children, adolescents and young adults. This practice is also common among friends. It is rare to find the elderly using this form of address because they prefer to use pet or endearment names when addressing their children. This paper is mainly a semantic analysis of Xitsonga nicknaming and nicknames by bringing to the reader’s attention the circumstances that led to the names given to the referents.",,,The Journal of Social Sciences,,,,2016-12,2016,2017-10-11,2016-12,49,3-2,378-383,Closed,Article,"Chauke, M.

Colombia’s pro-startup policy seeks to attract investment from financial institutions in start-ups, as well as to promote a business culture in the country. One prominent feature in the country is the growth of start-ups in cities like Bogotá and Medellín, which are looking to become hubs for start-ups in the country and in Latin America.",,,Development Centre Studies,Start-up Latin America 2016,,,2016-10-20,2016,,2016-10-20,,,95-107,Closed,Chapter,OECD,OECD (),,OECD (),0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1088394476,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

The objective of this research was to investigate the principal lactic acid bacteria present during spontaneous malolactic fermentation of Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines and to study its role in BA formation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this relation has been reported for Chilean wines. Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from five wineries located in three Chilean geographical regions. Genotypic differentiation of each bacterial isolated was performed via a restriction fragment length polymorphism method using rpoB and 16S rRNA genes and HinfI, AciI and MseI enzymes. Sixty-five colonies were isolated and identified as lactic acid bacteria, identifying two species, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Oenococcus oeni. The predominant species was L. rhamnosus, which, to the best of our knowledge, we are describing for the first time in the vinification process. Considering that L. rhamnosus was detected in wineries from different geographical viticultural regions, it could be preliminarily considered as an endemic species. Both species were biogenic amines producers, L. rhamnosus being mainly responsible for biogenic amines present in the Cabernet Sauvignon wines studied.","This work is part of Karem Henríquez-Aedo thesis to obtain the degree of Doctor in Science and Analytical Technology from the University of Concepcion, Chile.

Among other applications, this problem is used in test-splitting, which consists in assigning several sets of questions into different questionnaires so that every one of these questionnaires contains one question from each one of the original sets. Questions have a weight associated, which typically corresponds to a measure of their difficulty, and the objective is to split the questions among the questionnaires in such a way that the weights are distributed as evenly as possible. We propose a hybrid genetic algorithm for solving this problem, which is then tested on a benchmark set of practically-sized instances.

Although some studies describe ethanol production from yeast, few reports describe its manufacturing from hemicelluloses sugars in stirred-tank fermenter under controlled conditions. Experimental assays were performed to evaluate the influence of aeration, agitation rate and initial pH on ethanol production using sugarcane bagasse hemicelluloses hydrolysate by Scheffersomyces stipitis NRRL Y-7124 and Scheffersomyces shehatae UFMG HM 52.2. Ethanol production from these two yeasts was favored by initial pH increase and agitation rate decrease. The maximum fermentative yield was attained by S. stipitis and S. shehatae yeasts at 100 RPM, initial pH 6.50 and under oxygen limited conditions (0.1 and 3.2 h−1). Yield, ethanol productivity and process efficiency in S. shehatae and S. stipitis were 0.42 and 0.16 g g−1, 0.25 and 0.1 g L−1 h−1 and 85 and 31%, respectively. It showed that S. shehatae presented the best ethanol production performance. The current study is the first report describing the influence of these variables on hemicelluloses hydrolysates under controlled conditions. It highlights these xylose-fermenting yeasts potential to produce ethanol from biomass.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to FAPESP (Processes nº 2008/57926-4 and 2011/01226-7), CNPq (Processes nº 483294/2013-6 and 304826/2013-8) and CAPES for financially supporting the current study.

The concentration plant is formed by several concentration stages interconnected within a particular arrangement. Currently, the selection of the flotation circuit is based on the experience of the designer, and is complemented by laboratory tests and simulations. In the literature there are many studies that design concentration plants using mathematical programming. However, these strategies use a non-convex MINLP model that is difficult to solve. For that reason, usually simple models and systems with fewer species are used.This paper presents a methodology for the design of a mineral concentration circuit based in two steps: 1) Identify the set of optimal structures using discrete values of stage recoveries and solving several mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems; 2) Determine the optimal design for each of the structures obtained in the previous step, using a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model (MINLP) and a rigorous model for the recovery at each concentration stage. This work is based on the assumption that there are little optimal structures within a given space of species recoveries at each stage. A case study is used to validate the proposal using a system with several species.",,,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,26th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2016,2016,,2016,38,,1461-1466,Closed,Chapter,"Cisternas, Luis A.; Acosta-Flores, Renato; Lucay, Freddy; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Cisternas, Luis A.

Observations were performed during four consecutive nights on the telescopes of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. As a result, polarization was detected in the V band at the level of −0.36 ± 0.087% and the star was found to be photometrically variable with a period ranging from five hours to about two days. Throughout the entire observing set the variability amplitude was constant and equal to about 10 ± 1 mmag. Non-zero circular polarization directly indicates that the white dwarf has a global magnetic field with a strength of 10 MG or higher.We interpret the photometric variations found in this study in terms of rotationally modulated variability of magnetic properties of the star’s atmosphere.",,,Astrophysical Bulletin,,,,2016-10,2016,2016-11-24,2016-10,71,4,475-478,Closed,Article,"Antonyuk, K.

Models describing the RO process are generally used for the simulation or design of industrial plant. However, none of the existing models in the related literature have been used to study the effect of the distribution of the input variable uncertainties on plant responses and the sensitivity of these, which is the objective of this work. The results indicate that the type of uncertainties of the input variables does not substantially influence on the model responses and on its sensitivity. In addition, the histogram associated with the permeate salt concentration has a similar behavior to the log-normal distribution, while the histogram of water recovery has a not known tendency. Finally, the results of this study indicate that global sensitivity analysis (GSA) can supplement modelling studies of RO plants.",,,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,26th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2016,2016,,2016,38,,1443-1448,Closed,Chapter,"Lucay, Freddy; Cisternas, Luis A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.","Lucay, Freddy (Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia Universidad de Antofagasta & CICITEM, Av.

Using recent direct imaging observations with the 0.8 m Infrared Imaging System (IRIS) of the Universitätssternwarte Bochum near Cerro Armazones in Chile, we demonstrate that the faint source 2MASS J00402651–5927168 at a projected angular separation ρ = 6.″35 is a common‐proper‐motion companion to Gl 29. Provided this source is not part of a further subsystem, the IRIS J ‐ and K s ‐band photometry either implies a spectral type of about L2, based on its absolute magnitude, or an approximate mass M B ≃ 0.077 M ⊙ , suggesting that it may even be a brown dwarf. Assuming a face‐on circular orbit this faint companion orbits Gl 29 in 1880 years. (© 2016 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The fly ashes from co-combustion of coal and pet coke in a Spanish Power Plant were used as raw material to replace clay to make fired bricks. The effect of fly ash with high replacing ratio (from 0 to 80%) of clay on properties of bricks was analysed. The specimens, cylinders with 32.5mm diameter and 50mm length, were manufactured by compressing at 10MPa. Different firing temperatures, 800, 900 and 1000°C, were studied. The fired bricks with high volume ratio of fly ash present a high compressive strength and a low water absorption capacity. With increase in firing temperature, the compressive strength increased and the water absorption decreased. With increase in replacing ratio, the compressive strength decreased and the water absorption ratio increased. The bricks no present environmental problems according to the leaching study.",,,Journal of Building Engineering,,,,2016-03,2016,,2016-03,5,,114-118,Closed,Article,"Leiva, C.; Arenas, C.; Alonso-fariñas, B.; Vilches, L.F.; Peceño, B.; Rodriguez-galán, M.; Baena, F.","Leiva, C.

However, the dependency among callbacks can make it difficult to understand and maintain pieces of code, which will mix concerns eventually. Unfortunately, current solutions for JavaScript do not fully address the aforementioned issue. This paper presents Sync/cc, a JavaScript library that uses continuations and aspects to allow developers to write asynchronous pieces of code in a synchronous style, preventing callback dependencies. Unlike current solutions, Sync/cc is modular, customizable, and succinct because it does not require special and scattered keywords, code refactoring, or adding ad-hoc implementations like state machines. In practice, Sync/cc uses a) continuations to only suspend the current handler execution until the asynchronous operation is resolved, and b) aspects to apply continuations in a non-intrusive way.",,,,Companion Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Modularity,,,2016-03-14,2016,2016-03-14,2016-03-14,,,79-82,Closed,Proceeding,"Leger, Paul; Fukuda, Hiroaki","Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan)",,"Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology)",2,0,,0.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023031051,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

The circuit solution on the location of the heat pump circuit in relation to the conventional power unit of condensing power station (CPS) with 300 MW capacity including arrangement of the evaporator on the service water pipe lines system and the heat pump condenser in the regeneration system of K-300-240-2 turbine plant of KhTGP is offered. The article describes results of numerical studies and analysis of the thermal efficiency performance of CPS with lithium - bromide absorption heat pump (LBAHP) for different energy efficiency ratios of the cycle. Characteristics of average annual changes for heat-economy figures of thermal power plant are given. Conclusion of the proposed circuit solutions utility is made.,"The work has been carried out in the framework of implementation of the project № 16-38-00280 «Increasing of condensing thermal power plants heat efficiency by using the heat pump in low-pressure recovery system», supported by the Grant from Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research. Taking into account the results obtained during the examination of the above circuit solution one can conclude as follows: •Connecting two low-pressure heaters (LPH) to the condensation circuit of absorption heat pumps (ABHP) should be performed during the summer season when there is no heating load on power unit or in cases when the technological cycle of power plant does not provide heating load. •The analysis of the average annual variations of thermal efficiency rate of the power station equipped with ABHP showed the tendency to increasing the absolute efficiency of the turbine plant as well as the whole power station by up to 0.6%, and reducing overall heat consumption for turbine installation - up to 91.42 kJ/(kW·h), and specific consumption of reference fuel - up to 4 g/(kW·h). •It was found that the greatest impact on the variations of heat efficiency performances of thermal power plants equipped with ABHP compared with a typical thermal power station is achieved when power station operates at energy efficiency ratio equal to 3.45 when using an absorption heat pump with two-stage regeneration of lithium bromide solution and the transformation ratio of 2.1.",,,"2016 2nd International Conference on Industrial Engineering, Applications and Manufacturing (ICIEAM)",,,2016-01-01,2016,,2016-01-01,,,1-4,Closed,Proceeding,"Skubienko, S.V.; Yanchenko, I.V.; Babushkin, A.

The various ways of measuring homophobia will also be examined, in order to identify the limitations of these tests and what they teach us about the phenomenon of homophobia. Using these as starting points, we will try to redefine homophobia as a complex system that brings together several concepts (heterosexism, sexual prejudice, heteronormativity, sexism and male dominance). This system-based definition of homophobia will lead to a more nuanced understanding of various situations involving discrimination, inequality and violence, and will uncover violent situations that remain hidden by the current understanding of homophobia.",,,Sexologies,,,,2016-11,2016,,2016-11,25,4,e65-e69,Closed,Article,"Fraïssé, C.; Barrientos, J.","Fraïssé, C.

313,pub.1030924540,10.1002/2016jc011796,,,On subsurface cooling associated with the Biobio River Canyon (Chile),"Abstract  Submarine canyons cutting across the continental shelf can modulate the cross‐shelf circulation being effective pathways to bring water from the deep ocean onto the shelf. Here, we use 69 days of moored array observations of temperature and ocean currents collected during the spring of 2013 and winter‐spring 2014, as well as shipboard hydrographic surveys and sea‐level observations to characterize cold, oxygen poor, and nutrient‐rich upwelling events along the Biobio Submarine Canyon (BbC). The BbC is located within the Gulf of Arauco at 36° 50'S in the Central Chilean Coast. The majority of subtidal temperature at 150 m depth is explained by subtidal variability in alongshore currents on the canyon with a lag of less than a day ( r 2 = 0.65). Using the vertical displacement of the 10° and 10.5°C isotherms, we identified nine upwelling events, lasting between 20 h to 4.5 days, that resulted in vertical isothermal displacements ranging from 29 to 137 m. The upwelled water likely originated below 200 m. Majority of the cooling events were related with strong northward (opposite Kelvin wave propagation) flow and low pressure at the coast. Most of these low pressure events occur during relatively weak local wind forcing conditions, and were instead related with Coastal Trapped Waves (CTWs) propagating southwards from lower latitudes. These cold, high‐nutrient, low‐oxygen waters may be further upwelled and advected into the Gulf of Arauco by wind forcing. Thus, canyon upwelling may be a key driver of biological productivity and oxygen conditions in this Gulf. 
Key Points    Moored observations collected in Central Chile show strong cooling events associated with a large submarine canyon   The majority of the deep temperature variability and cooling in the canyon is associated with northward flow events over the canyon rim   Most of the cooling events are not forced by local wind‐driven dynamics but the passage of southward propagating coastal trapped waves","FONDECYT grant 1130648 has supported this work.

It describes the importance of religious rituals performed by women as adaptation measures to erratic rainfall patterns. This study is motivated by observations that unpredictable rainfall has diverse impacts on food security in rural communities that still depend on subsistence economies to supplement food sources. Focus group discussions with 50 women aged between 35 and 78 years revealed that the women draw on cultural knowledge as subsistence crop producers. They depend on rain-making, seed-dressing and crop maintenance rituals to adapt to rainfall scarcity hazards such as drought. These measures ensure food self-sufficiency in the face of climate change.

These subtle brittle strain features that are ∼50 km above the subduction zone interface in the hyperarid Atacama Desert record deformation from the single earthquake sequence. In this study we document how ancient cracks, formed during thousands of plate boundary earthquake cycles, were reopened during the 2014 earthquake sequence. We show that crack orientations along the rupture length reflect deformation from the Mw 8.1 mainshock and from an Mw 7.7 aftershock 100 km to the south, as documented by displacements calculated from continuous geodetic observations. We suggest that cracks form during the passage of surface waves, and repeated opening and closing enhance crack aperture. The orientation and opening of the oldest cracks in the forearc are indicative of the modal or most common rupture area of major megathrust earthquakes in the region. While the long-term preservation of cracks may be limited to northern Chile, similar features likely form during strong earthquakes at other subduction zones and represent permanent forearc deformation.",,,Geology,,,,2016-04-08,2016,2016-04-08,2016-05,44,5,387-390,Closed,Article,"Scott, Chelsea P.; Allmendinger, Richard W.; González, Gabriel; Loveless, John P.","Scott, Chelsea P.

It applies a combinatorial search, in which the possible converter feeding sequences are evaluated using a greedy heuristic; the daily schedule is then constructed using the heuristically optimal sequence. Depending on the mode of operation, the objective may be to maximise copper production, maximise profits or control concentrate stockpiles. This combinatorial greedy approach has been incorporated within discrete event simulations, which mimic hundreds of days of operation, hence analysing alternate modes of operation.

Recognizing a traveler's transportation mode is not only critical to personal context awareness in related applications but also essential to urban traffic operations, transportation planning, and facility design. While most current practice often leverages infrastructure-based fixed sensors or a Global Positioning System (GPS) for traffic mode recognition, the emergence of the smartphone provides an alternative promising way with its ever-growing computing, networking, and sensing power. In this paper, we propose a GPS-and-network-free method to detect a traveler's travel mode using mobile phone sensors. Our application is built on the latest Android platform with multimodality sensors. By developing a hierarchical classification method with an online learning model, we achieve almost 100% accuracy in a binary classification of wheeled/unwheeled travel modes and an average of 97.1% accuracy with all six travel modes (buses, subways, cars, bicycling, walking, and jogging). Our system (a) could adapt to each traveler's pattern by using the online learning model, and it performs significantly faster in computation than the offline model, and (b) works with a low sampling frequency for sensing so that it saves the smartphone battery.",This work was supported by the Region 2 University Transportation Research Center.,,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2016-03-07,2016,2016-03-07,2016-10-01,17,10,2921-2934,Closed,Article,"Su, Xing; Caceres, Hernan; Tong, Hanghang; He, Qing","Su, Xing (Department of Computer Science, Graduate Center, The City University of New York, New York, NY, 10016, USA); Caceres, Hernan (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, 14260, USA); Tong, Hanghang (School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, USA); He, Qing (Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering and the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, 14260, USA)","He, Qing (University at Buffalo, State University of New York)","Su, Xing (The Graduate Center, CUNY); Caceres, Hernan (University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Tong, Hanghang (Arizona State University); He, Qing (University at Buffalo, State University of New York)",58,8,,12.46,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061658964,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

This is the first study of Pseudo-nitzschia species found in several blooms off the central coast of Peru. The cultures obtained and identified by scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of Pseudo-nitzschia subpacifica and P. pungens, the first record of P. subpacifica in Peruvian coastal waters. Neither P. subpacifica nor P. pungens cultures contained domoic acid (DA) in detectable amounts using HPLC–MS/MS. Our results suggest that Pseudo-nitzschia species are common off the central coast of Peru. The detection of non-toxic strains of Pseudo-nitzschia does not necessarily mean that other populations or strains of this genus in Peru cannot produce DA. Research is needed to evaluate other strains from different locations along the Peruvian coast and to explore whether environmental factors or genetic variability affect the production of DA.","This research was developed within the framework of a cooperation agreement between the Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE) and the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile.

The Central Composite Face approach and a quadratic model were applied to the experimental design. The optimal copper extraction conditions given by the above methodology were 20% (v/v) of [bmim][HSO4] in water, 100gL−1 chloride, and 90°C. The concentration of chloride and the temperature together exert a synergistic effect in enhancing chalcopyrite dissolution. Experimental data were fitted by multiple regression analysis to a quadratic equation and analyzed statistically. A model was developed for predicting copper extraction from CuFeS2 ore with variables such as Cl−, [bmim][HSO4], H2SO4 concentrations and temperature in the range studied.

Modifications detected in the streamflow regime of the Puelo River (41.5° S, Patagonia, Chile) in recent decades may affect the regularity of seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Reloncaví Fjord. We examined the occurrence/frequency of spring–summer and autumn phytoplankton blooms in Reloncaví Fjord with respect to seasonal and inter-annual changes in freshwater streamflows from 2003 to 2011. Surface chlorophyll-a derived from satellite-ocean colour and phytoplankton abundances revealed that significant recurrences of autumn phytoplankton blooms (> 2 mg Chl-a m−3, > 500 cell mL−1) were associated with historical low mean freshwater streamflows, mainly in autumn (< 350 m3 s−1). On the other hand, the occurrence of spring–summer blooms was related to high streamflows (> 470 m3 s−1) that increased mixing in the upper photic layer enough to enhance phytoplankton growth. Our findings imply that the intensity of autumn blooms in Reloncaví Fjord could be modulated by streamflow strength.",Associate Editor: Dr Brian Sorrell.,This research was funded by Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica [grant number FONDECYT 1141065] (J.L.

Moreover, leaching tests were applied to the fly ash and gypsum. The results obtained were evaluated with the requirements established in some European standards for commercial gypsum products. The fire resistance of the panels under study was found to be higher than that of commercial gypsum and they also showed good mechanical properties.",,,Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Construction Materials,,,,2016-09-06,2016,2016-09-06,2018-02,171,1,1-9,Closed,Article,"Leiva, Carlos; Arenas, Celia; Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé; Vilches, Luis F.; Peceño, Begoña; Luna-Galiano, Yolanda; Rodriguez-Galán, Mónica","Leiva, Carlos (Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Seville, Spain (corresponding author: )); Arenas, Celia (Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Seville, Spain); Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé (Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Seville, Spain); Vilches, Luis F.

The main aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the meaning behind the names of some places among the Vatsonga communities. Emerging villages in the form of extensions of the existing villages are receiving a considerable amount of attention with regard to patterns of their naming. The presence of these villages is important for the study of toponymy. The study is qualitative in nature and data was collected using the interview technique. A focus group of five participants in each of the ten villages was used. Therefore, the study reports the results of the investigations into these place names among Vatsonga communities. The analysis shows that behind every place name, there is a meaning which is humorous and symbolic in nature. The study was conducted in order to make recommendations on guidelines for naming process of the newly developed extensions of villages.",,,The Journal of Social Sciences,,,,2016-10,2016,2017-10-11,2016-10,49,1-2,18-25,Closed,Article,"Thembhani, Babane Morris","Thembhani, Babane Morris (MER Mathivha Centre for African Languages, Arts and Culture University of Venda , P.

The operation of identifying the root vertex of each of r weighted Bethe graphs to the vertices of a connected graph of order r is introduced as the -concatenation of a family of r weighted Bethe graphs. It is shown that the Laplacian eigenvalues (when F has arbitrary graphs) as well as the signless Laplacian and adjacency eigenvalues (when the graphs in F are all regular) of the -concatenation of a family of weighted Bethe graphs can be computed (in a unified way) using the stable and low computational cost methods available for the determination of the eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrices.

The main objective was to evaluate the efficiency of this technique for the removal of capillary-entrapped solution as a function of the following parameters or operational variables: electrode configuration, voltage applied, distance between electrodes, polarity reversal and intermittency of the applied voltage. The efficiency of this technique was compared to that of drainage by gravity, based on three indicators: moisture reduction, energy consumption per cubic meter of drained solution and drainage time factor, which allows a visualization of the reduction of drainage time in relation to natural drainage time by applying electroosmotic drainage. Of the three tested electrode configurations, hexagonal, linear and alternate linear, the last configuration with intermittency in applied voltage (12V) and a distance of 0.6m between electrodes gave the best results, with a moisture reduction of 2.02, an energy consumption of 6.7kWh/m3 and a drainage time factor of 6.45. Considering these results, it is demonstrated that the technology increases the spatial capacity of copper leaching and reduces the weight of the material to be transported.",,,Hydrometallurgy,,,,2016-08,2016,,2016-08,163,,148-155,Closed,Article,"Valenzuela, J.; Romero, L.; Acuña, C.; Cánovas, M.","Valenzuela, J.

We investigate the coseismic induced ionospheric total electron content (TEC) perturbations following the Mw 8.3 Illapel thrust earthquake that occurred on September 16, 2015. The continuous global positioning system (GPS) data at 48 sites from Centro Sismológico Nacional and International GNSS Service GPS networks have been used in this study. The nearest GPS site recorded the ionospheric response 10 min after the occurrence of this earthquake. The maximum vertical coseismic induced TEC amplitude is ~1.4 TECU, and the perturbations are pronounced in the northern region of the epicenter and confined to less than ~1500 km radius. The average horizontal acoustic wave velocity has been determined as ~1260 m/s.

These landslides were produced through a large mass movement at high speed by gravity across the trough floor. Although the triggering factors are unclear, several mechanisms have been proposed as, among others, large amounts of subsurface water, quake produced through normal faulting close to the canyon walls, and meteoritic impacts. In this work we examine the limit equilibrium slope stability of three landslides (placed respectively at Ius, Candor, and Melas Chasmata), which can be considered representative, with the aims of constraining their formation conditions. Our results suggest that external factors (as high pore fluid pressure, seismic loading or rock mass disturbance) do not seem necessary for the failure of slopes if they are composed of unconsolidated materials, while high pore water pressure or ground acceleration are needed to trigger slides in slopes composed of strong basaltic-like materials. Moreover, the presence of sub-surface ice would contribute to slope stability. As a whole, our findings point to ground shaking due to meteorite impacts as the main triggering force for most landslides in the Valles Marineris.","We thank the comments from James Dohm and an anonymous reviewer.

This uncertainty has a demonstrable impact on the mining lifecycle, and has motivated stochastic strategic mine planning algorithms. The current paper describes how these algorithms may be extended to consider mineral processing operations in conjunction with open-pit mining operations. In particular, the paper describes an effective way to incorporate variable concentrator feed grade into these algorithms, which is the first step toward more elaborate representations of mineral concentrators. The resulting framework will be able to connect geological data to alternate configurations of the downstream resources, hence comparing the benefit of each configuration, and the corresponding capital investments. Sample computations are presented, comparing the net present value and utilisation for several different mineral processing capacities.","Funding for the current work is provided by the Chilean government, through its FONDECYT – Iniciación programme for young researchers (Project N° 11140078).

Their populations recover slowly after major disturbances and massive mortalities, suggesting that dispersal from remnant populations is strongly limited. This low dispersal is also a factor that probably favours the speciation process. Understanding the limiting factors for spore dispersal is crucial. Here we evaluated 1. spore dispersal and spore dilution over distance, 2. if submersion in calm waters for a specific period of time is needed for the settlement of spores before exposure to water movement, and 3. duration of spore attachment ability. Results were consistent with the hypothesis of low-distance dispersal of spores: stained-spore dilution was high at short spatial scales (<4 m); spores settled quickly (1–2 min) even under constant water movement, but they lost the ability to attach rapidly (≤16 h). Water motion did not affect spore attachment to the substratum, a fact probably resulting from an adaptation to high energy intertidal habitats. The very low dispersal range of the spores may explain the strong genetic differentiation at small spatial scales, the speciation event that occurred within the Lessonia species complex and the slow recovery of L. berteroana after massive mortalities occurring with the 1982/1983 El Niño Southern oscillation event.",,,Botanica Marina,,,,2016-07-29,2016,2016-07-29,2016-08-01,59,4,283-289,Closed,Article,"Parada, Gloria M.; Tellier, Florence; Martínez, Enrique A.","Parada, Gloria M.

269,pub.1036840913,10.1002/hyp.10878,,,A review of classical dimensionless numbers for the Yusa problem based on discriminated non‐dimensionalization of the governing equations,"Abstract When the governing equations of a problem are known, the non‐dimensionalization of these equations (applied in their classical form) is a useful and widely used method that can be used to identify the dimensionless groups that rule the solution. However, neither this technique nor dimensional analysis necessarily provides the most precise solution in terms of the sought numbers. The use of discrimination, a qualitative rather than quantitative extension of the non‐dimensionalization method, has demonstrated notable advantages over the classical method because it invariably provides a more precise set of dimensionless groups. The basis for the correct application of discrimination depends on a deep understanding of the phenomena involved in the problem, particularly in complex (coupled) problems. In this paper, discriminated non‐dimensionalization is applied to investigate a mixed convection problem in porous media, the Yusa problem. The derived discriminate groups are compared with those already known in the literature and deduced by classical methods. A number of scenarios are numerically solved to check the reliability of the discriminated groups in contrast with classical groups.

In the austral spring seasons of 2008 and 2009 zooplankton samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises (CIMAR 14, CIMAR 15) in Patagonian fjords and channels of southern Chile between 46°S and 53°S. Zooplankton sampling was conducted at 82 stations with Bongo (60cm diameter, 300μm mesh size) and Tucker (1m2 diameter, 300μm mesh size) trawl nets. The paralarvae were preliminarily identified by morphology and pigment patterns. Subsequently, their identity was confirmed through mitochondrial DNA (16S rRNA and COIII) analysis comparing them with the common adult octopus species from Chile which also have planktonic paralarvae (Octopus mimus, R. fontaniana and Enteroctopus megalocyathus) by phylogenetic analysis. We obtained 12 octopus and 1 squid paralarvae in 2008 and 16 octopus and 1 squid paralarvae in 2009. The paralarvae were caught exclusively in areas with higher oceanic influence and were absent in areas with greater freshwater discharge and/or ice melting. Southern Chile is characterized by geomorphological discontinuity due to fragmentation of the south coast starting at 41°30‘S, where there is a large freshwater influence in estuaries promoting fjord-like characteristics. Thus, it is not surprising that cephalopod paralarvae were not found in such places, because they are stenohaline. Both morphometric and molecular data confirmed that 26 paralarvae belonged to R. fontaniana; one paralarva was identified as Enteroctopus megalocyahtus; Doryteuthis gahi and Onychoteuthidae were also collected. Our results expand the known range of cephalopod paralarvae to areas where they have never have been reported in the southern tip of Chile. The presence of paralarvae in these fjords supports the hypothesis of their use as spawning grounds for many species of squid and octopus of different families.","AcknowledgementsThis study was financed by projects CF14 08-02, CF15 09-03 and FONDECYT 3110152.",,Fisheries Research,,,,2016-01,2016,,2016-01,173,,175-182,Closed,Article,"Pardo-Gandarillas, M.

Evidence from a Big Mac Index Approach,"Rural leaders can point to low housing costs as a reason that their area should be competitive for business attraction. To what extent do rural housing costs offset transportation and other locational disadvantages in cost structures? The United States lacks information to systematically answer the question. We adapt a strategy employed by The Economist in exploring purchasing power parity: the Big Mac index. We gather information on Big Mac prices with a random sample of restaurants across the contiguous United States. We find that core metro counties exhibit slightly higher Big Mac prices than other counties, but that differences across the balance of the rural–urban continuum code are not significant, implying that costs in a metroadjacent county are not different than areas that are much more rural. We show that some groups of states exhibit lower prices, especially in the southeast. Furthermore, we test for the presence of spatial monopoly and find that distance to other MacDonald’s restaurants has some influence on price. Stores at a greater distance from their competitors tend to charge more, ceteris paribus. We also show our results are consistent with other localized estimates of living costs. Our general findings could help rural decision makers determine whether their area truly holds cost advantages for firms looking to relocate.",,,International Regional Science Review,,,,2016-05-27,2016,2016-05-27,2018-05,41,3,364-382,Closed,Article,"Loveridge, Scott; Paredes, Dusan","Loveridge, Scott (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA); Paredes, Dusan (Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)","Loveridge, Scott (Michigan State University); Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)",14,4,,3.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010954763,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,
261,pub.1053745854,10.1002/ppp.1904,,,Spatial Sampling Design in the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring Programme,"Prior to development of the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) programme, little attention was paid to formal spatial sampling designs for measuring active‐layer thickness (ALT). This omission made the accuracy of many data‐sets questionable, in part because spatial periodicities caused by landscape features such as ice‐wedge polygons and thaw lakes can significantly influence the depth of thaw. Early in the development of CALM's protocols, ALT was sampled in the continuous permafrost zone in northern Alaska and simulated by computer, to determine how ALT could be measured accurately. The simulated and field data‐sets were analysed by comparing the means, variances and frequency distributions obtained using four spatial sampling designs (random, systematic, systematic random and systematic stratified unaligned). By a small margin, systematic stratified unaligned sampling provided the most accurate results. Systematic designs can, however, provide adequate estimates of the statistical moments of ALT with significant savings in cost, time and ease of implementation. Based on these results, the CALM programme recommended use of 10 x 10, 100 x 100 or 1000 x 1000 m grids, with sampling intervals of 1, 10 and 100 m, respectively. Most probed CALM sites now employ this strategy, except in terrain with unusual landscape elements or other special constraints.

A maximum slip amounted to 10.4 m in the shallow part of the seismic source region centered 72 km northwest of the epicenter and generated a following tsunami inundated along the coast. In a gross sense, the rupture front propagated almost unilaterally to northward from the hypocenter at <2 km/s, however, in detail the spatiotemporal slip distribution also showed a complex rupture propagation pattern: two up-dip rupture propagation episodes, and a secondary rupture episode may have been triggered by the strong high-frequency radiation event at the down-dip edge of the seismic source region. High-frequency sources tends to be distributed at deeper parts of the slip area, a pattern also documented in other subduction zone megathrust earthquakes that may reflect the heterogeneous distribution of fracture energy or stress drop along the fault. The weak excitation of high-frequency radiation at the termination of rupture may represent the gradual deceleration of rupture velocity at the transition zone of frictional property or stress state between the megathrust rupture zone and the swarm area.","Teleseismic waveforms and the strong motion data from the networks; Antarctic Seismographic Argentinean Italian Network (AI), Canadian National Seismograph Network (CN), GEOSCOPE (G), Global Telemetered Seismograph Network (USAF/USGS, GT), Global Seismograph Network (GSN - IRIS/IDA, II), Global Seismograph Network (GSN - IRIS/USGS, IU), and Red Sismologica Nacional (C1) are downloaded through the IRIS-DMC.

However, this hypothesis was inferred only from molecular divergence times. Here, the ancestral distribution and dispersal routes are estimated by Bayesian analysis based on a new phylogeny including 38 specimens from the south‐eastern Pacific Ocean. Morphological data and molecular sequences of three mitochondrial genes (16S rRNA , COI and COIII ) are presented. The morphological data confirm that specimens newly acquired from off the coast of Chile comprise two species: Muusoctopus longibrachus and the poorly described species, Muusoctopus eicomar . The latter is here redescribed and is clearly distinguished from M. longibrachus and other closely related species in the region. A gene tree was built using Bayesian analysis to infer the phylogenetic position of these species within the species group, revealing that a large genetic distance separates the two sympatric Chilean species. M. longibrachus is confirmed as the sister species of Muusooctopus eureka from the Falkland Islands; while M. eicomar is a sister species of Muusoctopus yaquinae from the North Pacific, most closely related to the amphi‐Atlantic species Muusoctopus januarii . Molecular divergence times and ancestral distribution analyses suggest that genus Muusoctopus may have originated in the North Atlantic: one lineage dispersed directly southward to the Magellan region and another dispersed southward along the Eastern Pacific to the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The Muusoctopus species in the Southern Hemisphere have different phylogenetic origins and represent independent invasions of this region.","Acknowledgements We thank Sergio Letelier (MNHNCL, Santiago, Chile), Bernhard Hausdorf (ZNH, Hamburg, Germany), Paul Valentich‐Scott (SBMNH), Sadie Mills (NZOI, Wellington, New Zealand) and Bruce Marshall (Tepapa Tongarewa, Wellington, New Zealand) for their help with loans and access to specimens from their collections and Jorge Avilés for his help in the processing of the FIP 2005‐61 samples.

Après un bref historique de l’apparition du concept d‘homophobie et des autres concepts venus le préciser et le compléter au cours du temps, nous discuterons de leurs apports en termes d’encadrement et de définition du phénomène ainsi que les questions qu’ils posent en retour sur le concept. Dans le même sens, les différentes formes de mesures de l’homophobie sont examinées afin d’en repérer les limites et ce qu’elles nous apprennent sur le phénomène d’homophobie. À partir de ces éléments de réflexion, nous proposons de repenser l’homophobie comme un système complexe articulant plusieurs concepts (hétérosexisme, préjugé sexuel, hétéronormativité, sexisme et domination masculine). Ce système permettrait de développer une compréhension plus fine des diverses situations de discriminations, d’inégalités et de violences ainsi que de révéler des situations de violence qui sont encore laissées dans l’ombre par l’homophobie telle qu’elle est actuellement envisagée.The purpose of this article is to consider the concept of homophobia from a psychosocial perspective. After a brief history of the emergence of the concept of homophobia and other concepts that have emerged over time to clarify the idea, we will discuss what these concepts provide in terms of framing and defining the phenomenon, and the questions this framing and defining raise, in turn, about this concept. The various ways of measuring homophobia will also be examined, in order to identify the limitations of these tests and what they teach us about the phenomenon of homophobia. Using these as starting points, we will try to redefine homophobia as a complex system that brings together several concepts (heterosexism, sexual prejudice, heteronormativity, sexism and male dominance). This system-based definition of homophobia will lead to a more nuanced understanding of various situations involving discrimination, inequality and violence, and will uncover violent situations that remain hidden by the current understanding of homophobia.",,,Sexologies,,,,2016-07,2016,,2016-07,25,3,133-140,Closed,Article,"Fraïssé, C.; Barrientos, J.","Fraïssé, C.

The aim was to generate a deeper understanding of our roles as models for our students, and by using the methodology of the heart, we have joined our three voices of Latin American women researchers to describe the interpretative autoethnography and performative text as ways of researching in education, health, and psychology and its power as a tool for breaking the traditional academic discourse to connect with international audiences from our own biographies. We seek to show how social transformation can occur from the classroom and at the same time challenge the public higher education system that follows free market policies in this neoliberal world. Why use autoethnography? Because reflecting on our own practices through autoethnography allows us to get to know ourselves and at the same time appreciate our voices. Trends in educational research in Latin America have been strongly marked by colonization and dramatically influenced by the knowledge developed in the global north. We propose to put the south in our research by exploring our realities told through social stories of the heart.",,"Funding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","Cultural Studies, Critical Methodologies",,,,2016-06-28,2016,2016-06-28,2018-04,18,2,99-106,Closed,Article,"Ramírez-Pereira, Mirliana; Espinoza-Lobos, Michelle; Zapata-Sepúlveda, Pamela","Ramírez-Pereira, Mirliana (University of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Espinoza-Lobos, Michelle (Arturo Prat University, Iquique, Chile; Monash University, Victoria, Australia); Zapata-Sepúlveda, Pamela (University of Tarapacá, Arica, Chile)","Ramírez-Pereira, Mirliana (University of Chile)","Ramírez-Pereira, Mirliana (University of Chile); Espinoza-Lobos, Michelle (Arturo Prat University; Monash University); Zapata-Sepúlveda, Pamela (University of Tarapacá)",1,0,,0.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064037445,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",4 Quality Education

It uncovered pregnant learners’ non - attendance of school activities and absenteeism, their knowledge on Sexual Transmitted Infections and HIV, and the extent of their knowledge and use of preventative contraceptives. Using the survey strategy, data was collected from a sample 70 students (n = 70), using a questionnaire. Scales were computed by means of the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Correlational analyses on the relationships between variables were carried out through bivariate correlations. The results showed that a preponderance of teenagers between the ages of 16 to 19 became pregnant. It was further revealed that pregnancies were due to learners’ limited knowledge about, and use of contraceptives. The results further showed that pregnant learners experienced varying levels of discrimination among other learners, which made them consider quitting education. It was recommended on the basis of research findings that learners must be taught about the importance of using contraceptives to prevent early pregnancy and, consequently, the propensity of girls to drop out of school.",,,The Journal of Social Sciences,,,,2016-10,2016,2017-10-11,2016-10,49,1-2,134-144,Closed,Article,"Majozi, T.P.; Ige, K.D.; Tshabalala, N.G.","Majozi, T.P.

251,pub.1071704393,10.3920/jiff2015.0083,,,Habitats and nutritional composition of selected edible insects in Zimbabwe,"Edible insects are gaining recognition as food with potential of contributing to attainment of household food security. In sub-Saharan Africa, sustainable use of insects as food is threatened by lack of data on host plants and habitatassociations. In addition, lack of nutritional data on most edible insects reduces consumer confidence and limits integration of insect consumption with other food sources. This study was undertaken to review, collate and assembledispersed information of some edible insects of Zimbabwe. Data on species identities, host plants and habitats weregathered for 14 species from reputable literature sources and Bulawayo Natural History Museum records. In addition, nutritional assessments were carried out on 10 widely consumed insects in Zimbabwe. Standard ecological samplingprocedures were used to collect insect specimens. Proximate analyses were conducted following the Association of Official Analytical Chemists standard procedures using dried pulverised material. Majority (60%) of reviewedinsects had reliable host plants and habitats records. More than half of these were recorded in agro-ecosystems. On dry matter basis, protein content ranged from 22%(Gryllotalpa africana) to 55.4% (Gonimbrasia belina); fat content ranged from 10.8% (G. africana) to 41.6% (Macrotermes natalensis). Ash content was >10% in the ground dwellingG. africana (12.6%) andEulopida mashona larvae (10.9%). Wide species differences were recorded for carbohydrate content; 0.4% inM. natalensis and 47.2% inG. africana. Carbohydrates content was inversely relatedto protein and fat contents for all insects. Energy and fat contents were positively related in all the insects. Overall, insect species from this study have high proximate constituents that can match plant and animal products diets andcan be considered as potential viable alternative nutritious food sources. Findings from this study are expected to promote greater recognition of insects as food in Zimbabwe and encourage up-scaling of their sustainable utilisation.",,,Journal of Insects as Food and Feed,,,,2016-06-15,2016,2016-06-15,,2,3,189-198,Closed,Article,"Musundire, R.; Zvidzai, C.J.; Chidewe, C.; Samende, B.K.; Chemura, A.","Musundire, R.

We examined the relative importance of density dependence, winter sea surface temperature (SSTW) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on polychaete dynamics. All species studied showed conspicuous abundance oscillations, consistent with negative density-dependent population feedbacks. Model selection across a suite of population dynamic models showed that for six species, the best model included the effect of environmental variables, SSTW in the previous year, while the SOI index was the relevant variable in two polychaete species. A pure density-dependent model best explained the population dynamics of the remaining five species. Our results contrast with traditional approaches, which focus on the importance of abiotic factors in structuring marine benthic systems, and demonstrate the importance of theoretical synthesis and analysis to understand long-term dynamics in these ecosystems.","We dedicate this work to the memory of Dr. Franklin D. Carrasco, who passed away in December 2015. His passion and dedication to the study of marine benthic ecosystems allowed this pioneering monitoring program to be carried out.

Under geological uncertainty, existing algorithms generate plans that may violate the mineral processing capacity; under such geological scenarios, the excess ore undergoes a recourse action which is not as profitable as regular processing, hence decreasing the net present value. This decrease has previously been represented as a penalty on excess ore, which may not accurately represent actual operations. The new framework considers the most typical recourse: increasing the cut-off grade into the mineral process.

245,pub.1005946477,10.1002/oa.2512,,,"External Auditory Exostoses and its Relationship to Prehistoric Abalone Harvesting on Santa Rosa Island, California","Abstract  Bioarchaeological research among prehistoric Pacific Coast populations has shown that external auditory exostoses (EAE) are found in high frequencies. On California's northern Channel Islands archaeological research has demonstrated that there was an intense exploitation of red abalone ( Haliotis rufescens ), particularly between ~8000 and 3500 years ago. If the Island Chumash were free‐diving for red abalone in subtidal waters, EAE should be prevalent in prehistoric populations from Santa Rosa Island. We recorded the presence or absence, number, side and severity of EAE growths for 207 adult individuals from three time periods on Santa Rosa Island. Our results show that ~11% of the total population was affected, including 22.5% of males and ~3.4% of females. The incidence among females increases from 0% in the Early period, to 2.6% in the Middle period, and 6.8% in the Late period. Overall these are lower rates than those reported for other Channel Island and Pacific Coast sites. Given the relatively low percentage of Santa Rosa Islanders affected with EAE, red abalones may have been harvested primarily in shallow waters rather than the deeper subtidal zone. Our data suggest that gender differences in food procurement activities existed on Santa Rosa Island throughout prehistory, congruent with the argument that EAE is an activity‐induced pathology that occurs with prolonged exposure to cold water and wind conditions.

Plant-microorganism interaction, however, is another key facilitation mechanism of the nurse effect, but is by far the least documented. Here we tested if microclimatic mitigation and soil microorganisms isolated from the root-zone of the nurse shrub Porlieria chilensis can increase the establishment of other native plants in a semiarid community. We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the presence of P. chilensis on the survival and growth of three native plants. In the field experiment, we compared the survival and growth of transplanted individuals beneath nurses and outside of them in pots filled with soil from both microsites (beneath and outside nurses). Finally, in the greenhouse experiment we grew native plants in soil taken from both microsites (below and outside nurses) and with and without soil microorganisms (sterilization process). We found a clear and significant nurse effect of P. chilensis on the tested species through of amelioration of climatic (air temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation) and edaphic (nitrogen availability) conditions, increasing the performance of these native species. Moreover, performance and establishment were enhanced when soil was kept with microorganisms. Thus, nurse effect mediated by microclimatic amelioration, edaphic improvement and presence of soil microorganisms could be key mechanisms to increase the establishment of native plant species in semiarid communities of central Chile.",AcknowledgmentsThanks to Cristian Fardella and Angelica Riquelme for their support in the experiments.

We investigated the role of environmental forcing following a recent interannual decrease in larval supply in the Inner Sea of Chiloé (41–45°S) using direct observations and environmental time series over the period 2003–2014. To examine the temporal structure of larval supply and potential associations with environmental forcing (approximated using satellite chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature), we used wavelet analysis and lagged correlations to test the hypothesis of an association between larval availability and changes in the seasonal cycle of chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature, and relevant climate variability (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode). Our results indicate that a weakening in the annual cycle of chlorophyll-a concentration and abnormally cold sea surface temperature during 2009–2010 can be related to the observed disruption in larval supply to the Inner Sea of Chiloé starting during the 2010–2011 season. The potential influence of climate variability is further discussed as the spatial extent and temporal persistence observed suggest that other ecological processes might have also been affected, and consequently, we suggest a link to transient large-scale climatic forcing.","AcknowledgementsThe first author thanks the support from MECESUP through the national fellowship program.

Despite the special needs requirements, there is consensus among researchers that access to library services by students with disabilities is not yet fully available, especially in countries in the global periphery. This study utilised quantitative data collected through questionnaires directed to 92 disabled students registered for the 2013 academic year, an interview with the librarian responsible for the disabled students unit and observation using the IFLA checklist for access to libraries for disabled people to evaluate the convenience and accessibility of library services for students with disabilities at the University of Limpopo in South Africa. Even though the study established that a purpose-built library service unit for students with disabilities that complies with international best practice was in place, students with disabilities were not adequately satisfied with the library services they received as very few library materials had been transcribed into accessible formats. The situation was compounded by the fact that only one librarian was assigned to manage and run the library services for the disabled. The study recommends that the university should hire more librarians to assist students with disabilities in the audio-braille library. It is hoped that the study will stimulate policy makers to include students with disabilities in information access and collection development policies.

Projected future changes for the krill habitat include a sustained increase in ocean temperature and changes in sea ice and chlorophyll a . Here we investigate how these factors affect the early life history of krill and identify the regions around Antarctica where the impact will be greatest. Our tool is a temperature‐dependent krill growth model forced by data from comprehensive greenhouse warming simulations. We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a strong impact on the already declining adult populations with consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological and commercial ramifications. 
Key Points    Sustained increase in ocean temperature and changes in seasonal expansion of sea ice   Krill habitat is projected to change under different scenarios of chlorophyll a   Localized regions will support future krill spawning and recruitment by the end of this century","This research was funded by the Yale Climate and Energy Institute at Yale University.

As dietary lipid quality is crucial for membrane function, we predicted that supplementing Argopecten purpuratus broodstock with essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during gonadal maturation would mitigate the loss in adult performance while favoring that of larvae. Scallops were fed during reproductive conditioning with microalgal diets with high and low PUFA contents, while a control group was maintained in natural conditions. After maturation, scallops of each treatment were kept at normal temperature (18 °C) or stressed by increasing the temperature (+6 °C). Mature scallops fed each diet were stimulated to spawn, and the ensuing larvae were exposed to handling and thermal stress. Relative transcription of hsp70 mRNA was assessed by RT-qPCR, and HSP70 proteins were quantified by ELISA. Feeding a high-PUFA diet during reproductive conditioning enhanced HSP70 induction (at transcription and protein levels) by mature A. purpuratus in response to thermal stress. By contrast, neither scallops matured in the natural environment nor those fed the low-PUFA diet increased HSP70 levels after thermal stress; hsp70 mRNA levels were also reduced. Offspring from broodstock fed a high-PUFA diet increased induction of HSP70 after exposure to handling and handling plus thermal stress relative to offspring of scallops fed a low-PUFA diet. Survival of these larvae was also enhanced. Feeding adult scallops with appropriate PUFA during reproductive conditioning could improve adult stress responses and favor stress responses and survival of ensuing larvae.",We gratefully acknowledge Germán Lira from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance.

The main objective is to find a set of optimal flotation circuit configurations, including the best metallurgical conditions for the process and cell design. The optimization process maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV). This methodology consists of two steps. The first step of the methodology entails obtaining data from the laboratory. Different metallurgical conditions are tested for different flotation stages. Each metallurgical condition is evaluated to determine its kinetics. The second step of the methodology is the optimization process. The optimization process achieves the best solution by optimizing cell design, flotation circuit structure and metallurgical conditions. The optimization process has three phases. The first phase assumes that every flotation stage has the same residence time and calculates feasible flotation circuits, metallurgical conditions and cell volumes. This process is performed for several residence times and, therefore, a set of feasible solutions is generated. The second phase takes the previous set of feasible solutions and calculates the residence time at each flotation stage. Then, for each phase two solution, the optimal flotation circuit, metallurgical conditions and cell design are calculated. The final product is a set of optimal solutions than can be considered for further study. The procedure is illustrated by the design of a zinc flotation plant, considering seven flotation stages and five species.",Financial support from CSIRO ICE Chile and CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2016-10,2016,,2016-10,96,,157-167,Closed,Article,"Calisaya, Daniel A.; López-Valdivieso, Alejandro; de la Cruz, Marcos H.; Gálvez, Edelmira E.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Calisaya, Daniel A.

In this study, the allocation of phenolic compounds (phlorotannins) was examined in relation with the longitudinal patterns of photosynthesis (as 14C fixation and chlorophyll fluorescence) and storage of carbohydrates (mannitol and laminaran) in the blades. Moreover, exposures to UV radiation were carried out in order to test the photoprotective role of phlorotannins along different blade regions. The content of soluble phlorotannins was higher in the basal regions than in the middle and apical parts, which was correlated with the longitudinal allocation of mannitol and light-independent 14C fixation, two indicators of growth activity. In contrast, photosynthetic 14C fixation and allocation of laminaran were inversely related to the levels of phlorotannins along the blade. The photosynthetic characteristics measured using Imaging-PAM fluorescence did not show clear intra-blade patterns. UV exposures resulted in a decline in chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) after 24 and 48 h (10 and 20 % respectively); however, no differential effects in different regions of the fronds were observed. The content of soluble phlorotannins in response to UV radiation was mostly determined by the time of exposure and less by the blade region: After a 6-h exposure phlorotannins decreased around 40 %, while after 48 h UV radiation stimulated the synthesis of phlorotannins by 22–99 %. Overall, after a 12-h UV exposure an increasing tendency of phlorotannins allocated in the basal regions of the blade was demonstrated. This study reinforces the idea that phlorotannins are important not only as secondary metabolites, but also their allocation in the thallus of kelps is integrated within the morpho-functional characteristics related to photosynthesis and biomass formation.","This study was supported by CONICYT—Chile (FONDECYT 1130582 to PH and FONDECYT 1030343 to IG).

To approach Cojinoba larviculture, an experimental Artemia enrichment emulsion, containing docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )/eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) = 2.5, supplemented with vitamin E, astaxanthin, and β‐glucan, was evaluated in both Artemia and Cojinoba larvae, 30–50 d.a.h. This study tested an experimental enrichment emulsion versus a commercial emulsion, with an integral approach of multicompound emulsions. After 23 h enrichment, experimental emulsion ( EE )‐enriched nauplii reached DHA and EPA concentrations of 23.8 and 18.7 mg/g dry weight (dwt), respectively, while in Cojinoba larvae they were 18.4 and 19.7 mg/g dwt. Control emulsion (CE)‐enriched nauplii exhibited lower DHA and EPA (6.1 and 7.7 mg/g dwt), while only DHA decreased in the control larvae (12.6 mg/g dwt). Vitamin E was higher in EE ‐enriched nauplii (29.2 mg/100 g dwt) than in the control (8.4 mg/100 g dwt). Larvae fed EE ‐enriched Artemia exhibited 8% increase in survival and 19% in growth compared with the control. Astaxanthin was detected only in larvae fed EE ‐enriched nauplii. The tumor necrosis factor‐α concentration was not significantly different between larvae fed EE ‐ and CE ‐enriched nauplii. EE looks promising as an Artemia enrichment and experimental diet to assess palm ruff larval requirements, and has a positive impact on fish larvae performance.","This work was financed by Project FONDEF (D09E1256) and PhD scholarship CONICYT (21110024).

This paper presents an architecture, called ASHYI, for dynamic adaptive activity planning, and ASHYI-EDU, an application of ASHYI for the educational domain. ASHYI-EDU can automatically create a learning plan for students, according to their specific characteristics, assign remedial activities if students need to reinforce some concepts, and it can update those plans if the student profile or its context change. ASHYI-EDU was implemented as a virtual learning environment (VLE) prototype, and was utilized during two semesters to teach an online course. The results suggest that, although teachers need to invest more time to create learning activities for heterogeneous students, ASHYI-EDU effectively assigns the most alike activities to each student and it also addresses student shortcomings through remedial activities.","This paper is part of the project “ASHYI: Plataforma basada en agentes para la planificación dinámica, inteligente y adaptativa de actividades aplicada a la educación personalizada”, executed by the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, cofinanced by Colciencias, project #1203-569-33545.",,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Computer Supported Education,"Susan Zvacek, Maria Teresa Restivo, James Uhomoibhi, Markus Helfert",,2016-02-11,2016,2016-02-11,2016,583,,112-131,Closed,Chapter,"Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime; Uribe-Rios, Mery Yolima; Barrera-León, Luisa Fernanda; Mejia-Molina, Nadia Alejandra; Carrillo-Ramos, Angela; Pomares, Alexandra; González-Vargas, Juan Camilo; Brijaldo, Monica; Sabogal, Martha; Vicari, Rosa; Fabregat, Ramon; Martin, Hervé","Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia; Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Uribe-Rios, Mery Yolima (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Barrera-León, Luisa Fernanda (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Mejia-Molina, Nadia Alejandra (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Carrillo-Ramos, Angela (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Pomares, Alexandra (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); González-Vargas, Juan Camilo (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Brijaldo, Monica (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Sabogal, Martha (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Vicari, Rosa (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil); Fabregat, Ramon (University of Girona, Girona, Spain); Martin, Hervé (Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France)","Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Catholic University of the North)","Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Catholic University of the North); Uribe-Rios, Mery Yolima (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Barrera-León, Luisa Fernanda (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Mejia-Molina, Nadia Alejandra (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Carrillo-Ramos, Angela (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Pomares, Alexandra (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); González-Vargas, Juan Camilo (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Brijaldo, Monica (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Sabogal, Martha (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Vicari, Rosa (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul); Fabregat, Ramon (University of Girona); Martin, Hervé (Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory)",1,0,,0.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033055998,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education

We tested the null hypothesis of monogamy in a northern Caribbean population. In the Florida Keys, shrimps did not inhabit host individuals in pairs with a frequency greater than expected by chance alone. Hermaphrodites inhabited sponges solitarily and often brooded embryos. Hermaphrodites do not store sperm and need to be inseminated shortly after molting to fertilize a new batch of eggs. Thus, males and/or other hermaphrodites are likely switching among host individuals in search of sexual partners. Field experiments demonstrated low shrimp host fidelity. Host residence time was ~2 times shorter for males than for hermaphrodites. We inferred a polygynandrous mating system in L. pederseni from the Florida Keys, with male-role and young hermaphrodites often moving among sponges in search of older, more sedentary, female-role hermaphrodites. We expected shrimps to use water-borne chemical cues originating from conspecifics or sponges to locate sexual partners. Experiments demonstrated that shrimps were attracted to water-borne cues originating from sponges but not conspecifics. We have described the mating system of a reef-associated shrimp in a fast-pace shifting seascape increasingly dominated by sponges and vanishing stony corals. In the central and southeastern Caribbean Sea, with greater coral cover and lower sponge abundance than in the Florida Keys, the same species is monogamous. Whether or not similar shifts in the social organization of other coral reef-dwelling marine organisms are occurring due to contemporary changes in seascapes is a relevant topic that deserves further attention.",We sincerely thank Kylie Smith and M.

Most of the evidence comes from funerary contexts and artifact typologies, but there are very few systematic zooarchaeological studies from which to understand this process. Considering the importance of marine and coastal resources for communities who inhabited this area in terms of subsistence and social organization, in this paper we analyze ichthyoarchaeological evidence from the Zapatero site (Antofagasta region of Chile), one of the most important Middle Holocene sites of the Taltal area. Our evidence shows a specialized maritime adaptation based on the exploitation of different fish resources from the area, but at the same time an important intensification in the harvesting of one specific taxon, the jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi. Through this systematic ichthyoarchaeological analysis, we reflect on the historical process of adaptation of local communities to the driest coastal desert in the world.","AcknowledgementsThis research has been funded by Proyecto FONDECYT 1110196 and Proyecto FONDECYT 1151203.

Two types of sampling were designed. For gay men, a type of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was used. In the case of the MtF transgender sample, snowball sampling was used. The final sample consists of 437 participants who are gay men (N = 325) and MtF transgender individuals (N = 112), with ages ranging from 18 to 64 years (M = 30.82, SD = 9.81) for gay men and from 18 to 75 years (M = 36.22, SD = 10.37) for MtF transgender individuals. The sociodemographic profile of the sample shows differential patterns revealing that MtF transgender individuals are in a more unfavorable position. There is a statistically significant difference in SISD scores between the gay men and MtF transgender individuals [t (435) = −2.48; p < 0.05; d = 0.26].

The oldest grains, with crustal residence ages of 3.8–4.0 Ga, are consistent with complete recycling of existing continental crust around 4 Ga. We confirm three major Archaean, Palaeoproterozoic (Transamazonian) and late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic crust‐addition phases as well as six igneous phases during Proterozoic to Palaeozoic time involving mixing of juvenile and crustally reworked material. A late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic, Grenville‐age igneous belt can be postulated along the palaeo‐margin of South America. This belt was the basement for later magmatic arcs and accreted allochthonous microcontinents as recorded by similar crustal residence ages. Crustal reworking likely dominated over juvenile addition during the Palaeozoic era, and Proterozoic and Archaean zircon was mainly crustally reworked from the eroding, thickened Ordovician Famatinian arc.","This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; grants AU 189/3 and WI 847/9).

The security of the proposed cryptosystem is based on the combination of DNA encoding, a compression process using a hyperelliptic curve over a Galois field GF2p$$GF\left( 2^{p}\right) $$, and coding via an algebraic geometric code built using a Hermitian curve on a Galois field GF22q$$GF\left( 2^{2q}\right) $$, where p>2q$$p> 2q$$. The proposed cryptosystem resists the newest attacks found in the literature because there is no linear relationship between the original data and the information encoded with the Hermitian code. Further, the work factor for such attacks increases proportionally to the number of possible choices for the generator matrix of the Hermitian code. Simulations in terms of BER and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are included, which evaluate the gain of the transmitted data in an AWGN channel. The performance of the DNA/AG cryptosystem scheme is compared with un-coded QPSK, and the McEliece code in terms of BER.

Three approaches for studying information flows among non‐synchronous markets are applied: cointegration techniques, vector autoregressive analysis and multiple regression proposed. Although comparable underlying assets are traded in the four markets, our results indicate that no long‐run links exist among them. ZCE is by far the most endogenous market, and Euronext/Liffe is the most exogenous one. Finally, the model points to KCBT as the most influential and sensitive wheat market. Our findings indicate that the relative openness of the SAFEX wheat market supports information flows and linkages from KCBT and Euronext/Liffe. Therefore, our results suggest that more supportive policies to incentivise higher wheat production in South Africa are required to mitigate the impact of price shocks emanating from the global wheat markets.",,"The authors are thankful for support by the European Commission under the Erasmus Mundus Action 2 programmes.

This paper studies 351 small and medium enterprises in the Antofagasta Region in Chile between 2007 and 2008, where multinational and public mining companies are the drivers of the local economy and the government is promoting the formation of a mining cluster. Structural equation model is used to show that first-tier small and medium enterprise mining suppliers, directly related to large corporations, follow business practices that promote international certification, quality control, and investment in innovation, while in contrast second-tier small and medium enterprises are more focused on avoiding insolvency and client orientation. These results cast doubt on the formation of a mining cluster in the region and suggest the need for differentiated policies in these two groups of small and medium enterprises, especially those related to knowledge transfer.",,,"Environment and Planning.

Diverse epifaunal communities inhabit kelp sporophytes and are subject to variations in the physical environment and to changes experienced by the kelp habitat itself. We assessed seasonal variations in epifaunal invertebrate communities inhabiting giant kelps, Macrocystis pyrifera , and their effects on this seaweed. Six seasonal samplings were conducted over a year at an upwelling‐dominated site in northern‐central Chile where physical conditions are known to fluctuate temporally. More than 30 taxa were identified, among which peracarid crustaceans stood out in both diversity and abundance. Species richness and abundance differed among sporophyte sections (holdfast and fronds) and throughout the year. The frond community was dominated by two grazers (the amphipod Peramphithoe femorata and the isopod Amphoroidea typa ), while suspension feeders, grazers, and omnivores (the amphipod Aora typica , the isopod Limnoria quadripunctata, and polychaetes) dominated the holdfasts. Abundances of the dominant species fluctuated throughout the year but patterns of variation differed among species. The most abundant grazer ( P. femorata ) had highest densities in summer, while the less abundant grazer ( A. typa ) reached its peak densities in winter. Interestingly, the area of kelp damaged by grazers was highest in autumn and early winter, suggesting that grazing impacts accumulate during periods of low kelp growth, which can thus be considered as ‘vestiges of herbivory past.’ Among the factors determining the observed seasonal patterns, strong variability of environmental conditions, reproductive cycles of associated fauna, and predation by fishes vary in importance. Our results suggest that during spring and early summer, bottom‐up processes shape the community structure of organisms inhabiting large perennial seaweeds, whereas during late summer and autumn, top‐down processes are more important.","We thank Andrés Jofré, Angelika Graiff, Fabián Ramírez, Miren Altuna, Lucía Barahona, Juan Carlos González, Germán Penna, and specially David Jofré for their enthusiastic support and unconditional help during the field samplings.

225,pub.1002379210,10.1108/ijwis-09-2015-0028,,,Tukuchiy: a dynamic user interface generator to improve usability,"Purpose
                    This paper aims to present a detailed description of Tukuchiy, a framework to dynamically generate adapted user interfaces. Tukuchiy is based on Runa-Kamachiy, a conceptual integration model that combines human–computer interaction (HCI) standards to create user interfaces with user-centered concepts usually addressed by adaptation.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The first step was the definition of three profiles: user, context and interface. These profiles contain information, such as user disabilities, location characteristics (e.g. illumination) and preferences (e.g. interface color or type of system help). The next step is to define the rules that ensure usability for different users. All of this information is used to create the Tukuchiy framework, which generates dynamic user interfaces, based on the specified rules. The last step is the validation through a prototype called Idukay. This prototype uses Tukuchiy to provide e-learning services. The functionality and usability of the system was evaluated by five experts.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    To validate the approach, a prototype of Tukuchiy, called Idukay, was created. Idukay was evaluated by experts in education, computing and HCI, who based their evaluation in the system usability scale (SUS), a standard usability test. According to them, the prototype complies with the usability criteria addressed by Tukuchiy.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    This work was tested in an academic environment and was validated by different experts. Further tests in a production environment are required to fully validate the approach.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    Tukuchiy generates adapted user interfaces based on user and context profiles. Tukuchiy uses HCI standards to ensure usability of interfaces that dynamically change during execution time. The interfaces generated by Tukuchiy adapt to context, functionality, disabilities (e.g. color blindness) and preferences (usage and presentation) of the user. Tukuchiy enforces specific HCI standards for color utilization, button size and grouping, etc., during execution.","The authors thank the Systems Engineering and Computing Masters program from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana for the funding provided for this project.

Moreover, cultures naturally develop their own systems of healing, grounded in traditional practices. Western psychology and psychiatry have, through globalisation and colonial histories, imposed systems of mental health care and definitions of mental illness. In doing so, local understandings and ways of being regarding mental health have often been eclipsed. This is no less true in Namibia. However, much of the existing mental health literature from Namibia explores mental illness from a Western lens of psychopathology. This article discusses the relevant research about mental illness in Namibia and situates this within related literature from other Southern African countries. Several cultural factors across diverse groups in Namibia are important to more fully understand what mental illness and treatment are throughout this country. The cultural role of diverse conceptualisations of mental illness is discussed in order to explore potential areas of growth in Namibian mental health and intervention. The nature of traditional healing in other Southern African contexts is also addressed, given that although traditional healing exists in Namibia, researchers have not yet explored it within the context of psychological distress. Recommendations for mental health and psychological treatment in Namibia are discussed.",,,Psychology and Developing Societies,,,,2016-02-17,2016,2016-02-17,2016-03,28,1,101-125,Closed,Article,"Bartholomew, Theodore T.","Bartholomew, Theodore T.

The objective of this paper is to present and compare two methods for locating water depots along the road network so that penalty costs for the lack of humidity in roads and routing costs are minimized. Because the demands are located on the arcs of the network and the arcs require service more than once in a time horizon, this problem belongs to the periodic capacitated arc routing domain. We compare two methods for finding the initial depot location. We then use an exchange algorithm to modify the initial location and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to modify the initial routing of vehicles.

These differences result from the lengthy historical presence of Islam in Eurasia and its over two centuries long state management first by the Russian Orthodox empire, and then by the Soviet atheist state. Islam made its inroads into what later became known as Russia in the seventh century AD during the period when most proto-Russians1 were still pagans. Islamic beliefs and practices were therefore directly involved, along with Byzantine and Khazar influences, in the formation of Russian cultural, social, and political norms. In the early medieval period Russia’s southern lands experienced a creeping Islamization resulting from proto-Russia’s commercial and military engagements with her more militarily and economically advanced Muslim neighbors, the Volga Bulgaria, in particular. The spread of Islam was facilitated by proto-Russia’s Eurasian location and her largely flat landscape, dominated by steppes and lacking natural geographical boundaries with both Europe and Asia. In the tenth century, the official adoption of Orthodox Christianity by Russian rulers changed the nature of Russian state’s relations with Islam. In the sixteenth century, the continuing territorial expansion of the Orthodox Russian state, including its conquest of the Islamic Kazan Khanate and other Genghizid principalities, shifted the geopolitical balance of power in Eurasia in her favor. In the eighteenth century the Russian empire2 annexed Muslim Crimea and imposed its control over the Kazakh Small Horde.",,,The Modern Muslim World,Muslim Minority-State Relations,Robert Mason,,2016,2016,,2016,,,107-132,Closed,Chapter,"Yemelianova, Galina M.","Yemelianova, Galina M.

In the Atacama Desert, north central Chile, coastal archaeological sites show that during the Middle Holocene people relied mostly on marine resources. However, evidence from one of the shell middens (Zapatero – 7400–5900cal BP) indicates that not only were shallow waters and marine mammals exploited, but that a dedicated fishery for large pelagic fish (mainly billfish) existed; with indications suggesting that large swordfish, weighing up to 300kg, were being caught and brought back complete to the settlement. Although the peculiar topographic and oceanographic features of the area probably allowed pelagic fish to come well inshore, this is still the oldest evidence worldwide for such a fishery. These results provide new insights into maritime adaptation and seafaring along the Chilean coast from as early as the sixth millennium BCE.","AcknowledgmentsThis collaborative work was financed by the project FONDECYT 1110196.

Drawing together insights on world literature, globalization and locality, and experimental writing in South Africa, my reading of Untitled demonstrates how the subject position of the main character, like the novel itself, emerges at the crossroads of different forms as they circulate among multiple localities. Analyzing how the novel experiments with narrative, form, punctuation, and subject formation in relation to African literary imaginaries, I suggest that the poetics of Untitled inscribe a (black) feminine subject position against dominant narrative conventions of gendered violation and within the interstices of globality and locality.",,,ariel A Review of International English Literature,,,,2016,2016,,2016,47,1,281-310,Closed,Article,"Sweet, Paige","Sweet, Paige (Paige Sweet is currently an Andrew W.

It requires a change of paradigm concerning development. Development cannot be seen as the “place” of the so-called developed countries; neither can development be seen as a “ladder” that developing countries should climb. A notion of inclusive development is sketched by combining normative, theoretical-factual, prospective, and propositional approaches. Such issues are related with ongoing changes in universities. The models of the Humboldtian university and the entrepreneurial university are discussed, particularly in relation to the Global South. It is argued that different models are needed in order to contribute to overcoming knowledge-based inequality and underdevelopment. The tradition of the Latin American University Reform is recalled. The concept of Developmental University is reconsidered and refined in a National Innovation Systems perspective.

213,pub.1003331506,10.1007/s00227-016-2962-3,,,Epibiont load causes sinking of viable kelp rafts: seasonal variation in floating persistence of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera,"Abstract Floating seaweeds serve as dispersal agents for various organisms, but their survival at the sea surface may be compromised by physiological stress and epibiont overgrowth. Most previous experiments have been conducted in laboratory mesocosms where epibiont colonization is limited, but in their natural environment floating seaweeds are frequently overgrown by epibionts, which might negatively affect seaweeds or even cause their sinking. To test this hypothesis, we conducted field experiments in northern-central Chile (30°S) with floating giant kelps Macrocystis pyrifera to determine the time until sinking, epibiotic bryozoan load, and their physiological status across different seasons. Floating sporophytes persisted for at least 4 weeks at the sea surface and sank in all seasons after bryozoan loads exceeded 40 % of the raft biomass. At the time of sinking, the kelp rafts were physiologically viable and biomass losses were relatively minor. In autumn, kelp rafts stayed afloat for an average of 41 days (maximum: 52 days) during moderate environmental conditions (cool water temperature and moderate solar radiation) and slow growth of epibionts. However, higher water temperatures in summer seemed to enhance the growth of epibiotic bryozoans but not the growth of M. pyrifera, causing earlier sinking. The results indicate that the high growth rates of encrusting bryozoans provoke sinking of the kelp rafts, representing the first demonstrated case of epibiont-induced sinking of otherwise healthy floating seaweeds. Increasing global temperatures may enhance epibiont growth and thereby suppress the dispersal potential of floating seaweeds, even of species known for their high acclimation potential to the conditions at the sea surface.","We are very grateful to David Pfender, David Jofré, Miguel Penna, German Penna, Freddy González, André-Philippe Drapeau Picard, and Lorena Jorquera for their help during the experiments.

We examined 14 early to mid-Miocene paleosols exposed in the El Tesoro Mine, near Calama, Chile. The paleosols developed on an aggrading alluvial fan system, and lie above the mineralized gravel horizons that host a copper ore body. Soil-forming conditions that oscillated between chemical weathering and clay production (humid: analogous to modern Alfisols) to environments favoring the accumulation of pedogenic carbonate (arid to semi-arid: analogous to modern Aridisols) are indicated. In contrast, the region is presently hyperarid, and soils accumulate sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates. While total chemical analyses clearly show the accumulation of Ca by the carbonate-rich paleosols, none of the soils exhibit significant losses of elements by leaching. The δ18O values of the carbonates range from -8.79‰ to −3.16‰ (VPDB). The O isotope data, when combined with published data from the region, reveal a significant divergence in the O isotope composition of precipitation in the eastern and western margins of the Andean plateau since the early Miocene, suggesting that simple interpretations of declining δ18O values of carbonate with increasing elevation may not be appropriate. These paleosols clearly indicate that wetter conditions prevailed in what is now the Atacama Desert during the early to mid-Miocene.","We gratefully acknowledge the mine access, support, and survey work of Compania Minera El Tesoro, support from NSF Geobiology and Low Temperature Geochemistry program, and the University of California Agricultural Experiment Station.

211,pub.1059920767,10.1093/mnras/stw2526,,,On the local stellar populations,"We present a study of the local stellar populations from a volume-complete all-sky survey of the about 500 bright stars with distances less than 25 pc and down to main-sequence effective temperatures Teff ≥ 5300 K. The sample is dominated by a 93 per cent fraction of Population I stars, only 22 sources (5 per cent) are Population II stars, and 9 sources (2 per cent) are intermediate-disc stars. No source belongs to the halo. By following the mass of the stars instead of their light, the resulting subset of 136 long-lived stars distributes as 22 (16.2 per cent):6 (4.4 per cent):108 (79.4 per cent) for the Population II:intermediate disc:Population I, respectively. Along with the much larger scaleheight reached by Population II, this unbiased census of long-lived stars provides plain evidence for a starburst epoch in the early Milky Way, with the formation of a massive, rotationally supported, and dark Population II. The same conclusion arises from the substantial early chemical enrichment levels, exemplified here by the elements magnesium and iron, as it arises also from the local Population II white dwarfs. The kinematics, metallicity distribution functions, star formation rates, age–metallicity relations, the inventory of young stars, and the occurrence of blue straggler stars are discussed. A potentially new aspect of the survey is the possibility for substructure among the local Population II stars that may further subdivide into metal-poor and metal-rich sources.","This work has made extensive use of the Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS4) of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut at Heidelberg, Germany, the ESA Hipparcos catalogue, NASA&#x27;s ADS bibliographic service, and the CDS SIMBAD data base, operated at Strasbourg, France; based on observations collected at the Centro Astronómico Hispano Alemán (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck Institut für Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (CSIC); based on observations in Chile at the Universitätssternwarte Bochum near Cerro Armazones and the La Silla Paranal Observatory under ESO programmes ID 092.A-9002(A) and 096.A-9009(A).

In the present work, we test this notion through a comparison of Middle Period human isotopic data (δ13Cco, δ15Nco, and δ13Cap) representing two distinct ayllus, Solcor and Tchecar, in the San Pedro de Atacama oases. We employ Bayesian mixture modeling of individual-level isotopic data to quantify and compare dietary composition within and between the cemetery populations of these two contemporary locales. Ultimately, our research shows that dietary diversity, which we take as a proxy for differential levels of participation in long-distance exchange or the access to the products thereof, was unequally distributed, and that the supposedly uniform richness of the Middle Period was similarly discontinuous. While average isotopic values for the two ayllus were similar, variance within each differed significantly, as did variance in dietary composition arrived at through modeling. By all measures, the individuals interred in Solcor 3 had more varied diets, particularly in terms of carbohydrate-rich plants, than their contemporaries interred at Tchecar Túmulo Sur, suggesting that more individuals from Solcor 3 had greater participation in/access to long-distance exchange networks. Besides providing novel insights into the lived experience of the Middle Period residents of far northern Chile, this work also demonstrates the power of Bayesian mixture modeling for the reconstruction of individual paleodiet.","This work would not have been possible without the continued support of the Instituto de Arqueología y Antropología and the Museo Arqueológico Le Paige of the Universidad Católica del Norte, and in particular, M.

Using various remote sensing data sets, we mapped the neotectonic characteristics of an area at the southeastern corner of the Atacama Basin, northern Chile, in the Andean forearc. There, one major N-S trending ridge is clearly visible both in the satellite images and in the field. This ridge reaches 250m above the basin floor in its middle part and is asymmetrical, with a steep eastern slope and a much gentler western slope. The geometry of the ridge indicates that it formed as an asymmetrical anticline. This anticline is likely formed as a shear fault-bend fold, with a major décollement at a depth of about 2.5km in the Naranja Formation. We suggest that this décollement is a major structure of the Atacama Basin area. From the ages of the ignimbrites and lake deposits that were deformed by this anticline, we obtained a long-term shortening rate of the major underlying structure at about 0.2mm/yr. This thin-skinned fold-and-thrust system appears to be active since at least about 3Ma, and could be as long as since middle Miocene. Therefore, crustal structures may play important roles in the Neogene development of the western Andean margin.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for the assistance of F. Aron, F. González, and E.E.

200,pub.1010649770,10.1002/aqc.2665,,,Towards local governance of marine resources and ecosystems on Easter Island,"Abstract    Social‐ecological system sustainability depends in part upon the fit between ecosystems and institutions.   In 2014, the local community on Easter Island started a bottom‐up process to improve marine resources conservation and management.   Local stakeholders formed a working group that has regular meetings and goals, such as creating a sea council and some basic action plans, thus initiating a local governance transformation process.   A participatory process was conducted together with a local organization that led the marine conservation issues on the island to define the factors that could favour and/or undermine the formation of the sea council. Also, the stakeholders that must be present in such a sea council were identified.   Twelve factors that could facilitate or hinder the implementation of a sea council were identified. The lack of representativeness of public institutions is a major challenge.   Public institutions are designed to ensure compliance with central government strategies, but the decisions do not represent the worldview of islanders.   The results showed the potential value of conducting a participatory process to identify the key issues that could hinder or favour a desired governance transformation process. The participatory process also highlighted governance mismatches that are important to consider in attempts to pursue more effective fishery governance on Easter Island, and other Island communities.   Centralized governance systems do not respond rapidly to locally observed social and ecological dynamics. By contrast, a local decision‐making system based on traditional laws and local governance can more rapidly respond to observed changes.   The participatory process presented here holds the potential to support local people in their planning and coordination for marine conservation and management in order to optimize bottom‐up change processes involving multiple stakeholders with different interests, values and levels of power.

The combination of strong economic growth and policies targeted at the most vulnerable groups improved considerably the living standards of the Colombian population. Today, the country enjoys higher employment and labour force participation rates than the average of OECD countries and unemployment is steadily declining. Nevertheless, despite these positive trends, deep structural problems remain. Labour informality is widespread, the rate of self-employment is high and many employees have non-regular contracts. Income inequality is higher than in any OECD country and redistribution through taxes and benefits is almost negligible. In addition, half a century of internal conflict and violence has displaced a significant part of the population, and many of them are living in extreme poverty. Despite considerable progress, violence continues to be a challenge and also affects trade union members and leaders. The Colombian Government has undertaken important reforms in recent years to address these labour market and social challenges, and the efforts are gradually paying off. However, further progress is needed to enhance the quality of jobs and well-being for all. The main trust of this report is to support the Colombian Government in tackling labour market duality, generate trust between the social partners, develop inclusive and active social policies, and get the most out of international migration.",,,OECD Reviews of Labour Market and Social Policies,,,,2016-01-20,2016,,2016-01-20,,,,Closed,Monograph,OECD,OECD (),,OECD (),5,0,,1.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107174179,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"1 No Poverty; 10 Reduced Inequalities; 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth"

In South Africa, providing schools with a well-resourced and well-staffed library and information service is even more challenging because of the inheritance of the apartheid education system prior to 1994. The article is limited to just one part of a research project which investigated the resource provision in public high schools in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The purpose of the study was to investigate challenges that negatively affect the establishment and sustainability of an active and vigorous library and information service for all schools in Limpopo Province. The study was largely quantitative, blended with triangulation of both quantitative and qualitative methods for data collection. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data from the principals or teacher-librarians at schools, while an interview schedule was used to collect qualitative data from education officials through face-to-face interviews. The findings established that there are daunting challenges which hinder effective establishment and maintenance of functional school library and information service. The national Department of Basic Education has a responsibility to ensure that school library policy is formulated, endorsed and implemented as a matter of urgency. The Government should also fast-track rural development to enable teachers and learners, particularly those in historically disadvantaged rural black communities, to access library materials in other amenities.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Librarianship and Information Science,,,,2016-10-12,2016,2016-10-12,2018-12,50,4,410-426,Closed,Article,"Mojapelo, Samuel Maredi","Mojapelo, Samuel Maredi (UNISA, South Africa)","Mojapelo, Samuel Maredi (University of South Africa)","Mojapelo, Samuel Maredi (University of South Africa)",17,6,,10.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063902394,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,4 Quality Education

Thus, the establishment and behavior of a market system is closer to a political struggle than it is a simple technical and spontaneous process. Despite their contributions, these approaches have not focused on the resistance that cultural exegesis, self-identification, and the affective connection between the human and non-human pose to market systems. In this paper, I show how the Atacameño people from the Atacama Desert (Chile) have subverted the radical pro-water market model imposed by the Chilean military dictatorship in 1981 by relying on their water-related cultural values. In some Atacameño communities, the water market has not operated to ensure that water rights are put to those uses with the highest economic value (e.g., mining or urban water consumption). Indeed, in these communities, internal rules both forbid the sale of water rights to the mining sector and regulate the distribution of water within the community in terms that operate as barriers to other transactions. These rules form part of a moral economy of water that is a concrete ethic based on shared values and affective connections between humans and non-humans, mandating how people should relate to one another in relation to water. Together, these relations have decommodified water and contradict the neoliberal explanation of how a free water market should work.","AcknowledgementsI am grateful to the Atacameños who shared with me their personal histories and to the people from Lasana, who invited me to the Limpia.

Over the 600km of coast studied, the following pattern of depth-zonation is described: an upper fringe (lower part of the sublittoral fringe) characterized by barren grounds dominated by calcareous encrusting algae and the sea urchin Tetrapygus niger; an intermediate fringe (upper Infralittoral sub-zone) characterized either by deep barren grounds similar to the former, or kelp beds of Lessonia trabeculata, or an assemblage of suspension feeding organisms, as the big barnacle Austromegabalanus psittacus and/or the tunicate Pyura chilensis; and a deep fringe (Circalittoral sub-zone) dominated by small encrusting or mobile invertebrates. This basic vertical zonation pattern of the shallow rocky subtidal communities seems to be common to most of the temperate coasts of the world. The analysis, first of the occurrence of the general zonation pattern and second of the species composition within the assemblages corresponding to each sub-zone, offers a useful framework for the assessment of the eventual impacts and changes within the shallow rocky subtidal habitat, for example within environmental monitoring programs.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank the various fisherfolk organizations that helped us with the field work in some parts of the coast.

Metamorphic rocks from the precordillera upthrust belt mostly show a wide spectrum of zircon ages, indicating derivation from sedimentary protoliths. Youngest detrital zircon ages (i.e., maximum depositional ages) range from c. 850Ma at Belén to 1000–1100Ma in Sierra de Moreno and Cordón de Lila. Late Proterozoic provenance throughout the region corresponds to a c. 1Ga igneous and metamorphic event. The main source region could have been the Proterozoic MARA block or Laurentia to the west. Early Ordovician plutonic rocks (465–485Ma) correlated with the Famatinian magmatism of NW Argentina are recognised in all three outcrop areas, and contemporaneous volcanic rocks in Cordón de Lila. Hf- and O-isotope data for Ordovician zircon in these rocks, and for c. 1450 detrital zircon in the metasedimentary rocks, are consistent with ultimate derivation from Early Mesoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic lithosphere. A depositional age younger than 400Ma is determined for the Quebrada Aroma metamorphic complex, indicating post-Early Silurian metamorphism and folding. Carboniferous igneous and deformational events occur in the Coast Range, where metasedimentary complexes are mostly related to Late Paleozoic subduction–accretion; deformation and metamorphism continued near the present Pacific shore line until Triassic and earliest Jurassic times. The underlying crust of much of Norte Grande is considered to be Proterozoic (Arequipa–Antofalla block or MARA), although there are no igneous rock outcrops of this age.","This research has been supported by FONDECYT grants 1095099 and 1130227 and associated International Cooperation Grants.

In particular, early platform mound-and-plaza complexes have long been understood as elite compounds due to their physical similarities with later sites. However, evidence regarding the construction and use of the monumental landscape at the Feltus site (22JE500) in Jefferson County, MS, suggests that platform mound construction was but one aspect of a broader ritual sequence aimed at gathering the dispersed Coles Creek community. In addition to mound building, this sequence included the setting and removal of freestanding posts, ritual feasting, and burial of the dead and focused on explicit deposition of meaningful objects and substances. Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic analyses of the objects and substances included in the ritual deposits at Feltus suggest that they helped forge relationships between an extended kin network, including non-human fictive kin and non-living human kin. In this context, we find a metaphor of gathering to be useful in understanding the archaeological remains of a ritual sequence focused on bringing together social, cosmological, and temporal domains. This provides a distinctly different take on the meaning and use of platform mounds based on a review of Native beliefs and practices that looks beyond the traditionally relied upon sources.","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 69th annual meeting of the Southeastern Archaeological Conference in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.

Various studies have confirmed that dispersal via floating sporophytes and/or gametophytes influences the phylogeography and genetic population structure of these buoyant seaweeds. In addition, non-buoyant seaweeds (secondary rafters) that grow attached to or intermingled with these primary floaters may also become dispersed by rafting on their floating hosts. Here, we examine reports of non-buoyant seaweed species associated with buoyant seaweeds and discuss potential consequences for their phylogeography and/or genetic population structure. We found that mostly red and brown algae have been reported with floating seaweed rafts, most of them growing as epiphytes and some as obligate parasites (e.g. endophytes) that travel with their hosts. Molecular evidence suggests dispersal associated with primary floaters in 16 non-buoyant seaweeds, although colonization of distant sites could also have occurred via other floating substrata such as wood, buoys, and other man-made materials. Transoceanic dispersal has been inferred for non-buoyant seaweeds (for example, Gracilaria chilensis and Capreolia implexa) based on low levels of genetic structure and shared haplotypes among populations separated over vast distances of open ocean (e.g. New Zealand–Chile). Some non-buoyant species suspected or shown to be dispersed by rafting are from intertidal habitats, and these algae can resist physiologically stressful conditions during long trips at the sea surface. However, subtidal and low intertidal non-buoyant species have higher potential to be transported because they cohabit with common raft-forming kelps, often growing on them as epiphytes. We conclude that buoyant seaweeds play an important role in driving the phylogeography, evolution, connectivity and distribution of non-buoyant associated seaweeds. Dispersal of non-buoyant seaweeds via these floating seaweeds may have been underestimated in the past.","We thank the editors for inviting us to contribute this review.

Furthermore, it functions as a sensitive analytical instrument that measures, within a few seconds, a wide range of isotopes in inorganic samples. Determining the elemental or the isotopic composition of ancient material is essential to address questions related to ancient technology or provenance and therefore aids archaeologists in reconstructing exchange networks for goods, people and ideas.

For example, the existence of a finite threshold energy εc for the escaping of plasma constituents can be favored by the external electrostatic forces near the grounded conducting walls of a cylindrical Penning trap. In contrast, the conventional statistical mechanics description of these situations is performed assuming the existence of a rigorous thermodynamic equilibrium (Dubin and O’Neil 1999 Rev. Mod. Phys. 71 87), dismissing thus the existence of evaporation effects. We propose in this work a two-dimensional toy model that describes the incidence of evaporation on thermo-statistics of a pure non-neutral plasma (a system composed of a single charge species like an infinitely long electron column). Considering the existing connections between the macroscopic descriptions of pure non-neutral plasmas and astrophysical systems, the treatment of evaporation along a quasi-stationary regime is developed here in analogy to some astrophysical models proposed in the literature. We start from a regularized microcanonical description that only considers those microscopic configurations where particles are trapped inside a confinement region of radius Rc, which is implemented introducing a truncation of their velocity spectrum. These arguments lead us to a statistical procedure to predict the quasi-stationary particles distribution n(r) similar to the maximum entropy approach. According to our analysis, the influence of evaporation for a non-zero temperature T crucially depends on the saturation parameter δ=rB/Rc, whose admissible values are located in the interval 0<δ<1, with rB being the radius of Billouin steady state that appears in the limit T→0. The theoretical profiles predicted from this model are then compared to the metastable radial density distribution reported by Huang and Driscoll (1993 Phys. Rev. Lett. 72 2187). This analysis suggests the effects of evaporation in this particular experiment are significant, being these data compatible with the range of values δ≃0.55–0.59. To reach a major understanding of this experiment, we analyze the relation between our development and the so-called minimum enstrophy approach, which was invoked by these authors to fit their experimental data. We show that a variant of differential equation for particle density compatible with this extremal principle appears as an asymptotic case of the present proposal.","The authors thank Prof S Curilef (UCN), J C Flores (IAI-UTA) and L del Pino-Muñoz (UCN) for their suggestions.

The deep-water megabenthic communities of the Interior Sea of Chiloé (ISCh, northern part of the fjord region of Chile) were studied to characterize their taxonomic composition and to trace the energy pathways supporting them by using stable isotope analysis (SIA). Megabenthic and demersal organisms as well as sunken macroalgal debris and terrestrial organic matter (TOM: wood, leaves, branches) were obtained by bottom trawling along an estuarine gradient covering 100–460m water depth. Additionally, particulate organic matter (POM) and the sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were sampled and carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope ratios were determined for all these organisms and potential food sources. A total of 140 taxa were obtained, including invertebrates (e.g. polychaetes, mollusks, crustaceans and echinoderms) bony fishes, rays and sharks. Based on the stable isotope values it was possible to infer a strong dependence on primary production derived from phytoplankton which is exported to the benthos. A potentially important contribution from sunken macroalgae to megabenthic consumers was established only for some invertebrates, such as the irregular echinoid Tripylaster philippii and the decapod Eurypodius latreillii. The trophic structure metrics suggest a similar isotopic niche width, trophic diversity and species packaging in the food webs among the major basins in the ISCh. It is thus concluded that the benthic food webs are supported principally by surface primary production, but macroalgal subsidies could be exploited by selected invertebrate taxa (e.g. detritivores) and terrestrial carbon pathways are important for certain specialized taxa (e.g. Xylophaga dorsalis).","AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank the Captains and crews of RV “Cabo de Hornos” for their help during the CIMAR-19 Fiords cruise.

These ‘polymineralic inclusions’ have previously been interpreted to form by necking down of melts at mantle depths. We present a detailed petrographical and geochemical investigation of polymineralic inclusions and their host crystals to better understand how they form and what they reveal about the evolution of kimberlite melt. Genetically, the megacrysts are mantle xenocrysts with peridotitic chemical signatures indicating an origin within the lithospheric mantle (for the Cr-diopsides studied here ~4.6 GPa, 1015 °C). Textural evidence for disequilibrium between the host crystals and their polymineralic inclusions (spongy rims in Cr-diopside, kelyphite in Cr-pyrope) is consistent with measured Sr isotopic disequilibrium. The preservation of disequilibrium establishes a temporal link to kimberlite eruption. In Cr-diopsides, polymineralic inclusions contain phlogopite, olivine, chromite, serpentine, and calcite. Abundant fluid inclusion trails surround the inclusions. In Cr-pyropes, the inclusions additionally contain Al-spinel, clinopyroxene, and dolomite. The major and trace element compositions of the inclusion phases are generally consistent with the early stages of kimberlite differentiation trends. Extensive chemical exchange between the host phases and the inclusions is indicated by enrichment of the inclusions in major components of the host crystals, such as Cr2O3 and Al2O3. This chemical evidence, along with phase equilibria constraints, supports the proposal that the inclusions within Cr-diopside record the decarbonation reaction: dolomitic melt + diopside → forsterite + calcite + CO2, yielding the observed inclusion mineralogy and producing associated (CO2-rich) fluid inclusions. Our study of polymineralic inclusions in megacrysts provides clear mineralogical and chemical evidence for an origin of kimberlite that involves the reaction of high-pressure dolomitic melt with diopside-bearing mantle assemblages producing a lower-pressure melt that crystallizes a calcite-dominated assemblage in the crust.","This study forms part of Y.B.’s Ph.D. research funded through D.G.P’s Canada Excellence Research Chair.

The study area is characterized by outcrops of the Cerro del Burro Gravels, a continental deposit which is surrounded by four morphostructural mountain systems. Based on a 46 Ma tuff affected by a syncline, which is sealed by a 44 Ma tuff, we recognized an Eocene fault activity that contributed to the uplift of the western and northern systems, which have remained inactive during the last 44 Ma. The deformed lithologies during the last pulse of activity of the western fault and the youngest lithology carved by pediment processes (21 Ma) indicate a pediment surface developed during the Late Eocene and Oligocene. This pediment extended below the Cerro del Burro Gravels associated to a base level which drained to the east. We also recognized Miocene fault activity that played a main role in the uplift of the eastern and southern systems. Geochronological, stratigraphic and geomorphological data suggest a first pulse of fault activity between 19 and 13 Ma, which interrupted the pedimentation processes, developed an intramontane depocenter, and forced the accumulation of the Laguna Grande Succession in an alluvial‐braided fluvial environment. After 13 Ma, an erosive event evidenced by the incision of valleys, resulted after the change in the extension and configuration of the hydric network.","Acknowledgements This work was supported by CONICYT (Chilean National Research Agency) through the Fondecyt grant No. 11121529: Quantifying long‐term denudation with low‐temperature thermochronology: tectonic activity and landscape evolution of the Chilean Andes (27–32°S), by G.

We used temperature measurements in the deep wells and geochemical analyses of borehole fluid samples to constrain present-day fluid conditions. In addition, we reconstructed the paleo-fluid temperatures and chemistry from microthermometry and LA-ICP-MS analysis of fluid inclusions taken from well-constrained parageneses in vein samples retrieved from a~1000m borehole core. Based on core logging, mineralogical observations and fluid inclusions data we identify four stages (S1–S4) of progressive hydrothermal alteration. An early heating event (S1) was followed by the formation of a clay-rich cap in the upper zone (<670m) and the development of a propylitic alteration assemblage at greater depth (S2). Boiling, flashing and brecciation occurred later (S3), followed by a final phase of fluid mixing and boiling (S4). The evolution of hydrothermal alteration at Tolhuaca has produced a mineralogical, hydrological and structural vertical segmentation of the system through the development of a low-permeability, low-cohesion clay-rich cap at shallow depth. The quantitative chemical analyses of fluid inclusions and borehole fluids reveal a significant change in chemical conditions during the evolution of Tolhuaca. Whereas borehole (present-day) fluids are rich in Au, B and As, but Cu-poor (B/Na~100.5, As/Na~10−1.1, Cu/Na~10−4.2), the paleofluids trapped in fluid inclusions are Cu-rich but poor in B and As (B/Na~10−1, As/Na~10−2.5, Cu/Na~10−2.5 in average). We interpret the fluctuations in fluid chemistry at Tolhuaca as the result of transient supply of metal-rich, magmatically derived fluids where As, Au and Cu are geochemically decoupled. Since these fluctuating physical and chemical conditions at the reservoir produced a mineralogical vertical segmentation of the system that affects the mechanical and hydrological properties of host rock, we explored the effect of the development of a low-cohesion low-permeability clay cap on the conditions of fault rupture and on the long-term thermal structure of the system. These analyses were performed by using rock failure condition calculations and numerical simulations of heat and fluid flows. Calculations of the critical fluid pressures required to produce brittle rupture indicate that within the clay-rich cap, the creation or reactivation of highly permeable extensional fractures is inhibited. In contrast, in the deep upflow zone the less pervasive formation of clay mineral assemblages has allowed retention of rock strength and dilatant behavior during slip, sustaining high permeability conditions. Numerical simulations of heat and fluid flows support our observations and suggest that the presence of a low permeability clay cap has helped increase the duration of high-enthalpy conditions by a factor of three in the deep upflow zone at Tolhuaca geothermal system, when compared with an evolutionary scenario where a clay cap was not developed. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the dynamic interplay between fluid flow, crack-seal processes and hydrothermal alteration are key factors in the evolution of the hydrothermal system, leading to the development of a high enthalpy reservoir at the flank of the dormant Tolhuaca volcano.","AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge support from FONDECYT grant #1130030, CEGA-FONDAP project #15090013, and Millennium Science Initiative grant NC130065.

We examine chemical and isotopic profiles in two soils of differing ages from the Salar Llamara to determine the geochemical processes involved in their formation. Evaporation, which provides salts to the soils through mineral precipitation, decreases with increasing salt crust thickness, and average~0.03mmm−2d−1 over geological time frames. Salt distribution varies predictably with depth and soil age, with the most soluble compounds concentrated nearest to the land surface, indicating the direction of fluid flow. δ34S values of mineral sulfate tend to decrease with decreasing soil depth, following a pattern indicative of Rayleigh-like fractionation as solute-rich waters migrate toward the land surface. δ13C and δ18O values of carbonate suggest that the uppermost halite layers, which contain very small amounts of carbonate, have a strong biological signature. In contrast, carbonate-rich layers deeper in the profiles consist of largely unmodified lacustrine carbonate that formed in highly evaporitic lake conditions. The continuous upward evaporation of water and dissolved solutes creates a rugged and physically dynamic halite crust composed of rounded salt nodules. The crust undergoes deliquescence as atmospheric relative humidity rises from marine air intrusions, and we found that the halite nodules on the surface of the Salar Llamara are nearly always at or above deliquescence relative humidity. The interiors of these nodules are therefore able to buffer the large diurnal changes in atmospheric relative humidity allowing for the survival of halophilic microbial communities in an otherwise very dry environment. Radiocarbon measurements of occluded organic C in the surface crusts indicate that C cycling occurs at differing rates depending on local micrometeorological conditions, and that a given salt crust feature may persist for thousands of years once formed.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for all the support received while completing this work.

The ETP is a natural laboratory, a model for understanding the development of coral biotopes in a changing environment. We evaluate conservation strategies in seven countries in the ETP region (Peru was not included for apparent lack of coral habitats). A survey of current Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) highlights great variation in the number, scale and management approaches. Generally, MPAs with no-take areas are relatively uncommon, with multi-purpose areas favored. The Cabo Pulmo MPA in Baja California, Mexico demonstrates that when a local community is involved in the creation and enforcement measures of an MPA, conservation success can be achieved. Despite such apparent successes, inadequate and confusing legal practices have generally forestalled effective protection of coral ecosystems in the ETP. However, in several instances nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have assisted with planning, negotiation and stakeholder engagement. Nonetheless these findings underscore how the establishment of an MPA does not guarantee that conservation goals will be achieved. This calls for a new approach that incorporates contributions from ecological studies along with a high investment in capacity development and training to ensure that the goals of MPAs better complement effective fisheries and ecosystem management within and outside their borders.","We thank the editors of this book for inviting us to participate in this project.

In Rightness as Fairness, Marcus Arvan argues that the field of moral philosophy must adapt scientific principles in order to move closer to discovering moral truth. Arvan argues that our best empirical evidence and natural observation reveal morality to be a type of prudence requiring us to act in ways that our present and future selves can rationally agree upon across time. Arvan shows that this agreement between our present and future selves - Rightness as Fairness - is fundamentally a matter of being fair to ourselves and to others, including animals. Further, the Four Principles of Fairness comprising this agreement reconcile several opposing moral and political frameworks, including libertarianism and egalitarianism. Rightness as Fairness provides a uniquely fruitful method of 'principled fair negotiation' for resolving applied moral and political issues that requires merging principled debate with real-worldnegotiation.",,,,,,,2016,2016,,2016,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Arvan, Marcus","Arvan, Marcus (The University of Tampa, USA)",,"Arvan, Marcus (University of Tampa)",11,2,,6.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047547175,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5003 Philosophy,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It suggests that such democratizing and development may be achieved in two complementary ways: i) broadening the access to knowledge through formal learning processes of higher education, and ii) promoting the advanced qualification of people while strengthening research institutions. The book shows how this entails a complex process of policy integration, with an emphasis on human resources and institutional issues combined in processes of technical change. It discusses in detail the three main challenges that most Latin American countries face in a globalized age, based on knowledge and ever-evolving learning processes. These challenges are the need to broaden the access to higher education; to make this access more socially balanced; and to recover from a long gap in investing in knowledge production and dissemination.

A Meta‐Analytic Investigation Based on Upper Echelons Theory,"What roles do CEOs play in firm performance? To address this question, the management field has accumulated a substantial amount of research over the past 3 decades built on upper echelons theory (UET), which posits that CEO characteristics manifest in firm strategic actions and, in this way, future firm performance. Hence, there is a need to systematically amass and take stock of prior empirical findings for UET testing and development. We use meta‐analytic techniques to synthesize prior UET research on the relationships among commonly studied CEO characteristics, firm strategic actions, and future firm performance. Based on 308 studies, meta‐analytic results generally support UET's predictions with a few exceptions: CEO characteristics (i.e., tenure, formal education, prior career experience, and positive self‐concept) are significantly associated with firm strategic actions, which in turn are significantly related to future firm performance. Moreover, CEO characteristics (i.e., age, tenure, formal education, and prior career experience) are positively related to future firm performance. In addition, fine‐grained analyses have revealed interesting and important relationships between specific measures of CEO characteristics (e.g., CEO prior task experience) and firm outcomes (e.g., firm strategic actions that match with CEO prior task experience).

Hojat’s new Empathy in Health Professions Education and Patient Care provides students and professionals across healthcare with the most scientifically rigorous, conceptually vivid, and comprehensive statement ever< produced proving once and for all what we all know intuitively – empathy is healing both for those who receive it and for those who give it. This book is filled with great science, great philosophizing, and great ‘how to’ approaches to education. Every student and practitioner in healthcare today should read this and keep it by the bedside in a permanent place of honor. Stephen G Post, Ph.D., Professor of Preventive Medicine, and Founding Director of the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care, and Bioethics, School of Medicine, Stony Brook University Dr. Hojat has provided, in this new edition, a definitive resource for the evolving area of empathy research and education. For those engaged in medical student or resident education and especially for those dedicated to efforts to improve the patient experience, this book is a treasure trove of primary work in the field of empathy. Leonard H. Calabrese, D.O., Professor of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University The latest edition of Empathy in Health Professions Education and Patient Care grounds the clinical art of empathic caring in the newly recognized contributions of brain imagery and social cognitive neuroscience. Furthermore, it updates the accumulating empirical evidence for the clinical effects of empathy that has been facilitated by the widespread use of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, a generative contribution to clinical research by this book’s author. In addition, the book is so coherently structured that each chapter contributes to an overall understanding of empathy, while also covering its subject so well that it could stand alone. This makes Empathy in Health Professions Education and Patient Care an excellent choice for clinicians, students, educators and researchers. Herbert Adler, M.D., Ph.D. Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University It is my firm belief that empathy as defined and assessed by Dr. Hojat in his seminal book has far reaching implications for other areas of human interaction including business, management, government, economics, and international relations.

It shows how higher education is a significant arena for regional and international transformation as well as domestic political struggle replete with unequal power relations. This volume shows: The causes and impacts of recent transformations in higher education within a transnational context; Emerging similarities in objectives, institutional set-ups, and approaches taking place within higher education institutions across different world regions; The asymmetrical relations between various kinds of institutional, commercial and state actors across borders; The extent to which historical and colonial legacies are important in the transformation of higher education; The potential effects these developments have on the current structure of international political order. Drawing on case studies from across the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, the contributors develop diverse perspectives explaining the impact of transnational politics on higher education—and higher education on transitional politics—across time and locality. This book is among the first multi-disciplinary effort to wrestle with the question of how we can understand the political role of higher education, and the political force universities exert in the realm of international relations.

It also provides extensive information on the nutritive value of underutilized pseudo-cereals, the goal being to broaden the vegetable list. Amaranthus is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Most of the species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed. Only a few are cultivated as vitamin-rich vegetables and ornamentals. The protein-rich seeds of a handful of species, known as grain amaranths, are consumed as pseudo-cereals. Amaranthus manifests considerablemorphological diversity among and even within certain species, and there is no general agreement on the taxonomy or number of species. Currently the genus Amaranthus is believed to include three recognized subgenera and 70 species. Amatanthus is considered to potentially offer an alternative crop in temperate and tropical climate. The classification of amaranths is ambiguous due to the lack of discrete and quantitative species-defining characteristics and the wide range of phenotypic plasticity, as well as introgression and hybridization involving weedy and crop species. It is a known fact that both vegetable and grain amaranths have evolved from their respective weed progenitors. There are more than 180 different weed species that are herbicide-resistant, and amaranths are considered to be leading members of the resistant biotypes. Amaranth species provide ample scope for investigating herbicide resistance mechanisms. Amaranths also show variability in terms of their mating behavior and germplasm, adaptability to different growing conditions, and wide range of variability in sexual systems, from monoecy to dioecy. A solid grasp of these parameters is essential to the future utilization of amaranths as super crops. There are quite a few amaranth research center and germplasm collections all over the world that maintain and evaluate working germplasms. To date, the genetic improvement of amaranths has primarily involved the application of conventional selection methods. But advances in genomics and biotechnology have dramatically enriched the potential to manipulate the amaranth genome, especially improving the amount and availability of nutrients. In conclusion, the book covers all aspects of amaranths, including their food value, significance as vegetables and pseudo-cereals, taxonomy, phylogeny, germplasm variability, breeding behavior and strategies, cultivation practices, and variability in terms of their sexual systems. It offers a valuable resource for all students, researchers and experts working in the field of plant taxonomy and diversity.",,,,,,,2016,2016,,2016,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Das, Saubhik","Das, Saubhik (Department of Botany, Taki Government College, West Bengal, India)",,"Das, Saubhik (Himachal Pradesh University)",121,46,,18.71,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022155794,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3004 Crop and Pasture Production",

This book presents a unique multidisciplinary exploration of African traditions in the study of religion in Africa and the new African diaspora. The book is structured under three main sections - Emerging trends in the teaching of African Religions; Indigenous Thought and Spirituality; and Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. Contributors drawn from diverse African and global contexts situate current scholarly traditions of the study of African religions within the purview of academic encounter and exchanges with non-African scholars and non-African contexts. African scholars enrich the study of religions from their respective academic and methodological orientations.

It establishes that the aphasia imposed on the indigenous is but a visible symptom of a deeper malaise — the mismatch between the symbiotic relation nurtured by the indigenous with their environment and the idea of development put before them as their future. The essays here show how the cultures and the imaginative expressions of indigenous communities all over the world are undergoing a phase of rapid depletion. They unravel the indifference of market forces to diversity and that of the states, unwilling to protect and safeguard these marginalized communities.

The book contributes to rectifying the dearth of analysis of mass democratic anti-apartheid organisations in South Africa by examining two black higher education organisations that span over two decades between 1968 and 1990. One is the South African National Students Congress (SANSCO), which between 1979 and 1986 went by the name of the Azanian Student Organisation (AZASO). The other is the South African Student Organisation (SASO), formed in 1968 and popularly associated with the person of Steve Biko. Initially, the book focuses on SANSCO. Part of the motivation for investigating SANSCO was involvement in the organisation, first as vice-president of the University of Cape Town branch of SANSCO, and thereafter as national co-ordinator of the Education Charter campaign and projects officer on the national executive.",,,,,,,2016-04-29,2016,2016-04-29,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Badat, Saleem","Badat, Saleem ()",,"Badat, Saleem ()",6,0,,2.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034512215,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 44 Human Society",4 Quality Education

Its success remains a symbol of a progressive global community. An African Volk looks at this phenomenon from the other side. It explores how the apartheid state in South Africa sought to maintain power as the world of white empire gave way to a new postcolonial environment that repudiated racial hierarchy. Drawing upon archival research across Southern Africa and beyond, as well as over fifty hours of interviews with leading figures from the apartheid order, An African Volk shows how instead of simply resisting decolonization and African nationalism in the name of white supremacy, the white power structure looked to hijack and invert the norms of the new global era to relegitimize its rule, break out of isolation, and secure international acceptance. Situated at the nexus of African, decolonization, and Cold War history, An African Volk tells the story of how the architects of apartheid used statecraft to redefine whiteness and promote a fresh ideological basis for their rule. In doing so, it offers new global and local perspectives on the apartheid state and illuminates the complexities and contradictions of the postcolonial project. Equally, it shows how the regime’s outreach to Africa both reflected and fueled heated debates within Afrikaner society over the relationship between race, nation, and state, exposing a deeply divided polity in the midst of massive economic, cultural, and social change.",,,,,,,2016-11-24,2016,,2016-11-24,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Miller, Jamie","Miller, Jamie ()",,"Miller, Jamie ()",22,5,,43.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1098755192,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",10 Reduced Inequalities

Affected individuals have normal, proportional height and high serum alkaline phosphatase activity. Radiographically, affected members exhibit generalized, symmetrically diffuse endosteal hyperostosis of the long bones and skull with narrow medullary cavities and loss of the diploë, respectively. There is no periosteal reaction or decreased hematopoiesis. Furthermore, osteosclerosis affects vertebral bodies, ribs, pelvis, mandible, clavicles, and scapulae. Bone mineral density is 2.4-7.3 SD above the mean for age and gender in affected individuals. Affected vs. unaffected individuals' Z-scores were (mean +/- SD) 5.03 +/- 1.77 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.97, respectively, P = 0.0004). Three affected subjects older than 40 yr old lost bone mass in 6 yr. No dysmorphism, abnormal facial features, bone fractures, or cranial nerve involvement was found. The pattern of inheritance, the absence of asymmetries and malformations, the increased serum alkaline phosphatase, the peak bone mass that appears to decrease physiologically with age, and the involvement of cortical and trabecular bone suggest a new variant of hyperostosis/osteosclerosis that affects the entire skeleton.","We thank Ms. Ginnie Roos for her help in preparing the manuscript and ISS for scientific support to Dr. C.

The incidence of the main (p.F508del) and other frequent mutations has been determined in a great number of countries and ethnic groups, but its incidence in most Latin American countries has remained unknown until recently. It is now beginning to be recognized as a frequent cause of infant mortality, and some countries report the incidence of their mutations. Colombia started several years ago a concerted program of molecular study of patients which were clinically diagnosed as probable cystic fibrosis. We screened the whole CFTR (ABCC7) coding sequence in 92 patients from 6 different geographic regions, using conventional PAGE analyses and DGGE followed by sequencing. Additionally, we established the frequency of the p.F508del mutation in 130 unrelated healthy controls. The results of this pilot study in Colombian patients from various ethnic admixture show six main mutations: p.F508del (41.8%), c.1811+1.6kbA>G (6.5%), p.G542X (3.8%), p.S549R (2.2%), p.W1282X (1.1%) and p.R1162X (1.1%). Thirteen other rare mutations, including three novel, were detected, accounting for a total of 63.6% known mutations. There is a great variability between the geographic regions, both in the frequency of the p.F508del mutation and non-p.F508del CF chromosomes. Our results point to a varied origin of the disease genes. These results also show that careful scrutiny of the mutations is needed in each part of Latin America in order to establish priority-screening protocols adapted to each country and region.",,,Human Mutation,,,Adult; Colombia; Cystic Fibrosis; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Gene Frequency; Genetic Carrier Screening; Genetic Testing; Humans; Incidence; Male; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Mutation; Pilot Projects,2003-08-14,2003,2003-08-14,2003-09,22,3,259-259,Closed,Article,"Keyeux, Genoveva; Rodas, Clemencia; Bienvenu, Thierry; Garavito, Pilar; Vidaud, Dominique; Sanchez, Dora; Kaplan, Jean‐Claude; Aristizábal, Gustavo","Keyeux, Genoveva (Instituto de Genética, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Rodas, Clemencia (School of Engineering, University of Warwick, United Kingdom); Bienvenu, Thierry (Institut Cochin, INSERM U‐567and Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaires,Hôpital Cochin, AP‐HP, Paris, France); Garavito, Pilar (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vidaud, Dominique (Institut Cochin, INSERM U‐567and Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaires,Hôpital Cochin, AP‐HP, Paris, France); Sanchez, Dora (Cruz Roja Ecuatoriana, Quito, Ecuador); Kaplan, Jean‐Claude (Institut Cochin, INSERM U‐567and Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaires,Hôpital Cochin, AP‐HP, Paris, France); Aristizábal, Gustavo (Escuela Colombiana de Medicina, Bogotá, Colombia)","Keyeux, Genoveva (National University of Colombia)","Keyeux, Genoveva (National University of Colombia); Rodas, Clemencia (University of Warwick); Bienvenu, Thierry (Institut Cochin, INSERM U‐567and Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaires,Hôpital Cochin, AP‐HP, Paris, France); Garavito, Pilar (Universidad del Norte); Vidaud, Dominique (Institut Cochin, INSERM U‐567and Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaires,Hôpital Cochin, AP‐HP, Paris, France); Sanchez, Dora (Cruz Roja Ecuatoriana, Quito, Ecuador); Kaplan, Jean‐Claude (Institut Cochin, INSERM U‐567and Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaires,Hôpital Cochin, AP‐HP, Paris, France); Aristizábal, Gustavo (Escuela Colombiana de Medicina, Bogotá, Colombia)",19,2,0.3,1.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006179877,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in a random sample of 275 women of fertile age living in the neighborhood of Carlos Meisel in Barranquilla, Colombia. Information was gathered through a structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews at the participants' homes. The questionnaire was adapted from the World Health Organization's recommendations on ethics and safety when investigating domestic violence. The questionnaire included items on personal characteristics, habitual alcohol and drug consumption, family function test (Family Apgar), socioeconomic characteristics, and physical abuse in the 12 months prior to the interview.
RESULTS: The prevalence of marital violence was 22.9%. Women aged 25-29 years old were the most commonly affected (33.3%). Factors associated with violence were habitual alcohol consumption in women (Odds ratio [OR] = 6.02; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.7-22.2) and in the spouse (OR = 10.11; 95% CI, 5.1-20.1) and drug consumption by the husband (OR = 11.01; 95% CI, 4.2-29.5). A monthly wage of less than 300,000 Colombian pesos (140 euros) was also significantly associated with domestic violence as was moderate or severe family dysfunction (respectively, OR = 16.9; 95% CI, 4.8-59.0; OR = 81.6; 95% CI, 18.8-335).
CONCLUSIONS: Because this was a cross-sectional study, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Barranquilla, Colombia.","BACKGROUND: The depression is a principal problem of public health. The principal aim of this study is to determine the role of the social groups as factor protective in elderly, to evaluate the agreement by American Psychiatric Association Criterions and Hamilton Depression test, and also to determine other socio-cultural risk factors associated with depressive syndrome in elderly.
METHOD: Cross-sectional survey. The sample consisted of 602 elderly people (eligible subjects) were men (223) and women (379) between 60 and 94 years (males and females), residents in the south-west of Barranquilla, Colombia. A previously tested, self answer questionnaire was used, therefore, we needed a report consent. Risk measures: Odds Ratio (OR-95% Confidence intervalue), Kappa test to agreement by the nine criteria of the American Psychiatric Association and Hamilton test so, screening testing.
RESULTS: The participation in social groups was a protector factor. (Odds Ratio = 0.5; 95% CI 0.34-0.73, p = 0.001). The rate 29.9% was obtained with prevalence of depression in elderly (21.4%-39.4%) affecting principally males (32.7%). The agreement by Kappa test = 0.63 was very important or good. Sensibility = 56.1% (48.5%-63.4%) Specificity = 0.93% (97.8%-99.8%) and Predictive Positive Value = 97.1% (91.2%-99.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: This survey was to determine risk factors related to depression in elderly in anyway can be potentially modifiable. The familiar disfunction by moderate and serious, the lack as blindness and deafness, the loneliness, the housingness and low incomes were obtained with risk factors associated to depression. The participation in a social group is a protective factor to depression syndrome in elders.

The distribution of these alleles was examined in a group of Colombian mestizo children (genetic admixture of Amerindians, Europeans and Africans) suffering from clinically distinct JRA subsets in order to detect HLA allele frequency differences in patients with different JRA subsets. A group of 65 patients with JRA and 65 controls were characterized for the subtypes of the HLA-DRB1 alleles using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP). The oligotyping protocol recommended by the 12th International Histocompatibility Workshop held in St. Malo, Paris, in 1996, was used. Subtype HLA-DRB1*1104 was the allele most strongly associated with susceptibility to JRA (Fisher's p = 0.013, odds ratio (OR) = 16.79, etiologic fraction (EF) = 0.93). HLA-DRB1*1602 was also associated with susceptibility to a lesser degree (Fisher's p = 0.016, OR = 8.98, EF = 0.88). HLA-DRB1 alleles participating in JRA protection were HLA-DRB1*1501 (preventive fraction (PF) = 0.466, p = 0.005) and HLA DRB1*1402 (PF = 0.49, p = 0.009). The relationship between some HLA-DRB1 alleles and clinical features was also compared. The presence of rheumatic factor was associated with the alleles HLA-DRB1*0407 (p = 0.05, OR = 11.2, EF = 0.45) and HLA-DRB1*1302 (p = 0.02, OR = 22.8, EF = 0.63). There was also an association between HLA-DRB1*0701 (p = 0.001, OR = 58, EF = 0.73) with expressing ANA +. We found that in the oligoarticular subset, the allele HLA-DRB1*1104 (p = 0.0034, OR = 41.53, EF = 0.97) was the one expressed most commonly. In the poliarticular group, the alleles most frequently expressed were HLA-DRB1*0404 (Fisher's p = 0.012, OR = 8.75, EF = 0.88). In patients with systemic JRA, the HLA-DRB1*1602 allele (p = 0.005, OR = 21.33, EF = 0.95) was most frequent.

Serological tests indicated that 5% of chickens tested had been exposed to Newcastle disease, 43% to infectious bronchitis and 63% to Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection. McMaster and Visser sieve techniques were used to determine helminth and coccidia from pooled fresh faecal samples. Helminths isolated in 37% of the villages investigated were Heterakis, Ascaridia and Capillaria species. Eimeria species were also isolated in 32% of the villages investigated. The red fowl mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) was isolated from some of the birds and their nests.

The 25 mm diameter shaft was driven by a 30 kW electrical motor and was running at 14,000 rpm. The shaft presented a complete section fracture near a surface bearing. In order to determine the primary cause of failure, the study was divided into different techniques depending on the objectives. Visual observation and electronic scanning microscopy were performed to obtain a fractographical description of the fracture surfaces. Next, emission spectrometry was carried out for chemical analysis of the steel, followed by a Brinell hardness test in order to establish the steel static strength. Energy consumption at the moment of the failure was used to evaluate the stress level on the shaft. Finally, optical microscopy was performed to determine the steel microstructure. The study found that the most probable cause of failure was fatigue, produced by heating generated from friction between the shaft and a poorly lubricated guide bearing filled with a corrosive and abrasive mixture of CS2, NaOH and diamine methylene, which caused adhesive wear grooves and an excessive clearance between shaft and bearing that originated an abnormal shaft movement, turn offset the rotation center, and induced the flexional cyclic loading. Failure was accelerated by the presence of the corrosive and abrasive lubricating substance within the fatigue cracks and the high temperature at the nearby surroundings.",AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank to Universidad del Norte and Griffin Corporation for their support in order to carry out this research work.,,International Journal of Fatigue,,,,2003-09,2003,,2003-09,25,9-11,1195-1201,Closed,Article,"Bris, J.; Maury, H.; Pacheco, A.; Torres, J.; Wilches, J.","Bris, J.

DESIGN: Descriptive study.
SETTING: Five health centres affiliated to the UNITRA, Faculty of Health Sciences.
METHODS: Medical students administered a questionnaire to mothers and other caregivers. Areas covered included how commonly traditional remedies are used, experience with traditional remedies in children, reasons for use, how administered, and problems encountered.
RESULTS: There were 103 respondents, 7.8% rated use of traditional remedies non-existent, 20.4% rated it as rare and the rest said it was common. 57.3% of the respondents had used these remedies in their children, and 83.1% of them said they would use them again. Only 20.7% of respondents reported problems with these remedies, including diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and death. The preparations used were known by only 40.7% of respondents. The remedies were administered by the mother and grandmother in 82.8% of cases; and were mainly given orally, by enema or by scarification. The amount administered varied from spoonful(s) up to 2.5 l. Children of all ages were given traditional remedies, usually for diarrhoea, fevers and constipation, or as prophylactics. These remedies were used because they are effective, available and safe, or due to customary beliefs and pressure from others.
CONCLUSION: The use of traditional remedies in children is common in communities around Umtata. There is need to study the composition and activity profiles of commonly used preparations so as to develop appropriate management protocols in case of toxicity.",,,East African Medical Journal,,,"Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Medicine, African Traditional; Mothers; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires",2003-08,2003,2004-05-12,2003-08,80,8,402-405,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Dambisya, YM; Tindimwebwa, G","Dambisya, YM (Professor, School of Health Sciences, University of the North, Sovenga 0727); Tindimwebwa, G (Professor, Department of Paediatrics, University of Transkei Medical School, UNITRA 5117, Republic of South Africa)",,"Dambisya, YM (Professor, School of Health Sciences, University of the North, Sovenga 0727); Tindimwebwa, G (Walter Sisulu University)",22,3,0.52,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/eamj/article/download/8730/1990,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020415919,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

One hundred and thirty drivers of minibuses, so-called ""taxis"" were interviewed on the basis of: (1) a superstition scale; (2) a risk-taking scale; (3) a list of perceived causes of road traffic accidents. Drivers showed largely superstitious attitudes and expressed a high degree of risk-taking behavior. Superstition was positively correlated with the number of self-reported accidents the drivers had been involved in and the number of accidents they had witnessed. Path analysis revealed a direct path from superstition to accident involvement while the influence of formal education was negligible. Risk-taking was inversely correlated with driving experience and the number of accidents witnessed but not so with the number of accidents involved in. There was no clear pattern of associations between superstition and risk-taking and perceived causes of accidents. Superstition and risk-taking were slightly and inversely correlated with each other.

Twenty nurses were randomly allocated to alternating videoconferencing and face-to-face modes of presentation. The quantitative study measured the amount of learning that occurred in each workshop with pre-tests and post-tests, and the mode of presentation. Forty-nine workshop attendances were analysed. The qualitative study used observation and analysis of videorecordings to assess the activity and attention spans in interactive communication during workshops, while a combination of interviews and questionnaires was used to assess the participants' level of satisfaction with presentation. The results showed that the nurses' level of satisfaction with the instructional presentation was high in both modes of presentation. Despite difficulties at the start of the project in the videoconferencing presentation, there was little difference between the modes of presentation in achievement scores or the gain in achievement scores. Although the learners preferred face-to-face workshops, they learnt as much from a videoconferenced workshop. Videoconferencing was less suitable for psychological or emotional discussions, but this may have been due to the time constraints on the workshops. Some features of videoconferencing suggest it could be used effectively in helping learners discuss sensitive issues.

The study was conducted at Harrismith and Kestell and in Qwa-Qwa from March 2000 to May 2001. Cattle of various breeds (including Bonsmara, Simmentaler and Friesian), Merino sheep and Angora goats were sampled. Faecal samples were analysed using the McMaster and Visser sieve techniques for egg counts and faecal cultures for 3rd-stage nematode larvae identification. Haemonchus and Oesophagostomum were the dominant nematode genera found to be infecting the animals. The socioeconomic status of the farmers in the study area was determined through a questionnaire survey aimed at recording their management strategies. It indicated that 81% of farmers take care of their livestock by feeding them with supplements. The low to moderate faecal egg counts from cattle showed that helminth infections in this region are still under control even though helminthosis seems to be a problem in small-stock, since EPG counts of more than > 1000 were found. Cattle farmers in this region are encouraged to continue with good animal husbandry practices that have ensured that helminth infections rates are kept low.

The model considers both solid and fluid regions in Cartesian coordinates. The problem was solved analytically, considering the fluid flowing in a laminar condition and hydrodynamically developed before any interaction with the heated body. The height of the fluid considered was enough to allow the generation of a thermal boundary layer without any restriction. The conservation of mass, momentum and energy equations were considered to turn the problem into a non dimensional form. The heated body presented a constant heat flux at the bottom side, and convective heat transfer at the top side in contact with the fluid. The other two boundary conditions are adiabatic. The energy equation was considered in the solid to turn it into a non dimensional form. The interface temperature was obtained from a regression using the Chebyshev polynomial approximation. As the problem deals with the cooling of a electronics components, the solution presents the mathematical solution of the energy equation for the solid, including the isothermal lines. The non dimensional form allows a thorough analysis of the problem, considering the influence of the different parameters in the conjugate heat transfer problem. The solution is compared with numerical solution of different problems, and the parameters considered are Reynolds number, plate thickness, Prandtl number, and solid thermal conductivity. The results obtained present isothermal lines, local Nusselt number, and average Nusselt number.Copyright © 2003 by ASME",,,,"Heat Transfer, Volume 1",,,2003-01-01,2003,2008-05-12,2003-01-01,,,11-18,Closed,Proceeding,"Vásquez, Ricardo S.; Bula, Antonio J.","Vásquez, Ricardo S.

Certain psychological, physiological, and secondary sex characteristics have been used as accurate markers of hormonal and developmental health. The main objective of this study was to investigate the capacity of women to select males of high reproductive quality based on their facial attractiveness. A total of 66 males were included in the study. Each of them provides a semen sample, and frontal and lateral photographs were taken. Semen analysis was made according to standard WHO (1999) guidelines for morphology, motility, and concentration. Moreover, a Sperm Index (SI) was calculated as the principal component of these parameters. In Study 1, 66 women rated the attractiveness, as a possible permanent couple, of pictures of all 66 men. In Study 2, the pictures of a subset of 12 males were randomly selected from three semen quality subgroups (terciles named good, normal, and bad, according to the value of the SI). These 12 pictures were rated on attractiveness by two independent sets of women (N=88 and N=76). Facial attractiveness ratings were significantly (P<.05) and positively correlated with sperm morphology, motility, and SI, but not with concentration, for all the women sets.","AcknowledgementsWe thank J.

We found that the mean number of patients treated for domestic violence per month was 11.4 (SD = 13.4); for White doctors 15.8, African Black 6.2, and for Asian doctors 5.3. The high frequency of domestic violence detected in this sample seems to reflect national surveys on domestic violence. Most doctors believed that they should play a role in prevention and treatment, and their attitudes toward victims of domestic violence were generally sympathetic and supportive. Male doctors and long-serving practitioners tended to have more conservative views of the causes and attitudes of spousal assault and of the doctors' role in prevention. Only 9.7% of the doctors had received any training on domestic violence.

METHOD: The sample included 60 children (30 were 5-year-olds and 30 were 9-year-olds) selected by simple random sampling from a rural primary school. They were interviewed, using a semi-structured interview schedule, about their understanding of health issues and their exposure to learning about health or sickness.
RESULTS: Differences across age in children's expressed understanding of health and illnesses were found. The 9-year-olds were more likely to give objective signs of chicken pox and AIDS than the 5-year-olds. They also knew more about objective symptoms of colds, chicken pox and AIDS, and were more likely to mention non-observable signs of colds and broken arms. Although there were no differences between the two age groups regarding 'knowing' strategies for avoiding illnesses, the older children had a more accurate knowledge about preventive measures than the younger children. The understanding of AIDS followed the same developmental sequence reported for children's understanding of general physical illness.

The deeper meaning of much traditional healing centres on ancestor reverence. This belief system and its accompanying rituals may positively influence the mental health of the individual and the community. Among traditional Xhosa-speaking peoples, the relationship with the ancestors is given expression in life cycle rituals that have much in common with Western psychotherapeutic principles and practices. The common thread that underpins many rituals is that of making links via concrete, literal means. Examples include the participation of the community in the healing of the individual; the linking of body and mind through dancing and drumming. Dreams form an essential connection between conscious life and the unconscious. Understanding the psychological depth of these practices is important so that a respectful relationship between Western-trained professionals and traditional healers can develop. Analytical psychology, with its notion of the collective unconscious has a particular contribution to make to cross-cultural understanding. The ancestors may be understood as archetypal representations of the collective unconscious.",,,Transcultural Psychiatry,,,Culture; Humans; Mental Healing; Mental Health; Religion and Psychology; South Africa; Spiritualism,2003-06-01,2003,2003-06-01,2003-06,40,2,194-207,Closed,Article,"Berg, Astrid","Berg, Astrid (zimi@iafrica.com)",,"Berg, Astrid (zimi@iafrica.com)",45,4,0.33,7.11,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015602542,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The traditional culture of the present-day indigenous Andean population enabled us to interpret the material remains left by pre-Columbian peoples, especially their particular way of understanding and occupying the land, knowledge of its flora and fauna, beliefs related to the sacredness that permeates all aspects of their lives, and their way of inhabiting the landscape that surrounds them. Ethnographic research is a priority in the highlands of northern Chile because the harnessing of water for industrial and urban use has dramatically reduced extensive areas of pastureland, springs, and streams. This progressively restricts the possibility for flora, fauna, and humans to survive in traditional settlements and stimulates gradual, forced migration toward the urban enclaves of the desert. Our research aims to present some aspects of our archaeological and ethnographic work and, especially, to explore ideological aspects related to the mountains in this region, from pre-Hispanic to the present.","This research is part of a project that was funded by grant FONDECYT 1011006, Chile.

The aim is to combine into a single aggregated metric the following weighting objectives: the maximum link utilization, the hop count, the total bandwidth consumption and the total end-to-end delay. Our proposal solves the traffic split ratio for multiple trees. The proposed approach is applied in MPLS networks by allowing the establishment of explicit routes in multicast events. Furthermore, the results obtained with GAMS tools show that several objectives are decreased; the maximum link utilization is minimized.

1251,pub.1002011910,10.1079/phn2003482,14552664,,Secondary data analyses of dietary surveys undertaken in South Africa to determine usual food consumption of the population,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to generate a reference table of food items and average amounts of these items consumed by South Africans, for the Department of Health. The reference table was required to be representative of foods and beverages eaten frequently by children and adults from all age and ethnic groups in order for the Department of Health to test for contaminants in these foods.
DESIGN: The National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) served as a framework for compiling data on children since this was a national representative survey of 1-9-year-old children undertaken in South Africa in 1999. However, there has never been a national dietary survey on adults in South Africa. Consequently the data had to be extrapolated from existing isolated surveys on adults. Secondary data analysis was conducted on existing dietary databases (raw data) obtained from surveys undertaken on adults in South Africa between 1983 and 2000. Available datasets were regional and independent, and were not individually representative of the South African diet. It was therefore necessary to use different statistical methods, including factor analyses, weighting and correlations, to generate ethnic and geographic representative data for adults. Two methods were used: Method 1, which corresponded with results of the NFCS (over-sampled for low socio-economic status), and Method 2, which was based on ethnic proportions of the population.
RESULTS: The secondary data analyses generated food items most commonly consumed by the South African adult population (Method 1) in descending frequency of usage and average (mean) amount per day: maize porridge (78%/848 g), white sugar (77%/27 g), tea (68%/456 g), brown bread (55%/165 g), white bread (28%/163 g), non-dairy creamer (25%/6 g), brick margarine (21%/19 g), chicken meat (19%/111 g), full-cream milk (19%/204 g) and green leaves (17%/182 g). In 6-9-year-olds, maize porridge (72%/426 g), sugar (76%/23 g), tea (51%/258 g), full-cream milk (35%/171 g) and white bread (33%/119 g) were eaten most frequently. Similarly, in 1-5-year-olds, the foods consumed most frequently were maize porridge (80%/426 g), sugar (76%/21 g), tea (44%/224 g), full-cream milk (39%/186 g) and white bread (24%/83 g). In order to evaluate the validity of the adult data generated, kilojoule values of the individual food items (per capita) were compared with food balance sheets (FBSs). The comparison was favourable except that the FBSs had a higher overall energy intake per capita of between 22 and 28%.
CONCLUSION: Reference tables of commonly consumed foods and beverages were generated at minimal cost based on secondary data analyses of past dietary surveys in different South African populations.",,,Public Health Nutrition,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Data Collection; Diet; Diet Surveys; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Analysis; Food Supply; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values; South Africa",2003-10,2003,2006-12-22,2003-10,6,7,631-644,All OA; Bronze,Article,"steyn, Nelia Patricia; Nel, Johanna Helena; Casey, Annette","steyn, Nelia Patricia (Chronic Diseases of Lifestyle Unit, South African Medical Research Council, PO Box 19070, Tygerberg, Cape Town 7505, South Africa); Nel, Johanna Helena (Chesham House, Hermanus, Western Cape, South Africa); Casey, Annette (Directorate Food Control, Department of Health, Pretoria, South Africa)","steyn, Nelia Patricia (South African Medical Research Council)","steyn, Nelia Patricia (South African Medical Research Council); Nel, Johanna Helena (Chesham House, Hermanus, Western Cape, South Africa); Casey, Annette (Department of Health)",46,1,0.93,6.83,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6E7DB8469C105DA1324D4D9F58483187/S1368980003000879a.pdf/div-class-title-secondary-data-analyses-of-dietary-surveys-undertaken-in-south-africa-to-determine-usual-food-consumption-of-the-population-div.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002011910,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,
1246,pub.1023971562,10.1081/fri-120018882,,,Current Use of Quinoa in Chile,"Quinoa, a relatively unknown crop in Chilean agriculture, is cultivated in the Andean area in the north of the country, and in coastal unirrigated lands of the southern central area. However, from pre-Columbian times (750 bc), the diverse indigenous ethnic groups that inhabited Chile used quinoa as part of their diet. Today, the area with the largest quinoa cultivation (176 ha) is found in the highlands of Iquique in the I Region. Recently, interest in cultivating quinoa for its food value and as a cash crop has increased, and considerable research is underway. A review of national databases for the last 10 years generated 52 studies of quinoa, half of which were investigations related to food uses. At present, investigations on quinoa are carried out at the universities of Chile—Santiago, Concepción, and Arturo Prat—Iquique, with studies on stress physiology, ecotype selection, selection for saponin content, saponin use, fertilization, and irrigation. In the Temuco area (IX Region), the Semillas Campex-Baer company has been working for more than 10 years with an ecotype known as Baer II, with potential for yields of 6500 kg/ha, and in commercial fields, of 3000 kg/ha. In Iquique, ecotypes from the highlands have been selected to be grown at 1000 masl, with experimental yields of up to 9000 kg/ha.",,,Food Reviews International,,,,2003-01-05,2003,,2003-01-05,19,1-2,155-165,Closed,Article,"Delatorre-Herrera, J.","Delatorre-Herrera, J.

These events are, however, quite rare and Pluto's atmosphere remains poorly understood, as in particular the planet has not yet been visited by a spacecraft. Here we report data from the first occultations by Pluto since 1988. We find that, during the intervening 14 years, there seems to have been a doubling of the atmospheric pressure, a probable seasonal effect on Pluto.","We thank the Conseil Scientifique of Paris Observatory and the Programme National de Planétologie for supporting part of the observations of the P126 event in South America.

One of the larger and more poorly studied groups of skinks includes members of the subfamily Scincinae distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan African scincines are one of the many groups of lizards that show limb reduction and loss, and the genus Scelotes offers an excellent opportunity to look at limb loss in a phylogenetic context. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed for a total of 52 taxa representing all subfamilies of skinks as well as other Autarchoglossan families using sequence from six gene regions including; 12S, 16S, and cytochrome b (mitochondrial), as well as alpha-Enolase, 18S, and C-mos (nuclear). The family Scincidae is recovered as monophyletic and is the sister taxon to a (Cordylidae+Xantusiidae) clade. Within skinks the subfamily Acontinae is monophyletic and sister group to all remaining skinks. There is no support for the monophyly of the subfamilies Lygosominae and Scincinae, but sub-Saharan African scincines+Feylinia form a well supported monophyletic group. The monophyly of Scelotes is confirmed, and support is found for two geographic groups within the genus. Reconstructions of ancestral states for limb and digital characters show limited support for the reversal or gain of both digits and limbs, but conservative interpretation of the results suggest that limb loss is common, occurring multiple times throughout evolutionary history, and is most likely not reversible.","AcknowledgementsSpecial thanks go to J.

Results indicated that the most important health actions around healthy eating were, 'washing hands'; around dressing, 'wearing warm clothes'; around keeping clean, 'washing body and hair'; going to sleep, 'washing body'; activity at school, 'read and write'; recess and leisure time, 'playing football or netball'. Personal hygiene (washing, brushing teeth, etc.) was the most common health action of the children around healthy eating, keeping clean and going to sleep. Some health actions were insufficiently mentioned, brushing teeth for example and some wrongly mentioned such as eating porridge before going to sleep.

At low evaporation temperature, 200 °C, clusters with an average size of 3.5 nm are formed on the surface. The mobility of the small clusters is so high, even at room temperature, that most of the clusters are trapped at surface defects. By increasing the evaporation temperature to 230 °C, larger clusters are formed which have lower mobility. The growth process is identified as a Volmer-Weber mechanism. On increasing the evaporation temperature further to 250 °C, crystals with dendritic shape are formed with an average size of 150 nm. The terraces of the crystal are formed with the (102) basal plane of the α-phase. Molecular resolution on the terrace also allows us to identify the molecular mechanism involved in the growth of the dendritic crystals.",,,Surface Science,,,,2003-12,2003,,2003-12,547,3,385-393,Closed,Article,"Chen, Q.; Rada, T.; Bitzer, Th.; Richardson, N.V.","Chen, Q.

Sixty percent of the isolates carried 1 of the 22 known tet genes examined. The distribution was as follows. The tet(A) gene was found in six isolates. The tet(B) gene was found in two isolates, including the first description in the genus Brevundimonas: Two isolates carried the tet(34) and tet(B) genes, including the first description of the tet(34) gene in Pseudomonas and Serratia and the first description of the tet(B) gene in Pseudomonas: The tet(H) gene was found in two isolates, which includes the first description in the genera Moraxella and Acinetobacter: One isolate carried tet(E), and one isolate carried tet(35), the first description of the gene in the genus Stenotrophomonas: Finally, one isolate carried tet(L), found for the first time in the genus Morganella: By DNA sequence analysis, the two tet(H) genes were indistinguishable from the previously sequenced tet(H) gene from Tn5706 found in Pasteurella multocida. The Acinetobacter radioresistens isolate also harbored the Tn5706-associated 1,063-bp IS element IS1597, while the Moraxella isolate carried a 1,026-bp IS-like element whose 293-amino-acid transposase protein exhibited 69% identity and 84% similarity to the transposase protein of IS1597, suggesting the presence of a novel IS element. The distribution of tet genes from the Chilean freshwater ponds was different than those that have previously been described from other geographical locations, with 40% of the isolates carrying unidentified tetracycline resistance genes.",,,Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,,,"Animal Feed; Bacteria; Chile; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Bacterial; In Situ Hybridization; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Oligonucleotide Probes; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Salmon; Sewage; Tetracycline Resistance; Tetracyclines; Transformation, Bacterial; Water Microbiology",2003-03-01,2003,2003-03-01,2003-03,47,3,883-888,All OA; Green,Article,"Miranda, Claudio D.; Kehrenberg, Corinna; Ulep, Catherine; Schwarz, Stefan; Roberts, Marilyn C.","Miranda, Claudio D.

By using the generalized flux, i.e., Robin-type of boundary conditions for the heat transfer in such a capillary domain, it is possible to identify clearly conditions under which the velocity field will depend crucially on the basic parameters and, therefore, what types of flow regimes may arise in the capillary channel. In addition, it is possible to conclude under what conditions the velocity field will not at all depend on some of these. The behavior is intimately tied to the symmetrical conditions associated with the temperature field in the system. A ""skew"" or asymmetrical parameter, W infinity, has been identified in the temperature profiles; this parameter is useful for studying the role of the symmetrical conditions on the hydrodynamics field and in determining a set of a priori design criteria that limits the range of values of the parameters.

In this context, the finding of remains from five individuals dated to the 9th millenium BP on the re-excavations at Baño Nuevo Cave (Andean Central Patagonia, Chile) is particularly interesting. They may not appear excessively old, but several radiocarbon dates (two of them done through AMS directly on the bone of one of the individuals) place them among the very few well-dated early human skeletons throughout the Americas. The small sample size militates against any interpretation of biological affiliation (to say nothing of population movements) and we can only affirm that these people belonged to a generalized “mongoloid stock”, different from historically known Patagonian populations. After a brief presentation of the skeletal evidence and the bone dating methods, we evaluate the relevance of this context with respect to the sparse osteological record of humans in the Americas on the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.","AcknowledgmentsWe want to thank the Baño Nuevo excavation team that included Victor Lucero and Valentina Trejo besides the two main authors.

Following a triple vaccination with a total dose of 150 microl BCG plus 60 microg or 30 microg of LPG for hamsters and BALB/c mice respectively, there were no noticeable side effects both locally and systemically; implying that the molecule was safe at this dosage level. Vaccinated animals demonstrated an activation of both the humoral as well as cell-mediated responses to LPG, which correlated with resistance against the disease. Protection by LPG plus BCG, was however, poor as the remaining immunized animals showed disease progression leading to severity of the disease as illustrated by emaciation, mass loss and heavy splenic parasitaemia in hamsters.

The present investigation uses a centrifugation method to isolate and purify hepatopancreatic lysosomes from the American lobster, Homarus americanus. Purified lysosomal preparations were used to characterize membrane transport mechanisms in these organelles for transferring and sequestering cytoplasmic copper following its absorption across the plasma membrane from dietary constituents. The copper-specific fluorescent dye, Phen Green, was employed to quantify transmembrane fluxes of this metal as has been recently used to investigate copper movements across hepatopancreatic mitochondrial and plasma membranes. Results indicated the presence of a vanadate-sensitive, calcium-stimulated, copper ATPase in the membranes of these organelles that displayed high affinity carrier-mediated transport kinetics and may significantly contribute to organismic copper homeostasis. Together with a putative bafilomycin-sensitive V-ATPase in the membrane of the same organelles, importing hydrogen ions into the organellar interior, this copper ATPase may function as part of a physiological mechanism for precipitate formation between metallic cations and anions. These ionic precipitate complexes may then act as a sink for excess metals and thereby reduce the circulating concentrations of these elements.",AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by US National Science Foundation grant number IBN99-74569 and Chilean International Cooperation Program PCCI/CONICYT.,,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part C Toxicology & Pharmacology,,,"Animals; Biological Transport; Calcium; Copper; Fluorescence; Hepatopancreas; Lysosomes; Male; Models, Biological; Nephropidae; Vanadates; Verapamil",2003-06,2003,,2003-06,135,2,107-118,Closed,Article,"Chavez-Crooker, Pamela; Garrido, Nestor; Pozo, Patricia; Ahearn, Gregory A.","Chavez-Crooker, Pamela (Laboratory of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, Facultad Recursos del Mar, Universidad de Antofagasta, Casilla 170 Antofagasta, Chile); Garrido, Nestor (Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Casilla 1280 Antofagasta, Chile); Pozo, Patricia (Laboratory of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, Facultad Recursos del Mar, Universidad de Antofagasta, Casilla 170 Antofagasta, Chile); Ahearn, Gregory A.

In order to get an overview on the genetic relatedness of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) landraces and cultivars grown in low-input conditions of small-scale farming systems, 46 sorghum accessions derived from Southern Africa were evaluated on the basis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs), random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). By this approach all sorghum accessions were uniquely fingerprinted by all marker systems. Mean genetic similarity was estimated at 0.88 based on RAPDs, 0.85 using AFLPs and 0.31 based on SSRs. In addition to this, genetic distance based on SSR data was estimated at 57 according to a stepwise mutation model (Δμ-SSR). All UPGMA-clusters showed a good fit to the similarity estimates (AFLPs: r = 0.92; RAPDs: r = 0.88; SSRs: r = 0.87; Δμ-SSRs: r = 0.85). By UPGMA-clustering two main clusters were built on all marker systems comprising landraces on the one hand and newly developed varieties on the other hand. Further sub-groupings were not unequivocal. Genetic diversity (H, DI) was estimated on a similar level within landraces and breeding varieties. Comparing the three approaches to each other, RAPD and AFLP similarity indices were highly correlated (r = 0.81), while the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between SSRs and AFLPs was r = 0.57 and r = 0.51 between RAPDs and SSRs. Applying a stepwise mutation model on the SSR data resulted in an intermediate correlation coefficient between Δμ-SSRs and AFLPs (r = 0.66) and RAPDs (r = 0.67), respectively, while SSRs and Δμ-SSRs showed a lower correlation coefficient (r = 0.52). The highest bootstrap probabilities were found using AFLPs (56% on average) while SSR, Δμ-SSR and RAPD-based similarity estimates had low mean bootstrap probabilities (24%, 27%, 30%, respectively). The coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated genetic similarity decreased with an increasing number of bands and was lowest using AFLPs.","The author would like to thank Natalia Lest, Franziska Müller and Roland Kürschner for their excellent technical assistance.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants in this study were 435 secondary-school adolescent students around the Pietersburg area (Central Region), in the Northern Province. Two hundred and forty-three (56%) participants were female and 192 (44%) were male. They were aged between 15 and 19 years, with the mean age of 17.25 years (S.D.=1.34). Their educational level ranged between standards 7 and 10 (Grades 9-12).
INSTRUMENTS: Participants' demographic variables were determined by use of a questionnaire which covered participants personal characteristics such as age and gender, as well as educational level. Illicit drug use, cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking behaviour were also measured using the questionnaire.
RESULTS: Findings of this study indicate the prevalence rate of 19.8% for illicit drug use, 10.6% for cigarette smoking and 39.1% for alcohol consumption among the participants. Both drug use, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are associated more with males than with females. The majority of the drug users and cigarette smokers indicated that they do so when they are bored, tired or stressed up, or at parties; and most of those who drink alcohol indicated that they do so at parties, weekends, or any other time. The mean age for first drug use is 14.9 years (S.D.=1.77); 14.54 years (S.D.=1.80) for first cigarette smoking and 15.33 years (S.D.=1.91) for first alcohol consumption. Among those who drink alcohol, 24.1% and 14.1% experience unplanned drunkenness and irritability, respectively. Unplanned drunkenness is associated with males, while unplanned irritability (after drinking alcohol) is not associated with any gender.
CONCLUSION: Mental health workers and the law-enforcement agencies should take note of the above findings while planning preventive and therapeutic strategies for the reduction of drug use, cigarette smoking and alcohol use and abuse among adolescents in the area.",,,Journal of Adolescence,,,Adolescent; Alcohol Drinking; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Incidence; Male; Mathematical Computing; Motivation; Rural Population; Smoking; Smoking Prevention; Social Facilitation; South Africa; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population,2003-01-21,2003,2003-01-21,2003-02,26,1,121-136,Closed,Article,"Madu, Sylvester Ntomchukwu; Matla, Ma‐Queen Patience","Madu, Sylvester Ntomchukwu (Department of Psychology, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga, 0727, South Africa); Matla, Ma‐Queen Patience (Department of Psychology, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga, 0727, South Africa)","Madu, Sylvester Ntomchukwu (University of Limpopo); Matla, Ma‐Queen Patience (University of Limpopo)","Madu, Sylvester Ntomchukwu (University of Limpopo); Matla, Ma‐Queen Patience (University of Limpopo)",95,8,1.73,9.31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014547873,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

A mandatory requirement for clinical immunoisolated transplantations is the reproducible production of biocompatible alginate. As shown here for alginates extracted from freshly collected algal stipes, the current assays used for validation of the quality of the alginate are not sufficient to screen for impurities arising from spores of gram-positive bacteria (and related contaminants). To assess the quality of alginate, we have developed a cell assay based on the induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells. This assay allows in combination with the ""modified mixed lymphocyte"" assay a rapid and sensitive screening for any fibrosis-inducing impurities in alginate samples (even during the purification regime) as demonstrated by transplantation experiments performed in parallel with BB rats (exhibiting an elevated macrophage activity). The results clearly demonstrate that the quality of the input algal material is of key relevance for the production of transplantation-grade alginate.","AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the company TAURUS, Lüderitz, for permission to collect kelp at the coast of Namibia.

Little is known of the coral fauna and coral communities of Sala y Gómez Island. Information on Easter Island's coral fauna has increased slowly, from sporadic taxonomic studies in the early to late 1900s to a comprehensive reconnaissance of subtidal communities published in 1988. Eleven species of zooxanthellate corals are currently recognized and only two of these, Pocillopora verrucosa and Porites lobata, contribute significantly to the live substrate cover. Coral communities are prevalent around most island exposures, best developed from about 5–50 m depth, except for the southeastern shore which is frequently subject to strong wave assault. Unfortunately, little information is available for any resource species. Official statistics or estimates of population size, fishing effort or pressure have not been kept at the same pace as on mainland Chile because many of the harvested species are locally consumed and have not been declared fished resources. Corals themselves are either sold as whole bleached colonies or as carved statues, jewelry, and parts of other curios. Recently, the Chilean government has realized the importance of protecting these coral communities that contain a high percentage of endemic species. With the recent establishment of Chile's first three submarine parks at Easter island, this new level of governmental sanction, with increased public awareness and support, should help sustain the biodiversity and vitality of the island's unique coral communities.",,,,Latin American Coral Reefs,,,2003,2003,,2003,,Ambiente y Desarollo21986,473-494,Closed,Chapter,"Glynn, Peter W.; Wellington, Gerard M.; Wieters, Evie A.; Navarrete, Sergio A.","Glynn, Peter W.

The Humboldt penguins were also fitted with masks for determining rates of air flow during breathing. During periods of higher gas exchange requirement, Humboldt penguins opened their beaks during inspiration, where tidal volume was linearly correlated with both change in beak angle and maximum beak angle, closed them slightly during the final stages of inspiration and finally closed them during expiration. Substantial differences were apparent between individuals. Contrary to the condition proposed for most birds, our data suggest that expiration is passive during periods of high respiratory tidal volumes, and that the increased resistance of the respiratory pathway serves to slow air flow so as to maximize gas exchange in the lungs. During foraging, Magellanic penguins at the surface between dives showed similar breathing patterns but maximum beak angles were much higher and breath cycle time shorter, as would be expected for animals attempting to maximize gas exchange. Both maximum beak angle per breath and breath frequency changed systematically over the surface pause; both were initially high, then decreased to a low before rising again to a maximum just before diving. Based on known changes in tidal volume with beak angle derived from Humboldt penguins, a simple model is proposed to examine rates of gas exchange over the surface pause. This indicates that the observed patterns do not maximize the rate of transfer of oxygen over the whole of the surface pause but are rather concerned with an initial rapid accumulation of oxygen in the tissues followed by effective carbon dioxide release.","References Support for this work was given by the grant FONDECYT 1010250 (to G.L.-J.),grants from the Chicago Zoological Society, the Riverbanks Zoological Park and Botanical Garden Conservation Support Fund, the German Academic Exchange Servive (to A.S.) and ICSU (to R.P.W.).

853,pub.1050570316,10.1017/s1464793102006024,12803420,,Climatic variability and the evolution of insect freeze tolerance,"Insects may survive subzero temperatures by two general strategies: Freeze-tolerant insects withstand the formation of internal ice, while freeze-avoiding insects die upon freezing. While it is widely recognized that these represent alternative strategies to survive low temperatures, and mechanistic understanding of the physical and molecular process of cold tolerance are becoming well elucidated, the reasons why one strategy or the other is adopted remain unclear. Freeze avoidance is clearly basal within the arthropod lineages, and it seems that freeze tolerance has evolved convergently at least six times among the insects (in the Blattaria, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera). Of the pterygote insect species whose cold-tolerance strategy has been reported in the literature, 29% (69 of 241 species studied) of those in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas 85 % (11 of 13 species) in the Southern Hemisphere exhibit freeze tolerance. A randomization test indicates that this predominance of freeze tolerance in the Southern Hemisphere is too great to be due to chance, and there is no evidence of a recent publication bias in favour of new reports of freeze-tolerant species. We conclude from this that the specific nature of cold insect habitats in the Southern Hemisphere, which are characterized by oceanic influence and climate variability must lead to strong selection in favour of freeze tolerance in this hemisphere. We envisage two main scenarios where it would prove advantageous for insects to be freeze tolerant. In the first, characteristic of cold continental habitats of the Northern Hemisphere, freeze tolerance allows insects to survive very low temperatures for long periods of time, and to avoid desiccation. These responses tend to be strongly seasonal, and insects in these habitats are only freeze tolerant for the overwintering period. By contrast, in mild and unpredictable environments, characteristic of habitats influenced by the Southern Ocean, freeze tolerance allows insects which habitually have ice nucleators in their guts to survive summer cold snaps, and to take advantage of mild winter periods without the need for extensive seasonal cold hardening. Thus, we conclude that the climates of the two hemispheres have led to the parallel evolution of freeze tolerance for very different reasons, and that this hemispheric difference is symptomatic of many wide-scale disparities in Northern and Southern ecological processes.",,,Biological Reviews,,,Acclimatization; Animals; Biological Evolution; Cold Climate; Cold Temperature; Freezing; Insecta,2003-05,2003,2007-03-15,2003-05,78,2,181-195,Closed,Article,"SINCLAIR, BRENT J.; ADDO‐BEDIAKO, A.; CHOWN, STEVEN L.","SINCLAIR, BRENT J.

This site is the first of its kind in the Chuquicamata-Tomic area, and was occupied from close to the end of the Formative Period, until the Late Intermediate. The relationship between extractive mining activities, associated to ceramics from the southern Altiplano, the occidental valleys of Tarapaca, the Loa and Atacama basins, and their caravanning routes, position Chu-2 as a site that is a key to the understanding of mining labour outside the valleys, in environments far from any water resource. This enables an account of the purposes of Atacamita, and native and coloured copper mining, from the uses of the material that was needed for smelting and those used in ornamental and ritual applications. We propose that the site does not represent an isolated or spontaneous event, but the presence of mining groups that came from stable settlements, suggesting expansive exploitation politics that stemmed from the middle and higher Loa regions and San Pedro de Atacama",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2003,2003,2003,,,25,7-34,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"A, Lautaro Nez; P, Carolina Agero; C, Brbara Cases; de Souza H., Patricio","A, Lautaro Nez (Universidad Catlica del Norte, Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo R.

Ambas poblaciones coexistieron e interactuaron en este territorio hasta fechas cercanas al 900 d.C.
Recent studies in the Andean mountains of central Chile allow us to identify the coexistence of two different ways of life in the same territory during the Early Ceramic period (350 B.C. to A.D. 900). On the one hand, one way of life corresponds to a populations of hunter-gatherers who continued the Archaic tradition, especially in economic aspects and in a mainly curated lithic technology, while acquiring a few pots from other ceramic-producing groups. On the other hand, a second way of life corresponds to a semi-sedentary population with a horticultural economy, a developed ceramic technology, and a mainly expedient lithic assemblage. Both populations coexisted and interacted until around A.D. 900.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2003-12,2003,2017-01-20,2003-12,14,4,389-407,Closed,Article,"B., Luis E.

Evidence of growth in the number of private institutions and enrollment suggests that higher education is becoming increasingly diversified into two sectors – public and private. While this appears to be true throughout Latin America, and much of the developing world, recent evidence from Argentina casts doubt on the degree to which private sector growth trends may actually translate into a significant increase in the impact of private institutions in higher education, where impact is proxied by the relative share of student enrollment and graduates. This study explores the dimensions and impact of private expansion in Argentina, and places the findings in a comparative (regional) and theoretical framework. The analysis shows that, despite unprecedented growth in the number of private universities, the public sector remains the dominant provider of university education. Private institutions, while certainly more numerous and training a growing number of students, do not account for a larger share of university enrollment. They have, however, developed specific niches (e.g., in graduate level training and in urban areas). Significantly, following a pattern of institutional proliferation found throughout Latin America, some private universities offer elite alternatives to prestigious public institutions. The findings serve to qualify apparent `gains' in private higher education and to underscore the need for further research into the relevant intrasectoral (public and private) dimensions of change in post-secondary education.",,,Higher Education,,,,2003-07,2003,,2003-07,46,1,1-35,Closed,Article,"de Cohen, Clemencia Cosentino","de Cohen, Clemencia Cosentino (Sociology Department, Princeton University, Sociology Department, Wallace Hall, 08544, Princeton, New Jersey, USA)",,"de Cohen, Clemencia Cosentino (Princeton University)",12,0,,2.85,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035434935,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

Este estudio contempl una prospeccin de la cuenca de Santiago, la excavacin de tres nuevos sitios y el anlisis de colecciones recuperadas previamente en la zona. Los anlisis fueron llevados a cabo desde una perspectiva integral, aplicando un mismo marco metodolgico a todos los materiales estudiados. Adems se realiz un programa de fechados que consider tanto el refechado de sitios como la datacin de los nuevos sitios excavados. Los resultados permitieron proponer un primer momento caracterizado por comunidades alfareras iniciales, vigente desde la aparicin de la alfarera en la zona hasta ca. 200 d.C. En esta fecha se configuran claramente dos unidades, Llolleo y Bato, que se desarrollan en forma contempornea hasta alrededor del 1000 d.C., ocupando este espacio de manera interdigitada. Estas unidades no slo se diferencian a partir de sus expresiones materiales y tradiciones tecnolgicas, sino tambin representan una orientacin econmica y una ideologa distintas. Junto a estas dos unidades, los resultados permitieron esbozar la presencia de al menos otras dos (Chacayes y EMI/RML001), que no obstante, por la escasez de datos, no pudieron ser bien definidas This paper presents the results of recent archaeological research on the Early Ceramic Period in Central Chile. The study includes results from an extensive archaeological survey in the Santiago Basin, the excavation of three domestic sites and the analysis of artifact collections from several previously excavated sites. All the archaeological materials were submitted to the same methodological approach. We can differentiate a brief initial period, from the first ceramic occurrence until ca. A.D. 200, where the few known sites can be grouped under the label ""Initial Ceramic Communities"". Later and until A.D. 1000, two archaeological units, Llolleo y Bato, can be clearly distinguished and characterized. Both have a similar temporal development and are distributed over the same area. These archaeological units have been equated to social groups that have different material expressions, technological traditions, economic strategies and ideologies. The most outstanding feature of this social configuration is the spatial proximity and intermingling of social entities that keep and express overtly their difference in relation to others. A few sites (Chacayes) and groups of sites (EMI/RML001), also dated to the Early Ceramic Period in this region, do not share cultural characteristics with either of these complexes leading us to believe that an even wider diversification of social groupings is probable during this period.

The question of the prominence of ancestral worship in early settled communities and its role in societal formation has been an ongoing discussion for Andean archaeologists. Recent archaeological research in the Titicaca Basin suggests that this dynamic was important in the earliest societal formation. This thesis is based in part on the evidence that early architecture was for civic memorials rather than domestic habitation. In addition the artifactual remains suggest these constructions were in part for ancestor veneration. Community creation and social experimentation charged by ritual are illustrated at the Formative site of Chiripa on the Taraco Peninsula in Bolivia. To demonstrate this thesis of community creation through rituals surrounding ancestral energies, the role of relational personhood, kinship, and social memory in community construction, based on practice theory is first outlined. Next the place of burials in the Andean world and the creation of ancestors are dealt with. Finally the ritual and memorials as seen in the archaeological evidence spanning 1500 years is traced.","AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Matthew Bandy, Ian Hodder, Bill Isbell, Jerry Moore, Lee Steadman, Chip Stanish, all the members of the Taraco Archaeological Project, in addition to three reviewers for thoughtful and perceptive comments on this subject.

Fifteen morphological characters were measured and used to compile a dendrogram. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were also used to assess the level of polymorphism between the 14 Solanum genotypes. Three EcoR I/Mse I primer combinations with three selective nucleotides per primer were used for screening the respective genotypes. Multiple polymorphisms could be detected to the extent that all the genotypes studied could be distinguished, using any single primer combination, thus showing the usefulness of AFLP's for this purpose. Up to 43 polymorphic bands were detected with a single primer combination among the 14 different genotypes. The three primer combinations generated a total of 359 bands, of which 222 (62%) were clearly polymorphic. This data was used to compile a dendrogram.

521,pub.1102309346,10.2139/ssrn.1814715,,,Privatization in Colombia: A Plant Performance Analysis,"This paper describes the privatization program carried out in the productive sector of the Colombian economy during the 1990s. It evaluates privatization within the policy context of general market deregulation and the promotion of private investment in the provision of public infrastructure and domiciliary public services. Two case studies are explored: the manufacturing and power sectors. The paper follows the ex-post measuring and econometric analysis of a set of operative and restructuring performance indicators for the privatized firms. For manufacturing, the study sample consists of 30 large manufacturing firms of which the Instituto de Fomento Industrial was the founding or supporting partner. The main findings suggest that those firms followed pro-cyclical behavior relative to their private competitors and undertook tight plant operative restructuring. For the power sector, the paper studies the impact of regulatory reform on market entry, ownership structure, market competition, and productive efficiency of the privatized holdings. The results suggest that privatization and entry competition in power generation have had a positive effect on the privatized utilities’ efficiency and investment. With respect to thermal generation, the measurement of productive efficiency follows a data envelope analysis technique based on a sample of 33 plants that account for 85% of the installed capacity. The sample units are plants that were active before the reform and new entrants that started business operations after the reform. The main outcome shows that efficiency scores have improved after the reform and that regulatory policy has had a positive effect on productive efficiency.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2003,2003,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Pombo, Carlos; Ramírez, Manuel","Pombo, Carlos (Universidad de los Andes, Colombia - School of Management); Ramírez, Manuel (affiliation not provided to SSRN)",,"Pombo, Carlos (Universidad de los Andes, Colombia - School of Management); Ramírez, Manuel (affiliation not provided to SSRN)",7,0,,1.28,https://repository.urosario.edu.co:443/bitstreams/215202c6-4d82-4aec-9198-a9ed107fbf25/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102309346,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This examination of the impact of globalisation on the restructuring of public sector universities in South Africa in the 1990s demonstrates that the picture is far more complex. Over the last thirty years, globalisation has been intertwined with neoliberal capitalist economic and ideological restructuring. This is refracted, in the first instance, through State policy, and, in the second, through specific local sites of power relations and class struggles that are, in turn, structured by the resources and responses of different actors. While the neoliberal component of globalisation has played a decisive role in shaping State higher education policy in South Africa, the actual implementation of the model of the market-orientated university receiving minimal support from a deficit conscious State has varied considerably between universities. Using a case study of the rise of support service outsourcing in the campuses, this paper demonstrates that management capacity and labour resistance play a central role in explaining divergence in the sector. The conclusion is that local struggles play a central role in shaping the extent to which globalisation is able to shape given sites of social relations, and that globalisation is refracted through, and reproduces, existing configurations of power.",,,Society in Transition,,,,2003-07,2003,,2003-07,34,2,272-294,Closed,Article,"van der Walt, Lucien; Bolsmann, Chris; Johnson, Bernadette; Martin, Lindsey","van der Walt, Lucien (Department of Sociology, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, South Africa, E-mail:, vanderwaltl@social.wits.ac.za); Bolsmann, Chris (Department of Sociology, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, South Africa, E-mail:, vanderwaltl@social.wits.ac.za); Johnson, Bernadette (Department of Sociology, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, South Africa, E-mail:, vanderwaltl@social.wits.ac.za); Martin, Lindsey (Department of Sociology, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, South Africa, E-mail:, vanderwaltl@social.wits.ac.za)",,"van der Walt, Lucien (University of the Witwatersrand); Bolsmann, Chris (University of the Witwatersrand); Johnson, Bernadette (University of the Witwatersrand); Martin, Lindsey (University of the Witwatersrand)",6,0,,1.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041806925,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 44 Human Society",

The highest number of perpetrators is found either among family/extended family members of victims (sexual kiss: 40.9%, sexual touch: 27.2%, oral/anal/vaginal intercourse: 42.5%) or among people entrusted with care of the participant as a child (sexual kiss: 20.4%, sexual touch: 40.7%, oral/anal/vaginal intercourse: 45%). Most of the perpetrators are people known to the victims (sexual kiss: 73.4%, sexual touch: 61.1%, oral/anal/vaginal intercourse: 77.5%). Many victims (83% of the victims) perceived themselves (possibly in line with their societal or traditional perceptions and attitudes towards child abuse) as not sexually abused during childhood; and most rated their childhood as either as “average” (41.3% of the victims) or as “very happy” (41.3% of the victims). The author discusses the above results from the ecological approach to human development, bringing out how child’s environment (the micro-, meso-, exo-, and macrosystems) can contribute adversely to the development of the individual. It is recommended that programmes against child sexual abuse should involve also children and their parents as providers.",,,Journal of Human Ecology,,,,2003-07,2003,2017-10-24,2003-07,14,4,253-262,Closed,Article,"Madu, S.N.","Madu, S.N.

Anthropometric measurements for height for age (HAZ), weight for age (WAZ), body mass index (BMI) and sum of skinfolds (SOS) were carried out to establish their ‘health status’. Educational achievement tests for Mathematics and English were administered to check their educational status.The results of the multilevel analysis showed that HAZ, WAZ and BMI were positively related to both English and Mathematics performance. HAZ was only positively related to mathematical performance and SOS was not related to educational achievement at all. Furthermore, age and gender only marginally influenced the observed relationships.The study recommends that other factors such as socio-economic status and learning environment should be looked into to find out whether these factors influence the observed relationships.","AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation (NRF), the Vrije University in Amsterdam and the University of the North for their financial support.

A population of the congeneric H. purcelli, was used as a reference group. A total of 25 loci were resolved from 14 enzymes and an unspecified protein. Of the 25 loci resolved, eight were variable within or across populations, revealing an overall polymorphism of 32% but not more than 8% in any individual population. Four of the H. natalensis populations sampled were monoallelic, whereas the fifth population displayed an average heterozygosity of 2.97%. However, there was considerable variation among H. natalensis populations, including monomorphic populations, with fixed allelic differences at three loci. Gene flow among H. natalensis populations was 0.156–0.915 migrants per generation for four pairwise comparisons but zero for the remaining six pairs; the latter is unusual for conspecific populations. The overall intraspecific fixation index value for H. natalensis was 0.876, not much lower than the interspecific FST value of 0.912 calculated when data for H. natalensis and H. purcelli was pooled for comparison. This confirms low gene flow and tight selection within microhabitats. Genetic distances ranged from 0.008 to 0.128 between conspecific populations, increasing to 0.182–0.284 between the H. natalensis populations sampled, and H. purcelli. The results are discussed with reference to the relationship between low genetic heterogeneity, response to selection and habitat tolerance of frogs.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank Ian Pattrick, warden of Krantzkloof nature reserve, Jerry Theron, Mpumalanga Parks Board and Beatrice Jordaan from the University of the North for assistance during sample collection.

In a questionnaire-based study approximately 21% of interviewed resource-poor farmers (n = 150) indicated that they experienced problems with ticks and tick-borne diseases. About 56% of farmers indicated that tick-related problems were most severe in summer, while 32% indicated that the most problems were encountered in winter. About 12% indicated that the tick problems were experienced throughout the year. Farmers also indicated that the highest tick burdens were experienced between spring and early winter. The principal ticks infesting cattle (n = 30) were found to be Boophilus decoloratus (53.1%), Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (44.7%). Rhipicephalus follis (1.0%). Rhipicephalus gertrudae (0.7%) and Rhipicephalus warburtoni (0.4%). On small stock (n = 188). R. evertsi evertsi (68%) and B. decoloratus (32%) were recorded as the main ticks in the study area. A sero-epidemiological survey of cattle (n = 386) showed that 94% of cattle were seropositive for Babesia bigemina by IFAT. while 87% were sero-positive for Anaplasma by indirect ELISA. All the animals were sero-negative for Babesia bovis and this is probably because the tick vector, Boophilus microplus, is not present in the study area. All sheep and goats were sero-positive for Theileria species by IFAT while 85% of sheep and 100% of goats tested positive for Anaplasma species by competition inhibition ELISA. The high incidence of positive serological results for B. bigemina and Anaplasma in cattle, and Theileria and Anaplasma in sheep and goats and the absence of clinical cases would indicate that this area is endemically stable for these diseases.",,,,Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens,"Frans Jongejan, W.

The Telecommunications, 1996 (Act 103 of 1996) establishes a Human Resources Fund to promote the provision of adequately skilled human resources at all levels of the telecommunications sector in numbers sufficient for the telecommunications needs of the country. The Department of Communication Web Internet Laboratories (DoC-WILs) emphasise skills development through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in areas such as network management, creating Websites, use of e-mail and the World Wide Web, multimedia applications and Intranet development. It is, however, not known under what contextual circumstances this kind of ICT-usage will lead to interactive learning benefits and how the DoC-WILs should go about achieving them. This article therefore attempts to shed some light on the conditions under which ICT usage could impact on educational outcomes desired by the DoC-WILs and on how these DoC-WILs could best go about taking appropriate actions to improve the possibility of achieving desired interactive learning benefits. It is argued that the ability of the DoC-WILs to achieve desired benefits successfully is crucially dependent on contextual conditions, policies or processes that apply to the DoC-WILs or their users. This is in line with the social shaping of technology approach that local circumstances surrounding the deployment of ICTs in different sectors of society are more important in shaping the consequence of ICTs than technological variables.",,,Communicatio,,,,2003-01,2003,,2003-01,29,1-2,233-249,Closed,Article,"Tlabela, K R U; Conradie, D P","Tlabela, K R U (); Conradie, D P ()",,"Tlabela, K R U (); Conradie, D P ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005915162,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",4 Quality Education

The questionnaire asked questions about perceived parental undesirable behaviours during childhood, and childhood sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Logistic Regression Analysis shows that among all the participants, ‘parent haven gone into a psychiatric hospital for psychiatric problems’ and ‘parent haven had problems with drugs or alcohol’ predict child sexual abuse. ‘Participant’s feeling of being mistreated because of parental psychiatric problems’ and ‘parent hitting or beating up the other parent’ predict child physical abuse. Again, ‘Parent hitting or beating up the other parent’ predict child emotional abuse.

The biological activities of the compounds and x‐ray structure of Ni[C6H5CONHNH2]3Cl2·3CH3OH are also reported. The microanalyses showed that the hydrazides reacted with the nickel(II) salts in 1:3 (metal:ligand) molar ratio. The hydrazide ligand behaves as a neutral bidentate chelating ligand with coordination involving the carbonyl oxygen and the amino nitrogen of the hydrazide moiety. The effective magnetic moments (μeff), infrared and electronic spectra of the compounds are consistent with a six‐coordinate pseudo‐octahedral arrangement of the ligands around the nickel ion. The x‐ray diffraction analysis of Ni[C6H5CONHNH2]3Cl2·3CH3OH showed that it crystallizes as a triclinic system with a P‐1 space group, a=10.2289(5), b=12.0707(6), c=14.0477(7) Å, α=67.5540(10)°, β=69.2360(10)°, γ=73.7860(10)°. The nickel ion is coordinated by three units of benzoic acid hydrazide with the chloride ions and the methanol solvates uncoordinated in the crystal lattice. The compounds show some measurable activity against selected bacteria and fungi.","This work was supported by the University of the North in the form of a Senate Research Grant 1881.

It was found that small concentrations of wax improved physical properties such as thermal stability, elastic modulus and yield stress. At higher concentrations, however, due to crystal phase separation, wax deteriorates the thermal as well as the mechanical properties. It was also shown that a formerly established two‐process model for the stress relaxation in semicrystalline polymers could be used for the explanation of the viscoelastic behaviour of the blends.

Two raters extracted a comprehensive list of value descriptive nouns from two Northern Sotho dictionaries. The list comprised a total of 210 terms. Four hundred individuals, 256 men and 144 women, from the Limpopo Province of the Republic of South Africa, participated. Their mean age was 24.6 years (SD = 7.9). The participants rated these concepts on an 11-point-scale with regard to their subjective importance as guiding motives in life. The principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation yielded five factors which explained 42.3% of total variance: (I) Religiosity and Support, (II) Solidarity (ukuzwdana, ubunye or ubudlelwane), (III) Conformity and Benevolence, (IV) Leadership and Achievement, and (V) Human Enhancement. With respect to cross-cultural comparisons the outcome of the study shows that in Northern Sotho, religious themes and social commitment play a more important role than in German, and that religious issues correlate with social concerns.

The only water resource for the population (about 420,000 habitants) and the mining industry (the most important economic activity in the region) is the 440 km long Rio Loa. Moreover, this is highly enriched in As. In order to assess As concentrations and sources, and to evaluate the impact of mining activity on the water quality in the Rio Loa basin, water and sediment samples were taken at strategic points along the river and its major tributaries. The water in the whole basin is quite saline (total dissolved solids up to 11 g/l) and heavily enriched in As (average: 1400 μg/l) and B (average: 21,000 μg/l). These values are up to 300 and 100 times higher than the respective guidelines suggested by the WHO for drinking water. The quality of water is extremely poor along the tributary Salado, mainly fed by the El Tatio geothermal waters that are very rich in As (up to 27,000 μg/l) and other components. Sediments from the Rio Loa and its tributaries have As contents in the range of 26–2000 mg/kg (mean value of 60 samples: 320 mg/kg), and reach 11,000 mg/kg at El Tatio. Sequential extraction analyses show the As to be mainly associated with Fe–Mn oxy-hydroxides and residual phases, but part of the As (about 20%) is readily available being extracted from the exchangeable and carbonate phases. This result is in agreement with the correlation observed between As content in sediments and As concentration in waters in the area. The extreme arid conditions, high evaporation, and the lack of low-As tributaries contribute to maintain high concentrations of As and other components in the Rio Loa water to the mouth. Due to the oxidising conditions, neutral to alkaline pH, high salinity and high As concentrations, adsorption of As-species is not favoured. The main As source in the Rio Loa basin is considered to be natural, i.e. linked to the lithologies in the area. Smelter emissions and mining wastes, as well as the As-rich effluents from the water treatment plants, possibly represent additional sources.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the European Community for supporting the research (WAQUAMINAR Project, EC Contract no.

The sample included 402 doctors, 59.5 per cent male and 40.5 per cent female. The majority were Whites (59.3 per cent), followed by African Black (21.3 per cent), and Asians (14 per cent). Results showed that the overall job stress index indicated with 4.9, high job stress levels among the doctors. High severity job stress ratings included (1) fellow workers not doing their job, (2) inadequate salary and (3) covering work for another employee and high frequency of job stress, (4) working overtime, making critical on‐the‐spot decisions and dealing with crisis situations. Female doctors felt significantly more lack of support on job stress severity than male doctors. High levels of burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization) were found among doctors. Job stress predicted emotional exhaustion and depersonalization but not personal accomplishment. Emotional exhaustion was associated with female doctors and personal accomplishment was significantly related to male doctors. White doctors reported more job stress and also burnout symptoms than doctors with colour.

The predicted pyrite structures are within 1% of those determined experimentally, while the calculated bulk modulus is within 7%. The model is also able to simulate the properties of marcasite, even though no data for this phase were included in the fitting procedure. There is almost no difference in results obtained for pyrite using the two potential sets; however, when used to model FeS2 marcasite, the potential fitted at 0 K performs better. The potentials have also been used to study the high-pressure behaviour of pyrite up to 44 GPa. The calculated equation of state gives good agreement with experiment and shows that the Fe–S bonds shorten more rapidly that the S–S dimer bonds. The behaviour of marcasite at high pressure is found to be similar to that of pyrite.",We would like to thank the RS/NRF Collaborative initiative for financial support and the provision of computational resources.

It focuses on the subject argument of Sesotho subordinate clauses viz., the hore-clause and the participial clause. It gives a brief overview of the grammatical concepts negation and subject within the framework of Chomsky's Minimalist Program and explains how constituent negation is realized in Sesotho. It argues that Sesotho does not have a direct means of negating clausal constituents but employs negative clauses such as cleft sentences, clauses with AGRS /ho/, clauses with subject inversion and contrastive clauses. It further argues that in terms of the Neg-Criterion, Sesotho does not have non-negative operators in that its negative morphemes are bound morphemes that are strictly generated from verb stems and not from nouns and adverbs as in English.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2003-01,2003,2012-10-24,2003-01,23,4,189-198,Closed,Article,"Malete, E N","Malete, E N (Department of African Languages, University of the North-QwaQwa Campus, Phuthaditjhaba, 9866, South Africa, E-mail:, malete@uniqwa.ac.za)",,"Malete, E N (Department of African Languages, University of the North-QwaQwa Campus, Phuthaditjhaba, 9866, South Africa, E-mail:, malete@uniqwa.ac.za)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106839203,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

It was found that an increase in wax content induces an increase in elastic modulus and yield stress of the blends. This is a consequence of the higher crystallinity of the blends in the presence of a higher amount of wax. The average tie chain concentration in the blends is estimated in order to explain detrimental effects of the wax on the ultimate properties. A significant correlation was found between stress and strain at break and the concentration of tie chains. Cross-linking improves the ultimate properties of the blends and pure polyethylene. On the other hand, because of its low molecular weight, thermal stability decreases with an increase in wax content and this trend remains unchanged after crosslinking.",AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank Dr. Radomir Žikić and Dr. Joachim Schröder for their useful comments during the calculation of tie chain concentrations.

It is shown that although the unrelaxed quartz surface is more reactive toward the apatite film, the more regular thin film structures grown at the pre-relaxed quartz surfaces lead to more stable interfaces. Interfacial energies for a single apatite layer range from 0.64−1.22 Jm-2 at the unrelaxed quartz surface to 0.55−0.73 Jm-2 at the relaxed surface. Hence, the nature of the substrate surface before attachment of the film is more important in determining the structure and stability of the resulting interface than the initial reactivity of the substrate and/or the degree of bonding between the two materials across the interface. In addition, film growth at the unrelaxed quartz surface is energetically increasingly unfavorable, whereas growth at the pre-relaxed surface is calculated to continue beyond the first layer and we predict that the apatite thin film will form local domains of both (2 × 2) as well as clockwise and anticlockwise (2 × 2)R120° adsorbate layers.",N.H.dL. thanks the EPSRC for an Advanced Research Fellowship and acknowledges the Wellcome Trust (grant 065067) and NERC (grant NER/M/S/2001/00068) for funding.

The available conductance data in nitromethane indicate that the compounds are non‐electrolytes while the room temperature magnetic moments (1.88–2.20 B.M.) suggests the absence of magnetic interaction between the Cu(II) ions. The ketoimine ligands coordinate to the copper atom in a bidentate fashion using the N2O2 chromophore to give a four‐coordinate square‐planar geometry. Infrared and electronic spectra results are consistent with the adoption of a six‐coordinate octahedral arrangement for the adducts of the copper(II) complexes with 2,2′‐bipyridine and 1,10‐phenanthroline.

                    . Two sexually mature males of different ontogenetic stage were tethered at opposite sides of a large tank. Tethering restricted males from actively pursuing the receptive female but allowed females to choose between males. Surprisingly most (10 out of 11) females first approached the subordinate typus male, but after these initial contacts all females chose the dominant robustus male. Following antennal and corporal contacts of variable duration seven (out of 11) females initiated the mating process with the robustus male, while four females did not initiate mating during the 90 min observation period. The fact that all mating females selected the robustus shows strong female preferences for these males.

Despite these different focuses, a peculiar convergence has taken place in that the themes of study of the two ‘schools’ often overlap. This convergence demands further exploration of a number of themes, such as the research methodologies appropriate to the South African development context; approaches to administration and management relevant to South African development; balancing the role of state and civil society in South Africa; and clarity on what we mean by the concept ‘empowerment’ in our deliberations on development in South Africa.",,,Development Southern Africa,,,,2003-10,2003,,2003-10,20,4,477-489,Closed,Article,"de Beer, Frik","de Beer, Frik ()",,"de Beer, Frik ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042443103,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

That is supplied to Europe during their winter. South Africa has a climate at high altitudes suitable for the production of southern highbush and rabbiteye blueberry types. The largest area with the appropriate climate for rabbiteye blueberry production is on the eastern highveld and high altitude areas of the eastern and western Cape. The eastern highveld has a mean annual temperature of 57.9°F (14.4°C), and mean winter minimum/maximum temperatures of 36.3/65.1°F (2.4/18.4°C), respectively. This area accumulates 500 to 550 chilling units below 44.6 °F (7°C). More than 550 chilling units accumulate in the mountains of the Eastern Cape and in the cold “bokkeveld.” The average summer minimum/maximum temperatures of 46.8/73.8°F (8.2/23.2°C) are close to optimal temperatures reported for blueberry production. Soils with a low clay content and pH of 3.5–4.5 developed in the high rainfall areas on the highveld. Organic matter is available to improve the soil for blueberry production. The occurrence of hail on the highveld necessitates the use of hail netting in blueberry plantings. Competitors of South Africa for blueberry exports are Australasia, South American, and Mediterranean countries. It should be possible to develop an early temporal niche market for fresh fruit export with their cultivation of southern highbush and early fruiting rabbiteye cultivars.",,,Small Fruits Review,,,,2003-11,2003,2008-10-15,2003-11,2,3,3-21,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Meyer, H.

The new curriculum contains exciting new aspects for the Natural Sciences. For example, in addition to learning traditional science subject matter, children are expected to develop also an understanding of the ‘changing and contested nature of knowledge in the natural sciences’, i.e. of the ‘Nature of Science’ (NOS). Since curriculum reform depends crucially on the teachers, it is important to find out whether their understandings of the NOS are in accordance with what they are required to teach. We explored existing understandings of the NOS among participants in several teacher professional development programmes through an internationally validated questionnaire backed up by semi-structured interviews. The questionnaire was expanded to elicit possible culturally and socially determined aspects of understandings of the NOS. We compare the teachers' understandings of the NOS with the understandings delineated in C2005. Teachers' understandings differ from those advocated in C2005 but match international research findings. Culturally determined views are found on the status of different knowledge systems. As a follow-up to this study, an exploration is under way into the impact of an in-service teacher-training programme directed at bringing teachers' understandings in line with the requirements of Curriculum 2005.",,,African Journal of Research in Mathematics Science and Technology Education,,,,2003-01,2003,2013-08-20,2003-01,7,1,21-34,Closed,Article,"Dekkers, Peter; Mnisi, Eric","Dekkers, Peter (Discipline of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, University of the North, dekkersp@unorth.ac.za); Mnisi, Eric (Discipline of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, University of the North, dekkersp@unorth.ac.za)",,"Dekkers, Peter (Discipline of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, University of the North, dekkersp@unorth.ac.za); Mnisi, Eric (Discipline of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, University of the North, dekkersp@unorth.ac.za)",12,1,,2.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016667115,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

The main feature of the crystal structure is the formation of chains ∞1[Yb(H2O)4(ReO4)2(ReO4)2/2] running along [100]. This arrangement shows distorted cubic antiprisms of [Yb(H2O)4(ReO4)2(ReO4)2/2] interconnected via the ReO4− ligands. The chains are held together in the solid by hydrogen bonding. The compound is paramagnetic and follows the Curie–Weiss law with a magnetic moment of 4.0μB at room temperature and θ=−42K. It loses hydration water in two steps at temperatures below 400K; decomposition begins at 850K, forming Yb2O3(Re2O7)2 and is complete at 1350K leading to Yb2O3 as final product.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by Fondecyt (Contract #1980882 and 1010305) and Acción Integrada de Cooperación Cientı́fica Conicyt- DURSI, Generalitat de Catalunya (2001-5-02-121).",,Journal of Solid State Chemistry,,,,2003-04,2003,,2003-04,172,1,200-204,Closed,Article,"Mujica, Carlos; Llanos, Jaime; Sánchez, Vı́ctor; Gómez-Romero, Pedro; Casañ-Pastor, Nieves","Mujica, Carlos (Departamento de Quı́mica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Llanos, Jaime (Departamento de Quı́mica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Sánchez, Vı́ctor (Departamento de Quı́mica, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez-Romero, Pedro (Institut de Ciència de Materials de Barcelona, (CSIC) Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain); Casañ-Pastor, Nieves (Institut de Ciència de Materials de Barcelona, (CSIC) Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain)","Mujica, Carlos (Catholic University of the North)","Mujica, Carlos (Catholic University of the North); Llanos, Jaime (Catholic University of the North); Sánchez, Vı́ctor (Catholic University of the North); Gómez-Romero, Pedro (Institut de Ciència de Materials de Barcelona); Casañ-Pastor, Nieves (Institut de Ciència de Materials de Barcelona)",6,2,,0.58,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012492637,34 Chemical Sciences; 3402 Inorganic Chemistry,

Electrical conductivity measurements on pressed pellets showed that all the phases are semiconductors. The optical band gaps were assessed at 2.8eV for SrCu2GeS4, 2.1eV for SrCu2SnS4, 2.2eV for EuCu2SnS4, and 1.6eV for EuCu2GeS4. Both Sr-based compounds present a temperature-independent paramagnetism, of about +135×10−6 and +92×10−6emu/mol, for SrCu2SnS4 and SrCu2GeS4, respectively. In the case of the europium compounds, they follow a Curie–Weiss dependence above 1.8K (EuCu2GeS4) and above 4K (for EuCu2SnS4), with values of the magnetic effective moment μeff and the Curie–Weiss temperature Θ, equal to 6.27μB and −2.8K for EuCu2GeS4, and 6.81μB and +0.7K, for EuCu2SnS4.

For accurate water use predictions, this two-dimensional variation in the energy and water balance must be adequately accounted for. To this end, a user-friendly, two-dimensional, mechanistic soil water balance model (SWB-2D), has been developed. Energy is partitioned at the surface depending on solar orientation, row direction and canopy size, shape and leaf area density. Water is assumed to be distributed uniformly at the surface in the case of rainfall, whilst micro-irrigation only wets a limited portion of the field. Crop water uptake is calculated as a function of evaporative demand, soil water potential and root density. Evaporation is also calculated as being either limited by available energy or by water supply. Water is redistributed in the soil in two dimensions with a finite difference solution to the Richards’ equation. A field trial was set up to test the 2-D soil water balance model in a citrus orchard at Syferkuil (Pietersburg, South Africa). Model predictions generally compared well to actual soil water content measured with time domain reflectometry probes. Scenario modelling and analyses were carried out by varying some input parameters (row orientation, canopy width, wetted diameter and fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil) and observing variations in the output of the soil water balance. The model holds potential for improving irrigation scheduling and efficiency through increased understanding and accuracy in estimating soil water reserves, since it accounts for the differing conditions in the under-tree irrigated strip and inter-row rainfed areas.","The authors acknowledge funding from the Water Research Commission (Pretoria, South Africa).",,Irrigation Science,,,,2003-10-01,2003,2003-10-01,2003-11,22,3-4,157-170,Closed,Article,"Annandale, J.

Yet, as pointed out by Burton Clark, it is also composed of “small worlds, different worlds” divided by discipline, role, and other factors (Clark, 1987). This chapter examines the conditions of the academic profession and workplace in developing countries. A growing proportion of the world’s postsecondary students are found in developing countries, and the rate of expansion of higher education is greatest in this part of the world. By the mid-1990s, 44 million of the world’s 80 million postsecondary students were in developing or middle-income countries— despite the fact that only 6 percent of the population in these countries have attained postsecondary degrees, while 26 percent in high-income nations have similar qualifications (Task Force on Higher Education and Society, 2000, pp. 111 and 115). Further, many developing countries are building up large and complex academic systems, including research universities.

The modification was carried out by calcinations (heat treatment) and hydrophobization using different anionic surfactants. The anionic surfactant isotherms were of the H-type. It was assumed that first the ion exchange mechanism takes place until approximately the anion exchange capacity of HT is reached and hereafter, the hydrophobic mechanism occurs forming surfactant bilayers. While the DCP adsorption was very poor on HT, significant uptake of DCP took place on calcined HT which was attributed to the simultaneously occurring rehydration and adsorption during the reconstruction of the layered structure. On anionic surfactant-HT complexes (“organo-hydrotalcites”) DCP was considerably adsolubilized in the anionic surfactant layers intercalated in HT. The AOT–HT complex appeared the more effective adsorbents for DCP.","AcknowledgementsWe thank the International Office (IB) of the BMBF (CHL 99/001) and the VRA/DGICT-Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile, for financial support.",,Colloids and Surfaces A Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,,,,2003-12,2003,,2003-12,230,1-3,111-116,Closed,Article,"Klumpp, E.; Contreras-Ortega, C.; Klahre, P.; Tino, F.J.; Yapar, S.; Portillo, C.; Stegen, S.; Queirolo, F.; Schwuger, M.J.","Klumpp, E.

Using a 2 (gender: male, female) × 3 (training: aspirant psychologists, psychologists in training,
 practicing psychologists) design, 90 participants completed the 15-item Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) Myth Scale. AMANOVA revealed a significant main effect for gender, with males scoring significantly higher than females did on all three subscales of the CSA Myth Scale. Myth acceptance scores
 were, however, unrelated to the extent of professional training, with the notable exception of scores on the Denial of Abusiveness subscale, where aspirant psychologists scored significantly higher than psychologists in training. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications

Transport through the quantum wire is investigated by using a noninteracting Anderson tunneling Hamiltonian. The conductance at zero temperature develops an oscillating band with resonances and antiresonances due to constructive and destructive interference in the ballistic channel, respectively. Moreover, we have found an odd-even parity in the system, whose conductance vanishes for an odd number of quantum dots while it becomes 2e2/h for an even number. We established an explicit relation between this odd-even parity and the positions of the resonances and antiresonances of the conductivity with the spectrum of the isolated quantum-dot array.",,,Physical Review B,,,,2003-02-15,2003,2003-02-28,2003-02-15,67,8,085321,All OA; Green,Article,"Orellana, P.

The overall knowledge mean score about correct usage was 7,7% (Whites 8,3 and Blacks 7,1) (range 0-10). The most common mistakes with the respect to condom use knowledge were ignorance before putting on a condom just before ejaculation (44%), when to take off a condom (41%), unrolling a condom before putting it on the penis (33%), and the use of oil-based lubricant with a condom (31%).

Because the short period between the release of both kind of gametes, the chance of self-fertilization exists, even in natural conditions. The self-fertilization rate was quantified in 10 scallops as the proportion of spontaneous (nonartificially fertilized) cleaving eggs. The existence of inbreeding depression was tested comparing families produced by self- and cross-fertilization. An average of 9.9% of spontaneous self-fertilization was detected. No differences in survival or growth in either larvae or juvenile were found between families produced by self-fertilization and pair mating.",AcknowledgementsAuthors are grateful to Lic. L.

Improvements to the LDA in the form of a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are explored. Structural parameters predicted by the LDA, as expected, underestimate experiment within a 1%–2% margin of accuracy. The GGA does not give a good account in the prediction of lattice parameter c, especially in graphite, although it does give a reliable description of LiC6. The effect on intercalating lithium into graphite, where charge transfer from lithium to carbon layers (graphenes) is expected, is discussed from the valence charge density, partial density of states, and energy band structure plots. The latter plot is also compared with inelastic neutron scattering results and low-energy electron diffraction results. We extend this work by calculating the elastic constants and bulk modulus for both graphite and LiC6 structures. These results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. The calculated hydrostatic pressure dependence of the crystal structures is also found to be in good agreement with the results of high-resolution x-ray structural studies and with other experimental data as well as with other calculations. The analysis of electronic structure at 0 GPa (ambient pressure) is used to resolve inconsistencies between previous LDA calculations.",,,Physical Review B,,,,2003-11-15,2003,2003-11-26,2003-11-15,68,20,205111,Closed,Article,"Kganyago, K.

Formation conditions of some vein‐type copper deposits of the Tocopilla district (Deseada, San Jose, Santa Rosa) and the Gatico district (Yohanita, Toldo‐Velarde, Argentina) in the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile were inferred from mineral paragenesis and fluid inclusion data, and were compared with those of neighboring stratiform copper deposits. The vein‐type copper deposits are hosted in Late Jurassic dioritic to quartz‐dioritic plutons intruding extensively an andesite‐dominant volcanic pile of the Jurassic La Negra Formation. Primary mineralization is characterized by chalcopyrite + magnetite + pyrite + bornite, and supergene alteration of these minerals produced anilite, covellite, atacamite and chrysocolla. The hypogene mineral assemblage indicates relatively high sulfur fugacity and weakly oxidized conditions, distinct from the stratiform copper deposits formed under low sulfur fugacity and moderately oxidized conditions. Furthermore, the fluid inclusion data of the vein‐type deposits indicate high temperature (401–560d̀C) and high salinity (39–68 wt% NaCl equiv.) ranges in contrast to the stratiform deposits, suggesting that this type of deposits formed by magma‐associated hypersaline ore fluids.",,,Resource Geology,,,,2003-03,2003,2008-11-05,2003-03,53,1,21-28,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Trista, Dania; Kojima, Shoji","Trista, Dania (Departamento de dencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

 and a risk evaluation inventory in another session. The results show a positive correlation between risk taking and sensation seeking and a negative correlation between risk evaluation and sensation seeking. High sensation seekers are found to be higher in risk taking than in risk evaluation
 while the low sensation seekers are higher in risk evaluation than in risk taking.

We found that the system develops an oscillating band with antiresonances and resonances arising from the hybridization of the quasibound levels of the ring and the coupling to the quantum wire. The positions of the antiresonances correspond exactly to the electronic spectrum of the isolated ring. Moreover, for a uniform quantum ring the conductance and the persistent current density were found to exhibit a particular odd-even parity related with the ring order. The effects of an in-plane electric field were also studied. This field shifts the electronic spectrum and damps the amplitude of the persistent current density. These features may be used to control externally the energy spectra and the amplitude of the persistent current.",,,Physical Review B,,,,2003-11-15,2003,2003-11-26,2003-11-15,68,19,195321,All OA; Green,Article,"Orellana, P.

The analysis is restricted to the achiral torus and the dependence of the toroidal energy spectra on its radius and thickness (tube radius) is inferred from the local density of states. The possibility of a metal-insulating transition occurrence in infinite single tubes and toroidal is investigated as functions of magnetic and electric fields applied in distinct configurations. As expected, periodical Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the local density of states at the Fermi level of the nanostructures are found as a result of the annular symmetry. When substitutional impurities are taken into account such an oscillatory behavior is found to be preserved.

The hypothesis that different substrates permit the formation of different biofilm over time, which affect the intensity of scallop larval settlement on each different substrate, was tested. Substrates including Netlon @, fly screen, scallop shell, and asbestos-cement were incubated in 50 mm-filtered flowing sea water to allow formation of primary biofilm for periods of 6, 12, and 18 days.

The results showed that the type of substrate influenced the intensity of scallop larval settlement. The highest settlement occurred on the asbestos-cement (29.6-62.3%); intermediate levels of settlement were observed on the fly screen (17.1-21.2%) and scallop shell (13.0-30.0%), and the lowest levels occurred on the Netlon (4.3-15.2%).

Here, I describe important characteristics of common floating substrata and review published studies examining the succession of the assemblage on detached macroalgae to identify the most important factors determining this succession. Floating substrata differ in survival time (i.e. before they disintegrate) and in food value, with abiotic materials having high survival times but low food value and some biotic substrata (seagrasses, fresh wood) having high food values but short survival times. Large macroalgae with pneumatocysts may combine high survival times and high food values. Substratum survival and food value have consequences for the species composition of the rafting macrofauna. In general, suspension feeders dominate rafting assemblages on abiotic substrata, while grazing and boring species abound on macroalgae and wood. The succession of the rafting assemblage can be subdivided into three phases during which different processes predominate. During the initial phase some of the original colonizers (if present) disappear from the substratum, either due to active emigration or predation. This short, initial phase is followed immediately by the colonization phase, during which new organisms colonize the rafting substratum. Colonization may be rapid and intense in the beginning but then slows down. Towards the end of the colonization phase, some rafting organisms may reproduce and their offspring recruit within the parental raft. Results from two long-term studies confirmed that the proportion of species with direct development increased with duration of rafting.

The present study is based on efforts to produce significant quantities of Lessonia trabeculata in long‐line culture as food for tank‐cultured Haliotis rufescens Swainson and Haliotis discus‐hannae Ino, which accept it as an excellent source of nutrition. Small sporophytes of L. trabeculata were propagated in the laboratory from reproductive blades harvested by diving near Coquimbo (30°S). The best culture substrate was polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in small pieces, inserted into the nylon cord for final culturing. Enrichment of sea water with agricultural‐grade fertilizer produced no differences in growth and development of the Lessonia compared with results obtained using Provasoli medium. Sporophytes 1–2 cm in length cultured on 12‐mm cord were transferred to outdoor tanks with circulating sea water and strong aeration where they were outgrown to 15–20 cm length; at this size, they were transferred to a 50‐m long line in the ocean. In a 1‐year period, individual plants reached up to 1.7 kg in mass, with average values per cord of about 9 kg. Total production from the long line was about 500 kg fresh weight of the alga. In comparative testing, H. discus hannae grew as well on the cultured algae as on naturally occurring L. trabeculata.",The authors are grateful for support given to this project by the Chilean National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) as Project FONDEF no. 1102.,,Aquaculture Research,,,,2003-05-28,2003,2003-05-28,2003-06,34,7,507-515,Closed,Article,"Edding, Mario E; Tala, Fadia B","Edding, Mario E (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Tala, Fadia B (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"Edding, Mario E (Catholic University of the North); Tala, Fadia B (Catholic University of the North)",33,4,,2.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038624307,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",

The FAO crop factor option within this model allows one to determine daily irrigation requirements from daily weather data as long as suitable crop parameters are available. The parameters required are the basal crop coefficient, root depth and plant height for the relevant growth stage (i.e. initial, development, mid- and late) and the length of each growth stage as well as a stress day index, the leaf water potential at maximum transpiration and the maximum transpiration rate. Data gained from trees planted in a lysimeter trial in South Africa have been used to develop these parameters for a deciduous peach tree crop (Prunus persica cv. Transvalia). These parameter values differed for first leaf and second leaf trees. The determined values gave very good estimates of water usage when applied in field trials.

The isopod Limnoria chilensis Menzies is frequently found in holdfasts of the macroalgae Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh and Durvillea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot. In the present study, holdfasts of D. antarctica that harboured L. chilensis were carefully dissected in order to examine the association pattern of reproductive females and small juveniles. In most infested holdfasts, L. chilensis reached very high densities of 43.7 ± 3.9 (mean ± SE) individuals cm−2 (range: 0–90 individuals cm−2). The overall sex ratio (females:males) was close to unity (1.2). Male size varied between 1.5 and 2.6 mm body length (BL) and female size between 1.5 and 3.6mm BL. The percentage of reproductive females was low (19.7% of all females), and only the largest females (>2.6 mm BL) were reproductive. Embryo numbers ranged between six and 19 per female and a significant correlation between female BL and the number of embryos was found. Several females were found with small juveniles (0.8–1.2 mm BL) in the terminal end of their burrows. On several occasions, aggregations of similar-sized juveniles (1.0–1.5 mm BL) in their own burrows were found near a female burrow, indicating that these juveniles initiated their first individual burrows from within the maternal burrows. Some females with small juveniles in the terminal end of their burrows were either accompanied by males or they were ovigerous, indicating that they may have been in the process of producing a second brood. The fact that juveniles build their first burrows in the protection of female burrows suggests that such small juveniles have not yet developed full boring capacity. Extended parental care in this (and other boring) peracarid species represents a mechanism facilitating high juvenile survival rates. Given the highly local recruitment, it is suggested that the reproductive biology of this isopod has strong implications for Its population biology.",,,Journal of Natural History,,,,2003-01-01,2003,2014-04-16,2003-01-01,37,14,1713-1726,Closed,Article,"Thiel, Martin","Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile, ; e-mail:, thiel@nevados.ucn.cl)",,"Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North)",39,1,,3.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049144083,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology,

Herein we examined the peracarid fauna living on the tunica of the sublittoral ascidian Pyura chilensis growing in offshore and nearshore conditions in Bahía San Vicente, Chile. From a total of 38 samples we collected 17 species of Amphipoda, five Isopoda and two Tanaidacea. The similarity between the sites was high (73.8%, Sorensen's index). Species diversity (H') was 2.8 and 2.6, evenness (J) was 0.7 and 0.6 at the offshore and nearshore site, respectively. Both species and individual number increased significantly with the size (volume) of the ascidian samples, and these relationships did not differ between the sites. Many species, in particular the most abundant ones, occurred at both sites, but some species were restricted either to the offshore (three species) or to the nearshore site (seven species). Amphipods and tanaids were the most abundant taxa at both sites. The peracarid fauna at both sites was dominated by suspension-feeding peracarids (>80% of the individuals), which utilize the ascidians primarily as shelter, feeding on allochthonous material, i.e. not originating from the ascidians. It is suggested that the high percentage of suspension-feeding species among the epifaunal peracarids is due to the fact that ascidians settle and grow at sites that provide optimal feeding conditions for these organisms.",,,Journal of Natural History,,,,2003-07-01,2003,2010-12-03,2003-07-01,37,13,1555-1569,Closed,Article,"SEPÚLVEDA, R.; CANCINO, J.

Late-Jurassic stratiform copper deposits in the coastal range of northern Chile (Susana-Lince and Buena Vista of the Carolina de Michilla district, and Mantos de La Luna) are hosted in an andesite-dominant volcanic pile of the Jurassic La Negra Formation which is extensively intruded by gabbroic to granodioritic plutons and dikes. Primary copper mineralization is characterized by chalcocite (~Cu1.90S) + digenite + bornite ± chalcopyrite + hematite. Supergene alteration of these minerals has produced chalcocite (djurleite), covellite, atacamite, chrysocolla and copper oxides (copper wad). Fluid-inclusion data indicate a variable temperature of formation (200 to 380 °C) and a wide range of fluid salinities (7 to 34 wt% NaCl). Carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of calcite from the Susana-Lince deposit (δ13C=–2.6 to –3.6‰, δ18O=13.7 to 18.7‰) combined with the thermometric data suggest that the fluid responsible for the calcite mineralization derives from mixing of high-temperature meteoric water with cooler basinal brines. These data imply that the stratiform copper deposits of the coastal Cordillera are epigenetic and formed from non-magmatic, moderately oxidized hydrothermal solutions.",,,Mineralium Deposita,,,,2003-02,2003,,2003-02,38,2,208-216,Closed,Article,"Kojima, Shoji; Astudillo, José; Rojo, Juan; Tristá, Dania; Hayashi, Ken-ichiro","Kojima, Shoji (Departamento de Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

The source of disorder comes from interface roughness at the heterojunctions (lateral disorder) as well as spatial inhomogeneities of the Al mole fraction in the barriers (compositional disorder). Both lateral and compositional disorder break translational symmetry along the lateral direction and therefore electrons can be scattered off the growth direction. The model correctly describes channel mixing due to these elastic scattering events. In particular, for realistic degree of disorder, we have found that the effects of compositional disorder on transport properties are negligible as compared to the effects due to lateral disorder.",AcknowledgementsThe authors want to thank V.A.

It determines students' futures in education and employment, and evaluates their teachers. Indirectly, it monitors the standards of other levels of education in Lesotho, especially the Primary School Leaving Examinations and the Lesotho Junior Certificate. The purpose of this study is to understand two issues in relation to COSC success, namely the availability of school-level resources in science education and the factors that teachers identify as keys to explaining performance at COSC level. This report outlines the human and physical resources available in Lesotho secondary schools and describes teachers' understandings of the causes of success (or lack of success) in physical science in COSC examinations. The research methodology comprises a survey of 32 high schools offering O-Level physical science. The survey questionnaire elicits information on teacher biographies, the national status of school-level resources for science education and teacher-identified factors explaining low performance in O-level science. The survey reveals that most physical science teachers at this level are male, young and inexperienced but qualified. These teachers soon find themselves having to provide academic leadership and guidance because more experienced teachers tend not to stay in teaching. In addition, the survey revealed that although the value of INSET was recognised, many teachers did not attend such training.

Paleosols, regional groundwater tables, abiotic proxy data and pollen of aquatic plants in lake sediments show a marked and rapid shift from very humid late-glacial/early Holocene climatic conditions (between ca. 14 and 9.5 kyr B.P.) to extremely dry mid-Holocene conditions (more arid than today between ca. 9 and 4 kyr B.P.). An exception during this hyperarid period is a century-scale more humid interval around ca. 5.5–6 kyr B.P. that appears systematically in lake sediment archives. In contrast, pollen for most terrestrial plants preserved in lake sediments do not show major changes during the Holocene, whereas more humid mid-Holocene conditions (compared with late Holocene conditions) were inferred from plant macrofossils in rodent middens. Is the reason for this disagreement to be attributed to misinterpretation of the paleoenvironments or of the proxy records themselves, or to incomplete paleoclimatic interpretation of the paleoenvironments? We argue that these different paleoclimate archives record different aspects and facets of ‘climate’. While paleosols and groundwater in the Atacama Desert record low-frequency climate variability at century to millennium scales, lake sediments on the Altiplano record decade- to century-scale variability. Terrestrial vegetation responds to shorter high-frequency climate variability at seasonal to inter-annual scales and preferably to humid years. Vegetation remains in ‘hibernation’ or does not germinate during arid years. Thus information from these three types of archives is not a priori comparable and requires careful site-specific, archive-specific and time-scale-specific evaluation. What is natural in modern climatology is also true for paleoclimatology: a comprehensive assessment must account for the complex daily and seasonal cycles, for the range of climate variability and trends at different scales in space and time, for impacts of short-term extreme events, and for specific, often non-linear responses of individual bio-geo-physical archives to any of the numerous aspects of ‘climate’.","AcknowledgmentsThis article is part of the Swiss NSF Project 21-57073 ‘Absolute Chronology of Paleolakes in the Central Andes’, National Geographic Society Grant 5836-96, and the Swiss NCCR ‘Climate Variability, Predictability and Climate Risks’.

They were aged between 15 and 19 years, with a mean age of 17.25 years ( SD = 1.34). A questionnaire was used to record participants' demographic data and suicidal behaviours, including suicidal thoughts and threats, plans, and attempts to commit suicide). Thirty-seven percent of the secondary school adolescents surveyed indicated having thought of taking their own lives; 17% had made threats or informed others about their suicidal intentions; 16% had made plans to take their own lives but did not carry them through; 21% reported having attempted to take their own lives. These results indicate that a higher percentage of males than females had attempted suicide. The most frequent method used for attempting suicide was self-poisoning (44% of the attempters), followed by drug overdoses (25.3%), hanging (22%), self-stabbing (2.2%), and other methods, such as, jumping from heights, starvation, and drug abuse (6.6%).",,,South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2003-05-01,2003,2003-05-01,2003-05,33,2,126-132,Closed,Article,"Madu, S.

Many studies on the social behavior of symbiont species have inferred that besides environmental factors (predation pressure, competition) host-related characteristics (i.e., host abundance and distribution, size, and morphology) have a major influence on the evolution of symbiont behavior. However, in many cases little information is available on host populations and few comparative studies have been conducted to test predictions. Herein, we compare the basic ecology of the sea anemone Phymactisclematis and the sea urchin Tetrapygusniger, each being host to a different porcellanid crab species, Allopetrolisthesspinifrons and Liopetrolisthesmitra, respectively. We first provide a description of host abundance and distribution and then test predictions concerning the behavioral ecology of the two crab symbionts to understand how and to what extent host characteristics affect the behavior of symbionts (i.e., host-resource monopolization). In the field, distances between host individuals (~15 cm) were similar for both sea anemones and sea urchins. However, the sea anemones were significantly less abundant than sea urchins. Furthermore, sea anemones represent a relatively small and morphologically simple microhabitat for A. spinifrons crabs, whereas sea urchins represent a relatively large and morphologically complex microhabitat for L. mitra crabs. The population distribution and size-specific association pattern of the two symbiotic crabs differed substantially, with A. spinifrons leading a solitary and L. mitra a gregarious life-style. Adults of A. spinifrons only cohabited with sexually immature individuals on their host, whereas adult L. mitra frequently occurred together with other adult crabs of both sexes on their host. These differences suggest strong territorial behavior for A. spinifrons but not for L. mitra, which is supported by results from other experimental studies on the intraspecific interactions of the two crab symbionts. The presence or absence of host-resource monopolization behaviors in these crab species appears to be an adaptive behavioral response depending on features of the corresponding host species – particularly host abundance, morphological complexity, and relative size. Based on these results, we developed a conceptual model to predict the probability for a symbiont to monopolize a host successfully, depending on host characteristics. The model predicts that the probability of host-resource monopolization behavior of a symbiont decreases with increasing (1) host abundance, (2) host complexity, and (3) relative host size. The present study is a first attempt to understand how host-resource monopolization behaviors have evolved and developed in symbiotic crustaceans and other marine invertebrates.",,,Marine Biology,,,,2003-01,2003,,2003-01,142,1,93-100,Closed,Article,"Baeza, J.; Thiel, M.","Baeza, J.

Biochemical composition of muscle and gonad, during laboratory conditioning at the different treatments, was also examined. Spawned-out individuals were obtained from commercial culture centers for experimentation. Test groups of scallops were independently maintained at: (a) 15 °C, (b) 19 °C, (c) 15 °C in the first stage, raised to 19 °C in the second stage, and (d) 19 °C in the first stage decreasing to 15 °C in the second stage. Scallops were maintained in seawater which was changed daily, provided with aeration, and were continuously fed a diet consisting of 50% Isochrysis galbana (var. T-iso) and 50% Chaetoceros gracilis. The daily ration was equivalent to 6% of the dry biomass of the scallops. Animals were maintained under a constant photoperiod of 12-h light and 12-h dark. Progress of gonadal recovery was followed by periodic determination of gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histological analysis. The highest percentage of scallops attaining spawning condition and highest values for GSI was obtained from animals conditioned under the constant 15 °C regime. The group started at 15 °C and raised to 19 °C showed the most variable pattern of maturation. Of the major biochemical components of the adductor muscle, lipids and proteins changed most during conditioning under any of the temperature regimes; changes in carbohydrate levels in this tissue were only detected for scallops maintained at a constant temperature. Changes in protein levels, depending on the time and temperature of conditioning, were detected in the gonad. Based on quality indicators used in this study, including fecundity, egg size, biochemical composition, and “D” larvae survival, the best physiological conditioning for the reproductive process was obtained in scallops, which were conditioned at a constant temperature of 15 °C, and at an initial temperature of 19 °C and then decreased to 15 °C. Results showed an inverse relationship between temperature and conditioning success and the importance of maintaining stable temperatures during the laboratory conditioning process which permitted adequate accumulation and use of nutritional reserves required to produce highly viable larvae.","AcknowledgementsThis study was partially supported by the “Unidad de Producción” from Universidad Catolica del Norte, Local Government of Coquimbo and, Pesquera Camanchaca from Caldera, Chile.

Spatial Dimensions of Mexico's Post-Liberalization Growth,"Standard parametric tests of convergence cannot capture whether the increased dispersion among state incomes is due to a steepening gradient between north and south, a few hot states randomly distributed, or as an intermediate position, the emergence of convergence clubs. This paper tests for spatial dependency in income levels and growth rates before and after the trade liberalization of 1985. Looking at levels of income per capita, we clearly identify a ""South"", but there is no ""North"" or ""Center"". Beyond the frontline states on the US border, we immediately enter an area as poor as the South and incomes in the central zone itself are almost randomly distributed geographically. Growth shows little evidence of spatial dependency in any period: There is only weak evidence of a South and none of a North.

Analyses were made of scores from 294 highly select 17–23-year-olds in the Faculties of Engineering and the Built Environment at the University of the Witwatersrand (187 Africans, 40 East Indians, 67 Whites; 70 women, 224 men). Out of a total of 36 problems, the African students solved an average of 22, the East Indian students, 25, and the White students, 29 (P<.001), placing them at the 57th, 64th, and 86th percentiles, respectively, and yielding IQ equivalents of 103, 106, and 117 on the 1993 US norms. Four months earlier, they had completed the Standard Progressive Matrices. The two tests correlated .60 or higher for both the Africans and the non-Africans, and both tests predicted final end-of-year grades with mean r's=.30 (P's<.05). Items found difficult by one group were difficult for the others; items found easy by one group were easy for the others (mean r's=.90, P<.001). The African–East Indian–White differences were “Jensen Effects,” being most pronounced on the general factor of intelligence (measured in this instance by items with the highest item-total correlations). Indeed, the g loadings showed cross-cultural generality: For example, item-total correlations calculated on the East Indian students predicted the magnitude of the African–White differences. When each of the 36 g loadings and race effects were aggregated into nine four-item “subtests,” the magnitude of the Jensen Effect was Spearman's ρ=.52.

Previous studies have indicated that the distribution of the crab on sea anemones may be influenced by the host's coloration. During the present study, we tested whether adult crabs dwell more commonly on those sea anemones that offer a higher degree of camouflage, and whether “behavioral preferences” can explain crab distribution on sea anemone species and color morphs in the field. We examined the frequency of occurrence of adult crabs on 200 sea anemones of each color morph, and crab distribution was compared to that expected by the relative abundance of different anemone hosts in the field. Adult crabs occurred more frequently than expected by chance on sea anemones most similar to their own color (reddish green), and occurred less frequently than expected by chance on sea anemones where homochromy was reduced (e.g. blue). Multiple host selection experiments conducted under laboratory conditions demonstrated that adult crabs avoid blue sea anemones compared to other host color morphs offered for colonization, but no preference was observed among red, green, reddish green, and orange sea anemones. These results suggest that “behavioral preference” play a role in determining the field distribution of A. spinifrons adult crabs in the field. The lack of preference for reddish green sea anemones in the laboratory, but its high frequency of occupancy by adult crabs in the intertidal, further suggests that factors other than homochromy-related preferences (e.g. sea anemones habitat) might affect crab distribution in the field. Alternative host selection experiments revealed that the specific host from which crabs were collected (source host) affected the host-choice behavior of crabs, indicating that previous experience is important in choice of sea anemone hosts.","AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge Paula Neill, Evie Wieters, Barbara Hasek, Jodi Caskey, Dr. Raymond Bauer, Dr. Martin Thiel, Dr. Rubén Soto, and Dr. Patricio Manrı́quez whose comments and ideas encouraged the writing of this manuscript.

The Peruvian booby Sula variegata was the most abundant seabird with a breeding population of ca. 18,000 pairs concentrated in two islands, followed by the Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti with ca. 9,000 pairs, the largest colony being at Chaaral Island with ca. 7,000 pairs. Kelp gulls Larus dominicanus bred at all the surveyed sites in colonies of variable size, ranging from 40 to 2,000 pairs. Peruvian diving-petrels Pelecanoides garnotii and Peruvian pelicans Pelecanus occidentalis bred at restricted sites, but generally in large colonies. Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, wedge-rumped storm-petrels Oceanodroma tethys, Neotropical cormorants Hypoleucos brasiliensis, guanay cormorants Leucocarbo bougainvillii, red-legged cormorants Stictocarbo gairmardi, band-tailed gulls Larus belcheri and Inca terns Larosterna inca nested at few sites forming small colonies (from a few to 150 pairs). Two new breeding sites are reported for the Peruvian diving-petrel and nesting of the wedge-rumped storm-petrel is confirmed on the Chilean coast for the first time. Despite protective status, most of the islands showed human disturbance, derived mainly from guano harvesting, egging and tourism. On at least five of these islands we were able to confirm introduced mammals including rats, rabbits and cats. These factors are likely to be detrimental to seabirds and thus demand detailed assessment. Further comprehensive ornithological surveys in other areas are needed so as to improve the scarce knowledge that we currently have on the seabird populations along the Chilean coast",,,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,,,2003-06,2003,2003-06,,76,2,323-333,All OA; Gold,Article,"SIMEONE, ALEJANDRO; LARA-JORQUERA, GUILLERMO; BERNAL, MARIANO; GARTHE, STEFAN; SEPLVEDA, FELIPE; VILLABLANCA, ROBERTO; ELLENBERG, URSULA; CONTRERAS, MACARENA; MUOZ, JULIETA; PINCE, TAMARA","SIMEONE, ALEJANDRO (Institut fr Meereskunde, Germany); LARA-JORQUERA, GUILLERMO (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); BERNAL, MARIANO (Universidad de Valparaso Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Via del Mar, Chile); GARTHE, STEFAN (Forschungs- und Technologiezentrum Westkste, Bsum, Germany); SEPLVEDA, FELIPE (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); VILLABLANCA, ROBERTO (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); ELLENBERG, URSULA (Institut fr Meereskunde, Germany; Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); CONTRERAS, MACARENA (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); MUOZ, JULIETA (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); PINCE, TAMARA (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"SIMEONE, ALEJANDRO (Institut fr Meereskunde, Germany); LARA-JORQUERA, GUILLERMO (Catholic University of the North); BERNAL, MARIANO (University of Valparaíso); GARTHE, STEFAN (Forschungs- und Technologiezentrum Westkste, Bsum, Germany); SEPLVEDA, FELIPE (Catholic University of the North); VILLABLANCA, ROBERTO (Catholic University of the North); ELLENBERG, URSULA (Institut fr Meereskunde, Germany; Catholic University of the North); CONTRERAS, MACARENA (Catholic University of the North); MUOZ, JULIETA (Catholic University of the North); PINCE, TAMARA (Catholic University of the North)",47,3,,3.01,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rchnat/v76n2/art16.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010430211,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

Reproductively mature rock shrimp (Rhynchocinetes typus) exist as several ontogenetic stages that differ in their morphological and physiological capacities. In natural populations, the majority of males are in early ontogenetic stages (termed typus), many are in intermediate stages (intermedius), and few are in the terminal molt stage (robustus). Dominant robustus males, which have already demonstrated their biological fitness by surviving to this stage, have previously been shown to have a higher potential than subordinate typus males to defend receptive females against other males, and fertilize the entire clutch of a female. While females should thus show a preference for robustus males, they nevertheless frequently receive sperm from typus males. These observations suggested that females might have mechanisms to discriminate against sperm from subordinate males. In laboratory experiments, we observed that females avoided being seized by typus males for longer time periods in the absence of robustus males than in their presence. Following seizure, females that were initially held by typus males, required more time to initiate spawning than those held by robustus males. Many typus males transferred spermatophores to females before these started to spawn while robustus males waited until females began to spawn before they transferred spermatophores. Females manipulated spermatophores received from typus males for long time periods (minutes), but not those they received from robustus males. By accepting sperm from subordinate typus males, females may avoid further harassment (convenience polyandry), but they subsequently may discriminate against these subordinate males by delaying spawning and removing their sperm. These observations suggest that female behavior influences the outcome of matings, favoring fertilization of eggs by sperm from dominant males. Convenience polyandry and cryptic female choice may be common in other crustaceans as well.","We thank our rock shrimp gang, A. Baeza, C. Correa, E.

Herein we examined the host‐use behaviour of the anemone‐dwelling crab Allopetrolisthes spinifrons (Porcellanidae) in which adults usually live as solitary individuals on their hosts. Adults of this crab use two different sea anemone species, one intermediate‐sized species that can be found at relatively high densities in the intertidal zone and another large one that occurs at significantly lower densities in the shallow subtidal zone along exposed rocky shores of the south‐east Pacific. Mark–recapture experiments demonstrated that crabs in subtidal waters (low abundance of hosts) remained for long time periods on the same hosts while crabs in the intertidal environment (high abundance of hosts) frequently changed hosts. There were no differences in host fidelity between male and female crabs. In an immigration experiment in the intertidal zone, significantly more juveniles immigrated than had been present originally, indicating that host‐use behaviour is age dependent. The sex ratio between resident and immigrated individuals did not change. In an additional experiment hosts were planted at two different densities (high and low) both in the shallow subtidal and the intertidal zone to test whether host fidelity of crabs depends on distance between hosts. At the subtidal site, about half the crabs remained on their sea anemones for 14 days while at the intertidal site most crabs disappeared within 1 day in both density treatments. At both sites crabs were seen changing hosts in high density treatments, but no such events could be witnessed at low densities of hosts. Although the results are not fully conclusive, they suggest that host movements are affected by host densities. This relationship may be mediated by host (anemone species, size, distance) and site‐specific (predation pressure, exposure time) factors. In general, the present study indicates that host characteristics influence host fidelity of symbiotic organisms and thereby, their social behaviour.",,,Journal of Zoology,,,,2003-12,2003,2006-02-28,2003-12,261,4,353-362,Closed,Article,"Thiel, Martin; Zander, Anke; Valdivia, Nelson; Baeza, Juan A.; Rueffler, Claus","Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Zander, Anke (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Universität Osnabrück, Spezielle Zoologie, Barbarastrasse 11, D‐49069 Osnabrück, Germany); Valdivia, Nelson (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Baeza, Juan A.

Four species in this genus are currently recognized from the Chilean coast, of which two, Crepidula dilatata and C. fecunda, are sympatric. These species are morphologically cryptic and differ only in their larval development: C. dilatata has indirect development with a planktonic phase, and C. fecunda direct development within egg capsules. The other two species, C. coquimbensis and C. philippiana, are species that occur within gastropod shells inhabited by hermit crabs and differ from the other species in internal morphology of the shell, developmental features, and geographic distribution. Analyses of nine morphological characters, eight developmental characters, and 26 enzymatic loci were carried out on four Crepidula populations in the Coquimbo region of northern Chile. Four populations of Crepidula were identified based on morphological, developmental, and protein electrophoresis features. Our results suggest the presence of C. coquimbensis plus three morphologically cryptic species including C. dilatata, C. fecunda, and a new previously unrecognized cryptic species. All four populations showed differences in larval development pattern. C. fecunda have indirect development, with free-swimming larvae. The remaining three species have intracapsular metamorphosis, but different modes of larval nutrition. C. dilatata have nurse eggs that are consumed by mechanical destruction; C. coquimbensis engulf nutritional embryos; and the new species eat nutritive embryos by rotation. Protein electrophoresis data support the specific condition of each group with different larval development and endorse the use of developmental differences in taxonomy of Crepidula. Genetic distance shows that C. dilatata and C. fecunda are closely related, and that C. coquimbensis is closer to them than to the new cryptic species.","We would like to thank V. Valdivia and L.

The worldviews of three non-scientific groups, namely the ancient Greeks, small children and traditional Africans are organistic in nature. The results of the empirical study showed that a statistically significant larger number of African than European students have organistic models of the universe. Since an organistic worldview differs completely from the formalized mechanistic worldview on which the classical mechanics taught at school is based, consequences for Physics education and African students are evident.

238,pub.1029433192,10.1651/c-2388,,,Population Structure and Operational Sex Ratio in the Rock Shrimp Rhynchocinetes Typus (Decapoda: Caridea),"The ratio of sexually active males to fertilizable females (operational sex ratio, OSR) is the most important parameter determining the direction and intensity of sexual selection. It is widely accepted that the pronounced sexual dimorphism featured by many crustaceans is a consequence of a strongly male-biased OSR. Many studies have contributed to the understanding of function and origin of sexually selected traits, but few attempts have been made to measure the OSR. Using the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus as an example, herein we propose a relatively simple method to assess the OSR of natural populations of crustaceans, as follows. The number of individuals willing to mate was estimated by the study of both the population structure (field sampling) and the readiness to mate (laboratory experiments). Field sampling showed that adult sex ratio was balanced during most seasons and that early ontogenetic male stages dominated among the males. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that females became receptive asynchronously, and that males from early ontogenetic stages showed limited readiness to mate. Based on this information, we estimated the OSR under three different scenarios. The results indicate that the OSR is highly male-biased in R. typus even in the more conservative scenario supporting the original predictions. Most male mate-competitors are early ontogenetic stages, whereas few are late stages. The results demonstrate the importance of estimating the OSR individually for shrimp categories differing primarily by sex and subsequently by individual conditions (ontogenetic stage, molt stage), which affects the probability of a potential mate to be sexually active. We suggest that this approach provides important information necessary for a better understanding of crustacean mating systems.","We thank H. Bastías and I. Hinojosa for their help during this study, W. Stotz for his permanent support, and A. Baeza, M. Salmon, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on the manuscript. A special thanks goes to I.

El espesor de la zona ftica de los tapetes descritos vari entre 8 y 30 mm lo cual podra atribuirse a la granulometra y la composicin mineralgica de los sedimentos. Se diferencian tres tipos de tapetes. El primero con una nica capa pigmentada de color verde; el segundo con capas de colores verde y naranja y un tercero en el que se observa, adems de las capas verde y naranja, una de color prpura. En uno de los sitios muestreados no se encontraron capas pigmentadas. Debajo de la zona pigmentada el sedimento es de color blanco, excepto en uno de los sectores donde se observ una coloracin negra atribuible a sulfuro de hierro. Los microorganismos predominantes de la capa naranja fueron diatomeas y cianobacterias unicelulares principalmente de los grupos Cyanothece y Synechococcus. Las cianobacterias filamentosas Microccoleus sp. y Oscillatoria sp. fueron las ms abundantes en la capa verde. No se observaron diatomeas en los sitios estudiados donde la salinidad del agua intersticial oscil entre 12 y 33 %. En la capa verde de estos sitios predominaron las cianobacterias cocoides, de los grupos Synechococcus, Cyanothece y Gloeocapsa y del gnero Gloeobacter, sobre las cianobacterias filamentosas. La capa prpura estuvo compuesta principalmente por bacterias fototrficas anoxignicas similares a clulas de los gneros Chromatium y Thiocapsa. Los espectros de absorcin revelaron que la clorofila a es el pigmento ms abundante en la mayora de las muestras analizadas. Los valores integrados de clorofila a y bacterioclorofila a alcanzaron 230 y 144 mg m-2 en el espesor de la zona pigmentada, respectivamente. Tambin se detectaron abundantes microorganismos no fotosintticos en los tapetes incluyendo cocos y bacilos no identificados. En todos los tapetes muestreados en el Salar se encontraron bacterias reductoras de sulfato. Stratified photosynthetic microbial mats are described from the Salar de Llamar, a salt flat basin located in the Atacama desert of northern Chile. Microscopic and spectrophotometric techniques were used. The thickness of the photic zone of these communities spans 8 to 30 mm. This is probably due to the grain size and mineralogical composition of associated sediments. Three different types of mats were recognized. A first one was characterized by a green pigmented layer; a second with orange and green coloured layers, and the third with orange and green layers and an additional purple layer. At one sampling site, no pigmented layers were present. Sediments underlying the mats were white, but in one site, black coloured sediments were observed; this dark colour is probably the result of iron sulphide precipitation. Predominant microorganisms in the orange pigmented layers were diatoms and unicellular cyanobacteria, mainly from the Cyanothece and Synechococcus groups. Filamentous cyanobacteria Microleus sp. and Oscillatoria sp. were the most abundant in the green layer. When interstitial brines reached salinities between 12 and 33 %, no diatoms were observed, and the coccoidal cyanobacteria from the Synechococcus, Cyanothece and Gloeocapsa groups and genus Gloeobacter predominated over filamentous Cyanobacteria in the green layer. The purple layer was built primarily of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria similar to cells of the genera Chromatium and Thiocapsa. Absorption spectra revealed that chlorophyll a is the most abundant pigment in most of analyzed samples. Integrated values of chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a reached values of up to 230 and 144 mg m-2 along all of the pigmented zone, respectively. Abundant non-photosynthetic microorganisms were found in the mats, including unidentified cocci and bacilli.

237,pub.1026049711,10.4067/s0716-078x2003000200007,,,Extended parental care in crustaceans: an update,"Many crustacean species show extended parental care (XPC) for fully developed juvenile offspring. Herein, the present state of knowledge of the major patterns and consequences of XPC is reviewed, and furthermore important future research topics are identified. Crustaceans with XPC are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments, but care for late juvenile stages appears to be more common in terrestrial environments. In all species, females participate or even take the main share of XPC activities. Crustaceans that carry their offspring during XPC commonly release early juvenile stages, while species inhabiting particular microhabitats may host offspring until these have reached subadult or adult stages. Apart from providing a suitable and safe microhabitat to small offspring, parents share food with, groom or actively defend their juveniles. Some of the most important benefits of XPC include improved juvenile growth and survival. XPC may also lead to conflicts among developing offspring or between parents and offspring, especially during later phases of XPC when resources (food and space) become increasingly limiting. Similarly, during long-lasting cohabitation, epibionts (e.g., parasites) may be transferred from parents to offspring, as is indicated by observational evidence. For several species, local recruitment, where juveniles recruit in the immediate vicinity of their parents, has been observed. Under these conditions, local populations may rapidly increase, potentially leading to intra-specific competition for space, thereby possibly causing a decrease in reproductive activity or a reduction in length of XPC. Another consequence of XPC and local recruitment could be limited dispersal potential, but some marine crustaceans with XPC and local recruitment nevertheless have a wide geographic distribution. It is hypothesized that the existence of suitable dispersal vectors such as floating macroalgae or wood can lead to a substantial increase in dispersal distances of crustaceans with XPC via rafting, surpassing that of crustaceans with pelagic larvae. Since crustaceans with XPC may be particularly susceptible to changing environmental conditions, especially in the terrestrial environment where populations are often small and locally restricted, conservation of biodiversity should focus on these (and other invertebrate) species with XPC Muchas especies de crustceos presentan cuidado parental extendido (XPC), donde individuos juveniles completamente desarrollados son cuidados por los padres. En la presente contribucin se revisa el conocimiento actual del XPC, sus consecuencias y adems se identifican tpicos importantes para ser investigados en el futuro. Los crustceos que presentan XPC pueden ser encontrados en ambientes marinos, lmnicos y terrestres, pero el XPC es ms conspicuo y aparentemente ms comn en el ambiente terrestre. En todas las especies analizadas, las hembras desarrollan las principales tareas relacionadas con el XPC. Crustceos que portan sus juveniles en alguna estructura del cuerpo (i.e. marsupio) durante el XPC liberan a estos tempranamente, mientras que las especies que habitan refugios pueden albergar a sus cras incluso cuando stas alcanzan estadios tardos de desarrollo, o bien, la adultez. Adems de proveer un microhabitat adecuado y seguro para las cras, las madres comparten el alimento con, limpian y/o defienden activamente a sus juveniles. Entre los beneficios ms importantes del XPC figura el incremento de las tasas de crecimiento y sobrevivencia de los juveniles. El XPC puede producir conflictos entre las cras o entre los padres y sus cras, especialmente durante la etapa tarda del XPC, cuando algunos recursos (alimento y espacio) pueden llegar a ser an ms limitantes. De manera similar, debido a la proximidad y frecuente interaccin entre padres y cras, epibiontes (e.g., parsitos) pueden ser transferidos desde los padres hacia los juveniles con mayor frecuencia, como algunos estudios lo indican. Un reclutamiento localizado (i.e. juveniles colonizan la vecindad inmediata de los padres) ha sido descrito para varias especies de crustceos que presentan XPC. En estas circunstancias, algunas poblaciones de crustceos pueden aumentar rpidamente en nmero, pudiendo ocurrir un incremento de la competencia intra-especifica por espacio, y consecuentemente, una disminucin de la actividad reproductiva y la duracin del XPC. Una disminucin respecto del potencial de dispersin, producto del reclutamiento localizado, puede ser considerada otra de las consecuencias del XPC. No obstante, varios crustceos con XPC y reclutamiento localizado presentan una amplia distribucin geogrfica. Se hipottiza que la existencia de vectores, tales como macroalgas flotantes o madera, representan un mecanismo mediante el cual la dispersin de crustceos marinos con XPC aumenta sustancialmente (va ""rafting""), incluso pudiendo superar el potencial de dispersin de especies con estadios pelgicos tempranos (i.e., etapas larvales). Dado que los crustceos con XPC pueden ser muy susceptibles respecto de cambios abruptos en las condiciones ambientales, especialmente en el ambiente terrestre donde las poblaciones son usualmente pequeas y localmente restringidas, estudios que tengan por objeto la conservacin de la biodiversidad deberan poner mayor nfasis en estas (y otras) especies de invertebrados que presentan XPC",,,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,,,2003-06,2003,2003-06,,76,2,205-218,All OA; Gold,Article,"THIEL, MARTIN","THIEL, MARTIN (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"THIEL, MARTIN (Catholic University of the North)",80,7,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rchnat/v76n2/art07.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026049711,31 Biological Sciences,

In a competition-free environment, all male stages mate in a similar manner. They guard females for 23 min to 3 h and perform several behaviors before and after they transfer spermatophores. In the present study, we observed the mating behavior of three different ontogenetic stages of male rock shrimp in a competitive environment in which the three different male stages competed directly for access to receptive females. In the first set of experiments, two males of different ontogenetic stages were placed together with a receptive female. The results indicated the existence of a linear dominance hierarchy, being robustus $\gt$ intermedius $\gt$ typus. In the second experiment, we examined the behavior of subordinate males while two dominant-stage males competed for a receptive female. During agonistic displays of the two dominant-stage males, the female escaped from the embrace of her (dominant) mating partner. Some subordinate males used this opportunity to pair with the female and mate rapidly without courting, contrasting to their courting in a competition-free situation. In a competitive situation, subordinate males that gained access to a female deposited several spermatophores as soon as possible (within 1 min). At the beginning of both experiments, subordinates that interacted first with the receptive female rapidly transferred spermatophores. Thus, in a competitive environment, subordinate males may use an alternative mating tactic that is characterized by speed. The social environment may impose divergent selective pressures favoring the evolution of conditional alternative mating tactics.","We thank D.

The languages facing loss and decay have been suppressed, neglected and not developed, particularly since Malawi attained her independence in 1964. This is a crucial matter in issues of national unity, group identity, language choice and community culture, all of which impact considerably on nationhood, state democracy, equality in language use and in the general development of a country. CiCewa alone, former president Dr Banda's home dialect that he promoted to a national language, received presidential support for its development. This article contends that, in effect, the rest of Malawi's indigenous languages are facing considerable loss and decay with regard to their development. This is particularly in print, where none of them appear as instructional languages in early education, mass communication or in literary publications such as in novels, short stories, poems, plays, etc. This is from 1968's presidential decree (Banda's), which elevated ciCewa only as a national language of symbolic status and banned the use of all other indigenous languages for functional purposes at regional or national levels. The article concludes by observing that there is need for equitable recognition of linguistic diversity and development of all languages.

In addition, in this type, the skin was repositioned as bandages and fine cords were used for wrapping the trunk and/or extremities. One mummy from the Uhle collection was radiocarbon dated to 3690 + 60 B.P. Consequently, the Uhle collection and its funerary taxidermy patterns could be ascribed to late manifestations within the Chinchorro Complex",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2003-01,2003,2003-01,,35,1,5-22,All OA; Gold,Article,"M, Agustn Llagostera","M, Agustn Llagostera (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)",,"M, Agustn Llagostera (Catholic University of the North)",10,4,,0.64,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v35n1/art02.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038756181,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 44 Human Society,
225,pub.1014762842,10.4067/s0716-078x2003000200014,,,The distribution of littoral caprellids (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Caprellidea) along the Pacific coast of continental Chile,"Many littoral caprellid species have a very ample distribution, some having been reported from all over the world. The cosmopolitan distribution of many littoral caprellid species might be facilitated by the fact that they are often associated with fouling communities on floating objects, which have a high potential of far-range dispersal. This dispersal potential may also have implications for the distribution of caprellids on local and regional scales. Herein we examined the distribution of littoral caprellid species on two spatial scales, local (tens of kilometers) and regional (hundreds of kilometers) along the Pacific coast of continental Chile. On the local scale, we studied the caprellid fauna in different habitats (intertidal boulders, subtidal algal and seagrass beds, fouling community on buoys and ropes); on the regional scale we focused only on caprellids associated with the fouling community on buoys and ropes. We found a total of six caprellid species, some of which were very abundant both on the local as well as on the regional scale. On the local scale we found a difference between the three studied habitat types with respect to the assemblage of caprellid species, some of which were found in more than one habitat. The highest species richness and abundance of caprellids was found in the fouling community associated with anchored buoys and ropes. On the regional scale we found very high numbers of caprellids in the fouling community of the northern region (n of 30S), and decreasing abundances and species richness in the central region (30-37 S). No caprellids were found in the southern region of the study area (37-42 S). This pattern coincides with the global distribution of littoral caprellid species, which are most abundant and diverse at low latitudes but occur in low abundances and low diversity at high latitudes. Detached buoys that were found a few km off the coast harbored similar caprellid assemblages (including ovigerous females) as anchored buoys, suggesting that buoys and other floating substrata (litter, macroalgae) may facilitate dispersal of caprellids (and other epibiota) along the Pacific coast of Chile. Since artificial and natural floating substrata are also abundant at high latitudes it is inferred that the low diversity of littoral caprellids at high latitudes is not due to lack of dispersal vectors, but rather of other factors Muchas especies de caprlidos del litoral presentan una amplia distribucin, algunas han sido citadas a lo largo de todo el mundo. La distribucin cosmopolita de muchas especies de caprlidos podra deberse al hecho de que se asocian frecuentemente a las comunidades ""fouling"" en objetos flotantes, que presentan una capacidad importante de dispersin a largas distancias. Esta capacidad de dispersin puede tener implicaciones en la distribucin de caprlidos a escala local y regional. En este estudio, nosotros examinamos la distribucin de las especies de caprlidos litorales en dos escalas espaciales, local (decenas de kilmetros) y regional (cientos de kilmetros), a lo largo de la costa Pacfico de Chile continental. A escala local se estudi la fauna de caprlidos en distintos hbitats (bolones intermareales, praderas de algas y fanergamas marinas, comunidades ""fouling"" de boyas y cuerdas); a escala regional el estudio se centr solamente en los caprlidos asociados a boyas y cuerdas. Se encontraron un total de seis especies de caprlidos, algunos de los cuales fueron muy abundantes a escala local y regional. A escala local, existi una diferencia entre los tres tipos de hbitat con respecto a la fauna de caprlidos, algunos de los cuales estuvieron presentes en ms de un hbitat. Los valores ms altos de riqueza especfica y abundancia se encontraron en la comunidad ""fouling"" asociada a boyas y cuerdas ancladas. A escala regional, los caprlidos fueron ms abundantes y diversos en las comunidades ""fouling"" de la regin norte (n de 30 S), mientras que la abundancia y riqueza de especies disminuyeron en la regin central (30-37 S). No se encontraron caprlidos en la regin sur del rea de estudio (37-42 S). Este patrn coincide con la distribucin global de especies de caprlidos litorales, mostrando los valores ms altos de abundancia y riqueza de especies en las bajas latitudes y los valores ms bajos en las altas latitudes. Boyas desprendidas desde sus amarras y encontradas a varios km de la costa albergaron asociaciones de caprlidos (incluyendo hembras ovgeras) similares a las de las boyas fijadas, sugiriendo que las boyas y otros sustratos flotantes pueden facilitar la dispersin de caprlidos (y otra epifauna) a lo largo de la costa Pacfico de Chile. Teniendo en cuenta que los sustratos flotantes naturales y artificiales son tambin abundantes en altas latitudes se infiere que la baja diversidad de caprlidos litorales en altas latitudes no se debe a la falta de vectores dispersantes sino a otros factores",,,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,,,2003-06,2003,2003-06,,76,2,297-312,All OA; Gold,Article,"THIEL, MARTIN; GUERRA-GARCA, JOS M.; LANCELLOTTI, DOMINGO A.; VSQUEZ, NELSON","THIEL, MARTIN (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Coquimbo, Chile); GUERRA-GARCA, JOS M.

225,pub.1010451837,10.1016/s0167-5648(03)80004-7,,,Integrated water resources management is more a political than a technical challenge,"The Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) approach was developed by environmental scientists, water resource engineers and economists in the late 1980's and the 1990's. Integrated Water Resource Management was a response by water resource planners to the negative outcomes of past water resource policies. Past practice did not for example properly recognise that sectoral demands could be competitive. The conflict between irrigated agriculture and the environmental services provided by water is a classic case. Upstream and downstream uses can also be incompatible. Integrated Water Resource Management was supposed to address these potential contests by planning. The study will show first, that Integrated Water Resource Management is a discursive political process and not just a planning process. Secondly it will show how social and political theory can be used to explain how and why attitudes to water resource allocation and management have changed through the last half of the twentieth century. Thirdly, such theory will also be used to show why the assumptions of Northern water policy makers and politicians differ from those in the South on how to achieve ‘sustainability’. The analysis will focus on the last three decades of the twentieth century when green social movements had a decisive impact on the way environmental services were perceived. Finally, the study will argue that the pace of adoption of water policy reform has been very much slowed in the Middle East in particular through the import of ‘virtual water’ to ameliorate the region's serious water deficit. Virtual water is the water embedded in water intensive commodities such as wheat. Political leaders have been able to solve their serious watershed constraints by resorting to the irresistible virtual water solution in problem sheds outside the region.",,,Developments in Water Science,"Water Resources Perspectives: Evaluation, Management and Policy",,,2003,2003,,2003,50,,9-23,Closed,Chapter,"Allan, John Anthony","Allan, John Anthony (SOAS/King's College London Water Research Group, SOAS, Thornhaugh Street, London WC1H 0XG, UK)",,"Allan, John Anthony (SOAS University of London)",30,2,,6.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010451837,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

Our own project experiences in Brazil and Vietnam are used as background to discuss the insights emerging from the papers that follow. The paper concludes that universities could simultaneously enhance their contributions to development, while strengthening themselves as learning institutions. They could structure more lasting partnerships with developing country institutions, approach projects and partnerships in a spirit of mutual learning through engagement with complex social problems rather than as knowledge transfer exercises, develop more collaborative relationships with funding agencies, better integrate development work with teaching and research missions, and apply resources to the ongoing study of universities themselves.",,,Canadian Journal of Development Studies/Revue canadienne d études du développement,,,,2003-01,2003,,2003-01,24,1,9-26,Closed,Article,"Angeles, Leonora; Boothroyd, Peter","Angeles, Leonora (); Boothroyd, Peter ()",,"Angeles, Leonora (); Boothroyd, Peter ()",6,1,,2.34,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010437152,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Using tools from spatial statistics, they examine the spatial dependence of regional per capita income in Brazil during the past six decades. They also examine the role of geography in explaining economic growth patterns using intradistribution dynamic tools based on Markov transition matrices and stochastic kernels in a discrete and a continuous framework. The analyses reveal the existence of two spatial clusters in Brazil, a low-income cluster in the northeast and a high-income cluster in the southeast. Moreover, the spatial pattern of economic growth in Brazilian states cannot be viewed without accounting for spatial spillovers.

224,pub.1011741553,10.1057/9781403980359_3,,,Transformations in South Africa,"South Africa is one of many nations embarking on democratization and modernization of its education system. A sweeping national reform program reflects South Africa’s adoption of global ideas including decentralization, democratization, and “outcomes-based education” (OBE). However, educational reform is creolized and re-creolized (Hannerz 1987) as it moves through South Africa’s system from national policy to provincial mandate and from provincial mandate to local and classroom practice, as redirection or reinterpretations occur. The difference between reform and reality, the policy practice dichotomy, is a phenomenon examined in research on reform and implementation issues in an array of developing countries that adopted ideas from outside (for example, Arnove 1999; Brook Napier in press; Paulston 1976; Reimers and McGinn 1997; Riddell 1998; Rust and Yogev 1994; Samoff 1999a and 1999b). For real understanding of educational reform, we need to consider the variety of lived cultures of schooling in South Africa and other countries, as well as the viability of world culture theory regarding educational reform. What factors shaped the creolized and re-creolized versions of reform at intermediate and local levels in the South African system, and what influences were at the heart of the imported reforms to begin with? Considering the large picture, is South Africa joining a world system of education? And in the narrower view, looking inside the country, to what degree is South Africa experiencing the emergence of a new homegrown hybridized, variously creolized, system of education?",,,,"Local Meanings, Global Schooling",Kathryn M.

Unified model of sedimentation, centrifugation and filtration of flocculated suspensions","This paper presents a unified theory of solid–liquid separation of flocculated suspensions including sedimentation-thickening, centrifugation and filtration. After identifying the variables and equations for each of the operations, thickening, centrifugation and filtration, and establishing the compatibility between them, we show that these processes can be described by variants of one scalar hyperbolic–parabolic strongly degenerate partial differential equation with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. To complete the description, constitutive equations should be postulated for the solid–fluid interaction forces in the suspension and for the permeability and the compressibility of the porous medium, which is either a sediment or a filter cake. A particular unit operation can then be simulated by solving these equations numerically.The mathematical analysis of the resulting model confirms the well-posedness of the mathematical model and support the design of robust numerical simulation methods. These methods are employed to calculate a variety of examples from thickening, centrifugation and filtration, which illustrate the theory.","AcknowledgementsThe preparation of this work was made possible through Fondef Project D00-T-1027, Fundación Andes project C-13634, support of the Research Council and the Graduate School at the University of Concepción, and through the Sonderforschungsbereich 404 at the University of Stuttgart.",,International Journal of Mineral Processing,,,,2003-09,2003,,2003-09,72,1-4,57-74,Closed,Article,"Garrido, P.; Concha, F.; Bürger, R.","Garrido, P.

But it is less a new phenomenon than the result of a selective view of the past. Compulsory military service has been the exception in Britain, but that is what has softened the divide between the armed forces and society. It follows that the abolition of conscription was a bigger change for civil–military relations than the end of the Cold War thirty years later. Since then the practices of the forces, justified by the claim that they are necessary for operational effectiveness, have deepened the divide. But professionalism has also rendered Britain's armed services of greater utility: casualty aversion has not been a significant constraint on recent deployments. The use of mercenaries could be one way to address the services manpower problems, but another would be a more concerted effort to target higher socio-economic groups as possible recruits. Some possible devices for easing the ‘gap’ include more open public debate, the exploitation of links with higher education, and the restructuring of the reserve forces in order to enhance their regional identity.",,,Journal of Strategic Studies,,,,2003-06,2003,2010-06-04,2003-06,26,2,43-63,Closed,Article,"Strachan, Hew","Strachan, Hew (History of War, All Souls College, University of Oxford)",,"Strachan, Hew (University of Oxford)",58,6,,17.35,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004393996,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

A representative community sample of adults (n=398) using a three-stage cluster sampling method was chosen for a household survey, and qualitative data were obtained from adults using ten focus group discussions. The survey sample included 398 adults: 155 (38.9%) male and 243 (61.1%) female, whose ages ranged from 25 to 49 years ( M=37.1 years, SD=12.6). The questionnaire included 71 items on HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours. The results indicated a mean HIV/AIDS knowledge score of 6.77 (range: 0 to 9), indicating a moderately adequate knowledge. HIV/AIDS knowledge was identified as a predictor for HIV-risk behaviour. Forty-six percent of the men and 21.4% of the women indicated that they had had a non-regular sexual partner in the last 12 months, and 53.4% of the women and 45.6% men said that they had never used a condom with their non-regular, non-commercial partner during the preceding 12 months. Among female adult women, 15.4% reported having been victims of enforced sex during the last 12 months. There was a high incidence of self-reported genital discharge/ulcers/sores within the preceding 12 months among the participants (19.7% in men and 11% in women).

In both studies more than 70% of the pupils wrote the achievement tests in their second or third language. A national option, an English test, was included together with the TIMSS-R mathematics and science tests in an attempt to ascertain the level of the pupils' language proficiency. Furthermore, additional questions pertaining to the pupils and their teachers' exposure and usage of English both within and outside of school were also included in the background questionnaire. In this research project that included more than 8 000 pupils in 200 schools, all the items pertaining to English proficiency and language usage and their relationship to mathematics achievement were explored. Partial Least Square analysis was used to explore the relative contribution of these factors to pupils' achievement together with other background variables from the student, teacher and principal questionnaires, resulting in the presentation of a school-level, a classroom-level model, a student-level model and a combined class and school-level model. Multi-level analysis was employed whereby a 2-level model (school and class-level and the student-level) was analysed in order to investigate the main factors explaining achievement of South African pupils in mathematics. The study revealed that the pupils' proficiency of English was a strong predictor of their success in mathematics. A number of other background variables on student and class-level were found to be significant. However, home language and class size were amongst those that were not found to have significant effect on achievement, whilst the effect of socio-economic status had a lesser effect once certain class-level factors were taken into consideration.",,,African Journal of Research in Mathematics Science and Technology Education,,,,2003-01,2003,2013-08-20,2003-01,7,1,1-20,All OA; Green,Article,"Howie, Sarah J.","Howie, Sarah J.

over a time span of four months from two observatories. All three objects are
multiperiodic with at least three modes of pulsation. Mode identification from
the relative colour amplitudes is performed. We obtain unambiguous results for
the two highest-amplitude modes of IL Vel (both are l=1) and the three

rotationally split components of the mode originating as p1 on the ZAMS; one of
these modes is m=0. V433 Car is suggested to be an unevolved 13 Msun star just

Increased access to and equitable allocation of resources to HE in developing countries have been advocated to accommodate the new kind of student entering HE, to increase access for previously under-represented groups, and to make HE responsive to the changing conditions affected by globalisation. This paper examines demands to accelerate expansion of and increase access to HE for blacks and to make the HE sector competitive, cost-effective and efficient in the changing conditions in post-apartheid South Africa. It argues that the popularised, accelerated expansion of and increased access to HE have not significantly improved the achievement of social equity, social justice and social development because of the external influence of global competitiveness. It argues further that the current policy of institutional mergers and incorporations is driven by demands to make the HE sector efficient and does not seem to sufficiently address historical inequities in higher education. It concludes that the participation rate in HE in South Africa has not improved as was hoped, because of internal factors including the scourge of HIV/AIDS, the declining number of matriculants enrolling into higher education and the lack of effective governance and management in some Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs).",,,International Journal of Educational Development,,,,2003-07,2003,,2003-07,23,4,381-398,Closed,Article,"Ntshoe, Isaac M.","Ntshoe, Isaac M.

William Fulbright, the Vietnam War, and the American South","During the two years following his shepherding of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution through the United States Senate in 1964, J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), came to the conclusion that the war in Vietnam was essentially a civil war and that the United States was simply supporting one side against the other. By the time President Lyndon B. Johnson left the White House in 1969, Fulbright was insisting that the insurgency in South Vietnam was chiefly a response to the repressive policies of the government in Saigon and its American ally, that the war had no bearing on the vital interests of the United States, and that the nation's involvement there was corroding its institutions and corrupting its public life. Though he was a true internationalist, Fulbright, anguished by what he perceived to be America's uncontrollable impulse to dominate, eventually sought refuge in a realism that bordered on neoisolationism. In “The Price of Empire” (1967) and The Arrogance of Power (1966) he advocated an Asian policy similar to that espoused in 1950 by former President Herbert Hoover and Senator Robert A. Taft. In public hearings, on television, and in Congress, the junior senator from Arkansas worked assiduously to erode national support for the Johnson administration's policies in Vietnam. The motives and circumstances surrounding Fulbright's decision to confront Lyndon Johnson were hotly debated by his contemporaries and are of increasing interest to historians.",,,,Vietnam and the American Political Tradition,Randall B.

Extensional deformation is documented by large-scale, mostly N–S-striking normal faults and open cracks that run along the forearc. The faults dip to the east and define half-graben geometries across the Coastal Cordillera (20°45′–23°30′S). Progressive trenchward tilting of the hangingwalls has produced internal unconformities within the graben and half-graben fill. This suggests that extension has been episodic, at least since the Pliocene. Northwest-striking dextral strike–slip faults occur in the northern part of the extensional fault zone of the Coastal Cordillera (20°40′S–21°10′S), where they link N–S normal faults. Hectometric open cracks occur throughout the Coastal Cordillera, some of which are spatially associated with the normal faults. Normal and dextral faults appear to accommodate long-term extensional strain, whereas open cracks are interpreted as tensile fractures formed by either concomitant normal faulting or coseismic extension. The long-term extensional regime may result from buckle folding of the margin, which in turn produces progressive uplift of the coastal area by oceanic plate subduction, followed by continental margin collapse toward the trench.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank the Universidad Católica del Norte Research Fund for financial support through project DGICT 36000 and for supporting a research visit granted to GG at the Earth and Atmospheric Department of Cornell University.

Four mating systems are described based on reports from available literature, and a fifth system is recognized but published information is insufficient to describe it in detail. `Monogamy' occurs in many species inhabiting monopolizable refuges or hosts, especially when environmental conditions restrict the probability of intraspecific interactions. In contrast, free-living species experience higher encounter rates and males can dominate or search. In `neighborhoods of dominance' mating systems, large males have higher reproductive success since they perform better in fights for receptive females. In `pure searching' mating systems, small and agile males do better because they search more efficiently for mates within the population. The fourth mating system is `search & attend' occurring in solitary symbionts, which experience variable ecological and demographic environments: depending on environmental conditions and ontogenetic stages it may either be profitable for males to search or to attend hosts with sexually attractive females. Sexual systems of caridean shrimp are characterized by their high diversity and intraspecific plasticity, including gonochorism and different forms of protandric or simultaneous hermaphroditism. The identified mating systems partially explained this diversity: In monogamous species, low encounter rates and lack of sexual dimorphism favors simultaneous hermaphroditism but gonochory usually occurs among these species probably because mates are not strictly faithful. Species with neighborhoods of dominance mating are gonochoristic because both sexes benefit from being large. Pure searching species have a wide opportunity for the evolution of protandry since small males benefit while the opposite is true for females. In species with search & attend the situation is variable, and only some males benefit by acquiring large size while others do better by searching or changing sex. In contrast to other crustaceans free-living shrimp do not exhibit precopulatory mate guarding and they are relatively unaggressive. The characteristic and efficient escape behavior of shrimp using their contractile abdomen might be one important trait that has constrained the evolution of such behaviors. Our review indicates that the mating systems of caridean shrimp depend both on environmental and on biological characteristics En este articulo revisamos relaciones funcionales y evolutivas entre los sistemas de apareamiento de camarones carideos, y caractersticas especficas tales como biologa/ecologa general, sistemas sexuales, conducta y morfologa. Basados en reportes bibliogrficos se describi cuatro sistemas de apareamiento, y un quinto fue reconocido pero la informacin disponible fue insuficiente para describirlo en detalle. `Monogamia' ocurre en muchas especies que habitan en refugios monopolizables o huspedes, especialmente cuando las condiciones ambientales restringen la probabilidad de encuentros entre conespecficos. En contraste, las especies de vida libre experimentan encuentros ms frecuentes y los machos pueden dominar o buscar: En el sistema de apareamiento `dominancia vecinal' los machos ms grandes rinden mayor xito reproductivo porque son los que tienen el mejor desempeo en la competencia agresiva por las hembras receptivas. En el sistema `pura bsqueda' son los machos pequeos los que lo hacen mejor porque su agilidad les permite buscar pareja eficazmente entre la poblacin. El cuarto sistema de apareamiento es `bsqueda & compaa' que ocurre en simbiontes solitarios que experimentan condiciones demogrficas y ecolgicas variables: dependiendo de las condiciones ambientales y del estado ontogentico, puede ser conveniente para los machos buscar o permanecer en huspedes con hembras sexualmente atractivas. Los sistemas sexuales de los carideos se caracterizan por su diversidad y plasticidad intraespecfica, habiendo especies gonocricas, otras con diferentes formas de hermafroditismo protndrico e incluso hermafroditas simultneas. Los sistemas de apareamiento identificados parcialmente explican esta diversidad: en especies monogamas las bajas tasas de encuentro y la falta de dimorfismo sexual, favorecen el hermafroditismo simultneo pero la gonocora normalmente domina posiblemente porque las parejas no son estrictamente fieles. Especies con dominancia vecinal son gonocricas porque ambos sexos se benefician con ser grandes. Las especies con pura bsqueda tienen una amplia oportunidad para la evolucin de protandra ya que los ms beneficiados son los machos pequeos y las hembras grandes. En especies con bsqueda & compaa la situacin es variable, solo algunos machos se benefician al ser suficientemente grandes, mientras que otros lo hacen mejor buscando o cambiando de sexo. En comparacin con otros crustceos, los camarones de vida libre se caracterizan por la ausencia de custodia precopulatoria e infrecuentes conductas agresivas. La eficiente y caracterstica conducta de escape de los camarones usando su abdomen contractil podra ser un importante impedimento para la evolucin de tales conductas. Nuestra revisin provee buenos indicios de que los sistemas de apareamiento de camarones carideos dependen tanto de caractersticas ambientales como biolgicas propias de este taxn",,,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,,,2003-06,2003,2003-06,,76,2,187-203,All OA; Gold,Article,"CORREA, CRISTIN; THIEL, MARTIN","CORREA, CRISTIN (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Coquimbo, Chile); THIEL, MARTIN (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"CORREA, CRISTIN (Catholic University of the North); THIEL, MARTIN (Catholic University of the North)",183,14,,15.01,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rchnat/v76n2/art06.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052914308,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology; 3109 Zoology,

After it was initially fished down in the first half of the 20th century, Lake Victoria became home to a series of introduced food fishes, culminating in the eventual demographic dominance of the Nile perch, Lates niloticus. Simultaneously with the changes in fish stocks, Lake Victoria experienced dramatic changes in its ecology. The lake fishery during most of the 20th century was a multispecies fishery resting on a diverse lake ecosystem, in which native food fishes were targeted. The lake ended the century with a much more productive fishery, but one in which three species—two of them introduced—made up the majority of the catch. Although many fish stocks in Lake Victoria had declined before the expansion of the Nile perch population, a dramatic increase in the population size of Nile perch in the 1980s roughly coincided with the drastic decline or disappearance of many indigenous species. Now, two decades after the rise of Nile perch in Lake Victoria, this species has shown signs of being overfished, and some of the native species that were in retreat—or even thought extinct—are now reemerging. Data on the resurgence of the indigenous species suggest that heavy fishing of Nile perch may enhance biodiversity; this has spawned renewed interest in management options that promote both fishery sustainability and biodiversity conservation.","The authors have a long history of research in the Lake Victoria region—for some, dating back to the 1950s.

The main influences were German missiology, as applied by Dutch Reformed Church missionary strategists in the Orange Free State and, more importantly, the secular intelligentsia in the Western Cape with good access to D. F. Malan's Cape National Party. Both the missionary strategists and Western Cape secular intellectuals were in the mainstream of the scholarship of racial thought and social engineering in Western Europe and the USA. The segregationist practice of the American South was particularly influential. The break with traditional South Africa segregation that apartheid represents was due mainly to party political competition between the National Party and United Party, obliging the former to come up with an alternative that was both more radical and more 'idealistic', and to the polarisation of white politics after South Africa's controversial entry into the Second World War. In essence, apartheid was a modernised form of both paternalism and trusteeship, on the one hand and, on the other, elements of liberal ideology not used by segregationists. The most sophisticated version, espoused first by N. P. van Wyk Louw and G. B. A.

Personal stories of formative and transformative change from the careers of 23 school principals were collected and analyzed comparatively. Four analytic tools were devised that can support future studies of principal learning. The findings indicate that these principals’ professional learning is influenced by (a) impressions of teachers and schooling formed in early childhood, (b) progression through a common perspective development sequence with patterned influences, (c) a personal orientation to learning, which can be seen as a combination of four dynamics—connections, context, characteristics, and concepts—with one dominating the others, and (d) a story about oneself as a learner—the learning story—that serves as both a guide for approaching novelty and a catalyst for change.

The main ingredient is to consider the action of rational maps in p-adic hyperbolic space, denoted ℍp. Hyperbolic space ℍp is provided with a natural distance, for which it is connected and one dimensional (an ℝ-tree). These advantages with respect to ℂp give new insight into dynamics. In this paper we prove the following results about periodic points; we give applications to the Fatou/Julia theory over ℂp and to ultrametric analysis in forthcoming papers. We prove that the existence of at least two nonrepelling periodic points implies the existence of infinitely many of them. This is in contrast with the complex setting where a rational map can have at most finitely many nonrepelling periodic points. On the other hand we prove that every rational map has a repelling fixed point, either in the projective line or in hyperbolic space.

An east dipping reflector (Nazca Reflector) is linked to the down going oceanic crust and shows increasing downdip intensity before gradual breakdown below 80 km. We interpret parts of the Nazca Reflector as a fluid trap located at the front of recent hydration and shearing of the mantle, the fluids being supplied by dehydration of the oceanic plate. Patches of bright (Quebrada Blanca Bright Spot) to more diffuse reflectivity underlie the plateau domain at 15–30 km depth. This reflectivity is associated with a low‐velocity zone, P to S wave conversions, the upper limits of high conductivity and high Vp/Vs ratios, and to the occurrence of Neogene volcanic rocks at surface. We interpret this feature as evidence of widespread partial melting of the plateau crust causing decoupling of the upper and lower crust during Neogene shortening and plateau growth. The imaging properties of the continental Moho beneath the Andes indicate a broad transitional character of the crust‐mantle boundary owing to active processes like hydration of mantle rocks (in the cooler parts of the plate margin system), magmatic underplating and intraplating under and into the lowermost crust, mechanical instability at Moho, etc. Hence all first‐order features appear to be related to fluid‐assisted processes in a subduction setting.","The project ANCORP&#x27;96 was funded by the Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie (BMBF, Bonn) within the German reflection seismic program DEKORP (Deutsches Kontinentales Reflexionsseismisches Programm) and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Bonn) within the Collaborative Research Center 267 (SFB 267‐Deformation Processes in the Andes).

It highlights that black–white IQ differences are more pronounced on highly g-loaded tests than on low g-loaded tests, g being the general factor of intelligence. Black–white differences on the g-factor occur regardless of whether testing is performed in the United States, in South Africa, or in the Netherlands. Further, it is found that the Lynn–Flynn effect may not be a Jensen Effect. The chapter also reviews the evidence for the default hypothesis—that genetic and cultural factors carry the same weight in causing black–white IQ differences, as they do in causing individual differences within each race. The chapter concludes by highlighting the robustness of the Spearman–Jensen hypothesis—that the more g-loaded a test is, the larger is the race difference—implying that a scientific understanding of the individual, group, or developmental differences depends on understanding the nature of g.",,,,The Scientific Study of General Intelligence,,,2003,2003,,2003,,Current Anthropology251984,147-186,Closed,Chapter,"Rushton, J.

130,pub.1028973385,10.1016/s0012-8252(03)00037-0,,,The origin of brines and salts in Chilean salars: a hydrochemical review,"Northern Chile is characterized by a succession of north–south-trending ranges and basins occupied by numerous saline lakes and salt crusts, collectively called salars. Fossil salt crusts are found to the west in the extremely arid Central Valley, while active salars receiving permanent inflows fill many intravolcanic basins to the east in the semiarid Cordillera. Sea salts and desert dust are blown eastward over the Cordillera, where they constitute an appreciable fraction of the solute load of very dilute waters (salt content<0.1 g/l). The weathering of volcanic rocks contributes most components to inflow waters with salt content ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 g/l. However, the average salt content of all inflows is much higher: about 3.2 g/l. Chemical composition, Cl/Br ratio, and 18O–2H isotope contents point to the mixing of very dilute meteoric waters with present lake brines for the origin of saline inflows. Ancient gypsum in deep sedimentary formations seems to be the only evaporitic mineral recycled in present salars. Saline lakes and subsurface brines are under steady-state regime. The average residence time of conservative components ranges from a few years to some thousands years, which indicates a permanent leakage of the brines through bottom sediments. The infiltrating brines are recycled in the hydrologic system where they mix with dilute meteoric waters. High heat flow is the likely driving force that moves the deep waters in this magmatic arc region. Active Chilean salars cannot be considered as terminal lakes nor, strictly speaking, as closed basin lakes. Almost all incoming salts leave the basin and are transported elsewhere. Moreover, the dissolution of fossil salt crusts in some active salars also carries away important fluxes of components in percolating brines.Evaporative concentration of inflow waters leads to sulfate-rich or calcium-rich, near-neutral brines. Alkaline brines are almost completely lacking. The alkalinity/calcium ratio of inflow waters is lowered by the oxidation of native sulfur (reducing alkalinity) and the deposition of eolian gypsum (increasing Ca concentration). Theoretically, SO4-rich inflow waters and their derived SO4-rich brines should be found in the intravolcanic basins of the Cordillera because of the ubiquity of native sulfur, while Ca-rich brines should prevail in sedimentary basins where Ca-rich minerals are abundant. This relation is perfectly observed in the salar de Atacama, the largest in Chile. However, several salars located within the volcanic Cordillera belong to the Ca-rich group. Inflows and brines may have acquired their Ca-rich composition in Pleistocene time when their drainage basins were mainly sedimentary. Later on, recent lava flows and ignimbrites covered the sedimentary formations. Underground waters may have kept their early sedimentary signature by continuous recycling. However, the weathering of volcanic rocks tend to slowly shift the water compositions from the Ca-rich to the SO4-rich type.","AcknowledgementsWe want to express our deep gratitude to the institutions and companies that gave us invaluable and unselfish logistic assistance: the regional Bureaus of the Dirección General de Aguas (Regiones I, II, III); Ejército de Chile; Minera Escondida; Codelco Chile: Division Chuquicamata and Division Salvador; Minera Mantos Blancos; Corporacion Nacional Forestal; Minera Quiborax; Minera Doña Inés de Collahuasi; and Minera Zaldivar.

The next three papers extend these views by taking a closer look on parameters that govern hydraulic diffusivity in sandstones and other types of rocks. Specific targets addressed are the influence of differential stress on permeability (5), imaging of the fracture geometry (6), and pressure induced variations in the pore geometry (7). Contributions no. 8 to 10 cover investigations of permeability-porosity relationships during rock evolution (8), of the formation, propagation, and roughness of fractures in a plexi-glass block (9), and pressure oscillation effects of two-phase flow under controlled conditions (10). The subsequent four articles focus on diverse modeling approaches. Issues considered are how the geometry and the mechanical behavior of fractures can be characterized by mathematical expressions (11), how the evolution of permeability in a microcracking rock can be expressed by an analytical model (12), deviations from the cubic law for a fracture of varying aperture (13), and the numerical simulation of scale effects in flow through fractures (14). Three further papers refer to in situ observations, being related to topics as the assessment of in situ permeability from the spatio­ temporal distribution of an aftershock sequence (15), to the scale dependence of hydraulic pathways in crystalline rock (16), and to the significance of pore pressure - stress coupling in deep tunnels and galleries (17).",,,Pageoph Topical Volumes,,Hans-Joachim Kümpel,,2003,2003,,2003,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,14,2,,1.63,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-3-0348-8083-1/1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024923393,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3707 Hydrology; 40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Maake, who was born in Eastwood, Pretoria, started his literary career with three radio plays broadcast by Radio Sesotho between 1975 and 1980. A translation of H.C. Andersen’s Dipale le Ditshomo (Stories and Tales) followed in 1987. Maake’s development in both linguistic and literary studies was enhanced by his membership in various music, drama, and arts groups in the 1980s, and his later participation in editorial committees on African languages and cultures, as well as his extensive involvement in the study and teaching of literature, which culminated in the award of a doctorate from the University of South Africa (UNISA). Of the thirteen books he wrote between 1991 and 1999, five novels have won the Maskew Miller Longman’s African Heritage Literary Award: Sejamonna ha se mo Qete (That Which Eats Man Does Not Destroy Him) (1993), Ke Pkethisitse Ditaelo tsa Hao (I Have Fulfilled Your Commands) (1994), Kweetsa ya Pelo ya Motho (The Depth of the Heart of Man) (1994), Mme (Mother) (1995), and Ta se nang Sekaja Mmae a Tele (He Who Has No Strength His Mother Should Give Up) (1996). Kweetsa ya Pelo ya Motho (The Depth of the Heart of Man) also won the M-Net Book Prize in 1995. Maake is also the author of Matshohlo a Dingolwa tsa Basotho (The Best of Sesotho Literature) (1993), three monographs that critique selected Sesotho books, and Hlwaya Tsebe (Open Your Ears) (1993), a handbook on the study of radio drama.",,,,Encyclopedia of African Literature,Simon Gikandi,,2003-09-02,2003,2003-09-02,,,,438-507,Closed,Chapter,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133948781,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4705 Literary Studies",

The pressures of mass higher education, accountability, fiscal constraints, distance education and the new technologies, and changing attitudes concerning academic work have combined to place unprecedented strains on the professoriate. There is no country that has avoided these challenges, although the changes vary. This book brings together some of the best analysts of the academic profession in a wide ranging comparative analysis of the changing academic workplace. The stress here is on middle income and developing countries, but the issues discussed are relevant everywhere. This book, precisely because of its comparative and international perspective, is useful worldwide. Among the topics considered in the case study chapters are: - The changing demographics of the academic profession, including the role of gender in the professoriate - New developments in academic appointments, including the terms of academic work, evaluation of professors, and the tenure system - External pressures on the academic profession, including demands for accountability, threats to academic freedom, and others - The changing nature of academic work, including patterns of teaching and evaluation of students and increases in teaching responsibilities - The role of research in a changing academic environment - The impact of the new technologies and distance education - Future prospects for the professoriate.",,,,,Philip G.

Do educational reforms take school systems on diverging or parallel paths? These case studies from five continents use ethnography and history to challenge the sweeping claims of sociology's world culture theory (neo-institutionalism). They demonstrate how national ministries of education and local schools re-invent every reform. Yet the cases also show that teachers and local reformers operate 'within and against' global models. Anthropologists need to recognize the global presence in local schooling as well as local transformation of global models.

Adoption was rapid and wide­ spread. In 1996, less than 4 million acres in six countries were planted with bioengineered crops. By 2001, worldwide adoption had expanded to more than 115 million acres. Important questions quickly followed. What were the factors driving the widespread adoption and rapid diffusion of these first-generation agrobiotech­ nologies? What were their economic and environmental impacts? How were such impacts distributed among large and small producers, innovators and adopters, developed and developing countries, exporters and importers, domestic and foreign consumers? How were such impacts and their distribu­ tion affected by market structure and government policies? A growing body of literature has provided valuable answers to some of these questions. However, an assessment that accounts for the full range of differences in geography, weather, pests, farm structures, and institutions had not been completed.

The theme of ""witchcraft"" has long been associated with exoticizing portraits of a ""traditional"" Africa, but this volume takes the question of occult as a point of entry into the moral politics of some very modern African realities.' - James Ferguson, University of California, USA'These essays bear eloquent testimony to the ongoing presence and power of the occult imaginary, and of the intimate connection between global capitalism and local cosmology, in postcolonial Africa. A major contribution to scholarship that aims to rework the divide between modernity and tradition.' - Charles Piot, Duke University, USAThis volume sets out recent thinking on witchcraft in Africa, paying particular attention to variations in meanings and practices. It examines the way different people in different contexts are making sense of what 'witchcraft' is and what it might mean.Using recent ethnographic materials from across the continent, the volume explores how witchcraft articulates with particular modern settings for example: the State in Cameroon; Pentecostalism in Malawi; the university system in Nigeria and the IMF in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. The editors provide a timely overview and reconsideration of long-standing anthropological debates about 'African witchcraft', while simultaneously raising broader concerns about the theories of the western social sciences.",,,,,"Henrietta L.

In his address, ""Towards a Sustainable Future,"" delivered just four months before the WSSD, Secretary General Annan contended that concrete progress in each of these areas, often referred to by their acronym WEHAB, would be key to improving the quality of life not only in the developing world but across the globe. For most people, I think it is fair to say that the inclusion of biodiversity in a list that focuses on basic human needs may not be self-evident. Water, energy, health and agriculture, yes. But why biodiversity? The truth is that biodiversity is just as critical to global well-being as water, energy, agriculture and health.

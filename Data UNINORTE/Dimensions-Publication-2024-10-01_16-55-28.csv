The challenge is to assemble a working wind turbine emulator reflecting the turbine behavior which consists on that the shaft spin is not fixed for a given wind velocity but depends on the target power to be delivered. This task is achieved via a PID controller that can be tuned after proper modelling of the wind turbine emulator. Since the emulator components are different and include even nonlinear components, a strategy of black box modelling is preferred. Artificial Neural Networks are used due to their capabilities as universal approximators, and supervised learning is chosen as the learning strategy due to its positive results in black box modelling. A DC generator is selected for the emulator which eases its interconnection with a DC microgrid testbench available at a laboratory intended for studying the effect of renewable energies in conventional power systems. The excitation voltage and the RPM range of the DC generator allow to create an emulator with a 10:1 power ratio that in fact agrees with the power handling specifications of the microgrid testbench.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte for support given through the Energy Strategic Program and for the Renewable Energy Laboratory, UniGRID, supported by the autonomous patrimony national of funding for science, technology and innovation FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS, COLCIENCIAS Code 57598 Grant 037-2018.

The progress has been slow, and there are still many areas where integration has been nonexistent. In Colombia, the government has improved several areas, but there are many needs for people with disabilities in education, who are usually left behind. We propose here a program for building inclusive mobile applications for children and adults with disabilities. The developers of those games will be high school students from schools in Barranquilla, and using this approach will teach them about inclusion. The users of those applications will be the children and adults with special needs served by institutions for students with special needs. In this paper, we present the methodology, software, and hardware architecture design and preliminary evidence of the positive effect that this kind of project can have on undergraduate students.","We want to thank the IEEE EPICS program, which has funded the project, the Apanexda Institution, which will be the educational tools recipient, and the undergraduate students for their committed participation in the project.

The group of researchers decided to select only two topics to advance this review: energy demand and energy efficiency. They also analyzed the modeling of hybrid power systems, for optimization methods. The group found successful cases at the international and national level where they implemented heuristic and metaheuristic methods to solve optimization problems in hybrid systems made up of non- conventional energy sources (NCRE). While previous research and successful cases have used these techniques to solve design and sizing problems in these systems, this work seeks to apply these techniques to perform energy flow optimization in hybrid systems that can be implemented in sanitary facilities located in the Department of La Guajira.","The authors thank the Universidad del Norte, the High-Level Human Capital Formation for Regions-Guajira de Colciencias program, and the autonomous national heritage of financing for science, technology, and innovation.

The report starts with modeling the demand curve for regularly periods from a dataset. Subsequently, IEEE 39 standard power system was used as a testbed where the standardized demand curves are applied and scaled to an interest voltage level. The case study uses Colombian energy demand data, and the analysis is carried out based on voltage magnitude at busbars, which is the electrical variable of concern. The demand response strategy adopted is the time-of-use tariff that assigns rate benefits depending on the demand blocks defined by the system operator. The results lead to the voltage magnitudes showing a flattening in their hourly profile when there is a higher level of penetration of the demand response. Additionally, an inverse correlation is demonstrated between demand energy consumption and voltage magnitude, as expected.",,,,2019 FISE-IEEE/CIGRE Conference - Living the energy Transition (FISE/CIGRE),,,2020-03-02,2020,2020-03-02,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Lopez, Luis; Ramirez-Ortiz, Juan; Arango-Manrique, Adriana; Oliveros, Ingrid","Lopez, Luis (Dpto. de Ingenier&#x00ED;a El&#x00E9;ctrica y Electr&#x00F3;nica Universidad del Norte,Barranquilla,Colombia); Ramirez-Ortiz, Juan (Dpto. de Ingenier&#x00ED;a El&#x00E9;ctrica y Electr&#x00F3;nica Universidad del Norte,Barranquilla,Colombia); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Dpto. de Ingenier&#x00ED;a El&#x00E9;ctrica y Electr&#x00F3;nica Universidad del Norte,Barranquilla,Colombia); Oliveros, Ingrid (Dpto. de Ingenier&#x00ED;a El&#x00E9;ctrica y Electr&#x00F3;nica Universidad del Norte,Barranquilla,Colombia)",,"Lopez, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Ramirez-Ortiz, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); Oliveros, Ingrid (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125375451,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Nonetheless, LoRa communication systems operate in free bands with modulation frequencies of 400 and 900 MHz. Therefore, directly simulating the system in these passband frequencies requires higher memory and processing resources compared to simulating a baseband system. This paper details a technique to study LoRa communications, by employing the Complex Envelope method. The method describes the transfer function of the communication system using an equivalent baseband representation. Results of bit error rate for different transmission parameters agree with other models in the literature, showing the validity of our approach.",,,,"2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",,,2020-10-22,2020,,2020-10-22,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Márquez, Luz E.; Calle, Maria; Vélez, Juan C.","Márquez, Luz E.

A 12-year seismic history of the site was analyzed. The technique estimates shear stresses and strains based on acceleration and pore pressure recorded using a vertical array of sensors in the deposit. A constitutive model was implemented to identify optimal material parameters controlling the contractive behavior of the soil based on the recorded response of all seismic events. The relationship between the maximum acceleration and pore pressure ratio was analyzed, as well as the relationship between the maximum acceleration and a parameter controlling the contraction of the soil. It was found that the seismic history of the deposits affects the contractive tendency of the material, which significantly influences the pore pressure response of the deposit.",,,,Geo-Congress 2020,,,2020-02-21,2020,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,,,234-243,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Sepúlveda, Alejandro; Mercado, Vicente; El-Sekelly, Waleed","Sepúlveda, Alejandro (Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia, .

The objective of this study was to describe patterns of multimorbidity among fatal cases of COVID-19. Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decreases the probability of death among older people. Consider multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the more adequate medical interventions. In addition to the co-occurrence of COVID-19 with diseases of high prevalence in the world, in Colombia there are cases more complex with COVID-19 co-occur with endemic and orphan tropical diseases. In these cases, although its occurrence may be low, clinical management requires adjusting to its complex clinical condition.",,This research received no external funding,medRxiv,,,,2020-07-30,2020,2020-07-30,,,,2020.07.28.20163816,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fernández-Niño, Julián A.; Guerra-Gómez, John A.; Idrovo, Alvaro J.","Fernández-Niño, Julián A.

We aimed to determine the effect of comorbidities and age on serum inflammatory markers in CAP.Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of adults hospitalized with CAP. For the purposes of this study, we compared patients according to comorbidities and age. Inflammatory markers were measured at hospital admission, focusing on acute phase proteins, cytokines, and monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR (mHLA-DR) expression.Results: In patients with chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), serum cytokines had significantly decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and mHLA-DR expression, as well as the C-reactive protein (CRP), compared with patients who had no comorbidities. Similarly, patients with chronic heart disease had a significantly reduced CRP levels and mHLA-DR expression, whereas patients with chronic kidney disease had significantly higher serum levels of procalcitonin and TNF-α. Lower procalcitonin, IL-6, and IL-10 levels, as well as mHLA-DR expression, were documented in older patients, but with no significant differences compared to younger patients. Multimorbidity in older patients was associated with significant lower levels of CRP and mHLA-DR expression.Conclusions: The circulating inflammatory markers to CAP have profiles that differ with age and underlying comorbidities. Multimorbidity in the elderly is also associated with lower serum levels of some inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that age and comorbidities have much more of an impact than to simply reduce physiological reserve and can cause variations in the inflammatory response in CAP.",,,Research Square,,,,2020-08-11,2020,2020-08-11,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Viasus, Diego; Simonetti, Antonella F; Estupiñan-Bohorquez, Andres; Carratalà, Jordi","Viasus, Diego (Universidad del Norte Division Ciencias de la Salud); Simonetti, Antonella F (Consorci Sanitari del Garraf); Estupiñan-Bohorquez, Andres (Universidad del Norte Division Ciencias de la Salud); Carratalà, Jordi (Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge)",,"Viasus, Diego (Universidad del Norte Division Ciencias de la Salud); Simonetti, Antonella F (Consorci Sanitari del Garraf); Estupiñan-Bohorquez, Andres (Universidad del Norte Division Ciencias de la Salud); Carratalà, Jordi (Bellvitge University Hospital)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-56322/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130045331,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Also, this study assessed available parametrized equations of the JONSWAP spectra in order to verify their applications for easing the application of the GA model. The modeled results demonstrated the capability of the GA model to find the best alpha and gamma values of the spectra for normal and extreme sea state conditions. In addition, the assessed spectra parameterized equations evidenced limitations to represent the wave energy distribution at the study area, then, this study performed a successfully modification of one of these parameterized equations to model the proper JONSWAP spectra. According to the results was evidenced the necessity to apply numerical approaches such as Genetic Algorithms to solve wave spectra equations for offshore structure designing, and the assessing of support parameterized equations before their application because the wave loads could be wrongly estimated.",,,,"Day 2 Tue, May 05, 2020",,,2020-05-04,2020,2020-05-04,2020-05-04,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel; Guzmán, Andrés","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Nueva Granada Military University); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Military University); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",3,0,,0.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127309604,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,

To assess the impact of the defect on the performance, two approaches were taken into consideration. Initially, the fuel cell system was simulated using a unidimensional (1D) dynamic model which took into consideration mass transfer, heat transfer, and electrochemical phenomena. The second approach was experimental, using a 5 sq.cm PEM fuel cell, the impact of the GDL porosity on the fuel cell system was studied. Also, the system response under different load changes was investigated. After that, experimental results are presented to give a better insight into the phenomena analyzed, mainly on the dynamic system response. Cracks and catalyst clusters were the main defects analyzed, both of them were observed in new membranes assemblies. To control the defects, new membranes assemblies were tested, and after that, defects were induced using Nafion solution and catalyst powder to emulate the presence of catalyst clusters. For the cracks, some fibers in the GDL cloth were cut to emulate the defect. Membranes now with defects were tested again to compare its performance and detect any performance loss due to the physical changes in the electrodes. Results indicate a strong correlation between the porosity and the supply air pressure and the system time constants. Also, the impact of the defects was evidenced in the dynamic system response, after step changes in the operating conditions.",,,,Volume 8: Energy,,,2020-11-16,2020,2021-02-16,2020-11-16,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Fontalvo, Victor M.; Illera, Danny; Sanjuan, Marco E.; Gomez, Humberto A.","Fontalvo, Victor M.

A Toolbox for Management of Meteorological and Marine Data on Limited Information Regions,"This work presents an application called APPMAR 1.0 based on Python ® environment, built to perform the downloading, treatment and analysis of meteorological and marine information. This application is composed of two main modules: the first module allows the downloading of information from the database (NOAA - WW3); the second module uses the principles of statistical mathematics for the treatment of waves and wind. The importance of this simple application is based on the free and agile access to meteorological and marine information for a coastal project. The determination of representative conditions of sea states ultimately will govern the process of design of coastal and oceanic infrastructure. The analysis of historical time series of local waves and winds allows the evaluation of average regimes or operational design, the ultimate limit states or extreme design, and the storms or design by persistence. In spite that the former analysis is a common task for coastal engineers, the codes generated are seldom shared for public use. In summary, for operational purposes is useful to have a freeware that can assist in the data processing for decision making and forcing of the mathematical models that are part of the common practice of coastal, oceanic and offshore engineering.

Previous work has discussed the potential of flipped classrooms to leverage active learning through the use of videos and other computer-based tools that encourage students to explore course content autonomously. This study explores how the tools and tactics used in the course, namely out-of-class readings and Jupyter notebooks, can be effective to engage students and foster learning. To that aim, the final study will compare the changes in perceptions and performance of two classes (Fall 2019 and Spring 2020) before and after students take the course. The perceptions part of the instrument focuses on students’ self-efficacy and interest in programming. On the other hand, the performance part of the instrument asks students to explain the purpose of simple programs by examining the code. Preliminary results suggest that the flipped format implemented increases students' self-efficacy regarding programming tasks, particularly within students already interested in this computational modeling. These results align well with preliminary performance results, which suggest that the strategy implemented prompts more students to try solving the programming problems and provide explanations, yet not always complete or correct.",,,,2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,,2020-10-24,2020,,2020-10-24,00,,1-4,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Ortega-Alvarez, Juan David; Vieira, Camilo; Guarín-Zapata, Nicolás; Gómez, Juan","Ortega-Alvarez, Juan David (Process Engineering dept., Universidad EAFIT, Medellín, Colombia); Vieira, Camilo (Education Studies Institute, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Guarín-Zapata, Nicolás (Civil Engineering dept., Universidad EAFIT, Medellín, Colombia); Gómez, Juan (Civil Engineering dept., Universidad EAFIT, Medellín, Colombia)","Ortega-Alvarez, Juan David (EAFIT University)","Ortega-Alvarez, Juan David (EAFIT University); Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Guarín-Zapata, Nicolás (EAFIT University); Gómez, Juan (EAFIT University)",2,0,,1.34,https://edarxiv.org/vt25q/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133302547,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

For that, this project implemented tests to measure parameters such as packet loss, delay and jitter using static routing, different packet scheduling algorithms (Custom Queuing, Priority Queuing, and Weighted First Queuing), different services (voice, data, and video), and connection speeds using Cisco 2800 Routers and D-ITG traffic generator in conjunction with the Network Time Protocol synchronizer. A comparative analysis of sensitive parameters for Quality of Service was conducted to describe network behavior for each service. The implemented services presented performances according to quality requirements, reported in the literature. Specifically, the data service presented delay and jitter within the levels considered acceptable for this application and zero packet loss. For its part, the video service presented levels of delay and jitter according to the quality requirements for streaming. Finally, the voice service presented the best configuration performance with the Priority Queuing algorithm, for all measured service quality parameters.",,,,2020 6th International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech),,,2020-10-22,2020,,2020-10-22,00,,23-28,Closed,Proceeding,"Castro, Malena; Márquez, Luz E.; Márquez, José","Castro, Malena (Faculty of Engineering, Institución Universitaria ITSA, Barranquilla, Colombia); Márquez, Luz E.

                  Objective
                  
                    To determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM
                    2.5
                    ), sociodemographic aspects, and health conditions and COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.
                  
                
                
                  Methods
                  
                    Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM
                    2.5
                    long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions.
                  
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM
                    2.5
                    were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having a higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality.

The methodology relies on the use of three non-parametric techniques: Least-Squares Support Vector Machines, Empirical Mode Decomposition, and the Wavelet Transform. Also, the traditional and simple Auto-Regressive model is applied. The combination of the aforementioned techniques results in nine methods for performing wind prediction.

We then combined newly generated mitochondrial DNA sequence data with published datasets to create a comparative phylogeographic dataset for 37 independent tetrapod lineages. We reconstructed time-calibrated molecular phylogenies for each lineage under Bayesian inference to estimate divergence times between lineages located East and West of the Andes. We performed a comparative phylogeographic analysis of all lineages within each class of tetrapod using hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) to test for synchronous vicariance across the EC-MA. To evaluate the potential role of life history in explaining variation in divergence times among lineages, we evaluated 13 general linear models (GLM) containing up to six variables each (maximum elevation, range size, body length, thermoregulation, type of dispersal, and taxonomic class).   Results  Our synthesis of geological evidence suggested that the EC-MA reached significant heights by 38–33 million years ago (Ma) along most of its length, and we reject the oft-cited date of 2–5 Ma. Based on mtDNA divergence from 37 lineages, however, the median estimated divergence time across the EC-MA was 3.26 Ma (SE = 2.84) in amphibians, 2.58 Ma (SE = 1.81) in birds, 2.99 Ma (SE = 4.68) in reptiles and 1.43 Ma (SE = 1.23) in mammals. Using Bayes Factors, the hypothesis for a single temporal divergence interval containing synchronous divergence events was supported for mammals and but not supported for amphibians, non-avian reptiles, or birds. Among the six life-history variables tested, only thermoregulation successfully explained variation in divergence times (minimum AICc, R 2 0.10), with homeotherms showing more recent divergence relative to poikilotherms.    Main conclusions Our results reject the hypothesis of the rise Andean Cordillera as driver of vicariance of lowland population because divergence dates are too recent and too asynchronous. We discuss alternative explanations, including dispersal through mountain passes, and suggest that changes in the climatic conditions during the Pliocene and Pleistocene interacted with tetrapod physiology, promoting older divergences in amphibians and reptiles relative to mammals and birds on an already established orogen.","For collecting permits, we thank the Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible and the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) in Colombia (Permiso de estudio con fines de investigación científica en diversidad biológica No. 27 del 22 de junio de 2012, permiso de acceso a los recursos genéticos resolución No. 0377 del 11 marzo de 2014 to Andrew J.

The global increase in species richness toward the tropics across continents and taxonomic groups stimulated the formulation of many hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of this pattern. We evaluated several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in the butterfly family, Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal to the LDG, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generated a new, time-calibrated phylogeny of Nymphalidae based on 10 gene fragments and containing ca . 2,800 species (∼45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the LDG among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. For example, we found that Neotropical nymphalid diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and that biotic interchanges with other regions were rare. Southeast Asia was also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, was the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, particularly during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, combined with the conserved ancestral tropical niches, played a major role in generating the modern LDG of butterflies.","DJL was supported by grants DEB-1541557 from NSF and WW-227R-17 from the National Geographic Society.

English Abstract: Foodborne diseases (FBDs) represent a major challenge for public health at the global level; they mainly affect low-income populations, children, the elderly and pregnant women, generating economic losses and high costs to health services, and are a cause for attention by international health organizations.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that ATS affect 1 out of every 10 people, cause the loss of 33 million years of healthy life, 440,000 deaths per year and 30% of these deaths occur in children under 5 years. The region of the Americas has the second lowest burden of foodborne disease in the world, 77 million people become ill annually from consuming contaminated food and of these people about 9000 die each year. Of those who do get sick, 31 million are children under five years of age, and of these, more than 2,000 die each year. In Colombia, surveillance of this event begins in the year 2000, with the notification of 2983 cases.

Our analysis reveals extensive sub-structure in the geographic area with pre-colonial Panamanians clustering separately. On a continental scale, the Isthmian populations are distinguished by a previously unknown Indigenous component in the Americas. This component derives from the admixture of different early Indigenous groups that originated from the same northern North American source in the late Pleistocene.

system affected by stochastic loads. The method uses the Analysis of Variance
to detect the controllers with significant effect over the quality of the
system response. Such quality is measured with an objective function defined as
a weighted average of the Integral Absolute Error of each controller. The
significant variables are then varied over a specified region in order to

Ciliates, a group of microbial eukaryotes, exhibit germline-somatic nuclear dimorphism within a single cell with two different genomes. The ciliate Oxytricha trifallax undergoes massive RNA-guided DNA elimination and genome rearrangement to produce a new somatic macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC). This process eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt genes and also deletes hundreds of germline-limited open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed during genome rearrangement. Here, we update the set of transcribed germline-limited ORFs (TGLOs) in O. trifallax . We show that TGLOs tend to be expressed during nuclear development and then are absent from the somatic MAC. We also demonstrate that exposure to synthetic RNA can reprogram TGLO retention in the somatic MAC and that TGLO retention leads to transcription outside the normal developmental program. These data suggest that TGLOs represent a group of developmentally regulated protein coding sequences whose gene expression is terminated by DNA elimination.","The authors thank Virginia A. Zakian, Gertrud M. Schüpbach, Samuel Sternberg, and the current and past members of the Landweber lab for their helpful feedback throughout the study.

In this paper, we designed a dexterous anthropomorphic robotic hand mimicking the muscle-tendon-ligament structure of the human hand. The robotic hand possesses the similar Degrees of Freedom (DOF) configuration of the human hand. Each DOF is driven with a pair of antagonistic pneumatic artificial muscles, and Bowden wires are carefully laid for mimicking the tendons of the human hand to facilitate the motion control of the robotic hand. Rubber bladders with force sensors are also employed as the skin of the palm and the finger pad to enable the force control and compliant manipulation of the robotic hand. As a result, the robotic hand can reproduce the manipulations of the human hand, and thus can be deployed on a robot to cooperate with people or on a homogeneous slave robot to improve its tele-operation performance.",Research supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 61673003) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Grant number: 4192010).,,,2020 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR),,,2020-01-29,2020,,2020-01-29,00,,493-498,Closed,Proceeding,"Gong, Daoxiong; Hao, Linyu; Yu, Jianjun; Zuo, Guoyu","Gong, Daoxiong (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, and the Beijing Key Lab of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, 100124, China); Hao, Linyu (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, and the Beijing Key Lab of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, 100124, China); Yu, Jianjun (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, and the Beijing Key Lab of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, 100124, China); Zuo, Guoyu (Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, and the Beijing Key Lab of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing, 100124, China)","Gong, Daoxiong (Beijing University of Technology)","Gong, Daoxiong (Beijing University of Technology); Hao, Linyu (Beijing University of Technology); Yu, Jianjun (Beijing University of Technology); Zuo, Guoyu (Beijing University of Technology)",10,6,,3.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134222046,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing",

At the University of Rwanda, anatomy is being taught using team-based learning. While student generated multiple choice questions (MCQs) stimulate deeper thinking of a given topic, their impact on anatomy learning is not known. This study aimed to improve anatomy teaching and student satisfaction by combining both models. Methods: It was a comparative interventional study where two similar chapters of anatomy were selected and one taught using team based learning (TBL) while the other one, in addition to TBL, student were encouraged to set MCQs while studying. Pre- and post-test scores were analysed using SPSS 23 and student t-test was used to compare the mean score obtained.                                                                      Results: 31 medical students were recruited. Pre-test mean scores in both chapters were 25.10 and 25.19 over 50 for chapter 1 and chapter 2 respectively. Although the students’ post-test scores improved after teaching for each chapter, it was much more for chapter 2 than chapter one with mean score of 39.97 and 32.45 over 50 respectively (P<0.05). Despite such improvement, setting MCQs was not easy in almost a half of students. Conclusion: This study has found that student generated MCQs can be used as a simple and cost effective tool to enhance TBL learning of anatomy.",,,Research Square,,,,2020-03-12,2020,2020-03-12,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"SIBOMANA, ISAIE; Karenzi, Irenee David; Niyongombwa, Irenee; Byiringiro, Jean Claude; Gashegu, Julien; Ntirenganya, Faustin","SIBOMANA, ISAIE (University of Rwanda); Karenzi, Irenee David (University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences Huye); Niyongombwa, Irenee (University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences); Byiringiro, Jean Claude (University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences); Gashegu, Julien (University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences); Ntirenganya, Faustin (University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences)",,"SIBOMANA, ISAIE (University of Rwanda); Karenzi, Irenee David (University of Rwanda); Niyongombwa, Irenee (University of Rwanda); Byiringiro, Jean Claude (University of Rwanda); Gashegu, Julien (University of Rwanda); Ntirenganya, Faustin (University of Rwanda)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=63340,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125645128,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,

ionospheric irregularities during geomagnetic storms at Tucumán-Argentina, a
low latitude station in the Southern American longitudinal sector ( 26.9 {\deg}
S, 294.6 {\deg} E; magnetic latitude 15.5 {\deg} S), near the southern crest of
the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). Three geomagnetic storms occurred on
May 27, 2017 (a month of low occurrence rates of spread-F), October 12, 2016 (a
month of transition from low to high occurrence rates of spread-F) and November
7, 2017 (a month of high occurrence rates of spread-F) are analyzed using
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and ionosondes. The rate of change of
total electron content (TEC) Index (ROTI), GPS Ionospheric L-band
scintillation, the virtual height of the F-layer bottom side (h'F) and the
critical frequency of the F2 layer (foF2) are considered. Furthermore, each
ionogram is manually examined for the presence of spread-F signatures. The
results show that, for the three events studied, geomagnetic activity creates
favorable conditions for the initiation of ionospheric irregularities,
manifested by ionogram spread-F and TEC fluctuation. Post-midnight
irregularities are developed due to the presence of eastward disturbance dynamo
electric fields (DDEF). For the storm of May, an eastward over-shielding prompt
penetration electric field (PPEF) is also acting. This PPEF is added to the
DDEF and produces the uplifting of the F region that helps trigger the
irregularities. What is more, during October and November, strong GPS L band
scintillation is observed associated with strong range spread-F (SSF), that is,
irregularities29 extending from the bottom-side to the topside of the F region.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-08-06,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"González, Gilda","González, Gilda ()",,"González, Gilda ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130006695,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4001 Aerospace Engineering,

Some authors use graphical representations of best practices for synthesizing knowledge. Although, some drawbacks impede extraction and interpretation of best practice information. Some of such drawbacks are improperly usage of representation symbols, incomplete information presented by authors, non-standard representation, absence of essential elements of best practices, non-homogeneous level of specificity, and imprecise denomination of practice. Consequently, in this paper we propose a model of best practice representation by using pre-conceptual schemas. Our model can be applied to any knowledge area with a generic structure and it is appropriate for human and computational comprehension. Our model is intended to allow for completely representing knowledge related to best practices, creating, selecting, updating, extending, and combining best practices.

Here, we report ten pre-Hispanic (plus two early colonial) genomes and 84 genome-wide profiles from seven groups presently living in Panama. Our analyses reveal that pre-Hispanic demographic changes and isolation events contributed to create the extensive genetic structure currently seen in the area, which is also characterized by a distinctive Isthmo-Colombian Indigenous component. This component drives these populations on a specific variability axis and derives from the local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin(s). Two of these ancestries were differentially associated to Pleistocene Indigenous groups that also moved into South America leaving heterogenous footprints. An additional Pleistocene ancestry was brought by UPopI, a still unsampled population that remained restricted to the Isthmian area, expanded locally during the early Holocene, and left genomic traces up to the present.","We thank Nicole Smith-Guzmán for her suggestions and comments and Sandra Kraus, Susanne Lindauer, Robin van Gyseghem, and Matthias Hänisch for processing and analyzing radiocarbon samples at the CEZA in Mannheim.

Instructors can adapt pedagogical strategies to train students' soft skills and the technical knowledge needed for the profession. Design Thinking (DT) is a methodology that promotes the production of creative and innovative software solutions. Teaching DT in Software Engineering (SE) courses can promote students with an interdisciplinary teaching practice that stimulates soft skills to understand and explore problems and design innovative software solutions. This paper presents research exploring how DT provides practical experiences and it supports the development of students' soft skills from SE courses. We proposed and developed a dynamic based on the DT phase that simulates practical situations of a software project. The students' perceptions of the dynamics were analyzed qualitatively. The results showed that the dynamics promoted practical experiences and the development of soft skills, such as problem-solving, creativity, teamwork, diversity, and critical thinking.",,,,Proceedings of the XXXIV Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering,,,2020-10-21,2020,2020-12-21,2020-10-21,,,690-699,Closed,Proceeding,"Marques, Anna B.; Ferreira, Bruna; Lopes, Adriana; Silva, Williamson","Marques, Anna B.

with conserved up and down spins along the Néel vector axis. The zero net
moment antiferromagnet acts as an electrical spin-splitter with a 34$^\circ$

Nevertheless, students face difficulties while learning software modeling. To teach software modeling effectively in computing courses, instructors who usually employed traditional methods could use active learning strategies. However, instructors are reluctant to change their teaching approaches due to several barriers that hinder the application of active learning strategies. Besides, relatively little research addresses how to mitigate them. The objective of this research is to help instructors implementing active learning strategies when teaching software modeling with UML diagrams. To achieve this objective, we conducted a Design Science Research (DSR). We proposed an artifact called OpenSMALS, an Open Repository for teaching Software Modeling applying Active Learning Strategies. OpenSMALS provides specific guidelines on how instructors can apply these strategies and helping instructors to identify the active learning strategies best suit their teaching context. We performed four DSR Design Cycles---in four different universities---to evaluate and evolve OpenSMALS. Our results show that OpenSMALS satisfactorily reduced the barriers faced by instructors, and it achieved an appropriate maturity level to be adopted by other instructors.",,,,Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training,,,2020-06-27,2020,2020-09-18,2020-06-27,,,162-172,Closed,Proceeding,"Silva, Williamson; Gadelha, Bruno; Steinmacher, Igor; Conte, Tayana","Silva, Williamson (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, AM - Brazil); Gadelha, Bruno (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, AM - Brazil); Steinmacher, Igor (Northern Arizona University); Conte, Tayana (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, AM - Brazil)",,"Silva, Williamson (Federal University of Amazonas); Gadelha, Bruno (Federal University of Amazonas); Steinmacher, Igor (Northern Arizona University); Conte, Tayana (Federal University of Amazonas)",2,2,,0.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130926712,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,4 Quality Education

A puzzling aspect of ZIKV emergence is that all human outbreaks and birth defects to date have been exclusively associated with the Asian ZIKV lineage, despite a growing body of laboratory evidence pointing towards higher transmissibility and pathogenicity of the African ZIKV lineage. Whether this apparent paradox reflects the use of relatively old African ZIKV strains in most laboratory studies is unclear. Here, we experimentally compared the transmissibility and pathogenicity of seven low-passage ZIKV strains representing the recently circulating viral genetic diversity. We found that recent African ZIKV strains largely outperformed their Asian counterparts in mosquito transmission kinetics experiments, which translated into a markedly higher epidemic potential in outbreak computer simulations. In addition, African ZIKV strains were significantly more lethal than Asian ZIKV strains in immunocompromised adult mice. Finally, prenatal infection of immunocompetent mouse embryos with an African ZIKV strain resulted in embryonic death whereas it caused microcephaly with Asian ZIKV strains. Together, our results demonstrate the high epidemic potential and pathogenicity of recent ZIKV strains from Africa. Importantly, they also imply that the African ZIKV lineage could more easily go unnoticed by public health surveillance systems than the Asian ZIKV lineage due to its propensity to cause fetal loss rather than birth defects.","We thank Catherine Lallemand for assistance with mosquito rearing, the Institut Pasteur animal facility staff for the breeding of Ifnar1-/- mice, and Anubis Vega-Rúa for initially providing the mosquito colony from Guadeloupe.

classes in schools and universities to safeguard health and life. However, many
students (teachers and parents, also) face great difficulties accessing and
staying in class due to technology limitations, affecting their education.
Using several nationally representative datasets in Colombia, this article
documents how the academic performance of students in their final high school
year is affected due to technologies, aggregated by municipalities. We conclude
that internet access strongly affects these results, and little improvement on
the internet/computer access will reflect better academic performance. Under

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online questionnaire that evaluated demographic variables, social capital, coronavirus disease perceived stress, depression risk, insomnia risk, and suicide risk. SC was taken as an independent variable, and symptoms indicating psychological distress was handed as dependent variables. Odds ratios (OR) were established with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using binary logistic regression analysis.   Results A group of 700 adults participated in the survey; they were aged between 18 and 76 years (M = 37, SD = 13). Low SC was associated with depression risk (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.34-2.97), elevated suicide risk (OR = 2.62, 95%CI 1.40-4.91) high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease (OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.76), and insomnia risk (OR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.69-3.47).   Conclusions Low CS was associated with indicators of psychological distress represented in depression risk, elevated suicide risk, high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease and insomnia risk. SC is a community social resource that could help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disease quarantine amidst the Colombian population’s psychological health. It is necessary to deepen the SC role in psychological well-being during and after the coronavirus disease epidemic.",,"Funding: University of Magdalena, Santa Marta, Colombia.

The aim of this study was to determine the acute effects of acupuncture on heart rate, the perceived exertion scale and lactate levels in recreational athletes. Fifteen competitive males engaged in HIIT. The characteristic was 29.86±2.51 years old, heart rate reserve 59.00±3.33, lactate 3.17±0.50 mM/DL. The subjects were submitted to two exercise sessions. Both training sessions consisted of 10 burpees, 12 thrusters and 14 box jumps (75 cm high) for 12 minutes. Activity intensity was between 85 and 95% of maximum heart rate. Acupuncture points: ST36, L3, LI11. The student’s t-test was adopted, Shapiro-Wilk test was applied for normality, and Pearson correlation. There was a positive correlation of r = 0.69 between lactate levels and heart rate. Lactate: Lac1 15.00±1.18 – Lac2 19.59± 1.46 p= 0.0001*; Heart 1rate: HRF 163.71±7.27 – HRF2 177.60±6.99 p=0.0001*; Blood pressure: SBP1 174.86±1.57 – SBP2 180.86±1.77 p= 0.0001*; PES1: 19.4±1.14; PES2 16.8±0.84 p= 0.0001*; weight1 – 182,57±12,05; weight 2 206,43±11,39 p=0.0325*.

The underreported diagnosis of this clinical entity has been widely highlighted due to multiple factors, as are among others, ignorance by the primary care practitioner consulted for this condition, clinical similarity with secondary gastroenteric symptoms, to common food poisonings of bacterial, parasitic or viral etiology. Eventually people affected by ciguatotoxin are related to trips to coastal areas hours before the onset of symptoms. Thanks to multiple studies over the years it has been possible to identify the relation of the dinoflagellates in the assembly of said toxin and its introduction into the food chain, starting by fish primarily inhabiting reef ecosystems and culminating in the intake of these by humans.

                The study of South American camelids and their domestication is a highly debated topic in zooarchaeology. Identifying the domestic species (alpaca and llama) in archaeological sites based solely on morphological data is challenging due to their similarity with respect to their wild ancestors. Using genetic methods also present challenges due to the hybridization history of the domestic species, which are thought to have extensively hybridized following the Spanish conquest of South America that resulted in camelids slaughtered en-masse. In this study we generated mitochondrial genomes for 61 ancient South American camelids dated between 3,500 - 2,400 years before the present (Early Formative period) from two archaeological sites in Northern Chile (Tulán 54 and 85), as well as 66 modern camelid mitogenomes and 815 extant mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America. In addition, we performed osteometric analyses to differentiate big and small body size camelids. A comparative analysis of these data suggests that a substantial proportion of the ancient vicuña genetic variation has been lost since the Early Formative period as it is not present in modern specimens. Moreover, we propose a model of domestication that includes an ancient guanaco population that no longer exists. Finally, we find evidence that interbreeding practices were widespread during the domestication process by the early camelid herders in the Atacama during the Early Formative period and predating the Spanish conquest.",,,bioRxiv,,,,2020-10-19,2020,2020-10-19,,,,2020.10.16.337428,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Díaz-Maroto, Paloma; Rey-Iglesia, Alba; Cartajena, Isabel; Núñez, Lautaro; Westbury, Michael V; Varas, Valeria; Moraga, Mauricio; Campos, Paula F.; Orozco-terWengel, Pablo; Marín, Juan Carlos; Hansen, Anders J.","Díaz-Maroto, Paloma (University of Copenhagen); Rey-Iglesia, Alba (University of Copenhagen); Cartajena, Isabel (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales de la Universidad de Chile); Núñez, Lautaro (Universidad Católica del Norte); Westbury, Michael V (University of Copenhagen); Varas, Valeria (Austral University of Chile); Moraga, Mauricio (Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile); Campos, Paula F.

covariance information, and are affected by sampling errors in operational
settings where the number of model realizations is much smaller than the model
state dimension. To alleviate the effects of these errors EnKF relies on
model-specific heuristics such as covariance localization, which takes
advantage of the spatial locality of correlations among the model variables.
This work proposes an approach to alleviate sampling errors that utilizes a
locally averaged-in-time dynamics of the model, described in terms of a
climatological covariance of the dynamical system. We use this covariance as
the target matrix in covariance shrinkage methods, and develop a stochastic
covariance shrinkage approach where synthetic ensemble members are drawn to
enrich both the ensemble subspace and the ensemble transformation. We
additionally provide for a way in which this methodology can be localized
similar to the state-of-the-art LETKF method, and that for a certain model
setup, our methodology significantly outperforms it.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-02-29,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Popov, Andrey A; Sandu, Adrian; Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Evensen, Geir","Popov, Andrey A (); Sandu, Adrian (); Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

symmetry operations in hexagonal lattices enforce Weyl points at the
screw-invariant high-symmetry lines of the band structure. The corepresentation
theory and connectivity group theory show that Weyl points are generated by
band crossings in accordion-like and hourglass-like dispersion relations. These
Weyl points are stable against weak perturbations and are protected by the
screw rotation symmetry. Based on first-principles calculations we found a
complete agreement between the topological predicted energy dispersion
relations and real hexagonal materials. Topological charge (chirality) and
Berry curvature calculations show the simultaneous formation of Weyl points and
nodal-lines in 4d transition-metal trifluorides such as AgF3 and AuF3.
Furthermore, a large intrinsic spin-Hall conductivity was found due to the
combined strong spin-orbit coupling and multiple Weyl-point crossings in the
electronic structure. These materials could be used to the spin/charge
conversion in more energy-efficient spintronic devices.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-05-06,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"González-Hernández, Rafael; Tuiran, Erick; Uribe, Bernardo","González-Hernández, Rafael (); Tuiran, Erick (); Uribe, Bernardo ()",,"González-Hernández, Rafael (); Tuiran, Erick (); Uribe, Bernardo ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127427218,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

Furthermore, Latin America and Europe have more women than men enrolled in tertiary education. The problem arises when those numbers are analysed by degree studies. There is a gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), with a low number of women enrolled in those programs and even lower numbers of graduates. The universities have a key role to steer new conceptions and understanding of the females in STEM. The higher education institutions have to define measures and policies to reduce the gender gap in the careers of the future. This work aims to provide a proposal to analyse the gender equality gap in STEM as a first step to define gender equality action plans focused on processes of attraction, access and retention and guidance in STEM programs.

Higher education managers, administrators and researchers will find this a valuable contribution to the field."" -- Christa van der Walt, Stellenbosch University, South Africa ""At a time when the rapid spread of English-medium education has outpaced theoretical conceptualisations, this excellent and concise book offers a sound interdisciplinary framework which stakeholders will find eminently useful to better understand the complexity of current multilingual university settings. As the saying goes, the best things come in small packages!"" --David Lasagabaster, University of the Basque Country, Spain ""Informed by recent research, the ROAD-MAPPING framework developed by Dafouz and Smit provides a valuable analytical tool to researchers, educators and policy-makers working with English-medium education across various university contexts. The authors carefully consider how English interacts with other languages and how it contributes to multilingual practices in higher education."" --Maria Kuteeva, Stockholm University, Sweden This book is the first to offer a conceptual framework of English-medium education that can be used across different international higher education (HE) contexts. It provides readers with an understanding of the complexities, possibilities and challenges that this phenomenon raises in the 21st century. Making the case for the pressing need for an overarching conceptualisation, the authors discuss, from a theoretical point of view, the recently introduced ROAD-MAPPING framework for ‘English Medium Education in Multilingual University Settings’ (EMEMUS). Drawing on current research and examples from a variety ofsettings, the book makes a strong case for the applicability of the framework in two important directions: as a methodological tool for researching educational practices and as an analytical guide to examine policies and teacher education programmes.

many magnetic topological phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and
its quantized variant. The AHE has been primarily accompanied by a
ferromagnetic dipole moment, which hinders the topological quantum states and
limits data density in memory devices, or by a delicate noncollinear magnetic
order with strong spin decoherence, both limiting their applicability. A
potential breakthrough is the recent theoretical prediction of the AHE arising
from collinear antiferromagnetism in an anisotropic crystal environment. This
new mechanism does not require magnetic dipolar or noncollinear fields.
However, it has not been experimentally observed to date. Here we demonstrate
this unconventional mechanism by measuring the AHE in an epilayer of a rutile
collinear antiferromagnet RuO$_2$. The observed anomalous Hall conductivity is
large, exceeding 300 S/cm, and is in agreement with the Berry phase topological
transport contribution. Our results open a new unexplored chapter of
time-reversal symmetry breaking phenomena in the abundant class of collinear
antiferromagnetic materials.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-02-20,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Feng, Zexin; Zhou, Xiaorong; Šmejkal, Libor; Wu, Lei; Zhu, Zengwei; Guo, Huixin; González-Hernández, Rafael; Wang, Xiaoning; Yan, Han; Qin, Peixin; Zhang, Xin; Wu, Haojiang; Chen, Hongyu; Xia, Zhengcai; Jiang, Chengbao; Coey, Michael; Sinova, Jairo; Jungwirth, Tomáš; Liu, Zhiqi","Feng, Zexin (); Zhou, Xiaorong (); Šmejkal, Libor (); Wu, Lei (); Zhu, Zengwei (); Guo, Huixin (); González-Hernández, Rafael (); Wang, Xiaoning (); Yan, Han (); Qin, Peixin (); Zhang, Xin (); Wu, Haojiang (); Chen, Hongyu (); Xia, Zhengcai (); Jiang, Chengbao (); Coey, Michael (); Sinova, Jairo (); Jungwirth, Tomáš (); Liu, Zhiqi ()",,"Feng, Zexin (); Zhou, Xiaorong (); Šmejkal, Libor (); Wu, Lei (); Zhu, Zengwei (); Guo, Huixin (); González-Hernández, Rafael (); Wang, Xiaoning (); Yan, Han (); Qin, Peixin (); Zhang, Xin (); Wu, Haojiang (); Chen, Hongyu (); Xia, Zhengcai (); Jiang, Chengbao (); Coey, Michael (); Sinova, Jairo (); Jungwirth, Tomáš (); Liu, Zhiqi ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125046782,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics; 5108 Quantum Physics,

underpinning a broad science and technology area, including topological
magnets, axion physics, dissipationless Hall currents, or spintronic memories.
A best known conventional model of macroscopic T-symmetry breaking is a
ferromagnetic order of itinerant Bloch electrons with an isotropic spin
interaction in momentum space. Anisotropic electron interactions, on the other
hand, have been a domain of correlated quantum phases, such as the T-invariant
nematics or unconventional superconductors. Here we report discovery of a
broken-T phase of itinerant Bloch electrons with an unconventional anisotropic
spin-momentum interaction, whose staggered nature leads to the formation of two
ferromagnetic-like valleys in the momentum space with opposite spin splittings.
We describe qualitatively the effect by deriving a non-relativistic
single-particle Hamiltonian model. Next, we identify the unconventional
staggered spin-momentum interaction by first-principles electronic structure
calculations in a four-sublattice antiferromagnet Mn5Si3 with a collinear
checkerboard magnetic order. We show that the staggered spin-momentum
interaction is set by nonrelativistic spin-symmetries which were previously
omitted in relativistic physics classifications of spin interactions and
topological quasiparticles. Our measurements of a spontaneous Hall effect in
epilayers of antiferromagnetic Mn5Si3 with vanishing magnetization are
consistent with our theory predictions. Bloch electrons with the unconventional
staggered spin interaction, compatible with abundant low atomic-number
materials, strong spin-coherence, and collinear antiferromagnetic order open
unparalleled possibilities for realizing T-symmetry broken spin and topological
quantum phases.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-12-31,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Reichlová, Helena; Seeger, Rafael Lopes; González-Hernández, Rafael; Kounta, Ismaila; Schlitz, Richard; Kriegner, Dominik; Ritzinger, Philipp; Lammel, Michaela; Leiviskä, Miina; Petříček, Václav; Doležal, Petr; Schmoranzerová, Eva; Bad'ura, Antonín; Thomas, Andy; Baltz, Vincent; Michez, Lisa; Sinova, Jairo; Goennenwein, Sebastian T.

Thus, these artifacts support team communication. Failures in communication via software artifacts occur because practitioners typically concentrate on the artifacts’ content, without reflecting on how other software development team members will interpret these artifacts. Such communication failures can negatively affect the quality of software artifacts. To support better communication via artifact, we proposed the Directives of Communicability (DCs). The DCs aim to support practitioners in analyzing the characteristics that affect the artifacts’ content on team communication. In this paper, we present an exploratory study carried out to evaluate the practitioners’ perception about the contribution of DCs to the quality of a specific software artifact. The results indicate that DCs contribute to this purpose.

Han transcurrido 18 largos años desde entonces, y la comunidad científica marina del país, así como la Autoridad Marítima colombiana y el gremio marítimo requieren no solo una actualización de dichas líneas de investigación, sino también mayor cantidad y mejor nivel de detalle en la información disponible para la toma de decisiones con base en el rigor técnico; así como el claro y amplio soporte de conocimiento del medio en el que se desenvuelven para el diario devenir en sus actividades en el mar y en la costa, teniendo en cuenta que las aguas del gran Pacífico no representan la frontera que separa, sino el puente que une a Colombia y los países de Oceanía y del sudeste asiático, considerada como la zona con los mercados de mayor proyección del mundo. Esta es una más de las principales razones, sumada a las necesidades de desarrollo y las aspiraciones nacionales de consolidar factores de seguridad multidimensional y de presencia estatal en las áreas de frontera, para aprovechar las múltiples potencialidades que ofrece el vasto océano Pacífico para una nación en desarrollo, y con la aspiración nacional de llegar a ser una potencia media regional influyente como lo es Colombia. Por lo anterior, el mismo CCCP, ahora denominado Centro de Investigaciones Oceanográficas e Hidrográficas del Pacífico, presenta con orgullo el resultado de un esfuerzo por satisfacer estos requerimientos a través de la publicación del título COMPILACIÓN OCEANOGRÁFICA DEL PACÍFICO COLOMBIANO II, el cual consta de siete capítulos que garantizan la continuidad en los anteriores temas y proporciona algunos nuevos, complementando y ampliando la información ofrecida por la primera edición. Dentro de estas líneas de investigación fueron incluidas las particularidades geográficas y geomorfología de la CPC, su meteorología, la investigación oceanográfica en la Cuenca e influencia de los eventos ENOS, las condiciones de oleaje en el Pacífico colombiano, la variabilidad del nivel del mar, la amenaza por tsunami en la CPC y, finalmente, las tendencias en la biogeoquímica del océano Pacífico Oriental Tropical y Sureste bajo diferentes escenarios de cambio climático. Bienvenidos entonces a una ventana más del conocimiento sobre nuestra Cuenca Pacífica Colombiana, desde donde contribuimos a la “consolidación de Colombia como país marítimo” y aportamos nuestro pequeño pero representativo grano de arena a la defensa del enorme, hermoso e imponente azul de la bandera. El reconocimiento de los espacios marítimos para el desarrollo de un país es de vital importancia. Desde su exploración oceánica y costera, la hidrografía ha representado el conocimiento científico sobre el territorio marítimo colombiano y ha brindado información, instrumentos y herramientas para una mejor compresión y desarrollo de las actividades marítimas en el país. La producción de la cartografía náutica para asegurar las rutas marítimas y el comercio internacional de la nación es un aspecto fundamental, que a su vez ha cumplido un papel importante en el reconocimiento de las profundidades y el descubrimiento de riquezas económicas y culturales en los fondos oceánicos, además de aportar seguridad en la navegación por el espacio marítimo colombiano y un mejor conocimiento de nuestros litorales y sus potencialidades. La hidrografía entonces ha desempeñado eficientemente el rol de fortalecer y desarrollar las riquezas que se encuentran en nuestras aguas jurisdiccionales, y ha sido la disciplina científica que ha aportado al reconocimiento de los territorios costeros y oceánicos, y, consecutivamente, al avance en el desarrollo de la infraestructura marítima para el país. Objetivos que podemos hallar desde sus comienzos y que fueron evidenciados y visibilizados a lo largo de su labor y trabajo en los espacios y frentes marinos, que le han permitido a la Autoridad Marítima Colombiana, a través de un interés nacional y una visión internacional, mantener una navegación segura que haga parte del impulso y progreso económico y nacional, en contribución paralela a los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas.",,,,,,,2020-11-24,2020,2020-11-24,2020-11,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Monograph,"Oviedo-Barrero, Fernando; Niño-Pinzón, Diana Carolina; del Pilar Aguirre-Tapiero, María; Pantoja-López, Diana Nathali; Sánchez-Manco, Liliana; Quijano-Ferrín, Joao Camilo; Cabeza-Durango, Leswis; Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía; Muñoz-Ordoñez, Cristian Camilo; Iriarte-Sánchez, José David; Gutiérrez-Moreno, Manuel Alejandro; Rojas-Bedoya, Edisson Jair; Quintero-Paz, Kenny David; Torres-Parra, Rafael Ricardo; Orfila-Föster, Alejandro; Tobar-Mosquera, Cristian Andrés; Vásquez-López, Laura Marcela; Angulo, Yineth Viviana Camacho-De; Quiñonez-Torres, Harry Fernando; Sánchez-Escobar, Ronald Efrén; Paz-Quintero, Jhonatan Cristian; Realpe-Martínez, Fabio Hernán; Quintero-Rodríguez, Paola Andrea; Jaramillo-Ortiz, Fabián Camilo; Ruiz-Figueroa, Daniel; Guerrero-Castillo, Anlly Melissa; Otero-Díaz, Luis Jesús; Bermúdez-Rivas, Christian; Velasco, Julián A","Oviedo-Barrero, Fernando (); Niño-Pinzón, Diana Carolina (); del Pilar Aguirre-Tapiero, María (); Pantoja-López, Diana Nathali (); Sánchez-Manco, Liliana (); Quijano-Ferrín, Joao Camilo (); Cabeza-Durango, Leswis (); Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía (); Muñoz-Ordoñez, Cristian Camilo (); Iriarte-Sánchez, José David (); Gutiérrez-Moreno, Manuel Alejandro (); Rojas-Bedoya, Edisson Jair (); Quintero-Paz, Kenny David (); Torres-Parra, Rafael Ricardo (); Orfila-Föster, Alejandro (); Tobar-Mosquera, Cristian Andrés (); Vásquez-López, Laura Marcela (); Angulo, Yineth Viviana Camacho-De (); Quiñonez-Torres, Harry Fernando (); Sánchez-Escobar, Ronald Efrén (); Paz-Quintero, Jhonatan Cristian (); Realpe-Martínez, Fabio Hernán (); Quintero-Rodríguez, Paola Andrea (); Jaramillo-Ortiz, Fabián Camilo (); Ruiz-Figueroa, Daniel (); Guerrero-Castillo, Anlly Melissa (); Otero-Díaz, Luis Jesús (); Bermúdez-Rivas, Christian (); Velasco, Julián A ()",,"Oviedo-Barrero, Fernando (); Niño-Pinzón, Diana Carolina (); del Pilar Aguirre-Tapiero, María (); Pantoja-López, Diana Nathali (); Sánchez-Manco, Liliana (); Quijano-Ferrín, Joao Camilo (); Cabeza-Durango, Leswis (); Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía (); Muñoz-Ordoñez, Cristian Camilo (); Iriarte-Sánchez, José David (); Gutiérrez-Moreno, Manuel Alejandro (); Rojas-Bedoya, Edisson Jair (); Quintero-Paz, Kenny David (); Torres-Parra, Rafael Ricardo (); Orfila-Föster, Alejandro (); Tobar-Mosquera, Cristian Andrés (); Vásquez-López, Laura Marcela (); Angulo, Yineth Viviana Camacho-De (); Quiñonez-Torres, Harry Fernando (); Sánchez-Escobar, Ronald Efrén (); Paz-Quintero, Jhonatan Cristian (); Realpe-Martínez, Fabio Hernán (); Quintero-Rodríguez, Paola Andrea (); Jaramillo-Ortiz, Fabián Camilo (); Ruiz-Figueroa, Daniel (); Guerrero-Castillo, Anlly Melissa (); Otero-Díaz, Luis Jesús (); Bermúdez-Rivas, Christian (); Velasco, Julián A ()",2,1,,,http://cecoldodigital.dimar.mil.co/2687/1/396_DIMAR.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140418091,,

The authors support the hypothesis that the current regional disparities are principally the result of a long and complex process in which historical, geographical, economic, institutional, and political factors have all worked together. Lessons from the past can aid current debates on regional inequalities, territorial cohesion, and public policies in developing and also developed countries. In contrast with European countries, Latin American economies largely specialized in commodity exports, showed high levels of urbanization and high transports costs (both domestic and international). This new research provides a new perspective on the economic history of Latin American regions and offers new insights on how such forces interact in peripheral countries. In that sense, natural resources, differences in climatic conditions, industrial backwardness and low population density areas leads us to a new set of questions and tentative answers. This book brings together a group of leading American and European economic historians in order to build a new set of data on historical regional GDPs for nine Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.

coordination of nodes in distributed remote sensing applications. Additionally,
this paper proposes a general system model and identifies preliminary
guidelines and critical elements for implementing the synchronization
mechanisms exploiting the inter-satellite communication link. The distributed
phase synchronization loop introduced in this work deals with the
self-interference in a full-duplex point to point scenario by transmitting two

Río de la Plata, primera mitad del siglo XIX (Municipal Republics and its Imprint on Independence Processes. Rio de la Plata, First Half of the Nineteenth Century.)","Spanish Abstract: Los estudios sobre el republicanismo en la historia Latinoamericana han tenido un notable desarrollo en los últimos años. No solo se han aplicado a la región los análisis provenientes de la historiografía anglosajona, sino que también se han generado nuevos enfoques buscando identificar las características comunes y distintivas de una larga serie de “experimentos republicanos” acaecidos tras la crisis del orden colonial español. Aunque con excepciones, en la mayoría de estos estudios predomina el interés por un sentido disruptivo de república, según el cual este término designa una forma de gobierno opuesta a la Monarquía. Este trabajo procura, por el contrario, recuperar la impronta de un sentido tradicional que, en la tradición hispana, vinculaba a la república con el gobierno municipal. Sin negar la relevancia de los cambios profundos a nivel de la retórica política, nuestro trabajo procura mostrar cómo aquel concepto tradicional de república, en cuyo núcleo semántico se sitúa la noción de “gobierno de muchas familias”, contribuyó a sostener en las provincias rioplatenses un tipo de legitimación basada más bien en los privilegios coloniales de las ciudades que en la moderna noción de soberanía popular. De este modo, el republicanismo de la primera mitad del siglo XIX, al menos en esta región, parece representar un momento de transición desde la tradición antes que un profundo quiebre con el pasado colonial.English Abstract: Studies on republicanism in Latin American history have undergone a remarkable development in recent years. Not only have analyses from Anglo-Saxon historiography been applied to the region, but new approaches have also been generated seeking to identify the common and distinctive characteristics of a long series of ""republican experiments"" that took place after the crisis of the Spanish colonial order. Although with exceptions, most of these studies are mainly focused on a disruptive sense of republic, according to which this term designates a form of government opposed to the Monarchy. This paper seeks, on the contrary, to recover the imprint of a traditional sense that, in the Hispanic tradition, linked the concept of republic with the municipal government. Without denying the relevance of profound changes at the level of political rhetoric, our paper seeks to show how the traditional concept of republic, in whose semantic core lies the notion of ""government of many families"", contributed to sustain in the Rio de la Plata provinces a type of legitimization based more on the colonial privileges of the cities than on the modern notion of popular sovereignty. Thus, republicanism in the first half of the nineteenth century, at least in this region, seems to represent a moment of transition from tradition rather than a deep break with the colonial past.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Aguero, Alejandro","Aguero, Alejandro (CONICET-CIJS Universidad Nacional de Córdoba)",,"Aguero, Alejandro (National University of Córdoba)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136857415,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 44 Human Society","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

We investigated the role played by each of the main competencies linked to the following intercultural dimensions: Professional Identity, Ethics and Axiology, Methodology, and Inclusive Education. We used an integrated methodology and a cross-study of data, performed after the obtention of a three-cornered evaluation of results collected in focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires. We were able to show the impact of intercultural dialogue and understanding in the education for a sustainable development pattern. This is fundamental to set up a new ecology of forms, knowledge, attitudes, and educational meanings, further used to update teachers and students’ training in sustainable ecology and cultural diversity.

While fossil and stratigraphic data show that reconfiguration of river drainages resulted from mountain uplift in the tropical Andes, investigations of the impact of landscape change on the evolution of the flora in the region have been restricted to terrestrial taxa.    We explore the role of landscape change on the evolution of plants living strictly in rivers across drainage basins in northern South America by conducting population structure, phylogenomic, phylogenetic networks, and divergence-dating analyses for populations of riverweeds ( Marathrum , Podostemaceae).     We show that mountain uplift and drainage basin formation isolated populations of Marathrum and created barriers to gene flow across rivers drainages. Sympatric species hybridize and the hybrids show the phenotype of one parental line. We propose that the pattern of divergence of populations reflect the formation of river drainages, which was not complete until <4 Ma    Our study provides a clear picture of the role of landscape change in shaping the evolution of riverweeds in northern South America, advances our understanding of the reproductive biology of this remarkable group of plants, and spotlights the impact of hybridization in phylogenetic inference.","We are thankful to Dr. C.Thomas Philbrick for his helpful and thorough insights into the biology and classification of Podostemaceae, access to voucher specimens, and help with determination of samples.

Strong geochemical evidence supports the hypothesis that the CLIP formed due to melting of the plume head of the Galápagos hotspot, which interacted with the Farallon (Proto-Caribbean) plate in the east Pacific. Considering the plate tectonics theory, it is expected that the lithospheric portion of the plume-related material migrated within the Proto-Caribbean plate, in a north–north-eastward direction, developing the present-day Caribbean plate. In this research, we used 3D lithospheric-scale, data-integrative models of the current Caribbean plate setting to reveal, for the first time, the presence of positive density anomalies in the uppermost lithospheric mantle. These models are based on the integration of up-to-date geophysical datasets, from the Earth’s surface down to 200 km depth, which are validated using high-resolution free-air gravity measurements. Based on the gravity residuals (modelled minus observed gravity), we derive density heterogeneities both in the crystalline crust and the uppermost oceanic mantle (",,,EGUsphere,,,,2020-09-28,2020,2020-09-28,,2020,,1-36,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gómez-García, Ángela María; Le Breton, Eline; Scheck-Wenderoth, Magdalena; Monsalve, Gaspar; Anikiev, Denis","Gómez-García, Ángela María (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, 14473, Germany; Universidad Nacional de Colombia – Medellín, Facultad de Minas; CEMarin – Corporation Center of Excellence in Marine Sciences); Le Breton, Eline (Institute of Geological Sciences, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, 12249, Germany); Scheck-Wenderoth, Magdalena (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, 14473, Germany); Monsalve, Gaspar (Universidad Nacional de Colombia – Medellín, Facultad de Minas); Anikiev, Denis (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, 14473, Germany)",,"Gómez-García, Ángela María (Helmholtz Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences; National University of Colombia; CEMarin – Corporation Center of Excellence in Marine Sciences); Le Breton, Eline (Freie Universität Berlin); Scheck-Wenderoth, Magdalena (Helmholtz Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences); Monsalve, Gaspar (National University of Colombia); Anikiev, Denis (Helmholtz Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences)",1,0,,0.26,https://se.copernicus.org/articles/12/275/2021/se-12-275-2021.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131231428,37 Earth Sciences; 3703 Geochemistry; 3705 Geology; 3706 Geophysics,

551,pub.1131476226,10.48550/arxiv.2010.02776,,,Polyakov formulas for conical singularities in two dimensions,"We investigate the zeta-regularized determinant and its variation in the
presence of conical singularities, boundaries, and corners. For surfaces with
isolated conical singularities which may also have one or more smooth boundary
components, we demonstrate both a variational Polyakov formula as well as an
integrated Polyakov formula for the conformal variation of the Riemannian
metric with conformal factors which are smooth up to all singular points and
boundary components. We demonstrate the analogous result for curvilinear
polygonal domains in surfaces. We then specialize to finite circular sectors
and cones and via two independent methods obtain variational Polyakov formulas
for the dependence of the determinant on the opening angle. Notably, this
requires the conformal factor to be logarithmically singular at the vertex. We
further obtain explicit formulas for the determinant for finite circular
sectors and cones.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-10-06,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Aldana, Clara L.; Kirsten, Klaus; Rowlett, Julie","Aldana, Clara L.

En este sentido, los semilleros de investigación se constituyen como una herramienta de participación de los estudiantes en actividades de investigación que contribuye en su formación integral,en el caso de los programas de Ingeniería Industrial potencializa la capacidad analítica, innovadora, crítica, de expresión y de generación de soluciones de los estudiantes, que a su vez contribuyen a la mejora continua de los contextos de análisis. En coherencia, el SEGUNDO ENCUENTRO NACIONAL DE SEMILLEROS DE INGENIERÍA INDUSTRIAL (II ENSIII) organizado por la Facultad de Ingeniería Industrial de la Universidad Santo Tomás - Sede Principal, tuvo como objetivo generar un espacio de integración entre docentes y estudiantes de universidades de diferentes ciudades del país, buscando socializar los proyectos desarrollados por cada uno de sus semilleros de investigación en relación a la Ingeniería Industrial, permitiendo compartir experiencias pedagógicas en la formación para la investigación, discutir y debatir frente a las tendencias de la investigación en la Ingeniería Industrial e intercambiar conocimientos y experiencias al respecto. El presente libro recoge las contribuciones en modalidad de ponencias y póster de proyectos terminados, en curso y propuestas que presentaron en el evento los semilleros participantes. Dentro de las temáticas abordadas se encuentra el mejoramiento de procesos y la gestión organizacional desde el enfoque tradicional, la incursión en otras tendencias como la innovación, el diseño, la informática, entre otros. Los proyectos presentados responden a diversos enfoques investigativos, cualitativos, cuantitativos y mixtos que permiten identificar la tendencia de las técnicas de análisis de problemáticas de la Ingeniería Industrial y su inclinación a la interdisciplinariedad.",,,,,,,2020,2020,2020,2020,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Monograph,"Riveros, Helien Parra; Sandoval, José Luis Sandoval; Parada, Luis Felipe Chaparro; Silva, Magda Viviana Monroy; Montenegro, Beatriz Lorena Rodríguez; Zarate, Luisa Fernanda Alcalá; del Carmen Navarro Romero, Elisa; López, Jairo Antonio Preciado; Moreno, Luis Manuel Pulido; Hincapié, José Alexander Rodríguez; Usaquén, Miguel Ángel Ospina; Delgado, Oscar Emmanuel Granados; Calderón, Edy Arturo Suárez","Riveros, Helien Parra (); Sandoval, José Luis Sandoval (); Parada, Luis Felipe Chaparro (); Silva, Magda Viviana Monroy (); Montenegro, Beatriz Lorena Rodríguez (); Zarate, Luisa Fernanda Alcalá (); del Carmen Navarro Romero, Elisa (); López, Jairo Antonio Preciado (); Moreno, Luis Manuel Pulido (); Hincapié, José Alexander Rodríguez (); Usaquén, Miguel Ángel Ospina (); Delgado, Oscar Emmanuel Granados (); Calderón, Edy Arturo Suárez ()",,"Riveros, Helien Parra (); Sandoval, José Luis Sandoval (); Parada, Luis Felipe Chaparro (); Silva, Magda Viviana Monroy (); Montenegro, Beatriz Lorena Rodríguez (); Zarate, Luisa Fernanda Alcalá (); del Carmen Navarro Romero, Elisa (); López, Jairo Antonio Preciado (); Moreno, Luis Manuel Pulido (); Hincapié, José Alexander Rodríguez (); Usaquén, Miguel Ángel Ospina (); Delgado, Oscar Emmanuel Granados (); Calderón, Edy Arturo Suárez ()",0,0,,,https://repository.usta.edu.co/bitstream/11634/30997/1/LIBRO%20DE%20MEMORIAS%20ENSIII%202018.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133495869,,

By demonstrating that Isthmian political and pedagogical debates went beyond the preoccupation for the realisation of classic liberalism and exploitation of Panama’s geographical views, this book challenges the perspective that Panamanian identity was a fabrication of the United States. Instead, this study reveals that the combination of positivist and conservative understandings of morality, reason and good science defined governmental policies intended to recuperate and enhance civic values and nationalism, leading the way to progress and modernity.",,,,,,,2020,2020,,2020,,,,Closed,Monograph,"de la Guardia Wald, Rolando","de la Guardia Wald, Rolando (University of Panama, Panama City, Panama)",,"de la Guardia Wald, Rolando (Universidad de Panamá)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137041040,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies",

It addresses the repeatability, variability, and sensitivity of lateral spreading observed in twenty-four centrifuge model tests on mildly sloping liquefiable sand. The centrifuge tests were conducted at nine different centrifuge facilities around the world. For the first time, a sufficient number of experiments were conducted to enable assessment of variability of centrifuge test results. The experimental data provided a unique basis for assessing the capabilities of twelve different simulation platforms for numerical simulation of soil liquefaction. The results of the experiments and the numerical simulations are presented and discussed in papers submitted by the project participants. The work presented in this book was followed by LEAP-Asia that included assessment of a generalized scaling law and culminated in a workshop in Osaka, Japan in March 2019. LEAP-2020, ongoing at the time of printing, is addressing the validation of soil-structure interaction analyses of retaining walls involving a liquefiable soil.

Because of eclipse occurrence timing over the Chilean region, it is a unique event as happened during the local evening time, when ionospheric evolution was going down due to decrease in electron density as intensity of ionizing radiation decreases. Solar eclipse, solar further decreases ionizing radiation. We have chosen two GPS receiving station close to totality path. The SILL station was in totality (magnitude 1.006), while PVCA was in partial (magnitude 0.99) eclipse region. Interestingly, we have observed maximum decrease in electron density (0.56 TEC unit) at PVCA compare to SILL (0.38 TEC unit) station. The higher decrease in electron density at partial eclipse station could possibly due to two regions: local time difference and geographical difference. A more detailed analysis is further warranted to confirm these possibilities.","The author A.K.M. thanks the Science and Education Research Board (SERB) for financial support under Ramanujan Fellowship (file SB/S2/RJN-052/2016) and the Faculty Recharge Program (FRP) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) (ID FRP62343), New Delhi.

Based on data gathered for the Worlds of Journalism Study, which conducted surveys with more than 27,000 journalists in 67 countries, the authors explore aspects such as linguistic and religious influences on journalists’ identities, journalists’ views of development journalism, epistemic issues, as well as the relationship between journalism and democracy. Further, the book provides a history of the evolution of the Worlds of Journalism Study, as well as the challenges of conducting such comparative work across a wide range of contexts. A critical review by renowned comparative studies scholar Jay Blumler offers food for thought for future endeavours. This unprecedented collaborative effort will be essential reading for scholars and students of journalism who are interested in comparative approaches to journalism studies and who want to explore the wide variety of journalism cultures that exist around the globe.

These analyses aim to develop a basis for modernization and possibly the construction of new foundries in Chile; are considered economic, competitive and strategic aspects. In Chile, an increase in the production of copper sulfide concentrates is projected, considering the depletion of oxidized minerals. This increase also includes complex or dirty concentrates with a high presence of impurities, mainly arsenic. Currently in an environmental context, Chilean smelters on average do not meet the emissions standard for copper smelters due to the age of these smelters and the high investment required to modify their infrastructure. Strategically, the increase in high impurities in concentrates results in higher treatment costs, penalties and difficulty of acceptance in the international market. With regard to the economic context of these smelters in Chile, these are among the most cost of operation worldwide. A globalized strategy for the modernization of foundries in Chile is therefore needed. High-capacity foundries are recommended, which will have state-of-the-art technology to eliminate arsenic and capture emissions and are also fed by mixtures of concentrates from different mines, with the participation of Codelco and private miners.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INVENTIVE MATERIAL SCIENCE APPLICATIONS: ICIMA 2020,,,2020-10-15,2020,,2020-10-15,2281,1,020008,Closed,Proceeding,"Toro, Norman; Ayala, Luís; Pérez, Kevin; Castillo, Jonathan; Navarra, Alessandro","Toro, Norman (Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile; Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Arturo Prat, Antofagasta 1244260, Chile); Ayala, Luís (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Arturo Prat, Antofagasta 1244260, Chile); Pérez, Kevin (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Arturo Prat, Antofagasta 1244260, Chile); Castillo, Jonathan (Departamento de Ingeniería en Metalurgia, Universidad de Atacama, Copiapó 1531772, Chile); Navarra, Alessandro (Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, McGill University, 3610 University Street, Montreal, QC H3A 0C5, Canada)","Toro, Norman (Catholic University of the North; Arturo Prat University)","Toro, Norman (Catholic University of the North; Arturo Prat University); Ayala, Luís (Arturo Prat University); Pérez, Kevin (Arturo Prat University); Castillo, Jonathan (University of Atacama); Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University)",1,0,,0.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131822280,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

In this regard, the use of dielectric spectroscopy is being coupled to statistical methods such as machine learning in order to develop new methods to identify adulteration. However, there is a small number of scientific reports above the application of the aforementioned methods when citric fruit juices is being identified. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate dielectric spectroscopy and four different classification techniques (Support Vector Machine - SVM, K-nearest neighbor-KNN, Linear Discriminat -LD and Quadratic Discriminat-QD) to discriminate between three citrus juices. For this purpose, samples of Citrus limetta, Citrus limettioides and Citrus reticulata were evaluated; obtaining its dielectric spectral profiles in the range of 5 to 9 GHz. Then from the spectral profiles the loss factor (e”) was calculated using the reflection coefficient. Next e” value was pretreated, reducing noise through a savitzky golay filter, and new variables created through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, the models for classification were constructed with the previously mentioned techniques and the principal components. The results shown that using four components the variance can be explained in 97%; likewise, the discrimination values vary between 88.9 and 100.0%, with SVM, LD and QD the best discrimination techniques all successfully at 100.0 %. Therefore; It is concluded that the technique of dielectric spectroscopy and machine learning presents potential for the discrimination of citrus fruit juices.","The authors would like to thank Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Chota for funding with mining CANON funds the excecution of the research project called “Desarrollo de un sistema no destructivo para la determinación de las propiedades físicoquímicas en frutas nativas y derivados de la región Cajamarca, usando espectroscopía dieléctrica” approved with resolution N°432-2018-C.O./UNACH.

338,pub.1133244648,10.4324/9780429053351,,,Approaches to Specialized Genres,"Approaches to Specialized Genres provides a timely update of the field of genre studies, with 14 cutting-edge contributions split into five sections using and integrating an exceptionally wide variety of methods and perspectives (such as ESP genre research, corpus linguistics, systemic functional linguistics, ethnographic and multimodal research) to analyse genres in written, spoken, visual and auditory modes across a multiplicity of pedagogic, professional and digital settings. It highlights and illustrates the growing trend of a multiperspective and inter-theoretic approach to genre studies and demonstrates how such methodological rigour can extend our knowledge of language, in general, and genres, in particular. It also examines a rich variety of underexplored genres such as the digital genre of synchronous videoconferencing, instructional slides, video ads, engineers’ training log book entries, the narrative story genres, fundraising letters and retraction notices. It demonstrates not only the prominent value of genre research but also wide applications of genre knowledge in various educational and professional domains. The book brings together experts spreading across the world, including countries in South-East Asia, Europe, America, West Africa and South America. Accordingly, it will appeal to readers of diversified socio-cultural backgrounds working in all the aforementioned inter-related fields of applied linguistics and communication studies.",,,,,"Kathy Ling LIN, Isaac N.

The present approach considers as main criterion that the outdoor infection is a random event that depends of a plethora of variables and free parameters. We project the present theoretical proposal to the current Corona Virus Disease 2019 pandemic by which is established that people must keep a social distance ranging between 1.5m and 2.0m in order to avoid contact with aerosol. In this paper stochastic and deterministic equations are proposed as well as hybrid relationships that would explain facts in the action of outdoor infection.

More than an abstract application, we develop a closed-form theory that is applied to certain cases where standards theoretical approaches might fail to describe nonlinear phenomenology of wireless-based events. In concrete we calculate the probability amplitude and therefore it is interpreted as the chance for getting a pure signal from a primary source. Taking into account the completeness property of the orthogonal states, we proceed to implement the noises that would appear as a spontaneous mechanism more than an “adhoc” procedure.

Robinson Crusoe Island is 667 km from the continent and approximately four million years old; Alejandro Selkirk Island is an additional 181 km west and only one million years old. The natural impacts of subsidence and erosion have shaped the landscapes of these islands, resulting in progressive changes to their subtropical vegetation. The older island has undergone more substantial changes, due to both natural causes and human impacts. After the discovery of Robinson Crusoe Island in 1574, people began cutting down forests for lumber to construct boats and homes, for firewood, and to make room for pastures. Domesticated plants and animals were introduced, some of which have since become feral or invasive, causing damage to the local vegetation. The wealth of historical records on these activities provides a detailed chronicle of how human beings use their environment for survival in a new ecosystem.

Often patients cannot estimate a possible crisis so that, in most cases most of them are quite sensitive to strokes and cardiac arrest unexpectedly. In this paper the algorithm of Tom Mitchell is employed as a kind of software that manages the updated inputs in order to anticipate a possible crisis in terms of probabilities. Thus, while sensors are enough accurate to measure a variable, the algorithm is able to make predictions about the worse scenarios of diabetes crisis. When this information is monitored inside an Internet of Bio-nano Things network, patients might be assisted in the shortest times, by avoiding irreversible complications in their health. Therefore, a health services operator acquires capabilities to minimize risks and make fast and precise decisions with minimal errors either from clinicians and instruments.",,,,2020 IEEE / ITU International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Good (AI4G),,,2020-01-25,2020,,2020-01-25,00,,147-151,Closed,Proceeding,"Nieto-Chaupis, Huber","Nieto-Chaupis, Huber (Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

316,pub.1133476196,10.1117/12.2562015,,,Development of an experimental optical adaptive optics for small telescopes,"We are developing an optical adaptive optics (AO) system for small telescopes. An AO instrument in optical wavelength mounted on a 1-2 m class telescope located at a good seeing site will make it possible to achieve high angular resolution of 0.1-0.2 arcsec. Such capability will enable us to perform unique astronomical programs, as well as to provide good opportunity in education for both astronomy and engineering. In order to examine the AO capability on small telescopes, we developed an experimental AO instrument, in which inexpensive commercial devices are extensively used to reduce cost for development. We designed the weight and the physical size so small that it is portable and easy to be mounted on a small telescope, which is a unique feature of our AO instrument. After the engineering observations performed in Japan, we mounted it on the 1-m telescope of the European Southern Observatory of La Silla in Chile in March 2018 to examine the performance. We found that there were approximately 4 times and 5 times improvements in the full-width-halfmaximum (FWHM) and Strehl ratio of the PSF from the natural seeing, respectively. The best AO-corrected PSF obtained during the observation achieved FWHM=0.18 arcsec and the Strehl ratio = 0.18. Based on the detailed analysis of the timeseries wavefront and deformable-mirror-operation data, further improvement in AO performance is expected by adjustment of the system parameters. We succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility of an inexpensive optical AO system for small telescopes.",,,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Adaptive Optics Systems VII,"Dirk Schmidt, Laura Schreiber, Elise Vernet",,2020-12-13,2020,,,11448,,114486z-114486z-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Minezaki, Takeo; Kono, Yukihiro; Vanzi, Leonardo; Zapata, Abner; Flores, Mauricio; Ramirez, Sebastian; Ohnaka, Keiichi","Minezaki, Takeo (The Univ. of Tokyo (Japan)); Kono, Yukihiro (The Univ. of Tokyo (Japan)); Vanzi, Leonardo (Pontificia Univ.

312,pub.1141923782,10.18041/978-958-5578-25-8,,,Restitución de tierras: fundamentos y desafíos para la superación del conflicto armado en Colombia,"El Acuerdo de Paz entre el Gobierno Nacional y las FARC sin duda se cons-tituye en un hito histórico en la historia de Colombia y de los conflictos armados en el mundo. En últimas, las partes concuerdan en considerar que este es tan solo el inicio de una serie de transformaciones en el ámbito polí-tico, económico y social que se deberán gestar en los años siguientes para el logro de una paz duradera y estable. Por eso, dentro de los puntos más importantes del Acuerdo cobra una gran centralidad la cuestión agraria, bajo el entendido de que las desigualdades históricas que afectan incluso hoy en día principalmente a los campesinos del país han sido el motor de la guerra.Las bases del punto uno, sobre la reforma rural integral, involucran de manera significativa un tema de la mayor importancia: la restitución de tierras a las víctimas del conflicto que tuvieron que abandonar sus predios por causa del conflicto armado. En Colombia, la acción de restitución de tierras ha tenido un desarrollo anterior a la firma del Acuerdo Final y encuentra su origen en la política de reparación integral a las víctimas del conflicto en el marco de los parámetros que ha establecido el Estado para configurar un modelo de justicia transicional.En este contexto, la presente publicación busca aportar a la reflexión sobre la importancia de la restitución de tierras en el país, a partir de la explicitación de sus fundamentos teóricos y normativos, las instituciones jurídicas que la componen y el análisis de los argumentos que permiten defender su razonabilidad dentro de la interpretación constitucional. Lo anterior se efectúa desde la reconstrucción histórica y el contexto social y político en el que emerge, lo que a su vez permite identificar algunas problemáticas y particularidades que van a marcar su diseño, así como los retos que permanentemente enfrenta.El planteamiento central que se defiende es que la acción de restitución de tierras es un componente estratégico de la mayor importancia para el cumplimiento de los objetivos de justicia social que establece el Acuerdo Final y, en esa medida, su capacidad institucional debe ser mantenida y opti-mizada para articularse con los propósitos de la Reforma Rural Integral. En efecto, sus resultados han contribuido al restablecimiento de derechos, a la resolución pacífica de los conflictos sobre el territorio, a establecer sinergias entre las autoridades locales y nacionales con la finalidad de brindar soste-nibilidad a los retornos y mejorar las condiciones de vida de los campesinos y llegar a las zonas donde el Estado no ha tenido una presencia significa-tiva; aspectos que sin duda contribuyen a cimentar las bases de una paz con enfoque territorial. Frente a este planteamiento, el libro no formula propuestas definitivas ni aborda todos los posibles escenarios en los que se requeriría adelantar estos esfuerzos de optimización y articulación. Por el contrario, los temas que lo componen proporcionan una mirada integral de la restitución de tierras desde la que es posible comprender con más herramientas su complejidad y particularidades en el contexto actual. A partir de este presupuesto es posible emprender nuevos esfuerzos investigativos para dar cuenta del alcance de la restitución de tierras en el Pos-Acuerdo. En todo caso, si bien es cierto que el país ha dado un paso importante hacia la paz, aún persisten nuevas situa-ciones de violencia derivadas del conflicto armado, lo que justifica además que se continúe estudiando la relevancia de políticas de reparación a víctimas del conflicto, como en este caso la de restitución de tierras.Aclarado lo anterior, es posible identificar cuatro temáticas que pueden estu-diarse de forma autónoma en cada capítulo, aunque en su conjunto brindan un panorama general de la restitución de tierras en el país.En el primero, se indaga sobre el concepto y la regulación jurídica interna-cional de la restitución de tierras, identificando sus peculiaridades, así como los elementos, que desde una perspectiva de los derechos humanos que los concibe como integrales e interdependientes, tienen la potencialidad de aproximarla, sin desnaturalizarla, al cumplimiento de objetivos de justicia social y redistributiva. El análisis allí efectuado ayuda a esclarecer los puntos de articulación entre esos dos conceptos de justicia, partiendo de la constatación de que una de las principales causas del conflicto armado en el país es la desigualdad social. En ese sentido, la consecución de la paz implicaría no solo la búsqueda de la reparación integral a las víctimas mediante la restitución de las tierras despojadas o abandonadas, sino además la superación de la desigualdad social, lo que implica contrarrestar fenómenos como la concentración de la propiedad. En la segunda y tercera parte se describen la problemática y el contexto en el que surge la restitución de tierras en el marco de la Ley 1448 de 2011. Para tal fin se describen algunos de sus antecedentes inmediatos y se analiza el marco normativo en el que se consagran principios, procedi-mientos e instituciones especiales para el cumplimiento de los objetivos de la restitución de tierras en el contexto de la justicia transicional. De igual manera, se efectúa una reflexión sobre su naturaleza, fundamento y características, dando especial énfasis a su dimensión constitucional. De manera específica se abordan los mecanismos que la componen y en qué medida estos satisfacen los criterios de razonabilidad que exige la justicia transicional. De manera especial se hacen consideraciones sobre la nece-sidad e importancia de instituciones como la focalización de predios, el carácter mixto de la acción, el tratamiento a los terceros y a los ocupantes secundarios y la naturaleza de la jurisdicción especializadaEn el último capítulo se efectúa una caracterización de los propósitos y mecanismos que se establecen en el Acuerdo Final en lo que respecta a la reforma rural integral, para a partir de allí reflexionar sobre el lugar de la restitución de tierras y los retos principales que esta debe superar para constituirse en un vehículo adecuado de los objetivos que este pretende en el escenario actual. Dentro de los principales retos que esto implica se destacan la necesidad de sellar un consenso frente a su legitimidad, nece-sidad e importancia, presupuesto imprescindible de la desactivación del espiral de violencia, así como la necesidad de lograr que las tensiones por el territorio se resuelvan a través de la apertura democrática, el respeto de la cultura y los intereses de las comunidades y la convivencia armónica entre diferentes modelos de desarrollo, dentro de los que se incluye, por supuesto, el de la economía campesina, aspecto que ya incorpora el texto del Acuerdo Final.El derrotero metodológico del libro parte de la identificación de las parti-cularidades jurídicas de la acción de restitución como un procedimiento complejo en el que se describen sus principales etapas y compo-nentes, dándoles sentido a partir de los pronunciamientos de la Corte Constitucional, que precisamente acentúan su estatus superior y afirman la razonabilidad y aceptabilidad de sus mecanismos en el contexto complejo del país y los estándares de la justicia transicional. Esto implica priorizar el enfoque hermenéutico y el análisis jurisprudencial a partir de la consulta y análisis de normas y decisiones judiciales paradigmáticas.De igual manera, en múltiples apartados es posible advertir la revisión, interpretación y sistematización de marcos jurídicos nacionales e inter-nacionales sobre restitución de tierras y acceso a la propiedad rural, útiles para formular hipótesis sobre los contenidos de justicia que esta alberga e interpretar los aspectos del proceso de paz que involucran la cues-tión agraria. Adicional a esto, a partir de entrevistas semiestructuradas a algunos actores políticos, activistas de derechos humanos y funcionarios públicos, y del análisis de documentación oficial y de notas de prensa, se reconstruyen algunos posicionamientos paradigmáticos sobre las temá-ticas abordadas, lo que contribuye a contextualizar el análisis jurídico e institucional. El presente libro se constituye en el informe final de investigación del proyecto “Constitucionalismo global, justicia transicional y multicultu-ralismo” que adelantan Andrés Mauricio Guzmán Rincón, Gustavo José Rojas Páez y José Guillermo Carrillo Ballesteros, profesores adscritos al Centro de Investigaciones Sociojurídicas de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Libre y que involucra el trabajo de los grupos de investi-gación de estudios constitucionales y de la paz y Derecho y sociedad y estudios internacionales.

In essence, peaks functions are assumed as the pattern of rate of infections at large cities. In this manner, once the free parameters of theses patterns are identified then one proceeds to engage to the well-known Mitchell’s criteria in order to construct the algorithm that would yield the best estimates as to carry out social intervention as well as to predict dates about the main characteristics of infection’s distributions. The distributions are modeled by the Dirac-Delta function whose spike property is used to make the numerical convolutions.

Our analyses extend the known distribution range northwards ca. 330 km. totaling ~1000 km along the Argentinean coast since its last detection in Nuevo Gulf in 2015. The expansion rate appeared to slow down during the last 15 years (from 115km/yr. to 30 km/yr.) as the species continues moving northwards into the transition zone between the Magellan and Argentinean biogeographic provinces (41°–43°S). In addition, a species distribution model (SDM) is provided at a much finer spatial resolution than previous studies, which accurately foresees suitable areas of invasion in the southern San Jorge Gulf, and predicts a hotspot of invasibility around 40°–33°S° if the invasion continues northward. Potential impacts of C. maenas on native species, particularly economically important oyster beds are discussed.",MMR’s research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT) under grant 1200843.

The robot software implementation requires a variety of knowledge and experiences. Thereby developing cost for such software systems is now increasing. Middleware systems such as Robot Operating System (ROS) are being developed to decrease such cost and widely used. Streaming data Sharing Manager (SSM) is one of such middleware systems that allow developers to write and read sensor data with timestamps using a common PC. This feature enables developers to control a robot by taking account of measured time. This control is important because using multiple sensor data with different timestamp cannot allow developers to control a robot correctly. SSM assumes that only one PC is used to control a robot, therefore if it exists a process that consumes much CPU resource, other processes cannot finish their assumed deadlines, leading to the unexpected behavior of a robot. This paper proposes an architecture called Distributed Streaming data Sharing Manager (DSSM) that enables to distributing each process on existing SSM to different PCs. We investigate the current architecture and behavior of SSM, then propose a new architecture that can achieve our goal. Finally, we apply DSSM to an existing SSM based robot control system that autonomously controls an unmanned vehicle, then confirm the effectiveness of DSSM by measuring the resource usages.",,,,2020 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII),,,2020-01-15,2020,,2020-01-15,00,,862-866,Closed,Proceeding,"Fukuda, Hiroaki; Gunji, Ryota; Hasegawa, Tadahiro; Leger, Paul; Figueroa, Ismael","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Gunji, Ryota (Graduate School of Electrical Engineerning and Computer Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Hasegawa, Tadahiro (Department of Electrical Engineerning, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ingenieía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Figueroa, Ismael (Escuela de Auditoría, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile)","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology)","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Gunji, Ryota (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Hasegawa, Tadahiro (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Figueroa, Ismael (University of Valparaíso)",1,0,,0.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125504467,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

These guidelines make it possible to control the variables involved in crop growth, such as temperature, humidity, radiation, among others. At present, mathematical models are being developed to control the behavior of these variables in greenhouses. In this research, the modeling of forced airflow from the temperature and humidity in a greenhouse is carried out. The selected greenhouse is in the Yuyucocha experimental farm of the Universidad Técnica del Norte in the city of Ibarra-Ecuador. Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) of the variety colloquially called ""superchola"" are grown in the greenhouse using aeroponics. High-quality seeds are obtained; however, it is necessary to improve the minimum temperature conditions for the warm months of the year. A model was developed to determine how the airflow is distributed inside the enclosure. The model is validated by comparing the results obtained with experimental samples in June from a network of sensors. It is observed that the forced airflow in the enclosure needs external elements to reach the minimum temperatures required for the potato crop in the months of higher environmental temperature.",,,,2020 IEEE ANDESCON,,,2020-10-16,2020,,2020-10-16,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Cabascango, Manuel; Mejía-Echeverría, Cosme; Morales, Diego Ortíz; Peña, David Ojeda","Cabascango, Manuel (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador); Mejía-Echeverría, Cosme (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-GIDSIM-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador); Morales, Diego Ortíz (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-GIDSIM-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador); Peña, David Ojeda (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-GIDSIM-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador)","Cabascango, Manuel (Universidad Técnica del Norte)","Cabascango, Manuel (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Mejía-Echeverría, Cosme (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Morales, Diego Ortíz (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Peña, David Ojeda (Universidad Técnica del Norte)",3,2,,0.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133226249,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3008 Horticultural Production",

Of the 377 respondents, 288 graduates participated in the study and were drawn randomly from the master lists of 6,677 graduates of various academic programs offered from five-year spans School Year 2006 to 2010. The findings showed that the majority in their current position is casuals. It also showed that most of the respondents work in businesses or organizations related to education, wholesale and retail trade, financial intermediation, development, and public administration. Most of them, their present work is connected to the course they took at college. Programs with the highest percentage of working graduates, JRMSU ranked Engineering as the top program offered. Teacher education, on the other hand, has more employed graduates with the highest potential for full initial earnings. Finally, the profile information that best predicts the graduates' employment likelihood is gender, GPA, and licensure exam.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Maratas, Ed Neil","Maratas, Ed Neil (Jose Rizal Memorial State University)",,"Maratas, Ed Neil (Jose Rizal Memorial State University)",0,0,,0.0,https://thescholedge.org/index.php/sijmas/article/download/787/602,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140137772,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

Studies have also shown that there is a correlation between students' spatial skills and programming abilities, but it is unknown how well students' prior spatial abilities can predict students' introductory programming abilities at the end of the semester. During this study we used a multinomal logistic regression to create a predictive model to predict students' introductory programming abilities at the end of the semester. The highest model accuracy (64.6%) was obtained when accounting for students' prior programming abilities, prior spatial skills, socioeconomic status, and three factors regarding students' attitudes towards computing. It was also found that when looking at the predictability of each individual variable, students' prior spatial ability had the highest predictability (56.6% accuracy) when compared to all other variables.",,,,Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,,,2020-06-15,2020,2020-06-15,2020-06-15,,,446-451,Closed,Proceeding,"Bockmon, Ryan; Cooper, Stephen; Gratch, Jonathan; Zhang, Jian; Dorodchi, Mohsen","Bockmon, Ryan (University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA); Cooper, Stephen (University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA); Gratch, Jonathan (Texas Woman's University, Denton, TX, USA); Zhang, Jian (Texas Woman's University, Denton, TX, USA); Dorodchi, Mohsen (University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA)",,"Bockmon, Ryan (University of Nebraska–Lincoln); Cooper, Stephen (University of Nebraska–Lincoln); Gratch, Jonathan (Texas Woman's University); Zhang, Jian (Texas Woman's University); Dorodchi, Mohsen (University of North Carolina at Charlotte)",25,14,,7.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128203252,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

The study implemented algorithms of ANN using input data from a battery of psychometric tests. This battery assesses multiple domains of attention and executive functioning, memory and learning, sensorimotor functioning, social perception, language, and visual-spatial processing. We attempt to explore how accuracy is the use of ANN for the prediction of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We implemented the ANN with a configuration of three layers, 20 neurons in the input layer, 25 neurons in the hidden layer, and two neurons in the output layer. We studied the accuracy of the model in training and testing, also the confusion matrix of the model. Using our machine learning approach, we have trained the ANN model to predict children/adolescents with FASD with accuracy ranging from 75.5% in testing data. These results suggest that the ANN approach is a competitive and efficient methodology to detect and differentiate the cognitive neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. However, we could not recommend the use of this technique for diagnosis FASD if the model does not improve accuracy.",,,,2020 39th International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society (SCCC),,,2020-11-20,2020,,2020-11-20,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"de J.

latitude station in South America (Tucumán, 26.9{\deg}S, 294.6{\deg}E;
magnetic latitude 15.5{\deg}S, Argentina). Ground based ionosonde measurements
obtained during different seasonal and solar activity conditions (a year of low
solar activity, 2009 and one of high solar activity, 2016) are considered in
order to compare the ionospheric behavior. The parameters used to analyze the
variability are the median, upper and lower quartiles. In addition, the foF2
values are compared with those estimated by the International Reference
Ionosphere (IRI) - 2016 model. It is found that: a) A clear dependence on solar
activity is observed in foF2 and hmF2, both increase with increase in solar
activity. b) the variability of foF2 is higher at low solar activity, this
behavior is not observed in hmF2 that present similar variability during both
periods. c) the variability of foF2 is larger at night than during the day,
this behavior is more pronounced during the high solar activity period. d) The
variability of foF2 is higher than that of hmF2. e) Significant planetary wave
spectral peaks at about 2 and 5 days are observed at high and low solar
activity. f) In general, IRI overestimates foF2 during daytime, and
underestimates it at post-sunset period, a better agreement is shown during

However, activation mechanisms and base code definitions are insufficiently decoupled, as conditionals to activate layers require base code variable references. This hinders reuse, evolution, and modular reasoning of COP and base code, and therefore, uses of COP in real scenarios. This paper proposes interfaces, which are shared abstractions to communicate activation mechanisms and base code in a decoupled manner. Using these interfaces, an object can exhibit its internal state and behaviors, and conditionals use them to (de)activate layers. As layers are planned to be (re)used in different applications, developers can use interfaces to overcome the incompatibility between values exposed by a particular base code and values required by a layer. In addition, as a layer is a plain object, it can use an interface to exhibit the conditional evaluation of its activation to other layers to resolve conflicts among activations of layers. We apply this proposal to implicit activations in which evaluations of conditionals implicitly (de)activate layers. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of this proposal through RI-JS, a practical JavaScript library that currently supports interfaces, reactive activations (implementation variant for implicit activations), global and dynamic deployment, enter and exit transition processes, and partial methods.",,,,Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming and Advanced Modularity,,,2020-07-21,2020,2020-10-18,2020-07-21,,,1-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Leger, Paul; Masuhara, Hidehiko; Figueroa, Ismael","Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Masuhara, Hidehiko (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan); Figueroa, Ismael (Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile)",,"Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Masuhara, Hidehiko (Tokyo Institute of Technology); Figueroa, Ismael (University of Valparaíso)",3,1,,1.14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131879197,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4612 Software Engineering,

In this sense, machine learning is a suitable approach to analyze network traffic, and it generally achieves good results in the identification and detection of malware. However, an underlying problem is creating a dataset with network characteristics that accurately reflect the malwareś behavior. Characterizing adequately the dataset is a relevant process to identify malware with high precision when using traditional machine learning algorithms. This paper compares empirically three supervised machine learning algorithms, in order to identify ransomware traffic based on Android mobile network traffic features. We consider 9 features related to time properties of flows and bidirectional packets in 10 families of ransomware and different benign application Android network traffic. Empirical results show that Random Forest (RF) achieved a 96% accuracy in classifying ransomware, higher than Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) approaches.

The questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies in online environments. However, questionnaires available in the literature have some limitations when applied in MOOCs: (1) they do not consider those strategies that have been related with academic achievements in MOOCs; (2) the response rates are low due to their large number of questions, which limits the usage of the collected data; and (3) they do not capture the idiosyncrasies of the actual MOOCs technological environment given that statements of existing questionnaires are based on instruments developed in the 90s. To overcome these shortcomings, this study presents the MOOC-SRL, a questionnaire to measure SRL in MOOCs. This questionnaire is built upon an analysis of existing SRL questionnaires used in traditional face to face, online learning and on a review that analyzed which SRL strategies relate to successful learning outcomes in MOOCs. This questionnaire was validated through an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis developed over a sample of 4,627 ($N = 4,627$) learners of 6 different MOOCs.

into account some strategies in order to analyze outcomes and to finally make
an effective and more precise decision. Among those strategies, the
modification of the normalization process in the multiple-criteria
decision-making algorithm is still a question due to the confrontation of many
normalization tools. Normalization is the basic action in defining and solving
a MADM problem and a MADM model. Normalization is the first, also necessary,
step in solving, i.e. the application of a MADM method. It is a fact that the
selection of normalization methods has a direct effect on the results. One of
the latest normalization methods introduced is the Logarithmic Normalization
(LN) method. This new method has a distinguished advantage, reflecting in that
a sum of the normalized values of criteria always equals 1. This normalization
method had never been applied in any MADM methods before. This research study
is focused on the analysis of the classical MADM methods based on logarithmic
normalization. VIKOR and TOPSIS, as the two famous MADM methods, were selected
for this reanalysis research study. Two numerical examples were checked in both
methods, based on both the classical and the novel ways based on the LN. The
results indicate that there are differences between the two approaches.

Mental health problems in youth often continue into adulthood if not diagnosed or treated in time. Methods The Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA) [Child and Adolescent Evaluation System] was used to evaluate mental health indicators in a sample of students in Northern Chile. Two age-appropriate versions of the assessment were applied to a total sample of 5,043 students, which included an elementary education sample of 1,953 schoolchildren from fourth grade through sixth grade (ages 8 to 13 years), and a Secondary School sample of 3,090 schoolchildren from seventh grade (the last year of elementary school) through the last year of Secondary school (senior high school) (ages 12 to 19 years). For each group, the version of the assessment used was determined by the students’ grade level. Both samples included municipal, government-subsidized, and private schools. Results In this student population, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders were the main mental health problems identified, and indicators revealed a progressive increase in cases over the years, coinciding with the global epidemiological scenario.

The Case of The Magdalena River Fishery and Its Correlation with Anthropic Pressures,"Abstract Overfishing has been historically considered as the main cause of fish stock depletion worldwide. This paradigm has oriented fishery management towards a classical approach, under which externalities to fisheries were not considered as they were difficult to assess and measure. The aim of this study is to describe the dynamics of different environmental, economic, and demographic variables (water flow, forest cover, gold production, population growth, stored water volume, and sediments) in relation to the behavior of the fishery production in the Magdalena-Cauca river basin from 1980 to 2015. Generalized Additive Models were used to determine the variables that best explain fishery production. The findings confirmed that environmental deterioration of the Magdalena River basin explained at least 60% of the reduction in fishery production. Thus, we concluded that the traditional approach of making fishers responsible for the decline of fish production was a misguided argument, and before implementing restrictions on fishing activity, a better understanding of the overall system is crucial. Hence, fishery management should involve the economic and social sectors that affect the offer of ecosystem services within the basin, including fishing.","We thank Fundación Humedales for supporting the main author and her technical team in the field research and surveys.

Mental health problems in youth often continue into adulthood if not diagnosed or treated in time.Methods: The Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA) [Child and Adolescent Evaluation System] was used to evaluate mental health indicators in a sample of students in Northern Chile. Two age-appropriate versions of the assessment were applied to a total sample of 5,043 students, which included an elementary education sample of 1,953 schoolchildren from fourth grade through sixth grade (ages 8 to 13 years), and a Secondary School sample of 3,090 schoolchildren from seventh grade (the last year of elementary school) through the last year of Secondary school (senior high school) (ages 12 to 19 years). For each group, the version of the assessment used was determined by the students’ grade level. Both samples included municipal, government-subsidized, and private schools.Results: In this student population, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders were the main mental health problems identified, and indicators revealed a progressive increase in cases over the years, coinciding with the global epidemiological scenario. Males showed a greater presence of externalizing behaviors related to mental health problems associated with aggression and defiant behavior. However, females showed the highest number of mental health issues overall, especially regarding problems related to internalization.

To do so, the presence of antixenosis and antibiosis as components of resistance to vector Dalbulus maidis (DeLong 1923) as well as resistance to the pathogen Spiroplasma kunkelii (Whitcomb et al. 1986) under artificial inoculation conditions were investigated in four widely-distributed maize hybrids in Argentina. The hybrids shown differences in the levels of resistance and target organisms (either the insect vector or the pathogen). Antixenosis and antibiosis to D. maidis were observed in DK72-10. Resistance of DK79-10 to S. kunkelii was evidenced by a delayed onset of symptoms, and DKB390 was antixenotic to D. maidis and highly resistant to S. kunkelii . A good association was found between symptom severity and yield, but not between symptom severity and accumulation of pathogen S. kunkelii . In conclusion, the proposed methodology was efficacious and can aid the screening of resistant genotypes in breeding programs to reduce the impact of corn stunt disease, ensuring that hybrids with good resistance level will be planted by farmers whenever disease occurs.","We thank Mariana Ferrer for his assistance in setting up insect survival and symptom progression experiments.

Although theory predicts that, when fish face warmer temperatures, they grow to smaller adult sizes, see a reduction in their ability to move, and increase their probability of speciation, evaluations of such predictions are hampered owing to the lack of empirical data spanning both wide temporal and geographical scales. Here, using phylogenetic methods, temperature, and 21,895 occurrences for 158 worldwide-distributed species of fish, we show that smaller fish have occurred in warmer waters for over 150 million years and across marine and freshwater realms. Smaller fish have historically moved the shortest distances and at low speeds. In addition, small fish display the lowest probability of giving rise to new species. Further, we found that species of fish that displayed high speeds of geographical movement and rates of size evolution experienced higher rates of temperature change in their lineage. Taking these results together, global warming predicts a future where smaller fish that have reduced ability to move over aquatic systems will be more prevalent, in turn, this will result in fewer species contributing global biodiversity.","We thank to Ciara O’Donovan for her help and advice with the Geo Model analyses, and to Andrew Meade for helping with the computer cluster at University of Reading.

                  Introduction
                  
                    Therapies that target activating
                    Egfr, Alk, Ros1
                    and other mutations have become first-line treatments that improve NSCLC patient’s life expectancy. Latin-American patients are poorly represented in clinical trials and in genomic databases, thus little is known about the prevalence of actionable mutations in this population. This study characterizes, for the first time, the somatic mutations found in 52 actionable genes, and describe a novel set of potentially actionable mutations, in NSCLC patients from Chile, Brazil and Peru, while correlating these genomic occurrences with relevant clinical, demographic and pathology aspects.
                  
                
                
                  Methods
                  1732 subjects diagnosed with NSCLC were analyzed. DNA and RNA were sequenced using a 52 genes NGS panel. Mutations were annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor, COSMIC, OncoKB and the Cancer Genome Interpreter to categorize somatic mutations.
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    We found a total of 1713 mutations with 626 (36.5%) novel, potentially driver mutations. 66.1% of these novel mutations were predicted as Tier 1 driver mutations. Actionable mutations for
                    Ret and Alk
                    were more prevalent in Brazil than in Chile, whereas
                    Met
                    exon-14 skipping was significantly enriched in Chile. In Peru,
                    Egfr
                    is higher while
                    Kras
                    is lower. A high number of novels potentially driver mutations in know NSCLC actionable genes, such as
                    Alk, Erbb2, Ret, Met
                    , and
                    Ros1

Over the past four decades, governments across the globe have struggled to design, implement and evaluate policies that benefit the development of small firms. Deciding whether macro or micro policies are more appropriate for a given context has usually created an initial challenge for policy-makers. However, a cause for even greater dispute has been determining and agreeing what might be the preferred outcomes of such policies (e.g. more firms, better performing firms, fewer firm failures, job creation, greater productivity, higher levels of innovation, inclusivity of disadvantaged groups). Furthermore, evaluating the impact of specific policies presents a wide range of difficulties since it is impossible to isolate a simple cause-and-effect relationship between policy and its stated goal. This book explores the development of small business policy in five countries across five continents and seeks to develop a deeper understanding regarding how small business policy has evolved in these countries and what we might learn from their experiences.

Se asume que la propuesta de educación superior intercultural impulsada por el ISIA ha implicado una “reinvención” del papel del universitario y el uso/utilidad de los saberes mixes/campesinos en un contexto de capitalismo neoliberal que promueve la acumulación y la desposesión.

The book demonstrates the importance of addressing the history of Southeast Asia as a multi-layered framework, rather than a series of entangled histories. In doing so, Manila is contextualized not merely as a Spanish settlement connected to New Spain via America, but instead within Southeast Asia, situated between the Chinese and the Sulú Seas, and located in the centre of commercial routes used by Armenian, Dutch, and Portuguese traders. This historical and geographical context is crucial to understanding later cultural dialogues. Urban planning, housing and architecture, and social networks in the city are also examined.

and the presence of young stars in the bulge of the Milky Way is largely
debated. We recently demonstrated that Terzan 5, in the Galactic bulge, is a
complex stellar system hosting stars with very different ages and a striking
chemical similarity to the field population. This indicates that its progenitor
was likely one of the giant structures that are thought to generate bulges
through coalescence. Here we show that another globular cluster-like system in
the bulge (Liller 1) hosts two distinct stellar populations with remarkably
different ages: only 1-3 Gyr for the youngest, 12 Gyr for the oldest, which is
impressively similar to the old component of Terzan 5. This discovery
classifies Liller 1 and Terzan 5 as sites of recent star formation in the
Galactic bulge and provides clear observational proof that the hierarchical
assembly of primordial massive structures contributed to the formation of the
Milky Way spheroid.",,,arXiv,,,,2020-11-19,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ferraro, F. R.; Pallanca, C.; Lanzoni, B.; Crociati, C.; Dalessandro, E.; Origlia, L.; Rich, R.

How these dimensions correlate among them is focus of recent ecological research, but empirical evidence at regional scales, at which conservation decisions are usually made, remains absent. Using a field-based manipulative experiment conducted in two marine intertidal regions, we analyse the correlations among different aspects of stability in functioning (community cover) and composition of local communities facing a press disturbance. The experiment involved the removal of the local space-dominant species for 35 months in eight sites under different environmental regimes in northern- and southern-central Chile (ca. 30°S and 40°S, respectively). After the disturbance, the magnitude of the initial responses and the recovery patterns were similar among communities dominated by different species, but varied between the functional and compositional response variables, and among four dimensions of stability. The recovery trajectories in function and composition remained mostly uncorrelated across the system. Yet, larger initial functional responses were associated with faster recovery trajectories—high functional resilience, in turn, was associated with both, high and low variability in the pattern of recovery. Finally, the compositional stability dimensions were independent from each other. The results suggest that varying community compositions can perform similar levels of functioning, which might be the result of strong compensatory dynamics among species competing for space in these communities. Knowledge of several, and sometimes independent, aspects of stability is mandatory to fully describe the stability of complex ecological systems.","We thank all the enthusiastic undergraduate interns (Biología Marina; UACH), members of the Coastal Ecology Lab (Lafkenchelab, UACH), and the Changolab (CEAZA-UAI) who provided invaluable help during the fieldwork.

The authors provide quantitative assessments, either descriptively or by means of modelling, of important demographic issues affecting this part of the world. The topics addressed include: broad demographic trends across the Asia-Pacific region and its sub-regions; assessment of population decline, urbanization and spatial distribution using cases from China, Colombia, Japan and Australia; migration and economic impacts in Australasia, Chile and Timor Leste; and the impacts of declining or low fertility and population ageing in China, India, Thailand, and across Asia.

There is the need for prior dialogue with the parties about the possibility of considering a vision of the applicable law that did not was considered previously. We speak thus of a dialogical iura novit curia, in such a way that the decision of the judge does not surprise the parties and also making these participants of how the case will be decided. Those decisions that surprise in their content —already ready and pronounced the judgement— to the parties and which could well have been discussed in advance are the focus of attention. The parties must be allowed to be heard regarding the iura novit curia. This study demonstrates the correlation between the duty of collaboration linked to the iura novit curia that allows an adequate contradiction with a plural discussion of those involved in the civil process for a fairer judgement.

La de identidad consistiría en la confusión de sus atribuciones de casación e instancia, que lo ubicaría más cerca de la tercera instancia; la crisis de funcionamiento se evidenciaría en la sobrecarga de actividad de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, que implicaría un problema de congestión y, más relevante dogmáticamente, la desviación de la finalidad de la casación y; la de autoridad se reflejaría en la regulación de la doctrina probable, criterio que conviene revisar en relación con la finalidad y naturaleza jurídica de la institución. Las principales conclusiones son que la Corte no presenta la crisis de identidad, aunque se replantea la adopción de nuevos fines como efecto de la constitucionalidad y convencionalidad; sí soporta las crisis de funcionamiento y de autoridad y, como respuesta, se propone en su orden, la consolidación de la selección reglada de los recursos a decidir y la supresión de la doctrina probable y, en su lugar, la aceptación del precedente, resaltando la relevancia del diálogo judicial con los tribunales constitucional y supranacionales en el marco de la globalización judicial.",,,,,,,2020,2020,2020,2020,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.18041/978-958-5578-72-2,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142417408,,

163,pub.1129355555,10.5194/esurf-2020-57,,,A photogrammetry-based approach for soil bulk density measurements with an emphasis on applications to cosmogenic nuclide analysis,"The quantification of soil bulk density (ρB) is a cumbersome and time-consuming task when traditional soil density sampling techniques are applied. However, it can be important for terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) production rate scaling when deriving ages or surface process rates from buried samples, in particular when short-lived TCN such as in situ 14C are applied. Here we show that soil density determinations can be made using structure-from-motion multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry-based volume reconstructions of sampling pits. Accuracy and precision tests as found in the literature and as conducted in this study clearly indicate that photographs taken from both a consumer-grade digital single lens mirrorless (DSLM) and a smartphone camera are of sufficient quality to produce accurate and precise modelling results, i.e. to regularly reproduce the true volume and/or density by > 95 %. This finding holds also if a freeware-based computing workflow is applied. The technique has been used to measure ρB along three small-scale (−3 over a few tens of metres along the same slope. As such, the dataset that was mainly generated to derive more accurate TCN-based process rates and ages can be used to characterise the present-day condition of soils in the study area, which in turn can give insight into the long-term soil formation and prevailing environmental conditions.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2020-07-14,2020,2020-07-14,,2020,,1-32,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mohren, Joel; Binnie, Steven A.; Rink, Gregor M.; Knödgen, Katharina; Miranda, Carlos; Tilly, Nora; Dunai, Tibor J.","Mohren, Joel (Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, University of Cologne, Zülpicher Str. 49b, 50674 Cologne, Germany); Binnie, Steven A.

148,pub.1127543574,10.5194/cp-2020-63,,,Sea Ice dynamics at the Western Antarctic Peninsula during the industrial era: a multi-proxy intercomparison study,"In the last decades, changing climate conditions have had a severe impact on sea ice at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), an area rapidly transforming under global warming. To study the development of spring sea ice and environmental conditions in the pre-satellite era we investigated three short marine sediment cores for their biomarker inventory with particular focus on the sea ice proxy IPSO25 and micropaleontological proxies. The core sites in the Bransfield Strait are located in shelf to deep basin areas characterized by a complex oceanographic frontal system, coastal influence and sensitivity to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. We analyzed geochemical bulk parameters, biomarkers (highly branched isoprenoids, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, sterols), and diatom abundances and diversity over the past 200 years (210Pb dating), and compared them to observational data, sedimentary and ice core climate archives as well as results from numerical models. Based on biomarkers we could identify four different stratigraphic units with (1) stable conditions and moderate sea ice cover before 1860, (2) low to moderate sea ice cover between 1860 and 1930, (3) high seasonal variability and changes in sea ice regimes from 1930 to 1990 and (4) a shift to increasing sea ice cover despite anthropogenic warming since 1990. Although IPSO25 concentrations correspond quite well with satellite sea ice observations for the past 40 years, we note discrepancies between the biomarker-based sea ice estimates and the long-term model output for the past 200 years, ice core records and reconstructed atmospheric circulation patterns such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM). We propose that the sea ice biomarker proxies IPSO25 and PIPSO25 are not linearly related to sea ice cover and, additionally, each core site reflects specific, local environmental conditions. High IPSO25 and PIPSO25 values may not be directly interpreted as referring to high spring sea ice cover because variable sea ice conditions and enhanced nutrient supply may affect the production of both the sea-ice associated and phytoplankton-derived (open marine, pelagic) biomarker lipids. For a more meaningful interpretation we recommend to carefully consider individually biomarker records to distinguish between cold, sea ice favoring and warm, sea ice diminishing environmental conditions.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2020-05-12,2020,2020-05-12,,2020,,1-43,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Vorrath, Maria-Elena; Müller, Juliane; Rebolledo, Lorena; Cárdenas, Paola; Shi, Xiaoxu; Esper, Oliver; Opel, Thomas; Geibert, Walter; Muñoz, Práxedes; Haas, Christian; Lange, Carina B.; Lohmann, Gerrit; Mollenhauer, Gesine","Vorrath, Maria-Elena (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany); Müller, Juliane (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany; MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, Germany; Department of Geosciences, University of Bremen, Germany); Rebolledo, Lorena (Centro de Investigación Dinámica de Ecosistemas Marinos de Altas Latitudes (IDEAL), Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile; Instítuto Antártico Chileno (INACH), Punta Arenas, Chile); Cárdenas, Paola (Centro de Investigación Dinámica de Ecosistemas Marinos de Altas Latitudes (IDEAL), Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile); Shi, Xiaoxu (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany); Esper, Oliver (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany); Opel, Thomas (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany); Geibert, Walter (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany); Muñoz, Práxedes (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Haas, Christian (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany); Lange, Carina B.

It is the perspective of social pedagogy: a theoretical and practical perspective that has been developing in continental Europe over the last 150 years. Social pedagogy poses a way of acting that places young people at the center of socio-educational work, putting their decisions and actions into value. It aims to accompany them in their life process of personal construction within the framework of the community in which they live. The book is organized into three large blocks of chapters. The introduction aims to prepare readers for the social pedagogy approach to work with young people. It briefly outlines its current situation in the world and, relate it to the main professions in which it is embodied in different socio-cultural contexts: social pedagogy, social education, and social work. The first block presents the framework and socio-pedagogical, theoretical, and practical parameters in which work with young people takes place in Europe and Latin America. The second block of chapters deals with youth policies and the training and professionalization of educators and those who work with young people.

131,pub.1124225241,10.5194/cp-2019-147,,,Volcanism and climate change as drivers in Holocene depositional dynamic of Laguna del Maule (Andes of central Chile – 36° S),"Abstract. Late Quaternary volcanic basins are active landscapes from which detailed archives of past climate, seismic and volcanic activity can be obtained. A multidisciplinary study performed on a transect of sediment cores was used to reconstruct the depositional evolution of the high-elevation Laguna del Maule (LdM) (36° S, 2180 m asl, Chilean Andes). The recovered 5 m composite sediment sequence includes two thick turbidite units (LT1 and LT2) and numerous tephra layers (23 ash and 6 lapilli). We produced an age model is based on nine new 14C AMS date, existing 210Pb and 137Cs data and the Quizapú ash horizon (CE 1932). According to this age model, early Holocene were followed by a phase of increased productivity during the mid Holocene and higher lake levels after 4.0 ka BP. Major hydroclimate transitions occurred at ca. 0.5, 4.0, 8.0 and 11 ka BP. Decreased summer insolation and winter precipitation due to a southward shift in the Southern Westerly Winds and a strengthened Pacific Subtropical High could explain early Holocene lower lake levels. Increased biological productivity during the mid-Holocene (~ 8.0 to 6.0 ka) is coeval with a warm-dry phase described for much of southern South America. Periods of higher lake productivity are synchronous to higher frequency of volcanic events. During the late Holocene, the tephra layers shows compositional changes suggesting a transition from silica-rich to silica-poor magmas at around 4.0 cal ka BP. This transition was synchronous with increased variability of sedimentary facies and geochemical proxies, indicating higher lake levels and increased moisture at LdM after 4.0 cal ka BP, most likely caused by the inception of current ENSO/PDO-like dynamics in central Chile.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2020-01-22,2020,2020-01-22,,,,1-43,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Frugone-Álvarez, Matías; Latorre, Claudio; Barreiro-Lostres, Fernando; Giralt, Santiago; Moreno, Ana; Polanco-Martínez, Josué; Maldonado, Antonio; Carrevedo, María Laura; Bernárdez, Patricia; Prego, Ricardo; Huertas, Antonio Delgado; Fuentealba, Magdalena; Valero-Garcés, Blas","Frugone-Álvarez, Matías (Departamento de Ecología & Centro UC Desierto de Atacama, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Laboratorio Internacional de Cambio Global, LINCGlobal PUC-CSIC-UFRJ; Instituto de Ecología y Biodiversidady (IEB), Santiago, Chile); Latorre, Claudio (Departamento de Ecología & Centro UC Desierto de Atacama, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Laboratorio Internacional de Cambio Global, LINCGlobal PUC-CSIC-UFRJ; Instituto de Ecología y Biodiversidady (IEB), Santiago, Chile); Barreiro-Lostres, Fernando (Laboratorio Internacional de Cambio Global, LINCGlobal PUC-CSIC-UFRJ; Instituto Pirenaico de Ecología (IPE-CSIC), Zaragoza, Spain); Giralt, Santiago (Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (ICTJA-CSIC), Barcelona, Spain); Moreno, Ana (Laboratorio Internacional de Cambio Global, LINCGlobal PUC-CSIC-UFRJ; Instituto Pirenaico de Ecología (IPE-CSIC), Zaragoza, Spain); Polanco-Martínez, Josué (Econometrics Research Group, Institute of Public Economics, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3), Leioa, Spain); Maldonado, Antonio (Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Región de Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas.

The book presents Pilauco as an example for the natural laboratory which can be found in South America, a testing ground for many of the hypotheses regarding migrations of animals and humans. In this context the study of topics, such as the paleozoography, the role of megafauna species for the architecture of the forests, the animal extinctions or the early human settlements, is extremely important on a global scale. The Pilauco site features paleontological and archaeological evidences and is contemporaneous with the Monte Verde site (~ 15,000 cal. yr AP).

122,pub.1126165272,10.1163/9789004435315,,,"Comparative Constitutional History, Volume One: Principles, Developments, Challenges","George Bancroft (1800–1891) was an influential statesman, historian and educator. He was one of the first Americans to attend the University of Göttingen as a young man in order to master multiple academic disciplines and educational techniques that the young United States needed. At Göttingen, Bancroft became fascinated by German constitutional theory and history, their connection to politics and human geography, and the forerunners of German legal science. After his return to the United States, Bancroft translated into English books by Arnold Heeren, his former professor. Bancroft also set up a school and adopted German teaching methods at Round Hill in Northampton, Massachusetts, employed German scholars, and intensely engaged Göttingen academics and other Americans who looked to Germany for pedagogic and constitutional inspiration. A close reading of Bancroft’s translations and correspondence suggests that this was not a one-way exchange. Bancroft was instrumental not only in importing German texts and practices into the United States, but also formulated American notions of progress, abolitionism and state-systems that in turn shaped the so-called Göttingen School. Citizenship is and has for a long time been a core component of constitutional theory. The rebirth of citizenship in the quattrocento in Northern Italy from classical Greek and Roman sources of inspiration demonstrates its salience, as does the importance citizenship had in French Revolutionary thinking. In general, citizenship constitutes a reciprocal relationship between the citizen and the polity with a set of fundamental rights and obligations. These might include the right to vote for representative assemblies, the right to free movement within the territory of the state and the obligation to bear arms when required by law. However, the relationship between a state and the citizens of its overseas territories challenges the basic model of citizenship. Contrasting the approaches of the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the rights of citizens of overseas territories sheds light on the meaning and contours of citizenship in constitutional theory and law. Located at a crossroads between politics and law, constitutional preambles often represent the outcome of debates between different political forces over the founding principles of the Constitution. The discussions that took place during the drafting of the Preamble to the Ukrainian Constitution provide an insightful case study of this phenomenon. Influenced by its Soviet past and an unstable political environment, Ukraine has seen severe struggles among the political parties in order to reach an agreement over issues of particular sensitivity to the nation. By examining the case of Ukraine and its 1996 Constitution, this chapter also aims to contribute to the debate concerning the legal value of constitutional preambles. While stressing the theme of ‘good faith’ and surveying the decisions and opinions of courts and scholars in Hong Kong, this article delves into the issue of interpretation of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and explains why, in the face of a breach of the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong resulting from the exercise of illegal interpretative power by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, it is about time for the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong to forcefully re-assert its power of constitutional control over the actions of the Standing Committee. This chapter examines the separation of powers and forms of government in North Africa and the Middle East following the ‘Arab Spring’ and shows that most Arab constitutions still guarantee (albeit to a lesser extent than in the past) an extremely high concentration of power in the hands of the Head of State, thus favouring the continuation in office of illiberal regimes. This weak separation of powers is due to different reasons, including the constitutional tradition, the top-down constitution-making processes and the external influences. The only notable exception (at least for the moment) is Tunisia, which is already at an advanced stage in the process of democratization. This chapter compares constitutional institutions that political thinkers in Revolutionary France, early nineteenth-century Spain, and Mexico devised with the aim of protecting constitutional order from abuses by one or more of the branches of government. The chapter focuses on two different types of historical institutions: those with moderating powers and those with conserving powers. Moderating institutions acted as buffers between legislative and executive authorities to prevent either from encroaching upon the prerogatives of the other. Conservative institutions undid unconstitutional actions and supervised constitutional order. The chapter shows that Mexicans were well-acquainted with the constitutional debates surrounding both types of institutions in France and Spain. It demonstrates that Mexican politicians not only endorsed these two types of institutions in their constitutional plans, but also reworked them to create an innovative institution of constitutional control in the 1836 Mexico Constitution: the Supreme Conservative Power. This chapter offers both a genealogy and a critique of the Portuguese system of judicial review of legislation, which blends elements of American-style diffuse control carried out by the ordinary courts and European-style concentrated control carried out by a specialized constitutional court. The genealogy suggests an unorthodox explanation of the peculiarly mixed character of the system. The critique identifies three principal flaws of the system and argues that it should be reformed. The judicial review of constitutional amendments in Colombia has evolved through the activism of constitutional judges rather than the texts of the Constitutions. In times of judicial crisis and reform to the judiciary it becomes more interesting because the constitutional judges have reviewed amendments regarding the judicial branch, as several of them have been declared unconstitutional during the last four decades. This chapter tells the trajectory of the review of constitutional amendments to the Judiciary, suggesting that one of the factors that could explain these rulings is the defence of the judicial branch by the constitutional judges. In this way, it tells the interdependency between politics and Law on the decisions that have limited the power of the Congress to reform the Judiciary, by the Supreme Court, between 1978 and 1991; as well as by the Constitutional Court as of the Constitution of 1991. Individual access to constitutional justice can take many forms. One of the most prominent examples is the individual constitutional complaint. In many constitutional courts, the constitutional complaint has become the key method for individuals to assert constitutional claims. In Germany, constitutional complaint is very well established and it extends to complaints against judicial judgments. This chapter examines individual access to constitutional justice in South Korea and Taiwan. Although the legal systems of both countries have been heavily influenced by German constitutional practices, constitutional complaint against judicial judgments is explicitly prohibited in Korea; in Taiwan such a possibility was only officially introduced in 2019 and awaits implementation in 2022. By comparatively tracing and analysing the constitutional conditions, and nature and evolution of the mechanism of individual constitutional complaint in South Korea and Taiwan, this chapter aims to shed light on variations and convergences in individual access to constitutional justice in East Asia.",,,,,"Francesco Biagi, Justin O.

Bioarchaeology—the study of archaeological human skeletons—provides direct evidence of the human experience of past climate and environmental changes and serves as an important complement to paleoclimate, historical, and archaeological approaches to changes we may expect with global warming. Comprising 27 chapters from experts across a broad range of time periods and geographical regions, this book addresses hypotheses about how climate and environmental changes impact human health and well-being, factors that promote resilience, and circumstances that make migration or interpersonal violence a more likely outcome. The volume highlights the potential relevance of bioarchaeological analysis to contemporary challenges by organizing the chapters into a framework outlined by the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Planning for a warmer world requires knowledge about humans as biological organisms with a deep connection to Earth’s ecosystems balanced by an appreciation of how historical and socio-cultural circumstances, socioeconomic inequality, degrees of urbanization, community mobility, and social institutions play a role in shaping long-term outcomes for human communities. Containing a wealth of nuanced perspectives about human-environmental relations, the book is key reading for students of environmental archaeology, bioarchaeology, and the history of disease.

54,pub.1125451821,10.1007/978-3-030-35187-8,,,Private International Law Aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility,"This book addresses one of the core challenges in the corporate social responsibility (or business and human rights) debate: how to ensure adequate access to remedy for victims of corporate abuses that infringe upon their human rights. However, ensuring access to remedy depends on a series of normative and judicial elements that become highly complex when disputes are transnational. In such cases, courts need to consider and apply different laws that relate to company governance, to determine the competent forum, to define which bodies of law to apply, and to ensure the adequate execution of judgments. The book also discusses how alternative methods of dispute settlement can relate to this topic, and the important role that private international law plays in access to remedy for corporate-related human rights abuses. This collection comprises 20 national reports from jurisdictions in Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia, addressing the private international law aspects of corporate social responsibility. They provide an overview of the legal differences between geographical areas, and offer numerous examples of how states and their courts have resolved disputes involving private international law elements. The book draws two preliminary conclusions: that there is a need for a better understanding of the role that private international law plays in cases involving transnational elements, in order to better design transnational solutions to the issues posed by economic globalisation; and that the treaty negotiations on business and human rights in the United Nations could offer a forum to clarify and unify several of the elements that underpin transnational disputes involving corporate human rights abuses, which could also help to identify and bridge the existing gaps that limit effective access to remedy. Adopting a comparative approach, this book appeals to academics, lawyers, judges and legislators concerned with the issue of access to remedy and reparation for corporate abuses under the prism of private international law.",,,Ius Comparatum - Global Studies in Comparative Law,,"Catherine Kessedjian, Humberto Cantú Rivera",,2020,2020,,2020,42,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,4,0,,6.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125451821,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The sociology of Latin America is a thriving field whose major contributions include Dependence theory, World-systems theory, historical debates on economic development, among others. This handbook offers research essays that introduce the readers to the main assessments of the discipline’s key areas and current trends, specifically with regard to contemporary sociology in Latin America, as well as a collection of innovative empirical studies deploying a variety of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The handbook is organized in eight subfields in which the most significant theoretical and methodological contributions are being made. These include studies in classical areas of sociology, such as sociology of inequalities, sociology of religions, and the well-established sociology of the state, collective action and social movements. The sociology of migrations in Latin America, which has rapidly consolidated into a specialized subfield in the region, provides analytical and conceptual categories that offer alternative theories. This collection also offers a group of sociological studies in diverse fields such as sociology of gender, medical sociology, and sociology of violence. Due to the deterioration of social and economic conditions, as well as recent disruptions to an already tense political environment, these have become some of the most productive and important fields in the sociology of the region. This roiling sociopolitical atmosphere also generates new and innovative expressions of protest and survival, which are being explored by sociologists across different continents today. The essays included in this collection presents a guided map and a thematic articulation to central sociological debates that introduces readers to contemporary sociology in Latin America.",,,,,"Xóchitl Bada, Liliana Rivera-Sánchez",,2020-06-08,2020,2020-06-08,2021-06-10,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,4,2,,1.83,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128316724,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,10 Reduced Inequalities

The Higher Education landscape around the world is changing. There is global competition for students’ enrolments, universities are competing within their home market as well as in the international market, and as government funding for public universities is reducing there is pressure on universities to seek additional income by increasing their student enrolment. African universities are not an exception in this competitive market. This book is unique in providing a composite overview of strategic marketing and brand communications of higher education institutions in Africa. It recognises that there is a growing need for universities to understand the stakeholders and develop strategies on how best to engage with them effectively.

Therefore, there is an increasing need to search for integrated solutions to make development more sustainable. The United Nations has acknowledged the problem and approved the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. On 1st January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda officially came into force. These goals cover the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The Encyclopedia of the UN Sustainable Development Goals comprehensively addresses the SDGs in an integrated way. It encompasses 17 volumes, each one devoted to one of the 17 SDGs. This volume addresses SDG 12, namely ""Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"" and contains the description of a range of terms, which allows a better understanding and fosters knowledge. Concretely, the defined targets are: Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries Achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources Halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses Achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment Substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities Ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities Editorial Board Medani P.

Increasingly, one considers communication to be crucial to effectively tackle the major problems of today. Hence, the question being addressed in this handbook is, is there a right communication strategy? Perspectives on sustainability, participation, and culture in communication have changed over time in line with the evolution of development approaches and trends, and in response to the need for effective applications of communication methods and tools to new issues and priorities. Divided into prominent themes comprising relevant chapters written by experts in the field and reviewed by renowned editors, the book addresses topics where communication and social change converge in both theory and praxis. Specific concerns and issues include food security, climate change, poverty reduction, health, equity and gender, sustainable development goals, and information and communication technologies (ICTs). The book shows how communication is essential at all levels of society. It helps readers understand the processes that underlie attitude change and decision-making and the work uses powerful models and methods to explain the processes that lead to sustainable development and social change.

This volume is based on comprehensive interviews with former student leaders, each of whom provided a personal account in their own words of their experience in the position of student leadership. The interviewees are from different backgrounds and of diverse political persuasions. The book is important for current and future leaders of higher education institutions as it provides insights into the thinking, aspirations, desires, fears and modus operandi of student leaders.

This second edition builds on the massive collection of information and research from the first edition by adding new entries as well as updating the existing entries. The entries in this encyclopedia range from succinct summaries of specific sites and the scientific aspects of archaeological enquiry to detailed discussions of archaeological concepts, theories and methods, and from investigations into the social, ethical and political dimensions of archaeological practice to biographies of leading archaeologists from throughout the world. The different forms of archaeology are explored, along with the techniques used for each and the challenges, concerns and issues that face archaeologists today. This compendium is both a print reference and an online reference work. One of the encyclopedia’s major innovations is that it harnesses the capabilities of an online environment, enhancing both the presentation and dissemination of information.

Absolute and relative poverty—both within and across state boundaries—are standardly measured and evaluated in monetary terms. However, poverty researchers have highlighted the shortfalls of one-dimensional monetary metrics. A new consensus is emerging that effectively addressing poverty requires a nuanced understanding of poverty as a relational phenomenon involving deprivations in multiple dimensions, including health, standard of living, education and political participation. This volume advances the debate on poverty by providing a forum for philosophers and empirical researchers. It combines philosophically sound analysis and genuinely global research on poverty's social embeddedness. Next to an introduction to this interdisciplinary field—which links Practical Philosophy, Development Economics, Political Science, and Sociology—it contains articles by leading international experts and early career scholars. The contributors analyse the concept of poverty, detail its multiple dimensions, reveal epistemic injustices in poverty research, and reflect on the challenges of poverty-related social activism. The unifying theme connecting this volume's contributions is that poverty must be understood as a multidimensional and socially relational phenomenon, and that this insight can enhance our efforts to measure and alleviate poverty.",,,Philosophy and Poverty,,"Valentin Beck, Henning Hahn, Robert Lepenies",,2020,2020,,2020,2,,,All OA; Hybrid,Edited Book,,,,,8,1,,4.8,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31711-9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128393292,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,1 No Poverty

Despite this, the field of Youth Studies, like many others, is dominated by the knowledge economy of the Global North. To address these geopolitical inequalities of knowledge, The Oxford Handbook of Global South Youth Studies offers a contribution from Southern scholars to remake Youth Studies from its current state, that universalizes Northern perspectives, into a truly Global Youth Studies. Contributors from across the Global South—including from Diaspora, Indigenous and Aboriginal communities—locate and define ‘the Global South’; articulate the necessity of studying Southern lives to enrich, reinterpret, legitimate, and offer symmetry to youth studies; and use Southern theory to do so. Eleven concepts—personhood, intersectionality, violences, de- and postcoloniality, consciousness, precarity, fluid modernities, ontological insecurity, navigational capacities, collective agency, and emancipation – are reimagined and ‘re-presented.’ The outcome is a series of everyday practices such as hustling, navigating, fixing, waiting, being on standby, silence, and life-writing that demonstrate how youth living in adversity experiment with and push back against routine and conformity, and how research may support them in these endeavors and, simultaneously, redefine the relationships between knowledge, practice, and politics – what the editors term epistepraxis. The handbook concludes with a nascent charter for a Global Youth Studies of benefit to the world, which no longer excludes, assumes, or elides but embraces new possibilities for representing youth, researching among them, and devising policies and interventions to better serve them.",,,,,"Sharlene Swartz, Adam Cooper, Clarence M.

It maps the field for the twenty first century reflecting the massive changes that have occurred and the challenges ahead for future research. It provides a rich diversity of scholarly perspectives and covers the entire spectrum of higher education from a geographical, a topical and disciplinary perspective. It is unrivaled in its capacity to go beyond national boundaries and provides indispensible comparative analyses. The major reference works available about higher education have been published more than two decades ago and since then higher education has undergone major changes that have resulted in a much larger, diverse, global, and multidimensional reality. One of the main trends has been relentless expansion on a worldwide scale. This has led to mass higher education becoming a reality across continents, substantial growth in the number of countries with universal access to higher education, and great diversification of the student body. The tremendous increase in the international links in higher education, through issues such as training, students’ mobility, staff mobility, research activities, is another major change. The consequence is a global dimension that is strongly associated with the intensification of international networks in which institutions and researchers explore, create and share knowledge. As a result of the changes and trends, higher education has increasingly become part of debates that highlight its complexity as an institution that combines relevant political, social, economic, and cultural purposes and dimensions. Asked to play important and varied economic and social roles, higher education has had to reshape its priorities, and organizational and decision-making structures.

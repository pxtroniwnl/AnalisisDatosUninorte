Mortality is approximately 10% to 20% with high-frequency ventilation, surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but is much higher when these therapies are not available. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor type 5 that selectively reduces pulmonary vascular resistance.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility of using oral sildenafil and its effect on oxygenation in PPHN.
DESIGN: This study was a proof-of-concept, randomized, masked study in infants >35.5 weeks' gestation and <3 days old with severe PPHN and oxygenation index (OI) >25 admitted to the NICU (Hospital Niño Jesús, Barranquilla, Colombia). The sildenafil solution was prepared from a 50-mg tablet. The first dose (1 mg/kg) or placebo was given by orogastric tube <30 minutes after randomization and every 6 hours. Preductal saturation and blood pressure were monitored continuously. OI was calculated every 6 hours. The main outcome variable was the effect of oral sildenafil on oxygenation. Sildenafil or placebo was discontinued when OI was <20 or if there was no significant change in OI after 36 hours.
RESULTS: Six infants with an OI of >25 received placebo, and 7 received oral sildenafil at a median age of 25 hours. All infants were severely ill, on fraction of inspired oxygen 1.0, and with similar ventilatory parameters. Intragastric sildenafil and placebo were well tolerated. In the treatment group, OI improved in all infants within 6 to 30 hours, all showed a steady improvement in pulse oxygen saturation over time, and none had noticeable effect on blood pressure; 6 of 7 survived. In the placebo group, 1 of 6 infants survived.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral sildenafil was administered easily and tolerated as well as placebo and improved OI in infants with severe PPHN, which suggests that oral sildenafil may be effective in the treatment of PPHN and underscores the need for a large, controlled trial.","The work was supported in part by Goddard Scholarship and Children&#x27;s Research Center, Emory University (Dr Sola), and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia (Drs Baquero, Neira, and Venegas).

DV envelope/membrane protein-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture and IgG capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titrations (1/log(10) 1.7 to 1 log(10) 6.6 dilutions) were performed on 100 paired S1 and S2 samples from suspected DV infections. The serologically confirmed S/PS infections were divided into six subgroups based on their different IgM and IgG responses. Because of their much greater dynamic ranges, IgG/IgM ELISA titer ratios were more accurate and reliable than IgM/IgG optical density (OD) ratios recorded at a single cutoff dilution for discriminating between P and S/PS infections. However, 62% of these patients' S1 samples were DV IgM and IgG titer negative (or=2.60 and <2.60) discriminatory IgM/IgG OD (DOD) ratios on these S1 samples than those published previously to correctly classify the highest percentage of these P and S/PS infections. The DV isolation rate was highest (12/12; 100%) using IgG and IgM titer-negative S1 samples collected 1 day AOS, when 100% of them were correctly classified as P or S/PS infections using these higher DOD ratios.",We thank Duane J.

6421,pub.1006108388,10.1016/j.virusres.2006.02.012,16600413,,CD4/CXCR4 co-expression allows productive HIV-1 infection in canine kidney MDCK cells,"The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line has become the prototypic cell type for studying the mechanisms involved in viral glycoproteins transport and viral assembly in polarized cells. This cell line has been used in our laboratories for studying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), despite the fact that MDCK cells cannot be infected by HIV. In transfected MDCK cells, HIV-1 glycoproteins are specifically transported to the basolateral cell surface where viral budding also mostly occurs. However, this model is of limited use when viral propagation, infection of most cells, or larger production of virions, is needed. The initial objective of this work was thus to establish an MDCK-derived cell line that could be productively infected by HIV-1, in order to pursue our studies on the polarization of viral budding. Expression of both receptor and co-receptor for T-tropic strains of the virus showed that canine cells are rendered permissive once virus binding and entry is allowed. In addition, a reduced infectivity of the viral particles released from the basolateral surface was observed. This observation most likely reflects the interference mediated by CD4 molecules that accumulate at the basolateral domain. Accordingly, this effect was largely prevented when using viruses that down-regulate cell surface CD4 by expression of both viral accessory proteins Vpu and Nef. This is a further evidence that the function of different viral proteins depends of the site of viral budding, which is itself determined by the presence of targeting signal(s) harbored by viral envelope glycoproteins.","AcknowledgementsWe thank Dr. Michael Emerman for his generous gift of the CD4 cDNAplasmid and Dr. Dan R.

Overall, 3,433 premises were investigated in the wet season and 3,563 in the dry, representing, respectively, 82.3% and 84.6% of the total numbers of premises in the study areas. Despite a reasonably reliable supply of piped water, there were still some large storage containers for domestic water (cement ground tanks and plastic, metal and cement drums) in the area. Although such containers represented only 1.8%-16.3% of the total number of containers observed, they contributed 72.0%-78.2% and 65.0%-95.8% of the total Ae. aegypti pupal population in the three study neighbourhoods during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. In contrast, bottles represented 23.0%-88.9% of the total number of containers but produced no more than 0.1% of the total Ae aegypti pupal populations in these neighbourhoods. Other containers (tyres, vases, 'other discarded' and 'other used') generally produced only low numbers of pupae. In some settings, however, containers in the 'other discarded' category could contribute up to 19% of the total pupal population, and in one survey of one neighbourhood a single container in this category held 9.1% of all the pupae collected. These results, from a city where dengue fever is endemic, will help to focus local campaigns for Ae. aegypti source-reduction on the most productive categories of container.",,,Pathogens and Global Health,,,Aedes; Animals; Cities; Colombia; Dengue; Endemic Diseases; Household Articles; Humans; Insect Vectors; Mosquito Control; Population Surveillance; Pupa; Seasons; Urban Health; Water Supply,2006-04,2006,2013-07-18,2006-04,100,sup1,87-95,Closed,Article,"Romero-Vivas, C.

Such control has an effect in the decrease of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of the study was to identify factors associated to the control of arterial hypertension in awareness of hypertension among males and females who receive pharmacological treatment.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis, made in basis of the following study data: ""Arterial Hypertension and other risk factors in the population of 60 years old and more in Spain"". The sample included 1461 hypertensive patients treated pharmacologically, selected by probabilistic and multistage sampling. The information recollected about the control of arterial hypertension, social and demographic variables, lifestyle, healthcare service usage, and life quality related to health, by residence interviewing.
RESULTS: No differences between gender were observed in the control of hypertension (p = 0.09), In men control were significantly linked to: residence in rural areas (OR = 1.83; CI at 95%: 1.06-3.14); being single (OR = 3.40; CI at 95%: 1.32-8.74); and exercising (OR = 1.69; CI at 95%: 1.06-2.69). Women who consume alcohol in a moderate way controlled themselves more (OR = 1.63; CI at 95% 1.14-2.33).

The method is to be used in the design of surveys of mosquito pupae, for identifying the key container types from which the majority of adult dengue vectors emerge. Although a finite-population correction was devised for estimating the mean of a negative binomial distribution, other complications of parametric approaches make them unlikely to yield methods simple enough to be practically applicable. The Shannon-Wiener index was therefore investigated as a more useful alternative, at the cost of theoretical generalizability, in an approach based on re-sampling methods in conjunction with the use of entropy. This index can be used to summarize the degree to which pupae are either concentrated in a few container types, or dispersed among many. An empirical relationship between the index and the repeatability of surveys of differing sample sizes was observed. A step-wise rule, based on the entropy of the cumulative data, was devised for determining the sample size, in terms of the number of houses positive for pupae, at which a pupal survey might reasonably be stopped.",,,Pathogens and Global Health,,,Aedes; Algorithms; Animals; Dengue; Entropy; Household Articles; Humans; Insect Vectors; Population Surveillance; Pupa; Reproducibility of Results; Sample Size; Water Supply,2006-04,2006,2013-07-18,2006-04,100,sup1,5-16,Closed,Article,"Alexander, N.; Lenhart, A.

3653,pub.1073856508,10.7705/biomedica.v26i1.1402,16929911,,Ethics review committees for human research: the challenge of strengthening this process in Colombia.,"INTRODUCTION: Ethics committees are a necessary resource to guarantee ethical integrity in human research; they must apply international standards in their ethical evaluation of research projects involving human subjects.
OBJECTIVE: The ethics committees for human research of Colombia were characterized, and recommendations for strengthening them were formulated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2003, 280 groups with research projects involving human subjects were selected from a list of research groups which form part of the science and technology network of Colciencias. (Colciencias is the Colombian national agency that promotes and funds science and technology.) Eighty percent (224) of the projects were associated with 40 institutions, consisting of universities, hospitals, and public or private research centers. Thirty of these institutions had at least one ethics committee for evaluating use of human subjects. A questionnaire was mailed to each of these Committees, requesting information concerning its their compostition, regulations, multidisciplinarity, plurality, representativity and independence. The World Health Organization's Operational Guidelines for Ethic Committees that Evaluate Biomedical Research (TDR/PRD/ETHICS/2000) was used as reference for the analysis. In 5 of the cities, supplemental information was obtained by direct discussions with members of the ethics committees.
RESULTS: Twenty-six committees responded to the questionnaire. The results indicated that 47% of the committee members were physicians, but only 23% of the committees had representatives from the community. In 60% of the Committees, members were not independent from the organization in which it was based. Seventy percent had established operating procedures. Lack of national regulations and limited education in research ethics were mentioned as the main drawbacks in providing effective guidance.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations led to the conclusion that national guidelines must be established for ethics committees that correspond to international standards. Committee members must be trained before accepting committee responsibilities. Finally, new committees must be created along with the improvement of the currently existing committees for reinforcing and promoting the importance of ethical integrity in research.",,,Biomédica,,,"Biomedical Research; Colombia; Ethics Committees, Research; Ethics, Research; Guidelines as Topic; Human Experimentation; Humans; Internationality; Surveys and Questionnaires",2006-03-01,2006,2006-03-01,2006-03,26,1,138-44,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miranda, María Consuelo; Palma, Gloria I; Jaramillo, Ernesto","Miranda, María Consuelo (Centro Internacional de Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Médicas, CIDEIM, Cali, Colombia. clinico@cideim.org.co); Palma, Gloria I (); Jaramillo, Ernesto ()",,"Miranda, María Consuelo (Centro Internacional de Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Medicas); Palma, Gloria I (); Jaramillo, Ernesto ()",7,0,0.1,1.51,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/1402/1517,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1073856508,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",4 Quality Education

However, the causal factors of such robusticity remain unsettled. We assess within- and among-sample cranial robusticity of seven samples from continental Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, using geometric morphometric techniques. In addition, the biomechanical, phylogenetic, and climatic hypotheses proposed to account for robusticity in such samples are discussed. Two Amerindian samples of farmers and two early middle Holocene samples from South America were included. The results show: 1) large variation in craniofacial robusticity among Patagonian samples, with the highest robusticity in samples from south continental Patagonia and Isla Grande of Tierra del Fuego, whereas central and north Patagonian samples display the same degree of robusticity as farmer samples; 2) that early middle Holocene samples display lower levels of robusticity than South Patagonian samples; and 3) strong association between latitude and craniofacial robusticity, with the most robust craniofacial morphologies occurring at the highest latitudes. In consequence, neither masticatory stress nor retention of ancestral features is supported by the morphological evidence analyzed. Hence it is hypothesized that endocrine changes related to cold climate may be a plausible explanation for several craniofacial features found in Fueguian and south continental Patagonian samples, such as their large masticatory component, and pronounced supraorbital ridge and glabellar region.",,,American Journal of Human Biology,,,"Adaptation, Physiological; Argentina; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cephalometry; Chile; Cold Temperature; Diet; Facial Bones; Female; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Models, Biological; Multivariate Analysis; Paleontology; Phylogeny; Sex Characteristics; Skull",2006-11,2006,2006,2006-11,18,6,748-765,Closed,Article,"Bernal, Valeria; Perez, S.

Since Dynamic Matrix Control is based on sampled-data model identification, and online inverse calculations are avoided, adaptation of the original model is not performed in commercial solutions. This paper presents an on-line adaptive form of the DMC control based on the Smith Predictor compensation strategy for processes with large dead time that does not require recalculating the inverse of the process matrix. The matrix form of the Smith Predictor was modeled in software and implemented in a lab scale continuously stirred tank reactor, where actual process noise was present. The adaptive algorithm included a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system to modify the size of the dead time matrix. Implementation results demonstrated the algorithm ability to compensate for large dead time emulating the response of the non-delayed process. At the same time, the controller is able to adjust the size of the delay based on process response.Copyright © 2006 by ASME",,,,"Dynamic Systems and Control, Parts A and B",,,2006-01-01,2006,2007-12-14,2006-01-01,,,759-765,Closed,Proceeding,"Durango, Nestor D.; Sanjuan, Marco E.","Durango, Nestor D.

The start of scallop aquaculture with a brief history of its development, its production methods, and an example of recovery of an overfished bed is also discussed. Three scallop species are of commercial interest in Chile: Argopecten purpuratus; Zygochlamys patagonica; and Chlamys vitrea. A. purpuratus has a higher commercial value and it is the only scallop being intensively cultivated in bays located in Northern Chile. Z. patagonica and C. vitrea, are only fished from natural populations in Southern Chile. The Z. patagonica scallop lives in protected bays, inlets, and channels between 2 to 40 meters deep, as well as in depths over 100 m on the Argentinean platform. This species has separate sexes, without sexual dimorphism. A. purpuratus is a fast growing and productive species. The scallop hatchery culture involves broodstock conditioning, spawning, fertilization, larval culture, settlement and metamorphosis and seed growth up to commercial size. The culture technology used in Chile is based on the Japanese system developed in the 1960's and it is basically a suspended culture on floating structures called “long-lines.”",,,Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science,"Scallops: Biology, Ecology and Aquaculture",,,2006,2006,,2006,35,,1293-1314,Closed,Chapter,"von Brand, Elisabeth; Merino, German E.; Abarca, Aljandro; Stotz, Wolfgang","von Brand, Elisabeth (Universidad Católica del Norte, Departamento de Biologia Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Casilla 117, Coquimbo, Chile); Merino, German E.

Chalcocite and bornite characterize the main stage of hypogene copper sulfide mineralization. Rhenium and osmium isotopes are used here to constrain the age of hypogene mineralization and the source of osmium contained in these ore minerals. A Re–Os isochron yielded an age of 160±16 Ma (2σ), with an associated initial 187Os/188Os ratio of 1.06±0.09 (mean square of weighted deviates=1.8). This age is consistent with available geochronological data from volcanic rocks that host the mineralization and associated alteration phases. The high initial 187Os/188Os ratio indicates a lower crustal component for the source of Os and, by inference, the Cu sulfides that contain this Os. Late hematite occurs as an isolated phase or, more commonly, is associated with the chalcocite–bornite and supergene chalcocite–covellite associations. Analyses performed on pure hematite indicate a disturbance of the Re–Os system, and hence, this mineral phase is not useful as a Re–Os geochronometer.",We thank the Geology department of Minera Michilla SA for their help and geological contribution.

Since PID controllers are linear in nature, but still used in 90% of control loops in the process industry, their use in nonlinear processes increases the risk of closed-loop unstable response. This paper presents the design of an instability avoidance module for SISO PID control loops to automatically adjust the controller's tuning parameters when undesired oscillatory behavior is monitored. This module is a Fuzzy-based Supervisor composed of a dynamic parameter identification module that operates on-line, and a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) with fuzzy rules to modify PID tuning. Tests in nonlinear process models are performed, demonstrating that this Fuzzy Supervisor—Type 1 (non-intrusive) provides the PID controller the ability to adapt its tuning to eliminate observed oscillatory behavior.",,,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,,,,2006-04,2006,,2006-04,19,3,323-333,Closed,Article,"Sanjuan, M.; Kandel, A.; Smith, C.A.","Sanjuan, M.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
SETTING: Saint Paul General Hospital, Coquimbo, Chile, during a period when it was undergoing significant interior remodeling.
PATIENTS: General surgery patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis before clean wound surgery between March 2003 and May 2004 and a matched control group of patients who did not receive such prophylaxis.
RESULTS: A total of 303 patients participated in the study. The rate of infection among patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of 1 in the prophylaxis group was 7.3%, whereas among ASA 1 patients in a no-prophylaxis control group it was 10.3% (P=.40). In the prophylaxis group, the ASA 2 and ASA 3 patients combined had an infection rate of 10.5%, whereas in the no-prophylaxis group these patients had a rate of 30.0% (relative risk, 0.33 [95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.96]; P=.03). Both the ASA 2 and ASA 3 patients were protected from infection by prophylaxis; these patients had 1.7 and 2.2 times, respectively, more risk of developing a surgical site infection than did ASA 1 patients after a clean surgical procedure, but the ASA 2 and ASA 3 patients who did not receive prophylaxis had 4.3 and 4.8 times, respectively, greater risk of infection (relative risk, 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.99]; P=.02). Prophylaxis significantly reduced the rate of infection in the ASA 2 and ASA 3 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis with cephalosporins in ASA 2 and ASA 3 patients undergoing clean wound surgery during a period when significant renovations are being performed in the hospital.",,,Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology,,,Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Cefuroxime; Female; Hospital Design and Construction; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Surgical Wound Infection,2006-12,2006,2016-06-21,2006-12,27,12,1372-1376,Closed,Article,"Iribarren, Osvaldo; Araujo, Miguel","Iribarren, Osvaldo (Department of Surgery, Surgery Service and Office of Nosocomial Infections Control, Saint Paul Hospital, School of Medicine, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Araujo, Miguel (Department of Sanitary Technologies Evaluation, Ministry of Health, Santiago, Chile)","Iribarren, Osvaldo (Catholic University of the North)","Iribarren, Osvaldo (Catholic University of the North); Araujo, Miguel (Ministry of Health)",5,0,0.07,0.88,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058787078,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

This study was conducted during 2002. It sought to explore THs' beliefs about SLT use and its health effects. In-depth interviews were conducted with 28--mostly female (68%)--registered THs, with a mean age of 55 years and with an average of 17 years of practice experience. These listed THs were randomly selected from two culturally diverse regions of the (largely rural) Limpopo Province in South Africa. The THs perceive the ritual (external) use of SLT as an absolute necessity in divination, but 32% have also prescribed its 'internal' use to their clients, usually following a ""directive from the ancestors."" Almost all the THs who themselves regularly consume SLT condemned the recreational use of SLT and believe that SLT is addictive. However, 39% of them claimed to be able to treat addiction resulting from tobacco use not sanctioned by the ancestors. This study has identified opportunities for enlisting THs' collaboration in future community-based tobacco dependence interventions.",,,Substance Use & Misuse,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, African Traditional; Middle Aged; South Africa; Tobacco, Smokeless",2006-01,2006,2009-07-03,2006-01,41,2,211-222,Closed,Article,"Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan; Peltzer, Karl; Mufamadi, Jane","Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan (Department of Community Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Pretoria, South Africa); Peltzer, Karl (Human Science Research Council and Department of Psychology, University of Venda for Science and Technology, Venda, South Africa); Mufamadi, Jane (Centre for Indigenous Knowledge Systems, University of Venda for Science and Technology, Venda, South Africa)","Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan (University of Pretoria)","Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan (University of Pretoria); Peltzer, Karl (University of Venda); Mufamadi, Jane (University of Venda)",12,1,0.36,2.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038240387,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

During the dry season (December–April) the water column is well‐mixed and along‐shelf currents flow southwestward following the steady trade winds. In the rainy season (May–November) the water column experiences continuous events of stratification and the along‐shelf currents flow northeastward, opposing the weak southwestward winds. In the dry season the along‐shelf circulation is mostly driven by wind forcing, while in the rainy season, the circulation is set by an alongshore baroclinic pressure gradient. In the cross‐shelf direction upwelling conditions are observed most of the year and geostrophic balance conditions are found.","Mauro Maza was funded by Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y Tecnologia–COLCIENCIAS through a Colciencias‐Fulbright scholarship.

Both systems incorporated a standard alimentation using nauplius of Artemia sp. plus microalgae; however the second system included, in addition, a supplement of fish and chiken eggs. The decrease in survival rate in both cultures systems was related to morphological changes in each stage of development. Juveniles were obtained after 98 days of culture with the first culture system, whereas in the second culture system, the time to reach the first juvenile stage was 62 days.

HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and VDR gene (VDR) polymorphisms were previously associated with tuberculosis (TB) and are here investigated as candidates for TB susceptibility in the Venda population of South Africa. Genomic DNA from 95 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and 117 ethnically matched, healthy controls were typed for HLA-DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQB1, and VDR polymorphisms FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). Allele and haplotype frequencies were calculated by the estimator maximum (EM) algorithm. DRB1*1302 phenotype was significantly associated with TB occurring at a significantly higher allele frequency in cases than controls and found in haplotype with DQB1*0602/3. DQB1*0301-0304 phenotype was significantly associated with TB and found in haplotype with DRB1*1101-1121, showing significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both cases and controls. Only DRB1*1101-1121-DQB1*05 was significantly associated with TB based on the sequential Bonferroni p value. VDR SNP phenotypes were not associated with TB, but the haplotype F-b-A-T significantly protected from TB. In conclusion, common African HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 variants, previously associated with protection from malaria and hepatitis B/C virus persistence, predispose the Venda to TB, whereas the proposedly active VDR haplotype F-b-A-T showed significant protection.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Professor Adrian VS Hill, University of Oxford, for fruitful discussions.

To solve the GMM-model, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) inspired by the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) was proposed. In this paper, we extends the GMM-model to dynamic multicast groups. If a multicast tree is recomputed from scratch, it may consume a considerable amount of CPU time and all communication using the multicast tree will be temporarily interrupted. To alleviate these drawbacks we propose a Dynamic Generalized Multiobjective Multitree model (D-GMM-model) that in order to add new egress nodes makes use of a multicast tree previously computed with GMM-model. To solve the Dynamic-GMM-model, a Dynamic-GMM algorithm (D-GMM) is proposed. Experimental results considering up to 11 different objectives are presented. We compare the GMM-model performance using MOEA with the proposed Dynamic-GMM-model using D-GMM The main contributions are the optimization model for dynamic multicast routing; and the heuristic algorithm proposed with polynomial complexity.",,,,"International Conference on Networking, International Conference on Systems and International Conference on Mobile Communications and Learning Technologies (ICNICONSMCL'06)",,,2006-01-01,2006,,2006-01-01,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Donoso, Y.; Fabregat, R.; Solano, F.; Marzo, J.L.; Baran, B.","Donoso, Y.

Although not immediately referable to recognised genera, they differ from other South American occurrences of ctenochasmids and appear to share features of the dentition with Ctenochasma and Gnathosaurus from Late Jurassic deposits in Europe. A slightly spatulate rostrum may hint at affinities with the gnathosaurine ctenochasmatid Gnathosaurus. The presence of a possible gnathosaurine in South America is further evidence for a Hispanic corridor allowing faunal interchange between South America and Eurasia during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.","AcknowledgementsWe especially thank Dr Peter Turner for allowing us to use his vehicle for fieldwork.

The high energy shift of the excitonic luminescence demonstrates the Mg incorporation in the ZnO lattice in at a few percent. The spectral parameters of the luminescence emission show a marked dependence of the incorporation of defects and Mg on the growth facet. This growth sector selectivity shows similar trends to those observed in hydrothermal ZnO crystals. The in depth distribution of Mg was studied varying the acceleration voltage of the excitation e-beam, showing a slight accumulation of Mg close to the surface.",,,MRS Advances,,,,2006,2006,2011-02-01,2006,957,,0957-k07-36,Closed,Article,"Mass, Julio; Avella, Manuel; Jiménez, Juan; Callahan, Michael; Grant, E.; Rakes, K.; Bliss, David; Wang, Buguo","Mass, Julio (Universidad de Valladolid, Física de la Materia Condensada, E.T.S.I.I, Paseo del Cauce s/n, Valladolid 47011, Spain); Avella, Manuel (Universidad de Valladolid, Física de la Materia Condensada, E.T.S.I.I, Paseo del Cauce s/n, Valladolid, 47011, Spain); Jiménez, Juan (Universidad de Valladolid, Física de la Materia Condensada, E.T.S.I.I, Paseo del Cauce s/n, Valladolid, 47011, Spain); Callahan, Michael (Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Hanscom AFB, MA, MA 01731, United States); Grant, E.

1523,pub.1092773817,10.1115/imece2006-13774,,,Skill-Centered Syllabus for Undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Education,"Recent changes in higher education policy in Colombia (South America) have forced educational institutions and universities to consider reducing undergraduate engineering programs from the traditional 5 or 6 years (170 credit hours) to four years (136 credit hours). This reduction is a worldwide trend, mainly due to a lack of financial resources supporting high standards of professional education. Additionally, institutions are restructuring their curricula to adjust to the broader spectrum of career development opportunities for the graduating engineer and the new challenges faced by practicing engineers. Also, engineering education in Colombia needs to adjust to Colombia's necessities as a developing country. In response to the above-mentioned circumstances, the mechanical engineering department of the Universidad de Los Andes (UdLA) has proposed a new mechanical engineering (ME) undergraduate syllabus. This paper summarizes the process undergone by the ME department of the Universidad de Los Andes to review our syllabus and propose alternative approaches. Our new ME syllabus applies a skill-centered approach structured by four priorities: 1) the primary professional role of an engineer is in project development, 2) the engineer needs an in-depth knowledge of the sciences (physics, chemistry and biology) and mathematics; 3) the engineer also needs a general education in the social sciences and arts and, 4) the engineer should master the core concepts of mechanical engineering. These four priorities agree with the US study of the Engineer of 2020. Our restructured syllabus evenly introduces these priorities early in the undergraduate ME program. Our ME Department implemented the new syllabus for first year students in January 2006. Positive results have already started to emerge. This article provides an overview of the higher education quality assurance system in Colombia and a description of the Universidad de Los Andes new ME syllabus.Copyright © 2006 by ASME",,,,"Innovations in Engineering Education: Mechanical Engineering Education, Mechanical Engineering Technology Department Heads",,,2006-01-01,2006,2007-12-14,2006-01-01,,,187-194,Closed,Proceeding,"Rodriguez, Carlos F.; Pinilla, Alvaro E.","Rodriguez, Carlos F.

At the same time, trends indicate that these groups will constitute an important part of the population of the United States by year 2050. Given these facts, it is crucial to help these minority groups become an integral part of the economic fabric of the United States. It has been shown that undergraduate research is one of the best vehicles to address several of these important issues. This paper describes our experience running a NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in CS&E for underrepresented minority student groups.

The presence of limits, cut‐offs or thresholds in the perception and appraisal of both attributes and alternatives is part of the complexity inherent to choice‐making behaviour. The paper considers the existence of thresholds in three contexts: inertia (habit or reluctance to change), minimum perceptible changes in attribute values, and as a mechanism for accepting or rejecting alternatives. It discusses the more relevant approaches in modelling these types of thresholds and analyses their implications in model estimation and forecasting using both synthetic and real databanks. It is clear from the analysis that if thresholds exist but are not considered, the estimated models will be biased and may produce significant errors in prediction. Fortunately, there are practical methods to attack this problem and some are demonstrated.","The authors are grateful to Elisabetta Cherchi, Ben Heydecker, Luis Ignacio Rizzi and Huw Williams for help in developing these ideas.

The independent variables included constructs derived from expectancy value theories, teachers' generic dispositions, their training experience, characteristics of their interactive context and the school climate. We conducted a postal survey of 579 teachers responsible for AIDS education in all 193 public high schools in Cape Town. Questionnaires were completed and returned by 324 teachers (56% response rate) from 125 schools. Many teachers (222; 70%) had implemented HIV/AIDS education during 2003, and female teachers were more likely to have implemented than males (74% vs. 58%). The teacher characteristics associated with teaching HIV/AIDS were previous training, self-efficacy, student-centeredness, beliefs about controllability and the outcome of HIV/AIDS education, and their responsibility. The existence of a school HIV/AIDS policy, a climate of equity and fairness, and good school-community relations were the school characteristics associated with teaching HIV/AIDS. These findings demonstrate the value of teacher training and school policy formulation. They also demonstrate the value and importance of interventions that go beyond a sexual health agenda, focussing on broader school development to improve school functioning and school climate.","Thanks to the participating schools and the Western Cape Education Department for their cooperation, and to Jim te Water Naude for statistical help.

Autotomy strongly decreased feeding, energy storage and growth. Intact juveniles showed a ∼3 fold higher feeding rate than autotomized individuals throughout the experiment. Intact juveniles also had a higher (∼5 fold) energy content per pyloric caeca in each arm. This was mainly due to higher lipid content, the main proximate constituent of pyloric caeca. Intact juveniles showed a greater growth rate and reached a greater size than autotomized individuals, more evident for underwater mass than radius length. The reduced capacity to feed reduced energy intake in autotomized individuals. However, low energy reserves along with low growth in autotomized sea stars, support the hypothesis that juveniles of this species allocate energy to regeneration to the detriment of growth. This was also supported by the ∼25% of arm length regeneration after 5 mo. Remaining small could increase risk of lethal predation, however, S. striatus may reduce predation risk by using crevices and kelp holdfasts as refuges from predators. Given the strong impact of autotomy on feeding, regeneration of arms to recover full capacity to forage and grow seems a better strategy for juvenile S. striatus, than merely growing.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to J.

1393,pub.1032433506,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.12.008,16442750,,A systematic literature review of tobacco use among adults 15 years and older in sub-Saharan Africa,"BACKGROUND: Given that developing countries (and particularly women in these countries) are at increasing risk for tobacco use, the need for hard data to accurately monitor tobacco use in developing countries is needed. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the available prevalence data on current tobacco use among adults in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
METHODS: Several databases were systematically searched for articles published in peer-reviewed journals at any time during the last century to mid-2005. The search resulted in the retrieval of 54 articles in which the current use of tobacco, cigarettes, cigars and snuff were reported. They were conducted in 14 of the 48 SSA countries.
RESULTS: Cross-country comparisons revealed that the prevalence, and intensity (frequency and/or quantity) of tobacco use was higher among males compared to females across all countries. Certain racially classified social groups in South Africa were at increased risk for tobacco use. Males aged between 30 and 49 years used tobacco at higher rates than those younger or older than this age range. Among females, prevalence rates of smoked tobacco use increased steadily with age. There was no clear pattern regarding socio-economic status (SES) or urban/rural differences. The onset of tobacco use mostly occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: While in many SSA countries the prevalence of tobacco use among adults is relatively low compared to developed and other developing countries, prevention, interventions and policies should work towards reducing these levels by targeting the at risk populations identified from this review.","The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of Kimya McCray, Selima Taylor and Todné Thomas.

A relatively large amount of information is available to enhance social inclusion but this data does not always have the detail (granularity) required to investigate small areas. As a result information sharing of locally generated information is increasing in the UK, particularly for issues such as health and crime where information is not readily available for Local Authorities. Legal and ethical issues associated with sharing locally generated information are frequently perceived as problematical. Examples of methods and protocols to overcome these problems are reviewed. It is possible that the activities of the Cabinet Office Committee on data sharing (MISC31) will act as an incentive for data sharing. However, an equally important catalyst will be commitment and support across UK central government and at the local level by Chief Executives and members to the principles and benefits of information sharing for better informed policymaking.",,,Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,,,,2006-11-01,2006,,2006-11-01,4,4,191-203,Closed,Article,"Foley, Paul; Alfonso, Ximena; Sakka, Mohammed Al","Foley, Paul (De Monfort University, Leicester, UK); Alfonso, Ximena (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sakka, Mohammed Al (Abu Dhabi University, United Arab Emirates)",,"Foley, Paul (De Montfort University); Alfonso, Ximena (Universidad del Norte); Sakka, Mohammed Al (Abu Dhabi University)",7,1,,3.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047313422,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The training aimed at providing teachers with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively teach a 16-lesson Grade 8 (14 year olds) life skills curriculum consisting of participatory exercises on sexual reproductive health, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexual decision-making, abstinence, consequences of sexual activity, safe sex practices, substance abuse and sexual violence. Questionnaires administered prior to the training, on completion of the training and at two follow-up time periods were analysed as well as participant observation notes. Findings indicate that teachers reported increased confidence and comfort in teaching the sexuality curriculum. However, many struggled with the transfer of sexual reproductive knowledge and facilitative teaching methods into the classroom context. This highlights the need for HIV education to form part of teacher trainee programmes. Ongoing support and engagement with teachers is needed to encourage alternative teaching practices.","The authors would like to thank the education department, principals and teachers who participated in the research, who cannot be named for reasons of anonymity.

Participants were 5,407 subjects (2,244 min and 3,163 women, aged 18-69 years). We used a cross-sectional questionnaire with a national probability sample. Data were collected using a thorough sexual behavior questionnaire consisting of 190 face-to-face questions and 24 self-reported questions. A single item included in the COSECON questionnaire assessed sexual satisfaction. Results showed that high education level, marital status, and high socioeconomic levels were associated with sexual satisfaction in women but not in men. The results also showed important gender differences and sustain the idea that sexuality changes may be more present in middle and high social classes. The proximal variables typically used for measuring sexual satisfaction, such as the frequency of sexual intercourse and orgasm, showed a positive but smaller association with sexual satisfaction. Other important variables related to sexual satisfaction were being in love with the partner and having a steady partner. The results confirmed previous findings and are discussed in the frame of approaches like the exchange, equity, and sexual scripts theories.","The complete version of this study is the author&#x27;s unpublished doctoral dissertation: “La satisfacción sexual en Chile desde una perspectiva psicosocial.” Thanks to Osmo Kontula from Vaestoliitto, Helsinki, Finland, and to Michel Bozon from INED, Paris, France, for their comments and suggestions.

Mediante el análisis de dos asentamientos complejos, Tulán-54 (3000 metros sobre el nivel del mar) y Caserones-1 (900 metros sobre el nivel del mar), se advierte que ha existido una sobrevaloración de los aportes alóctonos para explicar el surgimiento del sedentarismo asociado a prácticas formativas.

The Gossip-Based Sleep Protocol (GSP) [2] is an example of a protocol that implements routing and some MAC functions in an effort to conserve energy. Simulations show that GSP can conserve energy. We expand on this effort by building a prototype system and measuring energy consumption rates. GSP was implemented on the Mica2 platform and measurements were conducted to determine energy consumption. The measurements were then used to build an energy consumption model for GSP.,,,,"2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications",,,2006-01-01,2006,,2006-01-01,,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Calle, Maria; Kabara, Joseph","Calle, Maria (University of Pittsburgh, Universidad del Norte Pittsburgh, Barranquilla, USA, Colombia); Kabara, Joseph (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA)",,"Calle, Maria (University of Pittsburgh); Kabara, Joseph (University of Pittsburgh)",38,3,,8.43,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093376400,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

However, there has been less focus on the value of basic and clinical neuroscience research in this context. The current paper focuses on the relevance of a brain-behaviour research initiative in South Africa.Methods: Workshops sponsored by the University of Cape Town Research Office and by the National Research Foundation have recently focused on the state of South African basic and clinical neuroscience, and on how to strengthen research in these areas. The context of the discussion included national science and health priorities, as well as local research opportunities.Results: Neuropsychiatric disorders account for the second largest proportion of the burden of disease in South Africa, but receive relatively little research funding. There is a critical need for research, and there are unique research opportunities, in areas such as trauma and resilience, impulsive behaviour (eg violence, sexual risk taking, and substance abuse), and neuroAIDS. Basic, clinical, and systems research can all make important contributions.Conclusion: There is a need to apprise policy-makers in developing world countries such as South Africa of the need for increased expenditure on basic and clinical neuroscience research. Local and international collaboration may be useful in increasing research capacity in South Africa, and ultimately in improving mental health services.","Many people contributed to the ideas formulated in this document.

1273,pub.1042359529,10.1016/j.trb.2005.11.002,,,A discrete choice model incorporating thresholds for perception in attribute values,"In this paper we formulate a discrete choice model that incorporates thresholds in the perception of changes in attribute values. The model considers multiple options and allows for changes in several attributes. We postulate that if thresholds exist they could be random, differ between individuals, and even be a function of socio-economic characteristics and choice conditions. Our formulation allows estimation of the parameters of the threshold probability distribution starting from information about choices.The model is applied to synthetic data and also to real data from a stated preference survey. We found that where perception thresholds exist in the population, the use of models without them leads to errors in estimation and prediction. Clearly, the effect is more relevant when the typical size of change in the attribute value is comparable with the threshold, and when the contribution of this attribute in the utility function is substantial. Finally, we discuss the implications of the threshold model for estimation of the benefits of transport investments, and show that where thresholds exist, models that do not represent them can overestimate benefits substantially.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to an anonymous referee for several constructive suggestions, including investigation of the effects of thresholds on estimates of the marginal rates of substitution.

Examination of plankton and filter-feeder samples covering an area of ca. 350 km, from the location where the toxicity was recorded to Bahía Tongoy, showed that the unique toxin profile found in the first bloom was widespread over that part of Chile and persisted for months. The analysis were carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS using positive ionization mode, with a detection limit below 2 ng of OA mL(-1) of methanolic extract. This is the first report of the presence of pectenotoxins in the plankton of the Pacific coast of America and in the studied filter feeders. This is also the first report of a Dinophysis species containing pectenotoxins and not any toxin of the okadaic acid group.","AckowledgmentsWe have to acknowledge to Carmen Mariño, Iné Pasten and Helena Martín for their technical assistance, to Alvaro Rodríguez, Jenny Rivera y Mario Gutierrez (SGS-Chile) for the collection of the samples.

It had been 25 years since a solitary observation of a stellar occultation by Pluto's moon Charon. But on 11 July 2005 another occurred and this time observatories across South America were ideally placed to track it. The resulting haul of data has been used to obtain an accurate measure of Charon's radius, of close to 605 km, and to establish an upper limit (a rather low one) on the density of its atmosphere.

Nesse diálogo entre as inovações científicas e a adequação jurídica aos comportamentos delas advindos, depreende-se que o direito não pode mais ficar à espera de casos concretos para regulamentar o assunto. Ao contrário, deve o direito ter o condão de trazer mecanismos assecuratórios eficientes às relações contratuais e extracontratuais firmadas entre as partes envolvidas, e também da sociedade de forma geral, se pensarmos na proteção da vida das gerações futuras. De uma forma ou de outra, seu objetivo principal continua sendo a proteção dos direitos fundamentais, principalmente o direito à vida digna. Tal tarefa não é fácil, pois o problema encontrado no presente tema é que tampouco a ciência tem resposta quando é inquirida sobre as prováveis conseqüências das pesquisas que envolvem a manipulação genética células vegetais e humanas. Refrear tais pesquisas não se faz oportuno, ante à esperança da cura de doenças e de maior qualidade de vida. Por outro lado, “brincar de Deus” é tarefa preocupante, ante os danos que porventura possam causar à humanidade. A legislação global, na grande maioria, não tem apresentado posições favoráveis à manipulação genética de células de embriões.

The temporal patterns of the main components of these ecosystems, which included Macrocystisintegrifolia, Lessonia trabeculata, echinoids and asteroids, were evaluated seasonally between 1996 and 2004. M. integrifolia demonstrated high interannual variability in temporal patterns of abundance. The 1997–1998 ENSO did not significantly modify the temporal patterns of Macrocystis, although local extinction of M. integrifolia beds occurred during negative thermal anomalies in 1999–2000 (La Niña event), facilitating the establishment of urchin dominated “barren grounds”. The abundance of Lessonia trabeculata showed little temporal variability, and this species dominated the deeper regions of the kelp assemblage (8–13 m depth).The structure of the kelp communities in the study area is regulated by a trophic cascade which modulates alternation between kelp dominated areas and sea urchin barrens. In this context, frequent and intense upwelling of cold water high in nutrients favors the establishment and persistence of kelp assemblages. During ENSO, coastal upwellings can mitigate superficial warming of coastal water and increase the nutrient concentration in the water column. Superficial warming during the 1997–1998 ENSO induced spawning by different species of echinoderms, which resulted in major recruitment of these species during 1999. Top-down events, such as the decrease in densities of the asteroids after the 1997–1998 ENSO event, favored increases in densities of benthic grazers, which caused significant decreases in abundance of M. integrifolia. The re-establishment of the adult fraction of the carnivore (starfish) guild coincided with a decrease in the density of sea urchins and thus re-establishment of the kelp. In the temperate south eastern Pacific, oceanographic events, which act on different spatial-temporal scales, trigger trophic cascades that act at local levels, producing interannual variability in the structure of kelp communities. On the other hand, considering the high macroinvertebrate diversity associated with kelp assemblages, the transitions between kelp-dominated areas and sea urchin barrens do not appear to significantly affect the biodiversity of these assemblages of benthic invertebrates.",,,Journal of Applied Phycology,,,,2006-09-22,2006,2006-09-22,2006-10,18,3-5,505-519,Closed,Article,"Vásquez, Julio A.; Vega, J.

(cf. obscura) from the Fiji Islands (Melanesia, South Pacific); and from the giant mottled eel Anguilla marmorata from Futuna Island (Wallis and Futuna Islands, Polynesia). Although a total of 450 nematodes were collected, all specimens were females; this suggests either an extremely rare occurrence of males or parthenogenetic reproduction in this species. Procamallanus pacificus differs markedly from all congeners from fish hosts in possessing a greater number (4-9) of caudal mucrons in the female and by other morphological features. This parasite might become a serious pathogen of cultured eels in the region of the South Pacific. Batrachocamallanus Jackson and Tinsley, 1995 is considered a junior synonym of Procamallanus Baylis, 1923, to which 2 species are transferred as Procamallanus occidentalis (Jackson and Tinsley, 1995) n. comb. and Procamallanus siluranae (Jackson and Tinsley, 1995) n. comb.

Cryphiops caementarius (Molina 1782) (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) the northern freshwater prawn (Fig. 1) is the only species in the famliy represented in Chile. Its geographical distribution is confined to the rivers of the occidental coast of Peru and Chile from 10S to 32 55S. This freshwater prawn in Chile inhabits the rivers and ravines that mainly brought waters from the Andes mountains. The species was protected in Chile during a long time by a total interdiction. However, the clandestine exploitation with an excessive extraction produced a reduction of the population size of this prawn and the reduction of the size of the extracted animals. The damage caused on this resource encouraged the authorities to review the current regulations, proclaming a decree during 1996 with a new disposition that banned the extraction of this resource from December the 1st until April 30th each year. All these regulations increased the interest to know the life cycle of this species. Since the synoptic studies, several intents have been made in Peru and Chile, to study his biology, reproduction, bioecological conditions, habitat, population composition, migrations, larval development studies and some intents of aquaculture. All these studies were oriented to know and understand basic and technological aspects to establish artificial culture systems that allow the reduction of the extractive pressure over the resource and to replace it by an artificial juvenile production.

METHOD: We checked the videos of 10 endoscopic third ventricular cisternostomies of myelomeningocele patients taken during 24 months as from December 1998. A previous guideline is designed to record anatomic variables in the lateral ventricles, IIIrd ventricle, and basal cisterns. The topic is analyzed in view of the necropsy and imaging background data.
RESULTS: The ETVC of lateral ventricles showed: absence of septum (9/10); absence of anteroseptal vein (8/10); absence of choroid plexus and thalamostriate vein (0/10); absence of fornix (1/10): small foramen of Monro (4/10). The ETVC of the IIIrd ventricle showed: impossibility of recognizing any mammillary bodies (4/10); presence of septations (5/10); presence of atypical veins in the floor (6/10); translucent floor (5/10); floor umbilications (5/10); absence of infundibulum (4/10); arachnoid adherences (7/10); and visual contact of basilar artery (4/10).
CONCLUSION: There are categorical structural alterations in the ventricular system of myelomeningocele patients that are well correlated with previous necropsy and imaging reports.

Interpretation is made difficult by inconsistent methods for determining the race or ethnicity of a participant. The failure to specify how race or ethnicity was determined is common in the published literature.
HYPOTHESIS: Criteria by which they assign a research participant to racial or ethnic categories are not reported by published articles.
METHODS: Methods were reviewed for assigning race and ethnicity of research participants in 268 published reports reporting associations among race (or ethnicity), health outcome and genotype.
RESULTS: Of the 268 published reports reviewed, it was found that 192 (72%) did not explain their methods for assigning race or ethnicity as an independent variable. This was despite the fact that 180 (67%) of those reports reached conclusions about associations among genetics, health outcome and race or ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: More attention needs to be given to the definition of race and ethnicity in genetic studies, especially in those diseases where health disparities are known to exist.","We thank G Corbie-Smith, J Reardon, E Hauser and W Kraus for their contribution to the important background work for this project and A Powers and C Whitener for assistance with the Medline search strategy.",,Journal of Medical Ethics,,,"Bias; Data Collection; Ethics, Research; Ethnicity; Genotype; Human Experimentation; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Racial Groups; Research Design",2006-12-04,2006,2006-12-04,2006-12,32,12,724,All OA; Green,Article,"Shanawani, H; Dame, L; Schwartz, D A; Cook-Deegan, R","Shanawani, H (Department of Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology, Henry Ford Hospitals, Detroit, MI, USA; Duke University Center for Genome Ethics, Law, and Policy, Durham, North Carolina, USA; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA); Dame, L (Department of Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology, Henry Ford Hospitals, Detroit, MI, USA; Duke University Center for Genome Ethics, Law, and Policy, Durham, North Carolina, USA; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA); Schwartz, D A (Department of Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology, Henry Ford Hospitals, Detroit, MI, USA; Duke University Center for Genome Ethics, Law, and Policy, Durham, North Carolina, USA; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA); Cook-Deegan, R (Department of Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology, Henry Ford Hospitals, Detroit, MI, USA; Duke University Center for Genome Ethics, Law, and Policy, Durham, North Carolina, USA; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA)",,"Shanawani, H (Henry Ford Museum; Duke University; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences); Dame, L (Henry Ford Museum; Duke University; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences); Schwartz, D A (Henry Ford Museum; Duke University; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences); Cook-Deegan, R (Henry Ford Museum; Duke University; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences)",47,6,0.8,11.83,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2563355?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047934749,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics,

A bioreactor 0.75 m high x 14.5 cm diameter was used, divided into three equal stages, using compost to support the microorganisms, and sea shells to control the pH. The biofiltration of toluene was evaluated for flows between 0.12 and 0.73 m(3)h(-1) in a concentration range of 1-3.2 gm(-3). It was observed that on increasing the toluene inlet load by 90% (from 37 to 70 gm(3)h(-1)), the conversion by the biofilter varied by only 5% (from 98% to 93%). The biofiltration system used achieved elimination capacities of up to 82 gm(-3)h(-1) for a toluene load of 100 gm(-3)h(-1).",AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank the Dirección de Investigación de la Universidad Católica de Temuco for financing this research (Project DIUCT 2002-4-01).

In the local scale of analysis, it is argued that evidence suggests a heterogeneous society, with a wide diversity of social niches and an androcentric social order. In the meso-scale, the presence of geoglyphs and petroglyphs indicating routes of mobility and territories, suggests social organizations based on inter-group exchange. More particularly, we hold that this sort of cultural elaboration contributed to the reproduction of social institutions that derived from the competition over the access and use of productive spaces, where cultural transmission controlled the replication of rock-art designs and information regarding social behavior",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2006,2006,2006,,,31,9-30,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Muscio, Hernn J","Muscio, Hernn J (Universidad de Buenos Aires Seccin Arqueologa Grupo de Investigacin Cultura, Comportamiento y Evolucin (GICCE), Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA)",,"Muscio, Hernn J (University of Buenos Aires)",4,1,,1.45,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/eatacam/n31/art03.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011292562,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

Our results indicate that perylene adsorbs in an upright way in accordance with experimental observations. A number of conceivable geometries are considered and compared with respect to their adsorption energies, to their behavior in scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments and to their spectral response in an electron energy loss setup. Only the combination of these three aspects allows for the unique identification of the realized adsorption structure. In order to obtain complete energy loss spectra that can be related directly to experiments a recently developed method is used which allows for the easy calculation of both vibrational frequencies and intensities.","We thank Dr. Kaori Seino for providing some of the starting adsorption structures.

(bush tea) is widely used as a beverage, cough remedy and purgative. The commercialization of this tea in a similar vein to rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), is being considered. Traditional infusions and decoctions, as well as water and ethanol extracts, were prepared and screened. A related species, Athrixia elata Sond. (daisy tea), was included in many of the assays as a comparison. Extracts of Athrixia phylicoides and Athrixia elata were tested for toxic effects to brine shrimp larvae and the Vero kidney cell line. In both assays, the traditional preparations and aqueous extracts had little effect, but the ethanol extracts were relatively toxic. Antioxidant activity comparable to that found in rooibos was established. No detectable levels of caffeine were present in the Athrixia extracts following analysis using TLC and I/HCl spray reagent. Neither screening using spectrophotometry nor confirmation using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed evidence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Athrixia phylicoides.

Removal of the endothelium blunted the effect of NKCC1 inhibition on the response to PE (10(-5) M) in males, whereas in denuded aorta from female rats, bumetanide reduced this response (162+/-5% control vs 146+/-3% bumetanide; P<0.05). NKCC1 basal activity did not show gender differences in intact aortic rings, but in the presence of PE, bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb(+)/K(+) uptake increased more in male than female aortas (179+/-8 in males vs 158+/-5 nmol (86)Rb(+)/K(+) min(-1) (g aorta)(-1) in females; P<0.05). PE did not stimulate NKCC1 activity in denuded aorta from male rats. However, in female rats, PE increased NKCC1 activity similarly in both denuded (169+/-11 nmol (86)Rb(+)/K(+) min(-1) (g aorta)(-1)) and intact aortas. Ovariectomy increased the bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb(+)/K(+) uptake increase elicited by PE (223+/-17 nmol (86)Rb(+)/K(+) min(-1) (g aorta)(-1)) and hormone replacement with 17beta-estradiol prevented this effect (159+/-29 nmol (86)Rb(+)/K(+) min(-1) (g aorta)(-1)). Na(+),K(+)-ATPase basal activity, measured as ouabain-sensitive (86)Rb(+)/K(+) uptake, was similar in male and female rats, but the effect of PE was significantly less in intact male aortas (232+/-16 in males vs 296+/-25 nmol (86)Rb(+)/K(+) min(-1) (g aorta)(-1) in females; P<0.05).

(no calibradas) en el centro de un montículo ocupacional estratificado, inserta en un asentamiento aldeano pastoralista. La arquitectura monumental registrada en el sitio Tulán-54, perteneciente a la fase Tilocalar (3030 ± 70 a 2380 ± 70 a.P.) es contemporánea con el período Formativo Temprano del altiplano central y meridional. Sin embargo, de acuerdo a su patrón arquitectónico e indicadores culturales no presenta analogía con el área centro sur andina. Un análisis cronoestratigráfico, contextual y tecnológico, permitió establecer una secuencia Arcaico-Formativa, incluyendo una fase transicional entre ambos períodos y caracterizar a la vez el desarrollo ocupacional del montículo. Estas evidencias permiten proponer que el proceso circumpuneño de emergencia de complejidad sociocultural tendría un carácter autónomo e independiente de las relaciones pan-andinas en términos de núcleo-periferia.
Abstract This essay reports on the excavation of a temple structure found in a stratified mound in the western highlands of the Atacama Puna. The structure is at the center of a pastoral settlement dating to between 2630 ± 60 and 2490 ± 80 B.P. (uncalibrated). The monumental architecture, recorded at the Tulán-54 site, belongs to the Tilocalar phase (3030 ± 70 to 2380 ± 78 B.P.), contemporary with the Early Formative period of the central and meridional highlands. However, based on the architectural pattern and cultural indicators, it has no similarity with the south central Andean area. Using chronostratigraphic, contextual, and technological analysis, we establish an Archaic-Formative sequence, including a transitional phase, and characterize the occupational development of the mound. This evidence allows us to propose that the emergence of circumpuna sociocultural complexity was an independent process that was autonomous from the pan-Andean core-periphery interactions.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2006-12,2006,2017-01-20,2006-12,17,4,445-473,Closed,Article,"Núñez, Lautaro; Cartajena, Isabel; Carrasco, Carlos; de Souza, Patricio","Núñez, Lautaro (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, ., Casilla 17, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, (, lautanunez@netline.cl, )); Cartajena, Isabel (Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile, ., Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Ñuñoa, Santiago, Chile, .

Over a period of 12 years, 17 interdisciplinary and international task groups investigated the crustal processes that act at the convergent plate margin of central South America, through both laboratory work and large field campaigns. Since the early 1990s, the ever-growing digital database of the SFB 267 has required extensive data documentation to guarantee its long-term use and avoid redundancies. A meta-data information system has also been developed to facilitate queries by internet and intranet. The Internet module mingles new data sets from laboratory work, field research, and remote sensing with diverse geoscientific meta-data in a way that makes it more useful to both scientists and the general public. Based on an earlier version, the current SFB 267 website has been turned into a geo-service tool that provides data, meta-data, and numerical tools for three-dimensional modeling, mapping, and visualization.",,,Frontiers in Earth Sciences,The Andes,"Onno Oncken, Guillermo Chong, Gerhard Franz, Peter Giese, Hans-Jürgen Götze, Victor A.

Camallanus paracarangis Velasquez, 1980 is synonymized with C. carangis. Several additional species of Camallanus from marine fish of the Indo-Pacific region may be synonymous with C. carangis as it has a poorly sclerotized left spicule and 3 small caudal projections on the tail of young (i.e., non-gravid) females. The fourth-stage larva of C. carangis is described for the first time. P. (S.) variolae differs from most similar species of this region mainly in the position (i.e., at level or posterior to the nerve ring) and shape of deirids. P. (S.) longus differs from the similar P.

Desarrollo motor grueso en el primer año de vida.,"Objetivo: Determinar si haber tenido un Apgar bajo a los cinco minutos y/o convulsiones neonatales aumenta el riesgo de trastornos del desarrollo motor grueso, que se identifican como resultado anormal de Infanib al año de edad. Diseño: Cohorte histórica. Escenario: Programa de seguimiento de recién nacidos de riesgo en un hospital de nivel 1 de complejidad, con una población de estrato socioeconómico bajo de Cali entre 1989 y 1997. Población: Se incluyeron 287 lactantes que completaron un año de seguimiento en el programa. Intervenciones: No aplica. Desenlaces principales: Frecuencia de compromiso neuromotor estimado mediante la prueba de Infanib. Resultados: Al año se evaluaron 80% de los niños que eran parte del programa. En 39 (13.6%) hubo un Apgar anormal a los 5 minutos. En 36 (12.5%) presentaron convulsiones neonatales, asociadas principalmente con asfixia perinatal severa e hipoglicemia. La prueba de Infanib fue anormal en 47 niños para una incidencia acumulada de 16.4% y una densidad de incidencia de 1.3 casos nuevos por 100 lactantes-año. La presencia de convulsiones se asoció con un Infanib anormal (RR crudo = 2.39 IC 95% 1.37-4.16). No hay modificación de efecto entre Apgar bajo y convulsiones.

Data on water discharge, sediment load, and dissolved load of the Magdalena River is presented as an initial interpretation of coastal ecosystems changes in relation to water discharge and sediment load from the Magdalena. During the 1972–1998 yr-period, the Magdalena River has delivered approximately 4022 MT of sediment to the Caribbean coast. The river reflects high inter-annual variability and delivers large portions of its fluvial discharge and sediment loads in short periods of time. The analysis of annual deviations from the 27-yr mean sediment load indicates that 59% of the total sediment load variability of the Magdalena at Calamar could be attributed to flashy peak events. Further analyses of sediment load anomalies suggest that there was a high discharge period in the Magdalena River between 1985 and 1995 and another one in the Canal del Dique between 1985 and 1992. These increasing trends in sediment load coincide with the overall decline of live coral cover around the Rosario Islands, a 145 km2 coral reef complex in the Caribbean Sea that constitutes a marine protected area. The comparison of live coral: algae ratios for the 1983–2004 yr-period, also indicates that there has been an associated increase in the percentage of algae cover (i.e., Grande Island 1983=5%, 2004=59%). Other analyses show that nearly 850 ha of seagrass existing in the Cartagena Bay in the 1930s, only 76 ha remained in 2001, which is less than 8% of the original cover. There has been a mix of multiple stressors (natural and anthropogenic; local, regional and global; temporal and chronic) affecting the coastal ecosystems in the area, but the effect of the Magdalena River runoff has been constant and very prolonged (several decades). The impacts of heavy sediment loads and freshwater discharges from the Canal del Dique to Cartagena Bay have greatly contributed to the partial disappearance of coral formations and also to a considerable reduction in abundance of seagrass beds in the bay and neighboring areas.","AcknowledgementsThis study was done with support from the Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y Tecnología “Francisco José de Caldas”—COLCIENCIAS, Grant COLCIENCIAS 121609-12105 (Proyecto Río Magdalena), and Universidad EAFIT—Departamento de Geología.",,Global and Planetary Change,,,,2006-02,2006,,2006-02,50,1-2,33-49,Closed,Article,"Restrepo, Juan D.; Zapata, Paula; Díaz, Juan M.; Garzón-Ferreira, Jaime; García, Camilo B.","Restrepo, Juan D.

The study is based on 30 early Holocene specimens recovered from Sumidouro Cave (Lagoa Santa region, central Brazil) by Peter Lund in 1843. Sumidouro is the largest known collection of Paleoindian skulls deriving from a single site. Six different multivariate statistical methods were applied to assess the morphological affinities of the Sumidouro skulls in comparison to Howells' worldwide extant series and late archaic Brazilian series (Base Aérea and Tapera). The results show a clear association between Sumidouro and Australo-Melanesians and none with late Asian and Amerindian series. These results are in accordance with those of previous studies of final Pleistocene/early Holocene human skulls from South, Central, and North America, attesting to a colonization of the New World by at least two different, succeeding biological populations: an early one with a cranial morphology similar to that found today in the African and Australian continents, and a later one with a morphology similar to that found today among northeastern Asians.","AcknowledgementsThe research reported here was funded by FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) through Grants 99/00670-7, 04/01321-6 to Walter Neves, a doctoral scholarship given to Mark Hubbe (Process 04/01253-0), and a postdoctoral scholarship given to Luís Beethoven Piló (Process 00/14917-3). The senior author also held a research scholarship from CNPq (Brazilian National Science Foundation) (Process 305918/85-0). Our deepest gratitude goes to the curators who facilitated our access to the human skeletons from Sumidouro: Kim Aaris-Sorensen (Zoological Museum of University of Copenhagen), Chris Stringer (Natural History Museum, London), and Cybelle Ipanema (Historic and Geographic Institute, Rio de Janeiro). Robert Kruszynski, Knud Rosenlund, and Abdi Hedayat were of extreme help during our museum operations. João Paulo Vezzani Atui was also of much help during data handling and processing.

Partly drawn on theoretical contributions to growth and mineral resource accounting, this analysis assesses patterns of economic growth across Chilean regions. The theoretical and methodological rationale for focusing on weak sustainability, by testing convergence across regions in a distribution dynamics perspective, is first discussed. This is followed by a brief review of policy issues and previous empirical findings of concern to Chile's mining and regional growth. Panel data over the period 1960-2001 are analysed, with growth measured in terms of both income per capita as such, and sustainable measures of this variable. Kernel density and quantile regression estimates indicate persistent bimodal (if not possibly trimodal) distribution of nationally standardised regional incomes per capita, whereby conditions for cross-region convergence are matched only within the inner range of this distribution.",AcknowledgementThe author is grateful to three anonymous referees for insightful comments on an earlier version.

Often, these actions result in intensive and long lasting pain and suffering. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis has been the theoretical tool used mostly by psychologists to understand the physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms following a traumatic experience. Due to its clinical and medical roots, PTSD diagnosis represents man in a social vacuum, a man without context, and a model of health closely tied to illness. The aim of the paper is to reintroduce the social context of human beings into trauma diagnosis, and to develop a health model that is more focused on well-being than on illness. Both points of view help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the psychosocial trauma that result from political violence and terrorism. Psychosocial trauma has definite roots, and destroys our inner world—the world of our most valuable meanings—infects our minds with hate against others, and breaks the social fabric we belong to.",,,Studies in Psychology,,,,2006-01,2006,2014-01-23,2006-01,27,3,333-350,Closed,Article,"Blanco, Amalio; Díaz, Darío; del Soto, Araceli","Blanco, Amalio (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, ;); Díaz, Darío (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, ;); del Soto, Araceli (University of Pennsylvania)","Blanco, Amalio (Autonomous University of Madrid); Díaz, Darío (Autonomous University of Madrid); del Soto, Araceli (University of Pennsylvania)","Blanco, Amalio (Autonomous University of Madrid); Díaz, Darío (Autonomous University of Madrid); del Soto, Araceli (University of Pennsylvania)",8,3,,0.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045487944,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Clinical grade, ultra-high viscosity alginate is gelled by diffusion of Ba2+ followed by use of the ""crystal gun"" [Zimmermann H. et al., Fabrication of homogeneously cross-linked, functional alginate microcapsules validated by NMR-, CLSM- and AFM-imaging. Biomaterials 2003;24:2083-96]. Burst pressure of well-hydrated membranes is between 34 and 325kPa depending on manufacture and storage details. Water flows induced by sorbitol and raffinose (probably diffusional) are lower than those caused by PEG 6000, which may be related to a Hagen-Poiseuille flow. Hydraulic conductivity, L(p), from PEG-induced flows ranges between 2.4x10(-12) and 6.5x10(-12) m Pa(-1)s(-1). Hydraulic conductivity measured with hydrostatic pressure up to 6 kPa is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher and decreases with increasing pressure to about 3x10(-10) m Pa(-1)s(-1) at 4kPa. Mechanical introduction of 200 microm-diameter pores increases hydraulic conductivity dramatically without loss of mechanical stability or flexibility. NMR imaging with Cu2+ as contrast agent shows a layered structure in membranes cross-linked for 2h. Phase contrast and atomic force microscopy in liquid environment reveals surface protrusions and cavities correlating with steps of the production process. Murine L929 cells adhere strongly to the rough surface of crystal-bombarded membranes. NaCl-mediated membrane swelling can be prevented by partial replacement of salt with sorbitol allowing cell culture on the membranes.","AcknowledgmentsWe are extremely grateful to P. Gessner, A.

Science Foundation Year (UNIFY) Programme has provided access to higher education to over 1500 previously disadvantaged22In South Africa, a student can be regarded as ‘disadvantaged’ if s/he had inadequate access to quality education service, resulting in a lack of opportunity to fully develop their academic potential (Zaaiman, 1998). students. However, there has always been doubt about whether the concept of a foundation programme is a worthwhile endeavour. To date, government has not yet fully acknowledged the value of programmes such as UNIFY. This may be attributed, amongst others, to insufficient evidence on the crucial role of programmes of this nature. This paper gives a view of the valuable contribution UNIFY has played in increasing the quality and the quantity of science graduates at the University of the North in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. A tracer study of the performance of ex-UNIFY33‘Ex-UNIFY's are students who attended UNIFY before enrolling in the respective science programmes. students to that of direct entry44Direct entry students are those who qualify to enrol for science programmes offered at the University of the North (i.e., Pharmacy, Nutrition, Optometry, Nursing, BSc, BSc Agriculture and BSc Computer Science) after matriculation. students, in the science programmes at the University of the North shows that ex-UNIFY students perform better than the direct entry students.

471,pub.1032753298,10.4314/sajas.v35i4.3963,,,Nutritive value of Acacia tree foliages growing in the Limpopo Province of South Africa,"Acacia trees form the third largest woody plant family in southern Africa and are an important ecological component of the bushveld vegetation that is prevalent in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The purpose of the study was to determine types and amounts of tannins and also to evaluate the nutritive value of tree foliages, Acacia karroo, Acacia nilotica, Acacia tortilis, Acacia galpinii, Acacia sieberiana, Acacia hebeclada and Acacia rhemniana , grown in the Limpopo Province and also to determine types and amounts of tannins occurring in them. Young leaves with petioles from seven tree foliages were collected from five different trees per species at the University of the North (now University of Limpopo) in April 2003, in a completely randomized design. Packed volume ranged from 1.50 mL/g for A. karroo to 3.00 mL/g for A. hebeclada whilst water retention ranged from 3.71 g/g for A. galpinii to 4.98 g/g for A. sieberiana . These results suggest that all the tree leaves have a high intake potential. All the Acacia species had crude protein levels above 100 g/kg dry matter (DM), ranging from 103 g/kg DM for A. rhemniana to 183 g/kg DM for A. sieberiana . Crude protein levels of this magnitude in a diet are adequate to support the maintenance requirements of cattle, sheep and goats at low to medium production levels. The Acacias contained medium to high levels of neutral and acid detergent fibres with ranges of 488 to 622 and 415 to 545 g/kg DM, respectively. In vitro DM and organic matter degradabilities varied from 345 to 534 and 254 to 474 g/kg DM, respectively. Acacia hebeclada, A. sieberiana and A. galpinii contained traces of total phenolics whilst A. tortilis contained approximately 90 g/kg DM of total phenolics and A. karroo , A. nilotica and A. rhemniana contained intermediate concentrations. Extract condensed tannin (CT) content ranged from 1.1 g/kg in A. hebeclada to 80.7 g/kg in A. karroo . At level above 50 g/kg, CT tends to negatively affect intake and digestibility in ruminants. Consequently, reduced intakes of A. galpinii, A. karroo and A. tortilis could be expected because they contained CT values above 50 g/kg. Only A. nilotica showed a sharp curve in the potassium iodate test, reflecting its considerable content of hydrolysable tannins (HT). All the other species had flat curves reflecting low levels of HT in them. The results showed that all the species except for A. galpinii, A. karroo and A. tortilis are of good nutritive value and have a potential for integration into livestock feeding systems in the Limpopo Province.

Although curative treatment is increasingly successful, early detection and intervention are critical in reducing mortality rates. Early diagnosis is facilitated via breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE), and mammography. Breast cancer presentation shows an apparent racial variation, with black, coloured and Indian patients presenting at a younger age than whites. In addition, whites tend to present at earlier stages of disease severity, coloureds and Indians at more intermediate stages and blacks at later stages. Socio-economic variables impact on screening practices. One American/Canadian study showed women with higher education and incomes were more likely to receive screening. In South Africa, there is scant research on breast cancer screening. In 2001, Prof. Karl Peltzer of the University of the North did a small telephonic comparative study between black and white women that identified low frequencies of BSE in both groups. Further research is necessary. While several international studies exist, little research is available on the screening behaviour of South African women. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and actual screening practices regarding breast cancer among women in the Bonteheuwel township in the Western Cape. Methods A random sample of 100 women completed a questionnaire administered by a research assistant. A separate, selected group of nine women participated in a focus group discussion. Results The results indicate that the majority of the participants were aware of the dangers of breast cancer, perceived as a common (87%; 95% CI: 80%-94%) and serious (88%; 95% CI: 82%-94%) disease, which, if treated early, could be cured in most cases (82%; 95% CI: 74%-90%). Most had previously examined their breasts (65%; 95% CI: 56%-74%) and/or had been examined by their doctors (62%; 95% CI: 52%-72%). Only a minority, however, practised regular BSE (24%; 95% CI: 16%-32%) or had received a CBE in the last year (29%; 95% CI: 20%-38%). Fear of diagnosis was identified as the main barrier to screening (87%; 95% CI: 80%-94%). Despite their fears, the participants were keen to improve their knowledge and participate in the further education of their community. However, only 40% (95% CI: 30%-50%) had ever been taught BSE by a healthcare professional. Moreover, only 34% (95% CI: 25%-43%) of women who had consulted a GP in the preceding year had received a CBE during this period. A total of 38% (95% CI: 28%-48%) had never had a CBE in their lives. Conclusion The participants were better informed and more engaged in screening than had been anticipated. Still, healthcare professionals need to play a more proactive role in breast cancer screening and education.",,,South African Family Practice,,,,2006-06,2006,2014-08-15,2006-06,48,5,14-14f,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Krombein, IW; De Villiers, PJT","Krombein, IW (Dept. of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Stellenbosch UniversityCorrespondencebont@iafrica.com); De Villiers, PJT (Family Medicine and Primary Care, Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University)",,"Krombein, IW (Dept. of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Stellenbosch UniversityCorrespondencebont@iafrica.com); De Villiers, PJT (Stellenbosch University)",6,1,,0.85,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/20786204.2006.10873386?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032360503,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Characterization tests of the steel sludge employed X-ray diffraction, chemical composition, particle size distribution, scanning electron microscopy and DTA/TG analysis. Compositions were prepared with additions of 0, 5, 10 and 20wt.% waste in a kaolinitic clay from Brazil. To determine the technological properties such as bulk density, linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength, press molded specimens were fired in laboratory furnace at 900°C. The microstructure of the fired specimens was evaluated by SEM and XRD. The results showed that incorporations up to 5wt.% of fine steel sludge is beneficial to the red ceramic. By contrast, incorporations above 5wt.% cause deleterious effect on the mechanical strength of the fired specimens.","AcknowledgementsThe support provided by the Brazilian agencies: FAPERJ, CNPq and FENORTE/TECNORTE is gratefully acknowledged.",,Materials Science and Engineering A,,,,2006-07,2006,,2006-07,427,1-2,142-147,Closed,Article,"Vieira, C.M.F.; Andrade, P.M.; Maciel, G.S.; Vernilli, F.; Monteiro, S.N.","Vieira, C.M.F.

An attempt in a South African university department to distribute workload fairly indicated this task involved personal and sensitive concerns, which often had to do with biographical and situational variables. That attempt inspired this study which investigated the relationship between social group and institutional type, and views on the composition and distribution of aspects of academic work, determinants of teaching load, determinants of remuneration, the purpose of staff development programmes, and decision-making in departments. It was found that social group and institutional type are significant factors in views on the composition and distribution of academic work, on remuneration and on the purpose of staff development programmes. There is a disparity between what all groups think should be the case and what actually is the case, and yet there is a general satisfaction with decision-making processes. These findings suggest that the systemic and organizational transformation of higher education in South Africa is embedded in the complexities of social identity and institutional type. This has implications for the management and leading of systemic transformation in other countries.",,,Educational Management Administration & Leadership,,,,2006-10-01,2006,2006-10-01,2006-10,34,4,487-510,Closed,Article,"Ruth, Damian","Ruth, Damian (Department of Management and Enterprise Development, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand, d.w.ruth@massey.ac.nz)",,"Ruth, Damian (Massey University)",3,0,,0.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005843145,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,

The cellulignin was obtained by acidic prehydrolysis and was then burnt in boilers leaving behind the ash as a solid residue. Characterization tests of the ash employed X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, mercury porosimetry, chemical analysis, thermal analysis and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The ash/clay/feldspar compositions were fired at 1200°C and the linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength were determined. Solution and leaching tests were conducted to evaluate the environmental safety of the final ceramics. The results showed that the ash is mainly composed of quartz with partially nanometric particle size, high surface area and high content of alkaline and alkaline earth oxides. These are advantages for a potential use of this ash as a flux. The partial replacement of feldspar by ash promoted a better vitrification decreasing the open porosity and increasing the mechanical strength. Heavy metals present in the ash became inert after the firing stage.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the following Brazilian institutions: Laboratório Nacional de Luz Sincronton, Campinas, for the use of the high-resolution SEM; The Group of Preparation and Characterization of the UNICAMP University, Campinas, for the use of the thermoanalysis equipment and the Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, for the use of the mercury porosimeter.

The sample included 400 male and 400 female 16 or 17 year-olds; 400 from rural and 400 from urban areas, and almost all of African descent. Participants were chosen by multi-stage cluster and quota sampling. Results indicate that urban adolescents significantly had more often engaged in petting, masturbation and anal or oral sex than rural adolescents. Over their lifetimes, urban adolescents had a significantly higher number of partners with whom they had sexual intercourse than rural adolescents. The age of first sexual intercourse was lower among urban than among rural adolescents. Urban females seem to take more initiative at first sexual intercourse than rural females. Whereas the most frequent sexual practice for rural adolescents was sexual intercourse and petting, for urban adolescents it was kissing and cuddling and petting. By better linking HIV prevention to research on human sexuality and social change, it should prove possible to advance the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.",,,South African Review of Sociology,,,,2006-07,2006,,2006-07,37,2,189-199,Closed,Article,"Peltzer, Karl","Peltzer, Karl (Human Sciences Research Council and University of Limpopo HSRC, Private Bag X41, Pretoria, 0001, E-mail:, KPeltzer@hsrc.ac.za)",,"Peltzer, Karl (Human Sciences Research Council)",8,0,,2.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049908407,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4405 Gender Studies; 4410 Sociology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The trial was conducted with a central sorghum field (30 × 30 m) with male fertile donor plants that was surrounded by eight arms planted with male sterile recipient plants at a distance of 13 to 158 m from the central field. Gene flow was relatively high within the first 40 m and relatively low beyond that distance, but gene flow was detected even at the greatest distance investigated (158 m). The average hybridization or outcrossing rate for male sterile plants was 2.54% at 13 m, below 1% at a distance of 26 m or greater, and eventually dropping to 0.06% at 158 m. Outcrossing rates are expected to be even lower for male fertile plants, which were not investigated in this study. Mathematical models were used to estimate the maximum gene flow distance that is expected to be between approximately 200 and 700 m. These values are in line with observational data from sorghum plant breeders, who use an isolation distance of 100 m to achieve less than 1% genetic pollution. On the basis of the presence of fully fertile crop wild relatives and the weedy relative johnsongrass [ S. halepense (L.) Pers.], which may form hybrids with crop sorghum, and on the fact that gene flow takes place, there is strong evidence that introgression of genetically modified‐ (GM)‐sorghum into crops and crop wild relatives will take place once GM‐sorghum is deployed.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Graham Thomson, Biotechnology Division, Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Roodeplaat, South Africa; Willi Wenzel, ARC Potchefstroom, Grain Research Institute, South Africa; Muffy Koch, AfricaBio, South Africa; Emmanuel S.

Compositions were prepared with additions of waste of 0, 5 and 10 wt.% in a kaolinitic clay from the county of Campos dos Goytacazes, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. To determine the technological properties such as bulk density, linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength, specimens were prepared by uniaxial pressure at 20 MPa and then fired in a laboratory furnace at 700°C, 900°C and 1100°C. The microstructure of the fired specimen was evaluated by SEM. The results showed that the incorporation up to 10 wt. % of fine steel sludge does not change the ceramic properties, specially, at low temperatures. Hence, the recycling of steel sludge into red ceramic fabrication can be considered as an environmentally correct solution for the final disposal of this type of waste.",,,Materials Science Forum,,,,2006-11-03,2006,2006-11,2006-11-03,530-531,,544-549,Closed,Article,"Andrade, P.M.; Vieira, Carlos Maurício Fontes; Monteiro, Sérgio Neves; Vernilli, F.","Andrade, P.M.

345,pub.1018100308,10.1007/1-4020-4006-7_3,,,The Higher Education Landscape Under Apartheid,"5. ConclusionUnder apartheid, higher education in South Africa was skewed in ways designed to entrench the power and privilege of the ruling white minority. Higher education institutions established in the early part of the century (Fort Hare, UCT, Wits) were incorporated into a system which was subsequently shaped, enlarged and fragmented with a view to serving the goals and strategies of successive apartheid governments.By 1994, the landscape of 36 higher education institutions included ten historically disadvantaged universities and seven historically disadvantaged technikons designated for the use of black (African, coloured and Indian) South Africans, while ten historically advantaged universities and seven historically advantaged technikons were designated for the exclusive development of white South Africans. Two distance institutions catered for all races.By 1994 there had been considerable resistance to the apartheid regime in the historically black and in some of the historically white institutions and, as was demonstrated in this chapter, the racial profile of student enrolments in some of the institutions had departed considerably from apartheid’s intentions.It was in this context that the new higher education policies of South Africa’s first and second democratic governments sought to reshape the system into one that met the goals of equity, democratisation, responsiveness and efficiency. Working off the landscape described in this chapter, the chapters in Section 2 capture the developments since 1990 in respect of funding, students, staff, leadership, curriculum and research.",,,Higher Education Dynamics,Transformation in Higher Education,"Nico Cloete, Peter Maassen, Richard Fehnel, Teboho Moja, Trish Gibbon, Helene Perold",,2006,2006,,2006,10,,35-52,Closed,Chapter,"Bunting, Ian","Bunting, Ian ()",,"Bunting, Ian ()",79,19,,16.92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018100308,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

An equation is proposed which, as well as justifying the damage occasioned in the refractory bricks, it can also be used in the development of new designs.",,,Journal of the Ceramic Society of Japan,,,,2006,2006,,2006,114,1332,672,All OA; Bronze,Article,"GOÑI, Christian; BARBÉS, María Florentina; BAZÁN, Vanesa; BRANDALEZE, Elena; PARRA, Roberto; González, Luis Felipe Verdeja","GOÑI, Christian (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica.

Agardh) Kützing. Monthly field observations were made over a 1‐year period at Puerto Aldea, Tongoy Bay, Chile. Data were collected both outside and within a bed of C. chamissoi. Vegetative propagation was assessed via attachment of drifting fronds to shell‐encrusted concrete blocks at both sites. Germination of spores was recorded on the same shell substrates. Substrate re‐adhesion varied seasonally between sectors. Highest averages occurred within the algal bed between January 1997 and March 1997. The number of sporelings showed two peaks of maximal recruitment in spring and summer months (January‐March 1997 and September 1997‐January 1998). Spore‐based propagation is an important mechanism of seasonal regeneration of biomass in the C. chamissoi bed; however, re‐attachment of fronds may have been important in maintaining production of the bed during the period of maximum biomass accumulation.",,,Phycological Research,,,,2006-02-22,2006,2006-02-22,,51,1,45-50,Closed,Article,"A., Juan E.

G(RP) in BC 1 ranged from 0.53 to 0.95 and averaged to 0.76 in the population (NP4453 × ‘SV‐2’) × ‘SV‐2’. G(RP) varied between 0.60 and 0.86 and averaged to 0.74 in the BC 1 of (ICV‐219 × ‘SV‐2’) × ‘SV‐2’. Results show that plants with a G(RP) equivalent to BC 2 (0.875) or BC 3 (0.938), respectively, can be selected from BC 1 . Yield performance of BC 1 S 1 families was tested in field trials carried out in South Africa. The correlation between yield and G(RP) in BC 1 was low. Selection according to G(RP) did not result in an effective preselection for yield.","The authors thank Natalia Lest, Franziska Müller and Roland Kürschner for their excellent technical assistance.

Solving numerically the mass of the skyrmion as function of μ, we find a critical value μc=222.8MeV where the skyrmion mass vanishes. We compare the exact numerical treatment with an analytical discussion based on a special shape for the profile of the skyrmion due to Atiyah and Manton. The extension of this ansatz for finite μ works quite well for μ<121MeV. Then, for small values of μ, where the analytical approach is valid, we consider the possibility of having an angular deformation for the skyrmionic profile, which is possible for finite values of μ. This is, however, a small effect. Finally we introduce finite temperature corrections, which strength the instability induced by the chemical potential, finding the dependence of the critical temperature on μ.",AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank financial support from FONDECYT under grant 1051067.,,Physics Letters B,,,,2006-01,2006,,2006-01,632,4,512-516,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Loewe, M.; Mendizabal, S.; Rojas, J.C.","Loewe, M.

Additionally, if the system of differential equations associated with Hamilton's canonical equations of motion is linear (a very important special instance), we show that there is an equal amount of Fisher information per degree of freedom, proportional to the inverse temperature. This gives temperature an “information” meaning. This “equipartition” of I is also shown to hold in a simple but relevant (magnetic) example involving a non-linear system of differential equations, where the Fisher measure turns out to be proportional to Langevin's function.",,,Physics Letters A,,,,2006-01,2006,,2006-01,349,1-4,15-20,Closed,Article,"Pennini, F.; Plastino, A.","Pennini, F.

Under this condition, we analyze the time evolution of a Gaussian-shaped superposition of plane waves incoming from the source lead, and found that the wave packet can be split into three packets at the drain lead. This spatial pattern manifests in a direct way the peculiarities of the conductance in energy space.

Transport through the quantum wire is investigated by means of a noninteracting Anderson tunneling Hamiltonian. Analytical expressions of the transmission probability and phase are given. The transmission probability shows an energy spectrum with forbidden and allowed bands that depends on the up–down asymmetry of the system. In up–down symmetry only the gap survives, and in up–down asymmetry an allowed band is formed. We show that the allowed band arises by the indirect coupling between the up and down quantum dots. In addition, the band edges can be controlled by the degree of asymmetry of the quantum dots. We discuss the analogy between this phenomenon with the Dicke effect in optics.","AcknowledgmentsP.A.O. would like to thank financial support from Millennium Science Nucleus Condensed Matter Physics and FONDECYT under Grants nos. 1060952 and 7020269.

We study the classical behaviour of an electric dipole in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. We obtain equations and constants of motion from the Lagrangian formulation. We find an infinitely periodic effective potential that describes a rotational motion. The problem is not directly separable in relative and centre-of-mass variables, even though we are able to write the energy of the system as a function of only one term, the relative variable. We define another constant of motion, which couples the relative with the centre-of-mass variables. We describe conditions for the bound states of the dipole. In addition, we discuss the problem in the approximation of small oscillations. Finally, we explore the existence of a possible family of trapped states in a region of the space where there are no classical turning points.",,,European Journal of Physics,,,,2006-09-06,2006,2006-09-06,2006-11-01,27,6,1315-1322,All OA; Green,Article,"Troncoso, Paulina; Curilef, Sergio","Troncoso, Paulina (Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

The information gap between rich and poor reflects the deep division in the South African library and information profession at the end of the previous regime, but cooperation among libraries offers one way to build bridges among the ‘island communities’ that make up South African society. The history of library cooperation in South Africa is surveyed from its beginnings in the 1930s, through the development of inter-library lending, to the creation of a bibliographic network and regional consortia in the 1980s. More recently, the unified Library and Information Association of South Africa has as one of its key objectives the development of collaborative relationships, and the National Library of South Africa, launched in 1999, sees the building of partnerships as integral to its outreach ideals. A number of obstacles to cooperation are described, but the article concludes that the changing technology landscape will continue to make it easier for libraries to do things together in new ways.",,,Alexandria The Journal of National and International Library and Information Issues,,,,2006-08-01,2006,2006-08-01,2006-08,18,2,97-102,Closed,Article,"Tsebe, John; Drijfhout, Douwe","Tsebe, John (); Drijfhout, Douwe ()",,"Tsebe, John (); Drijfhout, Douwe ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004415682,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,17 Partnerships for the Goals

Isolation of tropical landforms within formal morphogenetic regions, which arose during the early history of the subject, has persisted. However, in a global geomorphology, plate tectonic motion, Milankovich cycles of climate change and invasive weather systems all render fixed climatic boundaries meaningless and, on every timescale of enquiry, interaction of the tropics with extra‐tropical regions is fundamental. In tropical regions, the continuity of weathering processes through geologic time emphasizes their contemporary relevance and, with knowledge of Quaternary climate changes, increases understanding of the nature of landscape sensitivity and instability and fluvial sedimentation on millennial timescales. Examples are illustrated from northeast Queensland, Australia and northwest Kalimantan, Indonesia. Global concerns centred on hazards and resources need to be addressed through a reciprocal exchange of ideas involving greater focus on tropical areas.",,,Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography,,,,2006-05-31,2006,2006-05-31,2006-07,27,2,111-127,Closed,Article,"Thomas, Michael F.","Thomas, Michael F.

Methods.Deep imaging and K-band spectroscopy from the VLT of 201 stars toward the cluster is presented. Results.The majority of 104 stars show the CO band-head in absorption. Half of them emit X-rays and/or have infrared excess, indicative of very young objects. Their intrinsic IR luminosity is compatible with intermediate and high-mass pre-main sequence stars. Nine additional stars have the CO feature in emission, while sixty sources are lacking any stellar spectral feature due to veiling by circumstellar dust. Conclusions.We suggest that CO absorption is – as in the case of low-mass stars – also a common feature during the early evolution of stars with higher masses. According to model calculations the observed CO absorption is most likely a sign of heavily accreting protostars with mass accretion rates above yr-1.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2006-09-12,2006,2006-09-12,2006-10,457,3,l29-l32,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Hoffmeister, V.

The mean-field finite-U slave-boson formalism is used to obtain the solution of the problem. We have found that the transmission spectrum shows a structure with two antiresonances localized at the renormalized energies of the quantum dots. The density of states (DOS) of the system shows that when the Kondo correlations are dominant there are two Kondo regimes with its own Kondo temperature. The above behavior of the DOS can be explained by quantum interference in the transmission through the two different resonance states of the quantum dots coupled to common leads. This result is analogous to the Dicke effect in optics. We investigate the many-body Kondo states as a function of the parameters of the system.","Two of the authors (G.A.L. and P.A.O.) acknowledge financial support from Milenio ICM P02-054F.

The Antofagasta–Calama Lineament (ACL) consists of an important dextral strike-slip NE-trending fault system. Deformation along the ACL system is evidenced by a right-lateral displacement of the Late Paleocene–Early Eocene metallogenic belts. Furthermore, clockwise rotation of the Early Cretaceous Mantos Blancos copper deposit and the Late Paleocene Lomas Bayas porphyry copper occurred. In the Late Eocene–Early Oligocene metallogenic belt, a sigmoidal deflection and a clockwise rotation is observed in the ACL. The ACL is thought to have controlled the emplacement of Early Oligocene porphyry copper deposits (34–37 Ma; Toki, Genoveva, Quetena, and Opache), whereas it deflected the Late Eocene porphyry copper belt (41–44 Ma; Esperanza, Telégrafo, Centinela, and Polo Sur ore deposits). These observations suggest that right-lateral displacement of the ACL was active during the Early Oligocene. We propose that the described structural features need to be considered in future exploration programs within this extensively gravel-covered region of northern Chile.","This research was supported by FONDEF Grant 1012 from CONICYT, Chile.

To this end, a number of South African learning potential instruments have been developed, empirical studies conducted (in most cases with positive results), and selection procedures implemented that make use of dynamic assessment techniques.

Methods This was a questionnaire-based study involving all seven tertiary institutions of learning in the ECP, viz. the Universities of Transkei, Fort Hare, Port Elizabeth and Rhodes University, and the Border, Eastern Cape and Port Elizabeth technikons. A total of 1 728 students were interviewed out of a student population of 30,080. Stratified random sampling was used to select the students. Two-way tables were used to test the independence of the variables and chi-square tests were applied. A ‘p’ value of below 5% was used as a test of significance. Results A total of 1 480 students completed the questionnaires (86%). The racial classification of the respondents was 79% Black, 13% White, 7% Coloured and 2% Indian. Twenty-six per cent of the students were smokers, of which 37% were male and 15% were female. Forty-five per cent of the Coloured students smoked, while the figures for Whites and Blacks were 26% and 25% respectively. Seventy per cent of the students smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day. Fifty-two per cent of the smokers said they wanted to stop smoking. Sixty-one per cent had been influenced to start smoking by their friends and only 13% were influenced by advertisements. Ninety-four percent agreed that smoking was dangerous to the smoker's health, while 73% responded that there was a relationship between mothers who smoke and low birth weight. Thirteen per cent thought the legislation was too tough, while 30% said it was good as it was. On measures to reduce smoking, 86% favoured restricting smoking in public places. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that smoking is prevalent in tertiary institutions of learning in the Eastern Cape Province. The demographic profile of the smokers reflects the national picture.

Different compositions prepared by mixing the three clays with other materials such as kaolin, quartz, philite, potash feldspar and talc, were investigated and compared with an industrial ceramic body for whiteware floor tiles (group BIIa). Physical and mechanical properties such as linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength were evaluated in pressed specimens fired at temperatures varying from 1025 to 1225 ºC.

311,pub.1025575032,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.10.011,,,Pressure induced anisotropy of electrical conductivity in polycrystalline molybdenum disulfide,Anisotropic specimens of MoS2 are obtained by pressing the microcrystalline powder into special die. This inelastic compression results in a rearrangement of the disulfide micro platelets observed by atomic force microscopy and reflected in the macroscopic anisotropy in electrical conductivity in these samples. The conductivity measured parallel and perpendicular to the direction of applied pressure exhibits an anisotropy factor of ∼10 at 1 GPa. This behaviour of the conductivity as a function of applied pressure is explained as the result of the simultaneous influence of a rearrangement of the micro platelets in the solid and the change of the inter-grain distances.,"AcknowledgementsThe support of the FONDECYT (Grants 1050344, 1030102, 7050081, 1050788), Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), the University of Chile, and the Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana are gratefully acknowledged.",,Applied Surface Science,,,,2006-09,2006,,2006-09,252,22,7941-7947,All OA; Green,Article,"Sánchez, V.; Benavente, E.; Lavayen, V.; O’Dwyer, C.; Torres, C.M.

The clay bodies were fired at temperatures from 850 to 1100 °C and then bend tested until rupture. Fracture surface observation revealed the existence of relatively small BaSO4 particles that do not significantly contribute to the rupture process. By contrast, larger clay matrix embedded particles and voids exert more influence on the ceramic rupture. Since these particles are also normal features in waste-free clay bodies, the incorporation of bentonite-treated petroleum waste cannot be directly related to the rupture process. Exception occurred above 10 wt.% added waste and temperatures higher than 1000 °C, at which the comparatively higher amount of non-plastic quartz particles plays a role in the decrease of strength.","AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the support to this investigation provided by the following Brazilian agencies, CNPq, CAPES and FAPERJ as well as the TECNORTE/FENORTE foundation.",,Applied Clay Science,,,,2006-08,2006,,2006-08,33,3-4,171-180,Closed,Article,"Monteiro, S.N.; Silva, F.A.N.; Vieira, C.M.F.","Monteiro, S.N.

We examined how the foraging activity of L. felina is affected by the regime of wave exposure and prey availability at Isla Choros, northern Chile. Through focal sampling we recorded time spent by otters in foraging, the duration of dives, and the hunting success on a wave-exposed and a wave-protected site on the island. In addition, we quantified the abundance of prey in both habitats. Marine otters spent more time foraging in the wave-protected site compared with the wave-exposed habitat. Successful dives reached 26.9% in the wave-exposed habitats, and 38.2% in the wave-protected habitat. Foraging dives were 18% shorter in wave-exposed as compared with wave-protected habitat. Numerically, available prey did not differ significantly with habitat. Our results are more consistent with the hypothesis that wave-exposed habitats represent a sub-optimal habitat to foraging marine otters. Marine otters’ use of wave-exposed patches through northern and central Chile coastal areas probably reflects a low availability of suitable protected areas and greater human disturbance of more protected habitat.","We are grateful to the Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF) for granting us permission to observe marine otters in the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve (IV Región, Chile).

The adsorbates coordinate mainly to the surfaces through interaction between their oxygen (or nitrogen) atoms to surface calcium ions, followed by hydrogen-bonded interactions to surface oxygen ions and, to a much lesser extent, surface fluorides. Bridging between two surface calcium ions is the preferred mode of adsorption, when the geometry of the adsorbates allows it, and multiple interactions between surfaces and adsorbate molecules lead to the largest adsorption energies. All adsorbates containing carbonyl and hydroxy groups interact strongly with the surfaces, releasing energies between approximately 100 and 215 kJ mol−1, but methylamine containing only the –NH2 functional group adsorbs to the surfaces to a much lesser extent (25–95 kJ mol−1). Both hydroxy methanamide and hydroxy ethanal prefer to adsorb to some surfaces in an eclipsed conformation, which is a requisite for these functional groups. Sorption of the organic material by replacement of pre-adsorbed water at different surface features is calculated to be mainly exothermic for methanoic acid, hydroxy methanamide and hydroxy ethanal molecules, whereas methyl amine would not replace pre-adsorbed water at the fluorapatite surfaces. The efficacy of the surfactant molecules is calculated to be hydroxy aldehydes > alkyl hydroxamates > carboxylic acids ≫ alkyl amines. The results from this study suggest that computer simulations may provide a route to the identification or even design of particular organic surfactants for use in mineral separation by flotation.","NHdL thanks the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council UK for an Advanced Research Fellowship and grant no.

Because epiphytism is a major problem in the mariculture of seaweeds, the recruitment of Ulva sp. and Enteromorpha sp. on gametophytic (cystocarpic) and tetrasporophytic thalli of C. chamissoi was tested in vitro on four populations from different locations in Chile. For Ulva sp., the density, cover and length of the recruits varied between the reproductive phases of the host and among the studied populations of C. chamissoi. In most experiments, a larger number of epiphytic thalli was observed on gametophytic plants of C. chamissoi; populations from Calderilla and Lechagua had a higher resistance to epiphytism. For Enteromorpha sp., its ability to grow epiphytically on both phases of the host showed a greater variability, but was inferior to that of Ulva sp. The differential resistance to epiphytism in both reproductive phases and in plant origin indicates the possibility of obtaining selected strains of C. chamissoi with lower susceptibility to epiphytism that could be utilized in planning maricultural programs.","C.

This has created a cultural diversity in the communities that we cannot wish away (Magubane, 2001:46). Historically, the black peoples of South Africa have been practising endogamous marriages, which means, for example, that a Motswana would not marry a Xhosa or Zulu (cf. Schapera, 1977:155). This article focuses on how the Northern Sotho writer H.M.L. Lentsoane, in his novel Megokgo ya Lethabo Tears of Joy', depicts these cultural stereotypes within black South African communities and how marriage, as a cultural institution, is portrayed. The questions asked are: How does this Sotho literary text, Megokgo ya Lethabo ‘Tears of Joy’, contribute to the crossing of conventional socio-cultural boundaries? To what extent are cultural diversities in marriage portrayed? As South Africa is counted among the young democracies of the world, what can be learned from the events outlined in this story?

The design problem is represented by several superstructures. The first superstructure represents separation tasks (STS), which include: feed processing superstructure (FPS), concentrate processing superstructure (CPS), and tail processing superstructure (TPS). The FPS commonly uses a single stage, i.e., rougher. The CPS represents the circuit needed to carry out the cleaner task, and the TPS represents the circuit needed to carry out the scavenger task. These superstructures are flow networks between several separation stages. In each separation stage two kinds of cells are allowed, bank and column. In several streams in the CPS and TPS, the incorporation of regrind mills is also included.The optimal selection of the circuit is made with an appropriate objective function, upon which the values of the operational and structural variables may be determined. The problem is formulated using disjunctive programming, which is converted to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The model includes mass balance, equipment models, operational conditions, and logic relationship. The approach is illustrated for a copper concentration plant.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank CONICYT for financial support, through Fondecyt Project 1020892.",,International Journal of Mineral Processing,,,,2006-07,2006,,2006-07,79,4,253-263,Closed,Article,"Cisternas, Luis A.; Méndez, David A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Jorquera, Rodrigo E.","Cisternas, Luis A.

This is achieved with the help of sequential measurements of two noncommuting observables only. We show that the overall success probability is maximized in the case of measuring two observables whose eigenstates define mutually unbiased bases. We find that for this optimal case the success probability quickly converges to unity as the number of measurement processes increases and that it is almost independent of the initial state. In particular, we show that to guarantee a success probability close to one the number of consecutive measurements must be larger than the dimension of the Hilbert space. We connect these results to quantum copying, quantum deleting, and entanglement generation.","This work was supported by FONDECYT Grant Nos. 1030671, 1040385, and Milenio ICM P02-49F. A.

The results reflect the poor socioeconomic situation of orphans in the country. Their number, especially in rural areas, is very high (i.e. 15% of all the children in rural areas). On average, 4.2% of the orphaned children of Botswana are household heads. The percentage of child heads of household (including non-orphaned) is greatest in the Central district (37.5%). Most of the orphans are raised by their relatives; for example, by grandparents (33.7%) and uncles (30%), the African tradition of the extended family which should be encouraged. Because orphaned children are, in most cases, not well educated and trained, they end up performing menial work or odd jobs, which are the lowest on the earnings ladder. The results also indicate that very few young people, especially those in the 10–14-year age group (less than 28%) know how HIV transmission can be prevented. There are some indications that young people are beginning to change their sexual behaviour; for example, a Central Statistical Office (CSO) (2005) report indicates that condom use among young people aged 15–24 increased from 81.5% to 87.1% between 2001 and 2004, while the number of people with more than one sex partner reduced from 10.6% to 5.5% for the same period. The provision of antiretroviral therapy to Botswana citizens and the different HIV/AIDS initiatives, programmes or partnerships now taking place in the country, such as the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnerships (ACHAP), should be applauded. However, much more should be done in terms of AIDS awareness and helping orphans, both socially and economically. For example, the government could create incentives for relatives and neighbours to take responsibility for orphans. This could be done, for instance, in the form of a foster care grant for each child they take into their care. Intervention could be better targeted; for example, children in the 10–14-year age group and districts such as the Central district, Kweneng and the Southern district should be given the first priority, as they have many child-headed households. It is also recommended that AIDS policy should be gender-biased towards women, and HIV/AIDS initiatives and programmes should be integrated with poverty reduction strategies for sustainable development.","The authors thank the editor and the reviewers for their helpful comments, which greatly improved this manuscript.",,Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies,,,,2006-10-27,2006,,2006-10-27,1,3,221-229,Closed,Article,"Arnab, R.; Serumaga-Zake, P.

In general, this kelp is reported to be reproductive all year round. Annual populations present in wave-protected areas of southern Chile suggest that the reproductive strategies of this population can be different. In this study we explore the reproductive strategies of annual M. pyrifera present in wave-protected areas and perennial populations encountered in exposed areas of southern Chile (41∘S). Our results show that M. pyrifera present in wave-exposed locations has a reproductive strategy that is similar to populations in the northern hemisphere. These populations reproduce all year round and their strategy is to produce high numbers of sporophylls and ensure that most of them (over 90%) become sporogenous. On the other hand, the protected populations with an annual life cycle, produce more spores per area of sorus.

To evaluate the effect and consequences of certain maternal factors (nutritional, sociodemographic and glucose metabolism) on pregnancy outcome of women recruited during the third trimester. Design. A longitudinal analytical study. Setting. Villages in the central region of the Limpopo province. Subjects. Third-trim ester pregnant women attending prenatal clinics at nine local clinics in the villages (N = 219) and their newborn infants. Results. The study showed that predictors of birth weight were found to be maternal body mass index (BMI), beta-cell function, haemoglobin and ferritin levels, while birth length was predicted by maternal height, fasting glucose and ferritin. The models accounted for 12.4% and 8.6% of the variation in both birth weight and length respectively. The 30-minute glucose (5.56 ±1.31; 6.23 ±1.59 mmol/1; p = 0.027) and haemoglobin levels (12.22 ±1.76, 11.46 ±1.87 g/dl; p = 0.041) differed significantly between the first and third birth weight tertiles. With respect to birth length tertiles, fasting (4.18 ±0.55, 3.84 ±0.92 mmol/1; p = 0.045), 30-minute (5.72 ±1.24, 6.31 ±1.50 mmol/1; p = 0.047) and 2-hour glucose levels (5.04 ±1.32, 6.13 ±2.50 mmol/1; p = 0.004) differed significantly between the first and third tertiles.

In South Africa itself, ten years of democracy have ripened our discussions and deepened our insights. We are less starry‐eyed and euphoric, and more cautious; less optimistic but more hopeful. We are beginning to understand much better just how much South Africa is part of Africa, as we are beginning to understand that ‘Africa’ is much more than a geographical connotation. Africa is its mountains and rivers, its valleys and high places; its sweeping savannas and its dense forests; its rich soil and its intimidating deserts. But Africa is Africa mostly in her children wherever they may dwell: in the wisdom of her elders and the courage of her youth, the strength of her mothers and the dedication of her fathers. Being an African is not simply a question of sharing the land, it is sharing the fate of Africa. We have come to understand Africa not just as a place, but as a manifestation of a vision; not just the land that we come from, but the destiny that we are called to fulfil. Africa has a rich diversity of spiritualities and proffers a deep well from which we can all drink.

Se trata de un grupo de estudio de 22 pacientes consecutivos con prdida traumtica o quirrgica del cuero cabelludo, mayor de 3cm de dimetro. Se emple para la reconstruccin colgajo semilunar, en espejo o en remolino vascularizados a partir de las ramas principales del cuero cabelludo. Analizamos en cada caso el tamao del defecto, prdida de hueso asociada, tipo de ciruga, resultados de la cobertura y complicaciones. La edad media de los pacientes fue de 40.6 aos con un rango entre 3 y 71 aos. El rea anatmica comprometida fue parietal en 11 pacientes (50%), temporal en 7 (31,8%), occipital en 3 (13,6%) y frontal en 1 caso (4,5%). La causa de la prdida de sustancia fue reseccin de tumores malignos o benignos en 10 casos, postraumtica en 5, postquirrgica en 4, y por alopecia en 3. El tamao medio del defecto fue de 147 cm con un rango entre 28 y 615 cm . El colgajo empleado fue doble en espejo en 10 casos (50%), semilunar de deslizamiento en 9 (36,4%) y en remolino en 3 (13,6%). En 6 pacientes se utiliz un injerto dermo-epidrmico para cerrar un defecto residual del rea dadora del colgajo (dos semilunares y dos en espejo). Veintiun pacientes (45%) evolucionaron sin incidencias, con cicatrizacin del colgajo en un plazo mximo de 21 das. Un paciente con prdida sea tras dos craneotomas, present necrosis parcial distal del colgajo y falleci por neumona aspirativa. Comparamos los tres tipos de reparacin de acuerdo al tamao del defecto y a la superficie del mismo. La eleccin de colgajo doble en espejo, remolino o semilunar, al aplicar la prueba de Kruskal Wallis, no se relacion con la superficie del defecto, y la eleccin del colgajo fue atribuible al azar, p > 0.05. La principal razn para escoger uno u otro fue la ubicacin del defecto. En conclusin, la estrategia de reconstruccin del cuero cabelludo mediante colgajos arterializados permite el cierre de grandes defectos en una operacin fcil y con cicatrices inaparentes que quedan ocultas bajo el cabello. Es por ello que creemos que estos procedimientos son la mejor alternativa de tratamiento y recomendamos su uso por sus resultados fiables cuando se siguen los principios tcnicos del manejo de colgajos. We present sucessive cases performed at Surgery Department of Hospital San Pablo, Coquimbo, Chile, between April1998, and April 2005: Twenty two consecutive patients suffering surgical or postinjury scalp defects, greater than 3 cm of diameter. Semilunar flap, mirror flap, or multiple pinwheel flap arterialized from the main scalp arteries were used for reconstruction. We determinate in every case the large of the defect, asociated bone loss, kind of surgery, end result and complications. Patients’ mean age was 40.6 years with rank between 3 and 71 years old. The involved anatomical area was parietal on 11 patients, (50 %), temporal in 7 cases (31.8 %), occipital in 3 cases (13.6 %) and frontal 1 case, (4.5 %). The origin of scalp loss was malign or benign tumor resection in 10 patients, post injury 5 cases, secondary to neurosurgical procedures in 4 cases, and alopecia or baldness in 3 cases. The mean large of the defect was 147 cm with rank between 28 and 615 cms . The mirror flap was used in 10 cases (50 %), the sliding semilunar flap in 9 patients (36.4 %), and the multiple pinwheel flap in 3 patients (13.6 %). An aditional dermoepidermal graft was used on 6 patients to cover a small area of flap donor site (two mirror flaps, and two semilunar flaps). Patients’ evolution were without complications in 95 % of cases (21/22). One woman with a temporal bone necrosis after two craniotomies suffered a distal flap necrosis, and finally died due aspirative pneumonia. The three kind of flap were compared according the defect length and defect area. The Kruskal Wallis test shows that the mean length and mean area of three different flap are statistically similars. The choice of one flap or another is no related with the area of the defect, p > 0.05. The main reason for choosing the flap was the site defect. Conclutions: the immediate scalp reconstruction strategie by arterialized flaps allows to close big defects, in one step, by a relatively simple technique with hidden scars under hair. We think this procedure is the best choice for immediate scalp recostruction, and we recommend its usage because this technique has reliable outcome when the surgical team follows the technical principles of flaps handle.",,,Cirugía Plástica Ibero-Latinoamericana,,,,2006-03,2006,2006-03,,32,1,55-62,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brown, O.

Gracilaria species have been extensively exploited with an average extraction of 75,000 t per year. In Chile this seaweed is usually found in sandy bottom bays between Antofagasta (2329'S - 7025'W) and Chilo (4203'0''S - 7311'0''W). Observations were made in 51 plants. Macroscopic observations were done in fresh plants, microscopic characters were determined in transversal sections with 20% Karo syrup and stained with aniline blue. Numerical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA and Principal Component Analysis. The latter analysis was performed for those characters with significant differences among the localities: basal constriction of branches, branch frequency, cortex cell diameter, subcortex cell diameter, thickness of the cortex and medullar cell diameter. The results of the Principal Component Analysis showed that 61% of the variance corresponded to the two first components. There were not observed groups clearly defined. The data suggest that along the coast of Chile there is only one morphotype that corresponds to the description of Gacilaria chilensis Bird, McLachlan et Oliveira, 1986 and it fits to the bulk of the material utilized in commercial production.

To assess whether the high prevalence of stunting and overweight accompanied by serum deficiencies of iron, folate and vitamin B12 in children at ages 1 and 3 years, can be explained by their diet. Design. A prospective cohort study. Setting. Villages in the central region of Limpopo province, which are serviced by Mankweng Hospital. Subjects. A cohort of children (N = 219) followed from birth were included in the study. Of the original cohort, 156 and 162 could be traced and assessed at ages 1 and 3 years, respectively. Dietary intake of the children was assessed using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and at 3 years a 24-hour recall questionnaire was also administered. Results. The children in this cohort consumed an energy-dense diet of poor quality as evidenced by insufficient intakes of iron, zinc, calcium and phosphates as well as folate, riboflavin, vitamin B6, niacin and vitamin A. Overall, nearly 70% of the energy intake of the diet came from carbohydrates while the contribution from fat was less than 20%. Average protein intake was adequate but comprised mainly protein from vegetable sources which are poor sources of iron and certain essential amino acids. Furthermore, the diet was judged to be high in phytates because of the high intake of cereals and this would have contributed to making iron and zinc less available for absorption. Low fruit and vegetable intake was the cause of the low intake of folate, vitamin A and vitamin C. The prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies was confirmed by the high prevalence of children with iron and folate biochemical deficiencies. Conclusion. The children’s diet was poor in several micronutrients which included iron, calcium, folate and vitamin A. Chronic energy deficiency, especially from animal sources, seems to be the factor contributing to the high levels of stunting observed.",,,South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition,,,,2006-01,2006,2016-05-31,2006-01,19,3,102-113,Closed,Article,"Mamabolo, Ramoteme; Steyn, Nelia; Alberts, Marianne","Mamabolo, Ramoteme (School of Physiology, Nutrition and Consumer Science, North-West University, Potchefstroom, North-West); Steyn, Nelia (Chronic Diseases of Lifestyle Unit, Medical Research Council, Tygerberg, W Cape); Alberts, Marianne (Medical Sciences Programme, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, Limpopo)",,"Mamabolo, Ramoteme (North-West University); Steyn, Nelia (Chronic Diseases of Lifestyle Unit, Medical Research Council, Tygerberg, W Cape); Alberts, Marianne (University of Limpopo)",14,1,,1.71,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025067861,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

Scolex and genital primordia changes through four stages of juvenile development are described. Longitudinal ridges do not appear on the scolex until the cestode has well defined genital primordia. This is in stark contrast to other caryophyllidean genera in which the basic morphology of the adult scolex becomes evident at the procercoid stage in the oligochaete intermediate host. The scolex of the adult has 13 to 19 prominent longitudinal ridges and deep furrows that come together at the apex to form an apical ring, a protrusible terminal introvert within the apical ring that forms a deep apical pouch when fully retracted, and a central group of Faserzellen. The scolex of W. virilis appears similar to the rugomonobothriate scolex of another African caryophyllid, Monobothrioides chalmersius (Woodland, 1924). Comparisons are made with other caryophyllideans having a scolex with a terminal structure: Monobothrium Diesing, 1863, Djombangia Bovien, 1926 and Caryoaustralus Mackiewicz et Blair, 1980. The terminal introvert may be responsible for attachment in early juvenile stages, but may be supplemented by the longitudinal ridges and furrows later in development. Host tissue appears to be drawn into these furrows that function as weak organs of attachment. We could not determine how the introvert of adult worms functions in attachment.

This snail species is experimentally susceptible to Schistosoma margrebowiei , a helminth parasite of game animals and cattle and can possibly also exploit humans as definitive hosts. The 125 different loci (1/16 degree squares) on record reflect a geographical distribution that is largely limited to the central and western part of the Limpopo Province and westwards down the basins of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. Details of each habitat as described by collectors during surveys, as well as altitude and mean annual air temperature and rainfall for each locality, were processed and chi-square and effect size values calculated. A decision tree constructed from all the available data indicated that temperature and altitude, followed by the type of water-body, seemed to be the more important factors that significantly influenced the distribution of this species in South Africa. The possible role of this species as intermediate host of economically important helminth species is briefly looked at and the urgent need to update the geographical distribution of host snails is emphasised. It is recommended that efforts be made to determine the exact role of B. depressus in the epidemiology of economically important helminth parasites.

The stoichiometric non-substituted compound MnLu2S4 is a normal spinel, with manganese at the tetrahedral sites and lutetium at the octahedral sites. The experimental magnetic moment indicates a 2+ oxidation state for Mn. Partial substitution of lutetium by Er and Ho slightly weakens the antiferromagnetic character of the Weiss parameter (Θ = −15 K for MnLu2S4) due to a larger separation of the Mn2+ ions, but it does not create any magnetic interaction, neither between the RE ions nor between the manganese spins. Inversely, 10% substitution of lutetium by chromium Cr3+ (MnLu1.8Cr0.2S4) triggers long-range ferromagnetic interactions below Tc = 67 K, although antiferromagnetic components still predominate. The ordered state, ferrimagnetic or AF-canted type, is studied by ZFC/FC cycles under different fields and temperatures.","The authors acknowledge the France–Chile program CNRS-CONICYT, project no. 18175, and the Région Bretagne for financial support.

In general, direct counts are more reflective of microbial abundance than plate counts. Microbiological techniques developed to recognize and count microorganisms in natural systems have had problems with reliability. Different methods frequently give different results for the enumeration of a specific organism. For direct microscopic examination of bacteria, automated digital systems represent a possible improvement in the identification and counting of microorganisms, eliminating observer bias, reducing costs and analysis time. A computational program was developed to evaluate the utility of coherent digital systems with color correlation for the recognition of Vibrio cholerae 01 in laboratory cultures and environmental samples stained with fluorescent monoclonal antibody. We tested 94 positive and 115 negative laboratory samples and, 33 positive and 34 negative environmental samples and 613 positive and 546 negative mesocosms samples. Correct identifications, cell counts and discrimination were possible in 100% of the laboratory samples. The sensitivity of the system with environmental and environmental-like samples varied between 91% to 94% and 99.5% discrimination between other bacteria or particles. Based on the absolute correlation values in red, green and blue components of the polychromatic V. cholerae 01 images (RGB channels), the algorithm to count and identify it correlated well with the peaks in the green channel output and were absent in both the red and blue channels. The discrimination criterion correlated well with the peaks present in the red and blue channels. We conclude that digital color correlation system is an useful and highly reliable tool to identify and count V. cholerae 01 in laboratory and environmental samples.",,,Revista de biología marina y oceanografía,,,,2006-07,2006,2006-07,,41,1,77-86,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mourio-Prez, Rosa R; Alvarez-Borrego, Josu; Gallardo-Escrate, Cristin","Mourio-Prez, Rosa R (Divisin de Biologa Experimental y Aplicada Depto. de Microbiologa, Mxico); Alvarez-Borrego, Josu (Centro de investigacin Cientfica y Educacin Superior de Ensenada Direccin de Fsica Aplicada Departamento de ptica, Ensenada B.C., Mxico); Gallardo-Escrate, Cristin (Centro de investigacin Cientfica y Educacin Superior de Ensenada Direccin de Fsica Aplicada Departamento de ptica, Ensenada B.C., Mxico; Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Biologa Marina, Citogentica y Anlisis de Imgenes, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"Mourio-Prez, Rosa R (Divisin de Biologa Experimental y Aplicada Depto. de Microbiologa, Mxico); Alvarez-Borrego, Josu (Centro de investigacin Cientfica y Educacin Superior de Ensenada Direccin de Fsica Aplicada Departamento de ptica, Ensenada B.C., Mxico); Gallardo-Escrate, Cristin (Centro de investigacin Cientfica y Educacin Superior de Ensenada Direccin de Fsica Aplicada Departamento de ptica, Ensenada B.C., Mxico; Catholic University of the North)",1,0,,0.09,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/revbiolmar/v41n1/art10.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022681177,31 Biological Sciences; 3109 Zoology; 33 Built Environment and Design,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, characterisation, at the atomistic level, of this material is difficult experimentally; rather the materials are typified by their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Here, we use an evolutionary simulation—amorphisation and recrystallisation (A&R)—to generate atomistic models for γ-MnO2, which include microstructural detail. These models conform to the pyrolusite polymorph, with small intergrowth domains (structurally similar to brookite-TiO2) and comprise micro-twinning together with general grain boundaries, stacking faults, dislocations and isolated point defects and defect clusters. Molecular graphics images, showing the atom positions for these microstructural features together with the (simulated) XRD patterns they give rise to, are presented and compare favourably with measured XRD providing valuable validation of the atomistic models. Surprisingly, the atomistic models also include anion sublattice domains conforming to both ccp and hcp, which are separated or facilitated by dislocations. We are not aware of this phenomenon having been reported in the literature for MnO2 and therefore, our simulations offer the prediction of its existence.","AcknowledgementsAlan Chadwick for undertaking EXAFS studies on MnO2 and useful discussions, Cambridge-Cranfield HPCF, EPSRC (GR/S48431/1, GR/S48448/01 and GR/S84415/01), The Royal Society-(London)/National Research Foundation-(Pretoria) Initiative, CCP5.",,Journal of Crystal Growth,,,,2006-08,2006,,2006-08,294,1,118-129,Closed,Article,"Sayle, Thi X.T.; Catlow, C.

This study was undertaken to investigate the experiences and attitudes of dietitians during the first compulsory community service (CS) year (2003), to determine their perception of the success of the year as a whole and to assess whether the knowledge and skills of graduates improved. Subjects and design. Data were collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire posted to the CS dietitians (N = 126). The questionnaire consisted of four sections: general information, demographic and logistical information, professional duties and competencies, and personal experience. Results. Ninety dietitians returned the completed questionnaire, giving a 71% response. Thirty-nine per cent of dietitians were placed during the first round of allocation, with 48% placed during the third round or after further deliberations. Eighty-eight per cent of the dietitians reported a safe working environment. Full competency was reported by 26% of dietitians for therapeutic nutrition, 47% for food service management and 30% for community nutrition. Only 7% of dietitians found it very difficult to execute their daily duties. At the outset, 55% of dietitians had a positive attitude regarding the year, with this percentage increasing to 67% towards the end of the year. Negative attitudes decreased from 17% to 15%. Ninety-one per cent of dietitians reported that their knowledge improved and 95% reported an improvement in skills. Most dietitians (92%) felt that the CS year was a successful institution. Conclusions. The majority of dietitians experienced the CS year positively and felt that their knowledge and skills improved.

Transfer of syntactic forms, now firmly established in the variety, is evidenced by, among other things, the preferred use of forms dispreferred in requesting formulae in the native varieties of English. To test the hypothesis of transfer of forms into English for the same requesting functions as in Sesotho sa Leboa (Northern Sotho), an African language of South Africa, use was made of a contrastive study, using ethnographic notebook data of BSAE and DCT (discourse completion task)‐elicited requests in both languages and acceptability judgements on ‘politeness’ in the African language. The results of a pragmatico‐syntactic analysis, which found a mismatch between knowledge about and use of appropriate speech act formulae in the native form of English, (1) confirm the hypothesis of a transfer of strategies from L1 to L2 over time in the speech of educated bilinguals which shaped BSAE; (2) suggest the influence of ‘cultural rules’(because contact of languages involves contact of cultures) in shaping the pragmatics of BSAE, on the basis of which the ‘Cultural Difference Hypothesis’ is proposed; and (3) concur with the emerging conclusion of the institutionalization of BSAE as an indigenized variety of English.",,,World Englishes,,,,2006-02-14,2006,2006-02-14,2006-02,25,1,65-89,Closed,Article,"Kasanga, Luanga A.","Kasanga, Luanga A.

Both groups were taught reading, writing and grammar. The only major difference was that whereas the control group was taught through interactively unmodified lessons, the experimental group was taught through interaction-based lessons. A proficiency pre-test on the content that the course was about was administered to both groups at the beginning of the study and a comparable performance post-test at the end. In order to enhance internal validity, both the pretest and post-test were marked by the same evaluator, not the researcher. The results of both tests were compared in order to find out if intervention had had any effect on the subjects' language proficiency. A descriptive comparison of the scores of the two groups indicated that intervention had had an insignificant impact. But a paired t-test showed that there was a significant difference between students' pre-test and posttest scores in essay writing and grammar.

An Analysis of Changing Higher Education in South Africa and its Relationship with the State,"This paper reviews briefly the relationship between the South African government and higher education. This relationship, which has shaped the landscape of higher education, is looked at on the premise that public institutions depend to a large extent on government for funding and other resources, and as such there has been constant influence and interference in higher education affairs. Whereas under colonial rule, the relationship mimicked that of the Scottish and British universities, the postcolonial relationships had their own characteristics, emulating government policies under apartheid and confirming therefore the establishment of two‐tier university systems. Like most African countries, South Africa is currently faced with an immense task to bring together economic, social and political stability.

in Vanuatu were characterized for crude protein (CP), fibre fractions, macro and micro minerals (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, copper, iron, manganese and zinc) and energy. Also in vitro digestibility study was carried out to predict the utilization of available nutrients. Data obtained were discussed in light of whether available nutrients would satisfy requirements of grazing beef cattle of different age and physiological function. The CP of grass and legume/browse species ranged from 7.9-17.8% and 10.5-23.9% respectively. L. leucocephala has a higher CP while Green leaf desmodium had the lowest CP content. DM and NDF were higher (P<0.05) in the grasses while CP was higher in the legume/browse species. Organic matter (OM) within and between the grass and legume/browse species varied. Mean concentrations of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) in the grass species was 5.7 g/kg DM and 2.6 g/kg DM, respectively and this resulted in an average Ca:P ratio of 2.2:1 for the grasses while the legume /browse species had Ca:P ratio of 5.3:1. Ca was low while K was high in the grasses compared to the legume/browse species. Among the microminerals Cu was critically low in both the grass and legume/browse species. In vitro DMD, OMD and CPD between and within the grass and legume/browse species were not significantly different (P>0.05) from each other, however NDFD and ADFD were higher (P<0.05) in the grasses than in the legumes/browses. In conclusion, the results of these analyses and the in vitro digestibility study have provided information on nutrients that are adequate and/or inadequate in the grass and legume/browse species components grazed to sustain beef cattle production in Vanuatu. The very low concentration of Cu in both the grass and legume/browse species therefore demonstrates the need to supplement grazing beef cattle with mineral lick blocks to overcome its deficiency.",,,The South Pacific Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences,,,,2006-12-15,2006,2006-12-15,2006,24,1,20-27,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Aregheore, E M; Steglar, T A; Ng'ambi, J W","Aregheore, E M (); Steglar, T A (); Ng'ambi, J W ()",,"Aregheore, E M (); Steglar, T A (); Ng'ambi, J W ()",6,1,,0.55,https://www.publish.csiro.au/sp/pdf/sp06003,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030177165,31 Biological Sciences; 3109 Zoology,
269,pub.1005097750,10.1016/j.csr.2005.10.002,,,Observations of bipolar residual circulation in two equatorward-facing semiarid bays,"Two equatorward-facing semiarid bays in Chile (around 30°S) were sampled between March 23 and 27, 1997 with the purpose of determining whether the similar coastline morphology of the bays caused residual circulation patterns that were alike. A towed acoustic Doppler current profiler and a conductivity-temperature-depth recorder were used to measure water current and density profiles along a triangular trajectory during two semidiurnal tidal cycles at each of the bays. The bays were influenced by semidiurnal tides. The bay to the north, Coquimbo Bay, featured a bipolar residual circulation consisting of a well-defined surface counter-clockwise gyre that occupied the northern two-thirds of the bay. The southern third of the bay was not completely resolved by the sampling but measurements suggested the presence of a clockwise circulation. The bay to the south, Guanaquero Bay, showed a well-defined clockwise gyre that occupied the southern half of the bay. Counter-clockwise circulation was apparent over the northern half. Near-surface circulations changed little with depth in both bays. The similarity in surface residual circulation patterns between bays, namely the presence of two counter-rotating gyres, was attributed to flow separation at the upstream headland of the embayment. In this context, “upstream” was relative to the direction of wind forcing and prevalent coastal currents. This direction was different during sampling of Coquimbo Bay (northerly winds and coastal currents) than in Guanaquero Bay (southwesterly winds and coastal currents). It was proposed that, in general, two counter-rotating gyres will appear in bays where the entrance width exceeds twice the radius of curvature of the headlands that limit them.","AcknowledgmentsThe help of J.L.

Starting with a partition of two inflation regimes, we use data symbolization for identifying temporal patterns. Afterwards the statistical information obtained from the patterns is used to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear model proposed by Brida (2000). 1 We compare the performance of the model against a naive benchmark predictor to verify its power to anticipate the qualitative behavior of the inflation time series.

The Chilean scallop Argopecten purpuratus is becoming a domesticated species and the production of hatchery-reared scallops (closed environment), has implied the development of successive generations of individuals deprived of several stimuli normally present in their natural habitats (e.g. predators). We compared the escape capacities between wild and cultured A. purpuratus and also evaluated the effect of reproductive investment on the escape response capacities. Wild and cultured scallops, at different reproductive stages (maturing, mature and spawned), were stimulated to escape with the predatory sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus. We recorded: (1) the time to reaction, (2) the total number of claps, the duration of the clapping response and the clapping rate until exhaustion, (3) the time they spent closed after exhaustion, and (4) the proportion of claps recovered, the duration of the clapping response and the clapping rate after 20 min of recuperation. We found that wild A. purpuratus (1) reacted earlier when contacted by their natural predator, (2) escaped faster (greater clapping rates), (3) spent less time with their valves closed when exhausted, and (4) most of their escape capacities (i.e. claps number; clapping time; capacity of recuperation) were less affected by the energetic requirements imposed by gonad maturation and/or spawning than in cultured scallops. We considered that all these aspects of the escape response would make wild scallops less vulnerable to predation than cultured scallops, thus decreasing predation risk. Given the reduction of escape performance in cultured scallops, we suggest that this aspect should be considered for the success of culture-based restocking programs.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to R.

The study further investigated the correlation between these trace metals in roadside soils and vegetation in order to infer the potential impacts of roadside trace metals contamination of vegetation. Collected surface soil and vegetation samples were analysed with atomic absorption spectrophotometer for Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb and Cd while water samples were analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for Zn, Cu, Fe, Pt and Pd. A linear correlation was observed between soil and vegetation metal concentration, which suggests the same source of metals in the samples except for Cu. The findings also revealed a general reduction in soil and vegetation metal concentrations some distance away from road traffic. For both experimental soil and vegetation samples, the mean concentrations were found to follow the decreasing orders: Pb > Zn > Cr > Cu >Cd and Pb>Zn >Cd >Cr>Cu respectively. For water samples, trace metals were highest in raw sewage and lowest in river waters. The sewage system leaking directly into the rivers was found to be the major source of pollution by trace metals. The mean concentrations of the trace metals in the water bodies were found to follow the following decreasing order: Fe >Zn >Pt >Cu >Pd.

Germination and viability (motile zoospores, settled spores), diameter of the primary cell of the gametophytes, percentage of female gametophytes, fertility and sporophytes production were measured after exposure to three radiation treatments (PAR; PAR + UVA; PAR + UVA + UVB). The effects of UVR in young sporophytes (diploid stage) were evaluated as changes in maximal quantum yield of chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm). A significant decrease in all variables was observed for the treatment that included UVB (PAR + UVA + UVB) after 2 and 4 h of exposure, in relation to the control. The motile spores were more sensitive to UVR exposure compared to settled spores and gametophytes, suggesting that along with an increase in ontogenetic development; there is an increase in the tolerance to UVR. In addition, it was observed that early stages of the intertidal L. nigrescens were more tolerant to UVR compared to the subtidal L. trabeculata. These results allow initially to infer that UVR may be regarded as an important environmental factor influencing the upper limit of distribution of these species, mainly through its detrimental effects on the early stages of the life cycle.",The research was supported by grants from the Universidad Católica del Norte (DGICT-2003 to M.E. and F.T.) and CONICYT (FONDECYT no. 1030343 to I.G.).

Design/methodology/approach This is a general review from 1930 to the present, based on published and unpublished material and personal engagement. Some analysis of the significance of events from a current perspective is included. The paper covers the founding in 1930 of the South African Library Association, attempts in the 1960s and 1970s to achieve greater recognition for libraries by government, the transformation of SALA in 1980 into the graduate South African Institute for Library and Information Science; and, in the early 1990s and the first years of democratic rule in South Africa, the emergence of “alternative” “democratic” library and information science (LIS) associations and initiatives. Participation in the 1991‐1992 African National Congress‐based National Education Policy Initiative (NEPI) led to a number of shared LIS events in the mid‐1990s that bridged the apartheid years and prepared the ground for LIASA. The rise of other significant but smaller specialist associations and their subsequent relationship with LIASA is also described.   Findings In addition to documenting events, this paper reveals the continuing efforts on the part of members of the LIS sector over 75 years to exercise influence on government and in the broad community. Problems identified in 1929 are still reflected in 2005.   Originality/value The value of the paper lies in its use of unpublished ephemeral records and the use and consolidation of information in scattered and previously unused published sources.",,,Library Management,,,,2006-01-01,2006,,2006-01-01,27,1/2,26-37,Closed,Article,"Walker, Clare M.","Walker, Clare M.

The high costs involved in such culture systems generated the interest to evaluate the possibility to culture the abalone confined to cages in the sea. Introduction of this species into the natural environment may pose risks to local flora and fauna, particularly the establishment of populations arising from escaped specimens or larval settlement. Laboratory experiments were carried out to evaluate interactions between this abalone and local species in order to determine rates of consumption of local algae by these molluscs, competition with other organisms occupying the same feeding niche, and predation on the abalone by some local carnivores. The experiments demonstrated consumption of all offered algae by the abalone, particularly Rhodymenia howeana at rates of 1.3% to 5% of their body weight per day. In competition with other species of herbivores it was observed that with some there was a decline in consumption rate both by the abalone and the competitors when they were together, suggesting occurrence of competitive interference. The abalone readily attracted and were consumed by a variety of predators, particularly Meyenaster gelatinosus and Cancer setosus. It was concluded that if H. discus hannai escapes from the cages or produces larvae which settle on rocky reefs, this species might become established as an additional component of the natural communities. However, due to competitive interactions, predation pressure, and an opportunistic fishery, the development of substantial populations, let alone population explosions, with serious negative environmental impacts is improbable.","AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Marcelo Aguilar and Christian Paz, who helped with the laboratory experiments.

We have obtained analytical expressions of the linear conductance and density of states for the molecule in equilibrium at zero temperature. As a consequence of quantum interference, the conductance exhibits one Breit-Wigner and two Fano resonances, which positions and widths are controlled by the magnetic field. Every two flux quanta, there is an inversion of roles of the bonding and antibonding states. For particular values of the magnetic flux and dot-lead couplings, one or even both Fano resonances collapse and bound states in the continuum (BICs) are formed. We examine the line broadenings of the molecular states as a function of the Aharonov-Bohm phase around the condition for the formation of BICs, finding resonances which keep extremely narrow against variations of the magnetic field. Moreover, we analyze a molecule of N quantum dots in the absence of magnetic field, showing that certain symmetries lead to a determinate quantity of simultaneous BICs.","We thank Luis Roa for useful comments.

Today, the events of September 11 and the response to them raise new questions about academic freedom, freedom of movement, and the role of student mobility. They mark a sharp counterpoint to the celebratory discussions of globalisation and human mobility that dominated during the 1990s. Since 2001, student visa policies have been considered on the basis of country-specific variations (versus academic norms). This decrease of the institutional solution of Tunisian mobility (the cooperation postulate) is associated with a rising form of ‘informal mobility’ and alternative forms of mobility, in terms of networks, and use of the ITCE tools. By studying the institutional and alternative forms of student mobility, this research investigates the sociological composition of candidates for the new and old destinations: by age, discipline and geographic origin of qualified graduates who have opted for the institutional path since September 11. This new post-globalisation posture poses, or rather supposes, in terms of public policies, a certain number of answers which take into account the universal vocation of the university, such as diversification of destinations, the idea of partnership between different Mediterranean universities, and the exploration of new forms of mobility.",This work has been accomplished thanks to the Population Council (West Asia &amp; North Africa) support.

Few specific studies on the mating behaviour of nemerteans have been conducted but several observational reports indicate that important processes known from other organisms, such as sexual selection and sperm competition, may also be at work in nemerteans. Herein, we review some of these observations and discuss their possible implications. We produce a summary table and reproduce some important observations, placing them in an evolutionary context. Four types of gamete‐transfer mechanisms are distinguished: (1) free‐spawning, where members of both sexes release gametes freely into the water column; (2) mucus‐spawning, where gametes are released within a mucus matrix; (3) internal fertilization, where spermatozoans are transferred to the immediate vicinity of oviducts, which they penetrate; and (4) gamete transfer aided by specific structures. While little is known about the last transfer mechanism, anecdotal observations are mainly available for the first three mechanisms. Mating interactions frequently involve more than two individuals. In several species, individuals only invest part of their gametes in a single mating interaction, apparently saving additional gametes for potential future mating events. These observations suggest that males of some species are exposed to mating competition. Males might counteract sperm competition by producing large numbers of sperm, as suggested by their high fertilization potential. Previous authors inferred that sperm morphology may be an adaptation to spawning behavior and possibly also to the risk of sperm competition.

The research investigated the relationship between regular physical exercise over a period of two to six months and psychological well-being in 26 exercisers at health clubs in the Richards Bay area of South Africa. Psychological well-being was measured by a Well-being Profile, composed of well-being components of mood, lifestyle, satisfaction with life, sense of coherence, fortitude, stress management, coping and total well-being score. Regular exercise was defined as meeting the criterion of exercising for an average of 30 minutes a day at least three times a week. The main findings were that regular exercise was associated with significant improvements in total well-being score and especially in the well-being components of mood, sense of coherence, fortitude, stress and coping. These findings are discussed in terms of their significance for the promotion of public health in general and mental health in particular.",,,South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2006-06,2006,2016-08-02,2006-06,36,2,357-373,Closed,Article,"Edwards, Steve","Edwards, Steve (Department of Psychology, Zululand University, Private Bag X1001, KwaDlangezwa 3886, South Africa)","Edwards, Steve (University of Zululand)","Edwards, Steve (University of Zululand)",58,10,,6.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063712712,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being
252,pub.1030731295,10.1007/s10811-006-9053-7,,,Effect of Detachment on the Palatability of two Kelp Species,"Many species of macroalgae survive after becoming dislodged from their primary substratum, but little is known about their capacity to express anti-herbivore defences after detachment. We examined the effect of detachment on the relative palatability of the two kelp species Lessonia nigrescens and Macrocystis integrifolia to mesograzers. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted on the northern-central coast of Chile to investigate whether (i) time after detachment and (ii) grazing on detached and attached algae could trigger internal defence mechanisms in the algae, which may have acted as deterrents to grazing. In order to examine palatability, feeding assays were run after each experiment using fresh algal pieces and artificial food. Time after detachment had a significant influence on palatability of L. nigrescens but not of M. integrifolia. During the first 12 days of detachment, detached L. nigrescens held in grazer-free laboratory tanks were not significantly more palatable than attached conspecifics from the field but thereafter detached individuals became more palatable. Floating individuals of M. integrifolia showed no effect of detachment, indicating that this alga maintains its defence after detachment. An experiment conducted in the field confirmed these results for M. integrifolia. An additional laboratory experiment confirmed that attachment status plays an important role on algal defence reaction for L. nigrescens when exposed to grazers. Detached and previously grazed individuals of this species were less palatable than grazer-free control algae, but grazing had no effect on palatability of attached algae. Our results indicate that kelps have varying capacities for development of anti-grazing responses once they become detached, possibly depending on their capacity to float and survive after detachment.",,,Journal of Applied Phycology,,,,2006-07-08,2006,2006-07-08,2006-10,18,3-5,423-435,Closed,Article,"Rothäusler, Eva; Thiel, Martin","Rothäusler, Eva (Institut für Aquatische Ökologie, Albert-Einstein-Str.3, 18057, Rostock, Germany; Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile)","Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile)","Rothäusler, Eva (Institut für Aquatische Ökologie, Albert-Einstein-Str.3, 18057, Rostock, Germany; Catholic University of the North); Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile)",20,0,,1.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030731295,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology",

[Hönninger, G., Bobrowski, N., Palenque, E.R., Torrez, R., Platt, U., 2004. Reactive bromine and sulfur emission at salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Geophys. Res. Lett. 31, doi:10.1029/2003GL018818] in a large salt pan of the Bolivian Altiplano: the salar de Uyuni. However, bromide is considered to be an excellent conservative tracer, which leads to the questioning of its actual conservation in surficial geochemical processes. The relation between bromide and lithium, thought to be a conservative component in waters and brines of the Central Andes, points to a depletion of Br relative to Li in Uyuni brines of about 50–300kg/day, a flux close to that measured by Hönninger et al. (2004): ⩾200kg/day. Such values are very low in regard to the size of the salar (5–30g/km2/day). Salt efflorescences have a much higher surface area than a flat salt crust, which should enhance the release of bromine. Leach solutions of salt efflorescences in closed basins of northern Chile are compared to their parent waters. Conservative components should have the same concentration ratios in both solutions. Actually, a strong depletion in Br is observed in the leach solutions, which could suggest a significant release of Br from the salt into the atmosphere. During the rainy season, efflorescences are leached and their dissolved components brought in saline lakes and salars. Evaporative profiles show a slight but noticeable fractionation between Li and Br which could be due to the contribution of Br-depleted leach solutions of salt efflorescences. Therefore, bromide does not behave conservatively in surface waters and brines of the Central Andes. If the loss of Br is really due to its transfer into the atmosphere, then the flux would be much higher than that estimated for the salar de Uyuni alone. Numerous salt pans, saline lakes, and widespread efflorescences covering large land surfaces would contribute significantly more reactive bromine into the atmosphere.",The Direccion General de Aguas at Santiago provided field and laboratory support for investigating Chilean salars.

It was hypothesised that mussels cushion the effects of disturbance on the associated organisms and thereby favour species diversity in patches with added nutrients. In order to test this hypothesis, a two-factorial field experiment was conducted at an exposed rocky shore of northern-central Chile in which nutrient addition and mussel removal were manipulated with two levels. Experimental units consisted of 100-cm2 mussel plots that were sampled after two months of experimental manipulations. Local nutrient addition was done with coated slow-release fertilisers. Mussel removal treatments consisted in three destructive events applied throughout the experimental phase, and each event consisted in the removal of 20% of the mussel biomass from each plot. While point-source nutrient addition had only minor effects on diversity, mussel removal had significant and negative effects on faunal species richness and the abundance of suspension-feeders and sessile organisms. The abundance of predators/scavengers significantly decreased with mussel removal in the presence of nutrient addition. Grazers and mobile organisms were very abundant in the mussel assemblage but their abundance remained unaffected by treatments. Finally, species richness and total abundance of algae were also not affected by the treatments. Although the duration of our experiment was relatively short, we suggest that the effects of local nutrient addition are of minor importance at the study site in comparison to the effects of mussel removal. Based on our results and previous studies conducted in soft-bottom systems, we suggest that physical and biological stress acting on exposed hard-bottom communities overshadows the potential effects of local nutrient addition.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful for the constructive comments and suggestions from C.

Recent studies have demonstrated that past mating history and predation risk can affect both male and female mating behaviour, but the interaction between these two factors has not been addressed explicitly. We allowed some socially dominant male rock shrimp, Rhynchocinetes typus (the robustus morph), to mate and prevented others from doing so. We then added them to an assemblage of individuals of mixed sex and social rank and gave them the opportunity to mate again in both the absence and the presence of predation risk. Recently mated males guarded females for significantly less time and they transferred significantly fewer spermatophores to these females than did unmated males. However, neither predation risk nor recent mating history affected the rate of spermatophore transfer, and there was no interaction between these variables. The results suggest that recently mated robustus males change their mating behaviour according to their perceived mating opportunities. The behaviour that we observed in robustus male R. typus is consistent with that of males of other species. Females and males are affected differently by mating history: with multiple matings, females become choosier and search for higher-quality mates, but males appear to conserve their reproductive resources to be able to increase mate quantity.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to E.

The lakes show marked differences among one another, although they are all temporary, shallow and saline systems (>30gl−1). La Muerte is dominated by microbial mats that are absent from the other two. Piñol is more exposed to strong winds than the other two lakes and exhibits higher turbidity. Sulfúrica appears to be the most extreme system, with the highest salinity, which leads to a complete absence of macrozooplankton. Phytoplankton composition in these lakes varies as a consequence of the different physico-chemical conditions; it is fundamentally composed of typical hypersaline species such as Dunaliella sp., Aphanothece sp., and soil benthic species (e.g. Hantzschia amphyoxis) that appear to play an important role in these systems. Comparative analysis of the microbial component (phytoplankton diversity and temporal evolution) under in situ conditions and the presence of various abiotic and biotic factors, including the impact of macrozooplankton grazing, shows that it is easy to overlook large differences in the community structure of apparently similar ecosystems.

Although the ‘new’ ecological system resulting from a successful invasion of abalone would be locally stable, the establishment of a self‐enhanced dynamic of recruits would transform this into an unstable system.    The harvest of the kelp, Lessonia trabeculata and other macroalgae is not recommended because this destabilizes the system. The harvest of abalone adults is only sustainable if they do not exert a negative effect upon other native invertebrates.     The eco‐social model showed three important results: (1) if the variables ‘Price’ and ‘Farming’ are in expansion and stationary dynamics, then the models were found unstable; (2) a self‐enhanced dynamic of abalone recruits tends toward instability; and (3) the harvest of the kelp L. trabeculata and other macroalgae would be non‐sustainable.     Based on our results, the sustainable development of extensive farming of H. discus hannai in the sea would be not reached. If it is done, an intensive monitoring of the community after introduction into the system is strongly recommended. Likewise, the farming of macroalgal species (source of food for abalone) should be promoted in order to avoid harvesting of macroalgae from natural systems.

The most important factor affecting the structure and properties of these copolymers is the comonomer content. The thermal treatment, that is, the rate of cooling from the melt, is also important. These factors affect the thermal properties, the degree of crystallinity, and therefore the structural parameters and the viscoelastic behavior. A slow cooling from the melt favors the formation of the γ phase instead of the α modification. Regarding the viscoelastic behavior, the β relaxation, associated with the glass‐transition temperature, is shifted to lower temperatures and its intensity is increased as the 1‐hexene content raises. The microhardness values are correlated with those of the storage modulus deduced from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis curves, and good linear relations have been obtained between these parameters. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

stars Beta and 15 CMa as well as KZ Mus. For the two stars in CMa, we obtained
270 h of measurement in the Stromgren uvy and Johnson V filters, while 150 h of
time-resolved Stromgren uvy photometry was acquired for KZ Mus. All three stars
are multi-periodic variables, with three (Beta CMa) and four (15 CMa, KZ Mus)
independent pulsation modes. Two of the mode frequencies of 15 CMa are new
discoveries and one of the known modes showed amplitude variations over the
last 33 years. Taken together, this explains the star's diverse behaviour
reported in the literature fully.
  Mode identification by means of the amplitude ratios in the different
passbands suggests one radial mode for each star. In addition, Beta CMa has a
dominant l=2 mode while its third mode is nonradial with unknown l. The
nonradial modes of 15 CMa, which are l <= 3, form an almost equally split
triplet that, if physical, would imply that we see the star under an
inclination angle larger than 55 degrees. The strongest nonradial mode of KZ
Mus is l=2, followed by the radial mode and a dipole mode. Its weakest known
mode is nonradial with unknown l, confirming previous mode identifications for
the star's pulsations.
  The phased light curve for the strongest mode of 15 CMa has a descending
branch steeper than the rising branch. A stillstand phenomenon during the rise
to maximum light is indicated. Given the low photometric amplitude of this
nonradial mode this is at first sight surprising, but it can be explained by
the mode's aspect angle.",,,arXiv,,,,2006-03-28,2006,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Shobbrook, R. R.; Handler, G.; Lorenz, D.; Mogorosi, D.","Shobbrook, R. R. (); Handler, G. (); Lorenz, D.

Aims.We compile the available data of WX Cet, compare the results with other SU UMa stars, and discuss our findings in the context of current theories of superhumps and superoutbursts to progress with our understanding of SU UMa stars. Methods.We analyse all recorded outbursts of WX Cet, based on the AAVSO archive and other published sources, and present new CCD photometry during two recent superoutbursts, including the determination of the corresponding periodicities. We perform numerical disc instability model calculations and compare its predictions with the observations. Results.WX Cet is a SU UMa type dwarf nova with a superoutburst cycle of 880 days on average, and short eruptions every 200 days. It seems that the outburst cycle length increased by nearly a factor of 2 during the past 70 years. According to our numerical simulations, this can be explained in the context of the disc instability model by assuming enhanced mass transfer during outburst and a decreasing mean mass transfer rate during the last decades. Using the data available, we refine the orbital period of WX Cet to days and interpret the orbital hump found in quiescence as emission from the hot spot. During two recent superoutbursts in July 2001 and December 2004 we observed superhumps, with a rather large positive period derivative of , present only during the first 9 days of a superoutburst. Afterwards and during decline from the “plateau” phase, a constant superhump period of about 0.05922 days was observed. Late superhumps are present for at least 12 days after the decline from the “plateau”, with a period of 0.05927 days. We find this phenomenology difficult to interpret in the context of the standard explanation for superhumps, i.e. the thermal tidal instability model. Conclusions.We interpret the long-term light curve of WX Cet as the result of a significantly decreasing mean mass transfer rate. Highlighting the complexity of the observed superhump light curves, we emphasise the importance of WX Cet for a proper understanding of the SU UMa star outburst physics and the evolution of ultra-short period cataclysmic variables.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2006-12-05,2006,2006-12-05,2007-03,463,3,1053-1060,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sterken, C.; Vogt, N.; Schreiber, M.

The pulsations of the star, which show flatter light maxima than minima, can be described with a frequency quintuplet centred on 1557.653 μHz and some first harmonics of it. The amplitude of the pulsation is modulated with the rotation period of the star that we determine with 2.91179 ± 0.00007 d from the analysis of the stellar pulsation spectrum and of the mean light data. We break up the distorted oscillation mode into its pure spherical harmonic components and find it is dominated by the ℓ= 1 pulsation, and also has a notable ℓ= 3 contribution, with weak ℓ= 0 and 2 components. The geometrical configuration of the star allows us to see both pulsation poles for about the same amount of time; HD 99563 is only the fourth roAp star for which both pulsation poles are seen and only the third where the distortion of the pulsation modes has been modelled. We point out that HD 99563 is very similar to the well-studied roAp star HR 3831. Finally, we note that the visual companion of HD 99563 is located in the δ Scuti instability strip and may thus show pulsation. We show that if the companion was physical, the roAp star would be a 2.03-M⊙, object, seen at a rotational inclination of 44°, which then predicts a magnetic obliquity .","The Austrian Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung partially supported this work under grants S7303-AST and S7304-AST.

Herein we examined the geographic distribution of pelagic barnacles of the family Lepadidae collected from floating macroalgae at seven sampling areas between 23 and 50 S. Four species were encountered and they are briefly described herein. The most abundant northern species was Lepas anatifera, and it diminished in abundance towards the south (33 S). Moreover, this species was not found in waters with a sea surface temperature (SST) of less than ~18 C. Lepas australis, primarily a circumpolar West Wind Drift species, diminished in abundance towards the north (33 S). This species was restricted to waters of < 18 C SST. A third species, L. pectinata, was encountered throughout almost the entire study area, but it was most abundant between 29 and 33 S. The fourth species, Dosima fascicularis, was only found at two sampling areas, namely at 27 S and 33 S, and this is the first record of this species from the central coast of Chile. The distributional pattern of the pelagic barnacles found herein corresponds to the three main zoogeographic regions as revealed by the majority of previous studies based on littoral organisms: the northern Peru-Chilean Province, the southern Magellanic Province, and the central Chilean Transition Zone where the two provinces overlap. Even though the present study only considers four species of pelagic barnacles, the results support the hypotheses on the importance of oceanographic conditions (in particular SST) in determining the zoogeographic patterns along the south east Pacific coast of Chile La mayora de los estudios de zoogeografa a lo largo de la costa chilena del Pacfico sur este se han enfocado en organismos bentnicos y las condiciones oceanogrficas se sugieren como factores principales que modulan su distribucin.

Se encontraron cuatro especies de cirripedios lepdidos y cada una se describe brevemente. La especie del norte ms abundantes fue Lepas anatifera y disminuye su abundancia hacia el sur (33 S). Adems, esta especie no se encontr en temperatura superficial del mar (SST) inferior a ~18 C. Lepas australis, que posee una distribucin circumpolar, atena su abundancia hacia el norte (33 S). Esta especie se restringe a SST < 18 C. La tercera especie, L. pectinata se extiende en la mayor parte del rea de estudio, pero posee su mayor abundancia relativa en el rea central, entre 29 y 33 S.

Reports on factors controlling meiofaunal community structure in these kinds of organic‐rich and oxygen‐deficient habitats are scarce in the literature. In this study, five sites along a transect from the mid‐Bay of Concepción (27 m) to the outer shelf (120 m) were studied on fives dates (May, August, November 1997, and March and May 1998) in order to assess the dynamic relationships between sedimentary organic matter and metazoan meiofauna. The sampling period coincided with the 1997–1998 El Niño event. Sediment parameters investigated were the redox potential discontinuity depth, photosynthetic pigment concentrations (chlorophyll a and phaeopigments), organic carbon, nitrogen, total lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. In general, lowest values of meiofauna abundance and biomass were found within the naturally eutrophic Bay of Concepción and towards the shelf break, while maximum values occurred at intermediate depths. During the whole period, the meiofaunal abundance was negatively correlated with the concentration of most of the biochemical components of organic matter, as well as with the sediment phaeopigment content. However, positive correlations were found with chlorophyll a derived indices and with bottom‐water oxygen content. Most of the sediment parameters displayed a seasonal cycle, but towards the beginning of 1998, an effect of the 1997–1998 El Niño was evident. Typical austral‐summer ( i.e. oxygen‐deficient) conditions did not develop, and sedimentary parameters reflected a decreased input of phytodetritus. Along the transect, the magnitude of this effect on meiofauna varied among sites. An overall positive response, in terms of meiofaunal abundance was observed, probably due to the amelioration of low oxygen conditions in the sediment.","We thank the captain and crew of the R/V Kay Kay (University of Concepción) for assistance during sampling.

Indeed, if possible age effects are taken into account, this metallicity range might become smaller. Irregular galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with longer timescales of formation and lower star formation (SF) efficiency, do not contain old MRGCs with [Fe/H] > -1.0, but they are observed to form populations of young/intermediate-age massive star clusters (MSCs) with masses exceeding 104 M⊙.

Changes in the interstellar dust, particularly in elemental abundances in dust grains and in the mass distribution function of the grains, may be among the factors regulating star and MSC formation activity in galaxies.

The young activity of the AFS is expressed by several fault scarps which affects alluvial fan sediments of the eastern side of the Coastal Cordillera (23°30′–23°42′S). Detailed mapping of alluvial fans reveals a complex relationship between fault motion, erosion and alluvial fan development. An older group of alluvial fans became inactive prior to the scarp formation. Younger alluvial fans, arising directly from feeder channels and entrenched in the fault scarps, posts date the scarp formation. The youngest slip on the AFS is recorded by headward eroding channels entrenched across the scarp which are in turn displaced vertically 0.3–0.5 m by the fault. Quartz fragments in four sites on the older inactive fan group were analyzed for cosmogenic 21Ne concentrations yielding an average age of 424 ± 151 ka, the upper limit for the recent activity of the fault.

In the Southern Andes, different kinematic environments represented by two nearly orthogonal active fissure systems show apparently incompatible arrays of volcanic chains. Moreover, a local Quaternary compressive regime is inferred from basement faults. However, these mutually orthogonal chains, which are also oblique to the volcanic front, have contrasting magma evolution and eruptive styles that can be related with their tectonic setting. Whereas northeast-trending monogenetic cones (Carrán–Los Venados) can be interpreted as resulting from magma upwelling along regional tension cracks in a Quaternary dextral transpressive/compressive domain, northwest-striking fissure system (Cordón Caulle Volcanic Complex) can be the result of extensional fault reactivation and long magma residence in the upper crust. Different kinematic environments cause contrasting magma evolution and eruptive styles. A two-way coupling mechanism is suggested for to explain local depart of the regional stress field, geometric array of extensional features, and final magmatic evolution in these volcanic domains of the Southern Andes.","AcknowledgementsThis work is part of a research on the relationships between tectonics and volcanism in Southern Andes, a collaborative effort of the SERNAGEOMIN (Chile) and IRD-Université Paul Sabatier (France).

It presents an overview of language policy development at historically Afrikaans-medium universities in South Africa against the background of a changing higher education environment. The paper demonstrates that such universities have opted for a rather flexible policy on the medium of education. Although parallel bilingual education has been taken as the preferred model, allowance is made for various deviations. This approach represents a compromise between the need to reform (and thus maintain Afrikaans, so as to appease traditional clientele and secure traditional sources of external funding) and the need to transform (and increase access so as to become multilingual and multicultural). The seemingly bilingual approach does not suggest a move towards bilingual higher education per se.

We ran experiments in the subtidal zone in Tongoy Bay, Chile, to test whether providing a filamentous settlement substratum in the water column and shell litter on the bottom would increase the settlement and post-larval survival of scallops. We placed collectors made of Netlon® 50 cm above the sand and mud bottoms, and three and a half months later there were significantly more scallop spat on the bottom under the collectors (38.5 ind m−2), than in areas without collectors (0 ind m−2), or in controls where collectors were installed but a bag around the collector prevented the juveniles from falling to the bottom (4.8 ind m−2). Also, the addition of either entire or broken scallop shells to the bottom resulted in increased settlement of juveniles on the bottom (33.7 ind m−2 with entire shells and 48.1 ind m−2 with broken shells), compared to plots where no shell debris was added (0 ind m−2). The 2 week survival rate of juveniles (<3 mm shell height) added to plots covered with entire scallop shells (12.4%) and to plots covered with broken shells (15.1%) was greater than in plots where we did not add shells (3.5%). These results suggest that substrate availability explains spatial variability of recruitment for this species, while temporal variability (between years) is mainly the consequence of larval supply. The manipulation of substrates can locally increase settlement, but will not remove the temporal variability. Whereas our experiments provide useful insights into strategies for managing or establishing local scallop populations, experiments over a longer term and at a large scale are needed to further understand the community functioning in order to develop a strategy for managing this fishery resource.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to friends and colleagues who assisted in this study.

The present contribution deals with the meaning of the feminine leadership from a masculine perspective. By using a qualitative approach, opened interviews were developed to understand the meaning that men assign to the feminine leadership. The speeches were analyzed on the basis of the Strauss/Corbin-theory (2003). The results show that men agree with the changes experienced by the gender rolls. In a specific way men agree that women need to have more societal-economic opportunities, that it is necessary to have more equitable relationship inside the family. However within this positive framework, emerging tensions configure a dissatisfaction of the masculinity that in turn impact the intimate sphere questioning the present day inter-gender relationship. Finally, there is a men group with more progressive speeches which venture towards a positive evaluation of the women capacities and their assumed public space-rolls. However this positive evaluation is vigilant, ambivalent, and influenced by a perception of confidence/uncertainty, efficiency/inefficiency of the effective societal contribution that women are able to reach.",,,Última Década,,,,2006-12,2006,2006-12,,14,25,65-90,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meruane, Paulina Salinas; Carvajal, Susana Arancibia","Meruane, Paulina Salinas (Universidad Catlica del Norte Escuela de Periodismo, Antofagasta, Chile); Carvajal, Susana Arancibia (Universidad Catlica del Norte Escuela de Psicologa, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Meruane, Paulina Salinas (Catholic University of the North); Carvajal, Susana Arancibia (Catholic University of the North)",9,1,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/udecada/v14n25/art04.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019562828,,

Design/methodology/approach This research adopts the descriptive case study research design, as defined by Yin and McCutcheon and Meredith. Four supply networks, whose central firms are leading pharmaceutical companies, have been investigated.   Findings At a given time when deciding the SCM initiative(s) to be implemented, external fit and the state of supply network configuration and integration are both important, but for different reasons. In particular, lack of external fit triggers the implementation of SCM initiatives. Sequences of SCM initiatives are the result of a series of successive decisional situations, where the external fit and state of supply network configuration and integration vary each time a new SCM initiative is implemented.   Research limitations/implications The research is descriptive. Further research is required to develop a theory on the sequences of SCM improvement initiatives.   Practical implications Managers contemplating the implementation of SCM interventions should consider the current performance conditions for competitiveness and compare them with the measured supply network performances, decide what SCM initiatives should be implemented after considering the current state of the supply network configuration and integration and performance dimensions to be improved, and measure the impact (positive and negative) of the implemented initiatives on supply network performance to evaluate whether or not to implement further initiatives. Moreover, if managers are able to forecast the potential performance trade‐off associated with the implementation of the selected SCM interventions, long‐term improvement programmes encompassing further SCM initiatives over time can be planned to counteract the trade‐off penalty.   Originality/value This study refines current literature on the sequences of improvement in supply networks, by demonstrating that the state of supply network configuration and integration is not enough to explain the decisional process that leads a company to follow a well‐defined sequence.

Current management applies visitor guidelines similar to those developed for Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus. However, unlike these, Humboldt penguins are extremely sensitive to human presence. Breeding success was significantly reduced at frequently visited sites. Heart rate telemetry during disturbance experiments revealed that Humboldt penguins respond more strongly to human presence than do any other penguin species thus far studied. A person passing an incubating penguin at 150m distance already provoked a significant heart rate response. Recovery times were up to half an hour after direct human approach, causing increased energy expenditure without any overt behavioural reaction. Being extraordinary sensitive to human activity with little habituation potential the Humboldt penguin proves to be a difficult focal species for ecotourism. For sustainable ecotourism visitors are required to stay out of sight of Humboldt penguin breeding and moulting areas. Management guidelines need to acknowledge that even closely related species may react very differently towards human presence.","AcknowledgementsFinancial support was provided by FONDECYT 1010250 (to GLJ), Stipendienstiftung University of Kiel, Germany, Deutsche Umwelthilfe and Global Nature Fund (to UE).

We therefore aimed at obtaining a data base of the line and thermal dust emission within equal beamsizes for galaxies in a variety of activity stages. Methods.We have conducted a search for the (1–0) and (2–1) transitions and the continuum emission at 1300 μm towards the centers of 88 galaxies using the IRAM 30 m telescope (MRT) and the Swedish ESO Submillimeter Telescope (SEST). The galaxies are selected to be bright in the far infrared ( Jy) and optically fairly compact (). We have applied optical spectroscopy and IRAS colours to group the galaxies of the entire sample according to their stage of activity into three sub-samples: normal, starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN). The continuum emission has been corrected for line contamination and synchrotron contribution to retrieve the thermal dust emission. For the latter we have determined the radio spectral indices of the individual sources and extrapolated the synchrotron emission corresponding to our millimeter beams to 1300 μm. Results.We present new observational data for the (1–0) and (2-1) transitions and the thermal dust emission at 1300 μm for 88 galaxies.

We present high-resolution optical spectra of U Gem in quiescence taken to test the accuracy to which the HST value can be recovered from optical data. We find that, even with data of very high signal-to-noise ratio on this archetypal system, we cannot recover Long et al.'s value to better than about 20 per cent by any method. Contamination by neighbouring emission lines seems a likely culprit. Our data reveal a number of new features: Doppler tomograms show emission at low velocity, close to the centre of mass, and a transient, narrow absorption feature is seen in the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of eclipse. We suggest that stellar prominences, as previously invoked for the dwarf novae IP Peg and SS Cyg in outburst, may explain both of these features. The He ii 4686.75 Å line emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact region. Two distinct spots are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very narrow and showing a velocity close to that of the accretion disc in the impact region, and the second much broader and located between the velocities of the (ballistic) stream and the (Keplerian) disc. We present tentative evidence of weak spiral structure, which may support explanations for ‘spiral shocks’ based upon three-body effects. We find no evidence of stream–disc overflow in the system. Our data suggest an inclination angle >70°, favouring a mass <1.1 M⊙ for the white dwarf, in disagreement with measurements of its gravitational redshift. The mass donor is clearly seen in the Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles, and mainly on the side facing the white dwarf. This suggests irradiation with shielding by the disc from which we estimate a height-to-radius ratio (H/R) between 0.15 and 0.25.","EUS was supported by PPARC (UK) and Fundación Andes (Chile) under the programme Gemini PPARC–Andes throughout most of this research.

En consecuencia, conocer cuáles son sus rasgos centrales y por qué impactaron de tal manera en sus estudiantes merece ser más investigado como un aporte al campo de estudio sobre la docencia en educación básica. En este marco, el objetivo central de esta investigación empírica ha sido analizar las características del “buen o buena docente” desde la percepción de sujetos egresados de educación secundaria de escuelas públicas y privadas de Lima (Perú). Los resultados de este estudio cualitativo, basado en entrevistas semiestructuradas a ocho estudiantes que han egresado, ha permitido describir, por un lado, los rasgos del buen personal docente en relación a su alumnado, caracterizado por un estilo vinculante expresado en el compromiso con este, en una percepción positiva y actitud motivadora y una calidad afectiva en la interacción profesorado-alumnado; y, por otro lado, rasgos en relación con su profesión como: su pasión por enseñar; su dominio sobre contenidos y la organización de la clase. El estudio concluye que el hecho que todos los egresados y egresadas hayan podido recordar al menos a un profesor o profesora como buen o buena docente revela la heterogeneidad de tipos de docentes que exige superar generalizaciones negativas y que la imagen docente es una construcción colectiva en varias promociones.

Los resultados indican que las tabletas de filiacin tiwanaku representan un bajo porcentaje (17,5%), demostrando que la mayor cantidad de tabletas, contemporneas con el evento tiwanaku (82,5%), no estara relacionada con la entidad altiplnica. Por otro lado, la diversidad de atributos tanto en las representaciones como en los elementos secundarios hace de cada una de las tabletas tiwanaku un ejemplar prcticamente nico, y su distribucin entre los sitios arqueolgicos resulta ser aleatoria; no se visualiza un patrn que refleje coherencia en el manejo espacial de estos artefactos.

A textual context analysis is conducted from sites in which tablets have been recovered; iconographic components are compared between specimens by category and by sites. The chronology is examined and a sequence for these artifacts is defined. The iconography is contrasted wit the care Tiwanaku iconography and mechanisms are discussed as to how the tablets could have come to San Pedro de Atacama. The results indicate that a low percentage (17.5%) of the tablets is affiliated with Tiwanaku demonstrating that the majority of the tablets, contemporary with Tiwanaku (82.5%), were not connected to the altiplano polity. However, the diversity of the attributes in their representations, such as secondary elements, make each one of the Tiwanaku tablets practically unique examples, and the distribution between the archaeological sites turn out to be random. No pattern can be observed that reflects coherence in the spatial management of the artifacts. From this heterogeneity, anarchy, and poor representative nature it can be deduced that the Tiwanaku tablets, besides being foreign imports, do not originate from one single place of origin. These artifacts are brought into local contexts and a significant number of their bearers also exhibit artifacts of status (axes, mallets or metal objects) because these persons display a certain status in the community",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2006-06,2006,2006-06,,38,1,83-111,All OA; Gold,Article,"Llagostera, Agustn","Llagostera, Agustn (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)",,"Llagostera, Agustn (Catholic University of the North)",43,4,,6.61,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v38n1/art08.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026627676,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

Despite this, the ability of second language learners to use metaphors is often still not seen as a core ability. In this paper, we take a model of communicative competence that has been widely influential in both language teaching and language testing, namely Bachman (1990), and argue, giving a range of examples of language use and learner difficulty, that metaphoric competence has in fact an important role to play in all areas of communicative competence. In other words, it can contribute centrally to grammatical competence, textual competence, illocutionary competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence. Metaphor is thus highly relevant to second language learning, teaching and testing, from the earliest to the most advanced stages of learning.","We are grateful to Philip King, Daniel Malt, Rosamund Moon and Sophia Skoufaki for discussing aspects of the paper with us and for commenting so helpfully on the various drafts of it.",,Applied Linguistics,,,,2006-06-01,2006,2006-06,2006-06-01,27,2,268-294,All OA; Green,Article,"Littlemore, Jeannette; Low, Graham","Littlemore, Jeannette (); Low, Graham ()",,"Littlemore, Jeannette (); Low, Graham ()",174,27,,81.97,http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/2919227/Littlemore_-_Metaphoric_competence-_L.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059396633,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

We are interested in topological properties of the global attractor Ωλ,τ of this map. Given ℓ and a Lipschitz function τ, we show that the attractor set Ωλ,τ is homeomorphic to a closed topological annulus for all λ sufficiently close to 1. Moreover, we prove that Ωλ,τ is a Jordan curve for at most finitely many λ∈(0,1).These results rely on a detailed study of iterated “cohomological” equations of the form τ=Lλ1μ1, μ1=Lλ2μ2,…, where Lλμ=μ○mℓ−λμ and mℓ:R/Z→R/Z denotes the multiplication by ℓ map.

The data came from reflection and from wide-angle/refraction experiments acquired within the framework of the Collaborative Research Center SFB267 ‘Deformation Processes in the Andes’. Two areas of differing character and subduction type were investigated: an erosive margin to the north (19–26° S) and an accretionary margin to the south (36–40° S). Results from different seismic models yield three main transects that give an overall impression about the internal structure below the Chilean margin. At the erosive margin, we find that the upper part of the subducting oceanic lithosphere is characterized by a horst-and-graben structure that coincides with the coupling zone between the plates. Strong coupling between oceanic crust and fore-arc in the case of a horst-continent collision is also indicated by plate-parallel faults beneath the lower continental slope, which we interpret as the upper parts of the subduction channel. In this context, the subduction channel represents the downgoing Nazca Plate as well as those portions of the continental crust which moved landward. Low seismic velocities below the coastline also represent parts of the subduction channel and of the hydrofractured base of the upper crust near the plate interface. Between 45 and 60 km depth, a double reflection zone marks the upper and lower boundary of the subducted oceanic crust. Off southern Chile, the ocean bottom is characterized by relatively smooth morphology. In contrast, in the south, the trench is filled with sediments and contains an axial channel (Figs. 7.16 to 7.18) extending in N-S direction along the trench axis within the investigation area. The periodicity of the reflected seismic signal within these sediments correlates with the main glacial cycle during the Quaternary. The recent accretionary wedge is built up from strongly heterogeneous unconsolidated sediments. Frontal accretion takes place within the southern working area except for the region around the Arauco Peninsula, which shows uplift due to basal accretion and antiformal stacking. Below the Coastal Cordillera, the heterogeneity of the modern accretionary wedge and the antiformal stack structure of the Permo-Triassic accretionary wedge complicate imaging at depths greater than about 30 km. Thus, we obtain an image of the top of the subduction channel as a thin reflector segment only to about 25 km depth.",,,Frontiers in Earth Sciences,The Andes,"Onno Oncken, Guillermo Chong, Gerhard Franz, Peter Giese, Hans-Jürgen Götze, Victor A.

The combined effect of extension and a near stationary position of the Jurassic to lower Cretaceous arc favoured the emplacement and preservation of juvenile magmatic rocks on a large vertical and horizontal scale. Chemical and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions of mainly mafic to intermediate volcanic and intrusive rock units coherently indicate the generation of the magmas in a subduction regime and the dominance of a depleted subarc mantle source over contributions of the ambient Palaeozoic crust. The isotopic composition of the Jurassic (206Pb/204Pb: ∼ 18.2; 207Pb/204Pb: ∼ 15.55; 143Nd/144Nd: ∼ 0.51277; 87Sr/86Sr: ∼ 0.703–0.704) and Present (206Pb/204Pb: ∼ 18.5; 207Pb/204Pb: ∼ 15.57; 143Nd/144Nd: ∼ 0.51288; 87Sr/86Sr: ∼ 0.703–0.704) depleted subarc mantle beneath the Central and Southern Andes (18°–40°S) was likely uniform over the entire region. Small differences of isotope ratios between Jurassic and Cenozoic to Recent of subarc mantle-derived could be explained by radiogenic growth in a still uniform mantle source.","We thank Anette Meixner, Rudolf Naumann, Cathrin Schulz, and Christa Wiesenberg for their assistance in the GFZ-Potsdam laboratories; Maren Lewerenz for sample preparation and XRF analysis at TU-Berlin.

This volume will provide its readers with a detailed insight into the new (i.e. post-1994) South African higher education system. The large number of experienced authors and editors involved in the book guarantees that the reader will be introduced in the new SA higher education system from a large number of perspectives that are presented in a consistent and coherent way. This book will be of interest to scholars, students, administrators, policymakers and politicians interested in South Africa, higher education and research, and policy analysis. ""Publications on higher education are not new. But this volume, which is the first of its kind as a collective effort of tracing and examining the twists and turns taken by processes of change in the South African higher education system in a context of profound societal and global transformation, adds a fresh dimension to the debate. In its examination of the extent to which the changes were in line with policy intentions, particularly with regard to equity, democratisation, responsiveness and efficiency, and how a new institutional landscape started emerging, it makes a momentous contribution to the current debate about higher education restructuring."" Njabulo Ndebele, Vice-chancellor, University of Cape Town and Chair of the South African Association of University Vice-chancellors ""This book addresses a rich variety of issues on South African higher education. It puts these in the relevant context of the process of globalization and it shows that the South African experiences offer us a lot to learn.

Frans van Vught, Rector Magnificus and founding Director of the Center for Higher Education Policy Studies, University of Twente, The Netherlands ""Reflection is a crucial ingredient to learning. In this book on higher education we have reflections on a unique period in the history of a country that managed its transition to democracy in a way that was unique, but from which we can all learn. Higher education in South Africa played a vital role in that transition and was part of the many tensions, choices and influences. They have been thoughtfully captured.""

However, they are also sites of recycling and destruction of continental crust. The Andean continental margin has been periodically active at least since the early Paleozoic and allows the evaluation of the long-term relevance of these processes. The early Paleozoic orogeny at ca. 0.5 Ga recycled and homogenized the ∼2 Ga old early Proterozoic crust of the Brazilian Shield, which was previously orogenized at ca. 1 Ga, consistent with global models of prominent crustal growth at 2 Ga and a near constant mass of continental crust in the Phanerozoic. The metamorphic and magmatic evolution and the isotopic signatures of the early Paleozoic rocks do not indicate significant crustal growth, either by accretion of exotic terranes and island arcs or by juvenile additions from a mantle source. The dominant inferred mode of crustal evolution in the Paleozoic was recycling of older crust. Destruction of continental crust by subduction erosion is prominent in sections of the present active margin and is also likely to have occurred in the past orogens. Voluminous juvenile magmatism is only observed in the Jurassic — lower Cretaceous extensional magmatic arc. Compositions of mantle-derived magmas from the early Paleozoic to the Cainozoic, as well as late Cretaceous mantle xenoliths, indicate that depleted mantle was already present beneath the early Paleozoic orogen. The old subcontinental, enriched mantle related to the Brazilian shield and bordering Proterozoic mobile belts was modified by asthenospheric mantle in the younger subduction systems. In summary, this transect of the Andes is not a site of major continental growth, but a site where long-term processes of growth, recycling and destruction balance out.",,,Frontiers in Earth Sciences,The Andes,"Onno Oncken, Guillermo Chong, Gerhard Franz, Peter Giese, Hans-Jürgen Götze, Victor A.

The basin is a post-Incaic feature that developed contemporaneously with the initial plateau uplift. Before 38 Ma, the magmatic arc was positioned in the present-day Precordillera; as a result, the Cretaceous to Eocene sequences that underlie younger SdA sediments were deposited in a proximal back-arc location, where a westward extending arm of the Salta Rift interfered with the magmatic arc.The lithospheric block underlying the SdA area has different physical properties to its surroundings. Strong, positive, isostatic residual gravity anomalies in the SdA area are caused by dense bodies that were magmatically or tectonically emplaced at depths of 10 to 15 km and 4 to 6 km, probably during Cretaceous rift processes. They contrast with gravity minima in the Precordillera and Western Cordillera. Seismic refraction profiles in the SdA lithospheric block show velocities of > 6.5 km s−1 and 7.5 kms−1 at depths of < 10 km and ∼30 km, respectively, but no clear Moho. A crustal thickness of 67 km, obtained from receiver functions, is reported, however Mesozoic and Tertiary structures do not indicate crustal thickening. Seismic tomography shows vp/vs ratios that do not reveal mantle serpentinization, and high vp and high Qp values (> 2000) point to a dense and strong lithosphere down to the plate interface.It is proposed that the SdA lithospheric block which, as part of the Salta Rift system in the pre-Incaic back-arc, had been hotter than the adjacent lithosphere was not cooled sufficiently to be serpentinized after the Incaic Event. Instead, mantle rocks hydrated at 600–800 °C (chlorite lherzolite) fit the measured physical properties. An episode of flat or low-angle subduction from 38 to 28 Ma, that preceded the emplacement of the modern magmatic arc in the Western Cordillera, was probably an important starting condition that allowed these processes to occur. Slab resteepening caused subsidence of the heavy SdA lithospheric block and its contact with the lower plate resisted the westward advancement of the asthenospheric wedge, thus causing the eastwardly convex curvature of the volcanic front around the east side of the SdA Basin.",,,Frontiers in Earth Sciences,The Andes,"Onno Oncken, Guillermo Chong, Gerhard Franz, Peter Giese, Hans-Jürgen Götze, Victor A.

When interpreting these provisions in the Bill of Rights, the Constitution states that international law ‘must be considered’. This refers to binding and non-binding international legal instruments such as the treaties and the General Comments made by the supervisory bodies. This article argues that the courts have an essential role to play in the realisation of international human rights law. Analysis of the judgments of the South African courts shows however that there are flaws in their use and enforcement of international and regional human rights law. Analysis of the courts tend merely to mention some of the applicable international law provisions without considering them in sufficient detail. Binding international law relevant to the rights of children is not given the same attention as non-binding international law. It is argued that the courts have not properly defined the scope and content of children’s socio-economic rights. Recommendations are made as to how the courts could strengthen their role in promoting the socioeconomic rights of children through the considered use and enforcement of international law.",,,South African Journal on Human Rights,,,,2006-01-21,2006,2017-04-07,2006-01-21,22,2,224-260,Closed,Article,"Rosa, Solange; Dutschke, Mira","Rosa, Solange (); Dutschke, Mira ()","Rosa, Solange (); Dutschke, Mira ()","Rosa, Solange (); Dutschke, Mira ()",3,0,,1.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093087581,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4804 Law In Context; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Convergent continental margins combine the majority of processes that affect the internal architecture thermal and geochemical character of continental lith- phere. In addition, the close relationships between active deformation and uplift, m- matism and associated crustal growth, ore formation, the release of more than 90% of global seismic energy at convergent margins, make these plate boundaries imp- tant natural laboratories where mass and energy flux rates can be studied at various scales. Since the advent of plate tectonic theory, it has been recognized that all of these phenomena are intimately related and often governed by feedback mechanisms. Accordingly, subduction orogeny has become an international, high-priority theme in process-oriented, earth-system analysis. In this context, Dewey and Bird (1970) have defined the Andes as the type representative for orogeny and associated p- cessesat convergent margins in their benchmark paper. The Andes, therefore, p- vide an excellent natural laboratory for studying the above processes.",,,Frontiers in Earth Sciences,,"Onno Oncken, Guillermo Chong, Gerhard Franz, Peter Giese, Hans-Jürgen Götze, Victor A.

There is a growing sense that the mechanistic approach to leadership, which has been widely encouraged over the last ten years, is sterile and that a more philosophical approach is now required. This approach is covered here, taking into account the importance of aesthetics on all aspects of the administrative and leadership world: the ways ideas and ideals are created, how their expression is conveyed, the impact they have on interpersonal relationships and the organisational environment that carries and reinforces them and the moral boundaries or limits that can be established or exceeded. While presenting a significant departure from conventional studies in the field, the international contributors reflect a continuity of thought on administrative and leadership authority, from the writings of Plato through to current theory.",,,,,"Eugenie A.

Chapter 1 discusses how the terms auxiliary verb and auxiliary verb construction are understood, and then provides an overview of the kinds of functional categories that AVCs serve to encode. A cursory typology is offered of the patterns of encoding inflectional/morphosyntactic/ functional semantic categories in AVCs, and notions of functional and formal headedness within AVCs are introduced. Five macro-patterns of inflection emerge, each with several sub-patterns. Chapters 2 to 5 are dedicated to the presentation of the varied sub-types of inflectional patterns seen in AVCs. These are called the AUX-headed, LEX-headed, doubled, and the split and split/doubled patterns. Each of these is extensively exemplified. In the final two chapters, various aspects of the diachronic origins of AVCs are discussed. Chapter 6 discusses where AVCs go once they have been grammaticalized, offering a range of complex verb forms that have derived from each of the inflectional macro-patterns of AVCs. Chapter 7 discusses diachronic origins of AVCs. This includes a discussion of both typical lexical source semantics for the grammaticalization paths of individual functional subtypes of AVC as well as the syntactic source construction types for each of the five macro-patterns and some of their more common sub-patterns. These source constructions draw into the discussion of how auxiliary verb constructions fit within the broadest possible typology of complex predicate phenomena. It offers an analysis of not only AVCs, but also such related complex predicate phenomena as serial verb constructions, verb complement structures, coordinate and clause chaining constructions, ‘light’ verbs, etc.",,,,,,,2006-06-08,2006,,2006-06-08,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Anderson, Gregory D.S.","Anderson, Gregory D.S.

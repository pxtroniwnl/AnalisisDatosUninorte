Sobre la base de un anlisis indito de datos provistos por la Agencia Informativa Catlica Argentina (AICA) se analiza la relacin del proceso de creacin de parroquias, capillas y santuarios con la evolucin numrica de los agentes eclesiales que atienden estos lugares de culto. Se vinculan, asimismo, estos aspectos con la evolucin de la poblacin catlica y la de la poblacin general del pas. Se argumenta que la respuesta de la jerarqua eclesistica al creciente distanciamiento institucional de los creyentes fue la de fortalecer su presencia, incrementando sostenidamente sus estructuras territoriales, aun si esta estrategia presiona la capacidad cada vez ms limitada de la Iglesia catlica, especialmente en trminos de sus recursos humanos especializados, para atender estas estructuras. Los resultados permiten matizar la hiptesis de la creciente desinstitucionalizacin religiosa en el campo religioso. Entre las respuestas de la jerarqua eclesistica catlica al creciente distanciamiento de los creyentes de las instituciones religiosas se cuenta la de fortalecer su presencia territorial a travs de una creciente institucionalizacin, medida en trminos de creacin de lugares de culto. Abstract: This article analyzes the creation of territorial ecclesiastic structures of the Catholic Church in Argentina since the mid-20th century. Based on an unprecedented analysis of data provided by the Argentine Catholic Information Agency (Agencia Informativa Catlica Argentina, AICA), the authors analyze the process of creating parishes, chapels and sanctuaries and its relationship with the evolution of the number of ecclesiastic agents who serve in these places of worship. They also link these aspects to the evolution of the Catholic population and the country’s general population. The authors argue that the response of the ecclesiastic hierarchy to the growing institutional distancing of believers was to strengthen their presence. This resulted in a sustained increase in its territorial structures, even though this strategy places pressure on the increasingly limited capacity of the Catholic Church to provide services for these structures, particularly in regard to specialized human resources. The results contribute to a nuanced hypothesis regarding the growing religious desinstitutionalization in the field of religion. The responses of the Catholic ecclesiastic hierarchy to the growing distancing of believers from religious institutions include strengthening its territorial presence through growing institutionalization measured in terms of the creation of places of worship.",,,Cultura y religión,,,,2021-12-31,2021,2021-12-31,,15,2,67-105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Suárez, Ana Lourdes; Olszanowski, Martín","Suárez, Ana Lourdes (); Olszanowski, Martín ()",,"Suárez, Ana Lourdes (); Olszanowski, Martín ()",5,3,,1.83,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/cultrelig/v15n2/0718-4727-cultrelig-15-02-67.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145058754,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society,

In extending the concepts of the MPSP, the automated mine may now be regarded as a hierarchical intelligent agent in which the bottom layer consists of distributed robotic equipment, while strategic functionality occupies the higher layers. Here we present a disambiguation of artificial intelligence, machine learning, computational optimization, and automation within the mining context. Specifically, the Q-learning algorithm has been adapted to generate the initial solutions for a high-performing strategic mine planning algorithm, originally developed by Lamghari, Dimitrakopoulos and Ferland, based on the variable neighbourhood descent (VND) metaheuristic. The hierarchical intelligent agent is presented as an integrative conceptual platform, defining the interaction between our new Q-learning adaptation and Lamghari's VND, and potentially other hierarchically controlled components of an artificially intelligent mine, having various degrees of automation.

182,pub.1144381789,10.3390/agriculture12010048,,,Supporting the Bidding Decisions of Smallholder Farmers in Public Calls in Brazil,"In Brazil, the National School Feeding Program (PNAE) seeks to contribute to the socio-economic development of smallholder farmers, prioritizing them in supplying their products for preparing daily meals in public schools. However, farmers face challenges in determining which school calls to bid for and the potential benefits from their participation, due to the multiple quantitative and qualitative decision criteria involved. This paper presents a novel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based method for bidding priority setting, to support the decision making. The model was applied for a case study in Brazil. The academic contribution lies in the innovation of using a Double-Frontier Slack-Based Measure (SBM) DEA model for Hierarchical Network systems, i.e., applied to multiple levels and followed by a tie-breaking method. The practical contribution lies in the decision support of farmers by presenting the results at three levels, the first of which is a ranking by the town or urban cluster priority, the second by the school, and the third by the products. Thus, using the rankings of calls, farmers can make informed decisions regarding the feasibility of bidding for each PNAE public call. At the same time, the objective rankings can alleviate friction and conflict within co-operatives during the decision-making process.","The contribution of Paulo Nocera Alves Junior (the corresponding author) includes work done both at the São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos/SP, Brazil, and Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Coquimbo, Chile.

However, it is important to assess differences between urban and rural areas. This study aimed to analyze the associations between the risk of developing T2D and setting in the Colombian north coast in 2017.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1,005 subjects. Data was collected by interviewing self-identified members of an urban community and a rural-indigenous population. The interaction terms were evaluated as well as the confounders. Then, adjusted binary logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).
RESULTS: subjects with a high risk of T2D are more likely to belong to the urban setting (OR = 1.908; 95%CI = 1.201-2.01) compared with those with lower T2D after adjusting for age, Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity, history of high levels of glycemia, and diabetes in relatives.

Patient-related data included age, gender, first dental visit, tooth brushing frequency, number of remaining teeth, and previous endodontic treatment, and tooth-related information regarding number, type, and location in the mouth of teeth that need RCT, waiting time for the endodontic treatment, endodontic diagnosis, pain report, and dental crown condition was collected for each participant. Bivariate analysis (Chi-square test; p < 0.05) associated gender and tooth/patient-related conditions. Poisson regression analysis compared multiple endodontic need and exposure variables.
RESULTS: Patients were mainly comprised of women (65.2%), aged 18-39 years (69.6%). Previous RCT was significantly more prevalent in women when compared to men (p=0.005). First dental visit at later moment (after 20 years of age) demonstrated 400% greater prevalence of multiple RCT demand when compared to patients that attended the dental office at age below seven years (p=0.032). Most of the patients presented only one tooth needing RCT (80.2%), mainly premolars (44.9%). Interestingly, women underwent more RCT in maxillary teeth (p=0.016) and significantly contributed with their report to the diagnosis process when compared to men (p=0.014). Regarding dental crown condition, 45.4% of all teeth registered unsatisfactory restorations, which were more pronounced in female patients (p=0.018). Unsatisfactory restorations or dental caries had 75% and 82%, respectively, less prevalence of multiple RCT indication when compared to sound dental crown (p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: RCT was undertaken more frequently in young female adults' premolars presenting unsatisfactory restorations. First dental visit, number of teeth with previous endodontic treatment, tooth group, and dental crown condition were significantly associated with the necessity of multiple endodontic treatments.",,,International Journal of Dentistry,,Javier Martin,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2021-12-30,2021,,7973356,All OA; Gold,Article,"Albuquerque, Maria Tereza Pedrosa; Abreu, Lorena Caetano; Martim, Leticia; Münchow, Eliseu Aldrighi; Nagata, Juliana Yuri","Albuquerque, Maria Tereza Pedrosa (Department of Clinical Dentistry Endodontics, Federal University of Bahia, Av.

Material and methods: Qualitative study from the focused ethnography perspective that included pregnant women over the age of 18 years, with overweight or obesity or excess weight gain during pregnancy, who attended the pre-natal care program at two public healthcare institutions belonging to the government-subsidized regime under the General Social Security System in two municipalities of the Department of Antioquia (Colombia). Thirteen individual semi-structured and three group interviews were carried out. Analysis was based on triangulation and open and axial coding.
Results: Overall, 22 pregnant women participated in the study. Five determinants of eating behavior in this population were found: low socioeconomic level that limits access to a variety of foods, social support network, health condition during previous pregnancies or during the current gestation, generic dietary and nutritional recommendations provided by healthcare staff and, finally, knowledge of the participants regarding diet and the implications of maternal overweight for the health of the mother and the child.
Conclusion: It is imperative to provide dietary and nutritional education and care based on the particular characteristics that influence the adoption of changes in eating behaviors among overweight pregnant women; prenatal care professionals must be trained to promote standardized criteria and care that is tailored to the social reality of the pregnant woman.","A las mujeres gestantes y el personal de salud que participaron en la investigación.

The objective of this review is to evaluate recent findings on the use of RSM in the extraction of compounds from agri-food products. First, the steps for the application of RSM were briefly detailed. According to the analysis performed, RSM is suitable because it evaluates the effects of the independent variables and their interactions on the responses, which is ideal for the optimization of different techniques for the extraction of multiple bioactive compounds and therefore, in the various studies, has allowed to significantly increase the yield and even the biological activities of the extracts; however, RSM has limitations and considering the complexity and dynamics of foods, the challenge is much greater. In this sense, it was determined that simultaneous use with other techniques is necessary in order to optimally describe the process and obtain more accurate results.",,,Current Research in Nutrition and Food Science Journal,,,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2021-12-31,9,3,745-754,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tirado-Kulieva, Vicente Amirpasha; Sánchez-Chero, Manuel; Yarlequé, Mario Villegas; Villegas Aguilar, Gretell Fiorela; Carrión-Barco, Gilberto; Ygnacio Santa Cruz, Abraham Guillermo; Sánchez-Chero, José","Tirado-Kulieva, Vicente Amirpasha (1Facultad de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.); Sánchez-Chero, Manuel (1Facultad de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.); Yarlequé, Mario Villegas (2Facultad de Ingeniería Económica, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.); Villegas Aguilar, Gretell Fiorela (3Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú.); Carrión-Barco, Gilberto (4Carrera de Ingeniería de Sistemas e Informática, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Chiclayo, Peru.); Ygnacio Santa Cruz, Abraham Guillermo (5Escuela Profesional de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru.); Sánchez-Chero, José (2Facultad de Ingeniería Económica, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.)",,"Tirado-Kulieva, Vicente Amirpasha (Universidad Nacional de Frontera); Sánchez-Chero, Manuel (Universidad Nacional de Frontera); Yarlequé, Mario Villegas (Universidad Nacional de Frontera); Villegas Aguilar, Gretell Fiorela (Private University of the North); Carrión-Barco, Gilberto (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Ygnacio Santa Cruz, Abraham Guillermo (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo); Sánchez-Chero, José (Universidad Nacional de Frontera)",18,14,,3.13,https://doi.org/10.12944/crnfsj.9.3.03,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144091232,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering",

Λ is said to be realizable if it is the spectrum of an entrywise nonnegative matrix. Λ is universally realizable if it is realizable for each possible Jordan canonical form allowed by Λ. Minc ([21],1981) showed that if Λ is diagonalizably positively realizable, then Λ is universally realizable. The positivity condition is essential for the proof of Minc, and the question whether the result holds for nonnegative realizations has been open for almost forty years. Recently, two extensions of the Minc’s result have been proved in ([5], 2018) and ([12], 2020). In this work we characterize new left half-plane lists (λ 1 > 0, Re λ  i  ≤ 0, i = 2, . . ., n ) no positively realizable, which are universally realizable. We also show new criteria which allow to decide about the universal realizability of more general lists, extending in this way some previous results.",,,Special Matrices,,,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2022-01-01,10,1,180-192,All OA; Gold,Article,"Soto, Ricardo L.","Soto, Ricardo L.

Days on which the phenomenon known as Santa Ana winds occurs were identified based on the corresponding criteria of wind speed (≥4.5 m/s) and wind direction (between 0° and 90°). Subsequently, the time series was formed with data representing the days on which this phenomenon occurs in each of the analyzed weather stations. A time series was additionally formed from the days in which the Santa Ana winds condition does not occur. Hurst exponents and fractal dimension were estimated applying the rescaled range method to characterize the established time series in terms of characteristics of persistence, anti-persistence, or randomness along with the calculation of the climate predictability Index. This enabled the behavior and correlation analysis of the meteorological variables associated with Santa Ana winds occurrence. Finally, this type of research study is instrumental in understanding the regional dynamics of the climate in the basin, and allows us to establish a basis for developing models that can forecast the days of occurrence of the Santa Ana winds, in such a way that actions or measures can be taken to mitigate the negative consequences generated when said phenomenon occurs, such as fires and droughts.",,"This research was funded by HIDRUS S.A de C.V, Grupo HIDRUS S.A.S and Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Campus Montería; the APC was funded by HIDRUS S.A de C.V and Grupo HIDRUS S.A.S.",Atmosphere,,,,2021-12-28,2021,2021-12-28,,13,1,48,All OA; Gold,Article,"Serpa-Usta, Yeraldin; López-Lambraño, Alvaro Alberto; Flores, Dora-Luz; Gámez-Balmaceda, Ena; Martínez-Acosta, Luisa; Medrano-Barboza, Juan Pablo; López, John Freddy Remolina; López-Ramos, Alvaro; López-Lambraño, Mariangela","Serpa-Usta, Yeraldin (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada 22860, Mexico;, yeraldin.serpa@uabc.edu.mx, (Y.S.-U.);, dflores@uabc.edu.mx, (D.-L.F.)); López-Lambraño, Alvaro Alberto (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada 22860, Mexico;, yeraldin.serpa@uabc.edu.mx, (Y.S.-U.);, dflores@uabc.edu.mx, (D.-L.F.); Hidrus S.A. de C.V., Ensenada 22760, Mexico;, enagamez@hidrusmx.com; Grupo Hidrus S.A.S., Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia); Flores, Dora-Luz (Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Design, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada 22860, Mexico;, yeraldin.serpa@uabc.edu.mx, (Y.S.-U.);, dflores@uabc.edu.mx, (D.-L.F.)); Gámez-Balmaceda, Ena (Hidrus S.A. de C.V., Ensenada 22760, Mexico;, enagamez@hidrusmx.com; Grupo Hidrus S.A.S., Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia); Martínez-Acosta, Luisa (GICA Group, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Campus Monteria, Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia;, luisa.martinez@upb.edu.co, (L.M.-A.);, juan.medrano@upb.edu.co, (J.P.M.-B.);, alvaro.lopezr@upb.edu.co, (A.L.-R.)); Medrano-Barboza, Juan Pablo (GICA Group, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Campus Monteria, Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia;, luisa.martinez@upb.edu.co, (L.M.-A.);, juan.medrano@upb.edu.co, (J.P.M.-B.);, alvaro.lopezr@upb.edu.co, (A.L.-R.)); López, John Freddy Remolina (ITEM Group, Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Campus Monteria, Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia;, john.remolina@upb.edu.co); López-Ramos, Alvaro (GICA Group, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Campus Monteria, Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia;, luisa.martinez@upb.edu.co, (L.M.-A.);, juan.medrano@upb.edu.co, (J.P.M.-B.);, alvaro.lopezr@upb.edu.co, (A.L.-R.)); López-Lambraño, Mariangela (Business School, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Atlantico, Colombia;, mlambrano@uninorte.edu.co)","López-Lambraño, Alvaro Alberto (Autonomous University of Baja California; Hidrus S.A. de C.V., Ensenada 22760, Mexico;, enagamez@hidrusmx.com; Grupo Hidrus S.A.S., Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia)","Serpa-Usta, Yeraldin (Autonomous University of Baja California); López-Lambraño, Alvaro Alberto (Autonomous University of Baja California; Hidrus S.A. de C.V., Ensenada 22760, Mexico;, enagamez@hidrusmx.com; Grupo Hidrus S.A.S., Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia); Flores, Dora-Luz (Autonomous University of Baja California); Gámez-Balmaceda, Ena (Hidrus S.A. de C.V., Ensenada 22760, Mexico;, enagamez@hidrusmx.com; Grupo Hidrus S.A.S., Monteria 230002, Cordoba, Colombia); Martínez-Acosta, Luisa (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Medrano-Barboza, Juan Pablo (Pontifical Bolivarian University); López, John Freddy Remolina (Pontifical Bolivarian University); López-Ramos, Alvaro (Pontifical Bolivarian University); López-Lambraño, Mariangela (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,0.52,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/1/48/pdf?version=1640843669,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144278159,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences,13 Climate Action

Mortality scores are important as they can help health care professionals to plan treatment as per the patients' condition for proper resource allocation. When it comes to patients, it provides invaluable information for implementing advance directives. The aim of the study is to validate mortality scores for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methodology This was a retrospective cohort study that included data from three tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Data of patients diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 infection and hospitalized in Ziauddin Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, and Liaquat National Hospital were enrolled in the study from November 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. Data was extracted from the hospital management information system (HMIS) using a structured questionnaire. Results Overall, 835 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients was 53.29 (SD ± 15.17) years, and 675 patients (80.72%) were males.

In Pakistan, the concept becomes even more foreign and muddled with certain stubborn biases which needs to be accessed. Therefore, we conducted a study to identify the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with behaviors regarding health and general well-being. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural health centers (RHCs) of five districts of Sindh, Pakistan, from October 2020 to December 2020. A survey questionnaire was designed to collect data on socio-economic and demographic factors and their impacts on behavior towards health and general well-being. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA Version 16.0. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the extent of association between predictor variables and outcome variables. Results: A total of 969 respondents participated in the study. The mean age of the respondents was 35.70 (±13.17) years. Majority of the participants (82.77%) had limited access to the required health care facility and only (3.61%) of respondents reported that they regularly consult with disease specialists. Multivariable logistic regression revealed the ability to bear disease expenses (OR=0.55, p=0.009), level of education (OR=1.81, p=0.026), female gender (OR=0.30, p=0.048), access to required health facilities (OR=0.58, p=0.012) were significantly associated with positive behavior towards health and general well-being. Conclusions: The study shows that ease of access to healthcare facilities would encourage the population to seek more healthy behaviors. Resources for promoting healthy lifestyle choices in the general population should be more comprehensive for encompassing cognitive beliefs that target psychological and physical health outcomes.",,,International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health,,,,2021-12-27,2021,2021-12-27,,9,1,93-99,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sarfaraz, Maria Binte; Shazad, Amir; Naeem, Mustafa; Barkat, Rahil; Narawish, Chutimon; Caprilesez, Camilo Andres Avendano","Sarfaraz, Maria Binte (Physiology Department, National University of Medical Science, Rawalpindi, Pakistan); Shazad, Amir (St. George’s University school of medicine, True Blue, Grenada); Naeem, Mustafa (Medical College, Liaquat National Hospital & Medical College, Karachi Pakistan); Barkat, Rahil (Indus Hospital Research Center, Indus Hospital & Health Network, Karachi Pakistan); Narawish, Chutimon (International College, Rangsit University, Lak Hok.

This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of moderate-intensity and high-intensity statins in controlling low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after ACS.
METHODOLOGY: A randomized control trial was conducted at the Cardiology Department of Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from July 2020 to September 2021. During admission, patients were either started on a high-intensity statin dose (rosuvastatin 20 mg) or moderate-intensity statin (rosuvastatin 10 mg) by a computer-generated allocation sequence. Patients were followed-up in the outpatient department (OPD) after 3 months, and a lipid profile at follow-up was obtained. The percentage of LDL change was determined on 3 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 590 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of all participants enrolled, 334 (80.48%) completed the 3-month follow-up. The mean age of participants was 58.08 (+12.06) years. High-intensity statin therapy is positively associated with positive LDL change (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.45, P-value=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our data implies that high-intensity statin medication may be an initial therapeutic option to decrease LDL. However, future randomized clinical trials should corroborate these findings.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-12-26,2021,2021-12-26,2021-12-26,13,12,e20710,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rupasinghe, Chamithra D.; Kantas, Theodosios; Sani, Rohail; Capriles, Natalia M.

The influence of the processing parameters on the physical, microstructural, and mechanical properties was investigated. The bimodal microstructure was achieved from the blends of powder particles with different sizes, while the porous structure was obtained using the space-holder technique (50 vol.% of ammonium bicarbonate). Mechanically milled powders (10 and 20 h) were mixed in 50 wt.% or 75 wt.% with c.p. titanium. Four different mixtures of powders were precompacted via uniaxial cold pressing at 400 MPa. Then, the specimens were sintered at 750 °C via hot pressing in an argon gas atmosphere. The presence of a bimodal microstructure, comprised of small-grain regions separated by coarse-grain ones, was confirmed by optical and scanning electron microscopies. The samples with a bimodal microstructure exhibited an increase in the porosity compared with the commercially available pure Ti. In addition, the hardness was increased while the Young's modulus was decreased in the specimens with 75 wt.% of the milled powders (20 h).","The authors thank the laboratory technicians Jesus Pinto at Universidad de Sevilla (Spain), Claudio Aravena and Gabriel Cornejo at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (Chile) for their support carrying out the microstructure characterization and mechanical testing.","This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of Chile government [grant number Fondecyt 11160865, and FONDEQUIP EQM130103 and EQM150101, and Scholarship Program/DOCTORADO/2021-21211274], and the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain under the grant PID2019-109371GB-I00.",Materials,,Javier Gil,,2021-12-25,2021,2021-12-25,,15,1,136,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chávez-Vásconez, Ricardo; Lascano, Sheila; Sauceda, Sergio; Reyes-Valenzuela, Mauricio; Salvo, Christopher; Mangalaraja, Ramalinga Viswanathan; Gotor, Francisco José; Arévalo, Cristina; Torres, Yadir","Chávez-Vásconez, Ricardo (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Lascano, Sheila (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Sauceda, Sergio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Reyes-Valenzuela, Mauricio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Salvo, Christopher (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Bío-Bío, Avda.

In this framework, the research aimed to assess the mediating effect of ethnic identity and collective self-esteem on the inverse relationship between mental health problems and quality of life. Data were collected from 908 first-generation Colombian migrants living in Chile, of whom 50.2% were women and with an average age of 35 years. They were assessed with The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQoL)-Bref, Smith's ethnic identity questionnaire, Basabe's collective self-esteem, and Beck's Anxiety and Depression questionnaires. The results provide evidence that both collective self-esteem and ethnic identity exert a partial mediation effect on the relationship between anxiety and depression on quality of life. The study provides evidence of the protective role that the maintenance and reinforcement of ethnic identity and collective self-esteem can have, with a view to strengthening the planning of interventions both in the field of prevention of mental health problems and in the improvement of quality of life based on evidence.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Aristomenis Exadaktylos, Paul B.

At least 74 specimens were obtained of which 24 survived the capture and transport processes. Fish were stocked in a recirculating land-based aquaculture system, and at 14 months under captivity, fish began spawning. Eggs were collected, to describe some stages of development, and were placed in incubators at 20 °C and on the third-day eggs hatched. Larvae reached a total length between 1.435 and 1.7 mm, which were accurately characterized during their first morphological changes.

However, little is stated regarding its specific prevalence in the academic area. The present study seeks to define the prevalence of burnout in teachers and students as presented in the literature. A systematic review is conducted to research the prevalence of the burnout syndrome and its dimensions on the education sector, regarding both teachers and students. 1547 unique references were found, within which 59 reported information on the prevalence of the burnout syndrome in the population of interest. The proportion of high levels of each dimension showed to be higher in students than in teachers. However, the prevalence of the syndrome itself showed opposite results, being more frequent in teachers (Median = 19.8%) than in students (Median = 14.4%). Burnout research is affected by some limitations; particularly, regarding the use of psychometric instruments and cut-off points. Nevertheless, its high prevalence on both teachers and students are enough evidence to further research into its consequences in this specific sector.",,,Revista de Investigación en Psicología,,,,2021-12-23,2021,2021-12-23,,24,2,163-182,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vessoni, Rosana Aurora Choy; Molinari, Diego Eduardo Prieto","Vessoni, Rosana Aurora Choy (Universidad de Lima, Facultad de Psicología, Perú); Molinari, Diego Eduardo Prieto (Universidad de Lima, Facultad de Psicología, Perú)",,"Vessoni, Rosana Aurora Choy (University of Lima); Molinari, Diego Eduardo Prieto (University of Lima)",2,2,,1.83,https://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/psico/article/download/21507/17465,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144717230,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

271,pub.1144155468,10.3390/math10010044,,,A Combined Interval Type-2 Fuzzy MCDM Framework for the Resilient Supplier Selection Problem,"Selecting the most resilient supplier is a crucial problem for organizations and managers in the supply chain. However, due to the inherited high degree of uncertainty in real-life projects, developing a decision-making framework in a crisp or fuzzy environment may not present accurate or reliable results for the managers. For this reason, it is better to evaluate the potential suppliers in an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy (IT2F) environment for better dealing with this ambiguity. This study developed an improved combined IT2F Best Worst Method (BWM) and IT2F technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model “Atieh Sazan” Co. as a case study, such that the IT2FBWM was employed for obtaining the weight of criteria. The IT2FTOPSIS was utilized for ranking the potential suppliers based on Hamming distance measure. In both phases, the opinions of experts as IT2F linguistic terms were employed for weighting the criteria and obtaining the relative importance of the alternatives in terms of the evaluative criteria. After obtaining the final results, the proposed model was validated by replacing Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) approaches separately instead of BWM for weighting the criteria. After executing both new models, it was found that the final ranking was similar to the final ranking of the proposed model, representing the reliability and accuracy of the obtained results. Moreover, it was concluded that the resilient criteria of “Reorganization” and “Redundancy” are the most determinant measures for selecting the best supplier rather than measures in the Iranian Construction Industry.",,This research received no external funding.,Mathematics,,,,2021-12-23,2021,2021-12-23,,10,1,44,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hoseini, Seyed Amirali; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Skačkauskas, Paulius; Fallahpour, Alireza; Saberi, Sara","Hoseini, Seyed Amirali (Department of Industrial Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran 13114-16846, Iran;, amirali.hoseiny1989@gmail.com); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1240000, Chile); Skačkauskas, Paulius (Department of Mobile Machinery and Railway Transport, Faculty of Transport Engineering, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, 10105 Vilnius, Lithuania;, paulius.skackauskas@vilniustech.lt); Fallahpour, Alireza (School of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai 81310, Malaysia;, fallahpour.a@utm.my); Saberi, Sara (Robert A.

Data were collected from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (NDIS). 17,056 snakebites were recorded in Amazonas between 2007 and 2017. During the study period, the Rio Negro and Tefé micro-regions had the highest accumulated incidence, while small municipalities such as São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Uarini and Alvarães presenting a high incidence rate during the same period. Snakes in the genera Bothrops and Lachesis caused 69.5% and 20.3% snakebites. Snakebites occurred more frequently in the Amazonian winter, between January and April, and most of the snakebite victims (78.6%) were men. The most affected individuals were between 20 and 39 years of age (59.4%). The time elapsed between snakebites and medical assistance varied from one to six hours (51.4%). 7,705 of the snakebite cases, were classified as moderate, 7,328 as mild, and 1,299 as severe. Of the 104 deaths that occurred in the period, Bothrops genus caused the highest mortality (68.3%). The State of Amazonas recorded both high numbers of snakebites in the period 2007-2017 and the time elapsed between snakebite and medical assistance, which may affect the clinical status of patients.

The prosthesis is used so that the amputee can adapt to their condition and rejoin their daily activities, its use occurs after the alignment of the prosthesis. The alignment tends to be a subjective process, where knowledge and practice are essential at the time of carrying it out; there are no systems that allow knowing the affectation of the alignment on biomechanical variables of the amputee. For this reason, it was proposed to create a neural network that shows the incidence of the angular variation of the socket of the prosthesis in joint ranges, the distribution of body weight and the center of pressure. Method: A descriptive study was carried out where the socket of the prosthesis of a transtibial amputee was placed in seven different angular positions, in each position biomechanical parameters were measured, with these data a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) was programmed to predict data biomechanics from the socket location and a graphical interface was generated to view the parameter changes. Results: The neural network allowed predicting the behavior of the hip, knee and ankle angles, the location of the pressure center and the body weight supported both ipsilaterally (amputee) and contralaterally (non amputee); and in the graphical interface the affectation could be shown. Conclusion: The use of technological tools allows the construction of support systems for medical personnel, in this case the prosthetist, to improve the rehabilitation process of a person with a transtibial prosthesis.",,,Movimiento Científico,,,,2021-12-22,2021,2021-12-22,,15,1,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Luengas-C., Lely A.; Wanumen, Luis Felipe; Casallas, Esperanza Camargo","Luengas-C., Lely A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: This was a retrospective cohort, that used information collected from clinical records and official epidemiological surveillance systems (NOTIWEB, SISCOVID and SINADEF), on hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Information was collected on sociodemographic and clinical factors, considering discharge (death/survival) and days of hospitalization as outcomes.
RESULTS.: The in-hospital fatality rate was 39.6%, and significant differences were found between hospitalization time and status at discharge in people over 60 years of age (p<0.001). Age older than 60 years (HR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.76-4.68),) unattended ICU bed request (HR: 3.49; 95% CI: 2.02-6.05), oxygen saturation less than 80% at admission (HR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.35-5.53) and the use of ivermectin (HR: 1.68; 95%CI 1.06-2.68) were factors associated with lethality. The chosen ML model considered that the most important variables were oxygen saturation, age over 60 years, time of hospitalization and time of the onset of symptoms.
CONCLUSION.: The factors that could increase lethality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were age, oxygen saturation less than 80%, use of ivermectin as part of hospital treatment and unattended request for ICU beds. Future studies with better representativeness could confirm these possible relationships at the regional or national level.",,,Revista Peruana de Medicina Experimental y Salud Pública,,,Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Ivermectin; Middle Aged; Peru; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2,2021-12-22,2021,2021-12-22,2021,38,4,501-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anyaypoma-Ocón, Walter; Vásquez, Sandra Ñuflo; Bustamante-Chávez, Hugo Cesar; Sedano-De la Cruz, Edyson; Zavaleta-Gavidia, Víctor; Angulo-Bazán, Yolanda","Anyaypoma-Ocón, Walter (Oficina de Epidemiología.

Through the application of the transformative sequential design with a mixed approach, a sample of 80 students from the secondary level of a private educational institution in the municipality of Galapa-Colombia was selected, who when reading three texts related to electromagnetism on the screen of the Eye tracker T.120 and with the use of the Tobii.3.4.6 software, allowed to demonstrate that readings for less and higher than expected according to some characters and number of fixations affect textual comprehension. These results allow us to confront from the teaching practice different positions on the incursion of these variables in the reading processes. For example, teachers generally focus on developing criticism and try, at all costs, to develop processes of intertextuality in the student body, leaving aside the other levels, which are essential to achieve the final product. However, in this case the order of the factors would alter the result, since velis nolis must carry out a cycle and specific procedures to achieve the objectives set. Finally, it is concluded that visual fixations play a main role in obtaining the understanding of a text and therefore, as a prospective, the design of a didactic proposal is proposed that takes science and image as a reference in order to seek adequate understanding on the part of the reader.",,,Alteridad,,,,2021-12-21,2021,2021-12-21,,17,1,126-137,All OA; Gold,Article,"Padilla-Berdugo, Rodolfo Antonio; Amador-López, Jorge Alberto; Olivo-Franco, José Luis","Padilla-Berdugo, Rodolfo Antonio (Institución Educativa María Auxiliadora de Galapa); Amador-López, Jorge Alberto (Fundación Centro Educativo Mixto de Galapa); Olivo-Franco, José Luis (Institución Educativa Técnica Agrícola Juan Domínguez Romero de Caracolí)",,"Padilla-Berdugo, Rodolfo Antonio (Institución Educativa María Auxiliadora de Galapa); Amador-López, Jorge Alberto (Fundación Centro Educativo Mixto de Galapa); Olivo-Franco, José Luis (Institución Educativa Técnica Agrícola Juan Domínguez Romero de Caracolí)",1,1,,0.92,https://alteridad.ups.edu.ec/index.php/alteridad/article/download/1.2022.10/5173,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144050420,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

GO2DAT will combine data from the coastal and open ocean, as measured by the chemical Winkler titration method or by sensors (e.g., optodes, electrodes) from Eulerian and Lagrangian platforms (e.g., ships, moorings, profiling floats, gliders, ships of opportunities, marine mammals, cabled observatories). GO2DAT will further adopt a community-agreed, fully documented metadata format and a consistent quality control (QC) procedure and quality flagging (QF) system. GO2DAT will serve to support the development of advanced data analysis and biogeochemical models for improving our mapping, understanding and forecasting capabilities for ocean O2 changes and deoxygenation trends. It will offer the opportunity to develop quality-controlled data synthesis products with unprecedented spatial (vertical and horizontal) and temporal (sub-seasonal to multi-decadal) resolution. These products will support model assessment, improvement and evaluation as well as the development of climate and ocean health indicators. They will further support the decision-making processes associated with the emerging blue economy, the conservation of marine resources and their associated ecosystem services and the development of management tools required by a diverse community of users (e.g., environmental agencies, aquaculture, and fishing sectors). A better knowledge base of the spatial and temporal variations of marine O2 will improve our understanding of the ocean O2 budget, and allow better quantification of the Earth’s carbon and heat budgets. With the ever-increasing need to protect and sustainably manage ocean services, GO2DAT will allow scientists to fully harness the increasing volumes of O2 data already delivered by the expanding global ocean observing system and enable smooth incorporation of much higher quantities of data from autonomous platforms in the open ocean and coastal areas into comprehensive data products in the years to come. This paper aims at engaging the community (e.g., scientists, data managers, policy makers, service users) toward the development of GO2DAT within the framework of the UN Global Ocean Oxygen Decade (GOOD) program recently endorsed by IOC-UNESCO. A roadmap toward GO2DAT is proposed highlighting the efforts needed (e.g., in terms of human resources).","This manuscript has been produced as an outcome of a 2-day workshop organized in Sopot in November 2019 by the IOC-UNESCO Global Ocean Oxygen Network (GO2NE) and sponsored by IOC-UNESCO, the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project (IOCCP), U.S. NOAA and German SFB754 and of a 2-day virtual workshop in November 2020.","All authors would like to thank IOC-UNESCO, International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project (IOCCP), NOAA, and the German SFB754.

The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) was used to detect participants at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals CI).ResultsModerate or extreme problems appeared more frequently in the dimensions of Pain/Discomfort (60.8%) and Anxiety/Depression (30.8%). The mean score of the EQ-VAS was 74.3 (± 17.3), significantly larger in the state of complete health (11111) compared with those with problems in more than one of the quality-of-life dimensions. Being female and living in Bogota D.C., were associated with greater odds of reporting problems in the Pain (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.2) and Discomfort dimensions (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.0) respectively and Anxiety/Depression (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3–2.7), (OR 9.1; 95% CI 6.6–12.4), respectively.ConclusionsAs living place and sex were associated with dimensions of Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression in the HRQoL in people at risk of T2D, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQoL to design and reorient strategies with a territorial and gender perspective to achieve better health outcomes.Plain English summaryDiabetes is one of the four non-communicable diseases with increasing prevalence in the world, which has made it a serious public health problem. In Colombia, in 2019 diabetes affected 8.4% of the Colombian adult population and more than one million Colombian adults of this age group have hidden or undetected diabetes. This disease is not only characterized by increased premature mortality, loss of productivity, and economic impact, but it also involves a deterioration in the quality of life of people with diabetes with their respective families. However, very Little is known about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a population at risk or with prediabetes. This study has evaluated the quality of life in patients at risk of diabetes and their behavior with some variables as sociodemographic, lifestyle, history, and established their difference in two territories of the Colombian Caribbean. The results of this study indicate that the HRQoL of people at risk of type 2 diabetes is affected by factors such as gender, city, dysglycemia, medication for hypertension and education level. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQL to design and implement strategies that reduce this risk of developing type 2 diabetes, prevent prediabetes and improve the quality of life in prediabetic or diabetic patients.",Not applicable.,"FundingThis project was financed by the Colombian National Program for Science, Technology, and Health Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) in line with the theme focused on chronic non-transmutable diseases.

In this way, this essay addresses teacher training as a structural reference for the development and positioning of education. Likewise, it considers that an interdisciplinary and binding practice requires a teaching paradigmatic rupture, with the capacity to unlearn and undertake transformative actions, through multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary dialogues. The document is made up of four sections: in the first one, relationships and connections are analyzed from uncertainty as a way of rethinking teacher training; in the second part, we move between certainty and uncertainty in a review of thinkers on a path between paradigms; thirdly, we work on the dialogical, epistemological and gnoseological relationship of teacher training; finally, we advance in the understanding of emerging knowledge in the context of a new teacher training.

Desde un enfoque crítico-interpretativo, la pesquisa se desarrolló en dos fases: en la primera se realizó un análisis textual de 559 noticias digitales publicadas sobre el tema; en un segundo momento, los datos obtenidos se confrontaron con las y los 45 protagonistas de las noticias a través de entrevistas semiestructuradas. Se constató que la mayoría de las y los atletas carecen de conocimiento y adopción del modelo progresista de representación mediática de la discapacidad, por lo que valoran los discursos mediáticos supercrip con los que son representados como héroes o modelos de inspiración, no por sus logros deportivos, sino por su capacidad de superación “a pesar” de la discapacidad. Se concluye que, en la medida en que los medios digitales los muestran como atletas, especialmente que inspiran a otras personas con y sin discapacidad, incrementan las posibilidades de que estos deportistas desarrollen una autoidentidad mediática. En tal sentido, a partir de la valoración positiva o negativa de determinados elementos de las noticias, los deportistas se sintieron o no autoidentificados mediáticamente de manera impuesta, asumida, negociada o rechazada.

This research addresses the relationship between media and disability from the area of sports journalism with the Colombian digital press coverage of the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. The study analyzed the meanings assigned by Colombian Paralympic athletes to the news published by the digital media about their participation, as well as the elements of such news and the way in which they influenced their media self-identification. From a critical-interpretative approach, the research was developed in two phases: in the first phase, a textual analysis of 559 digital news items published on the subject was carried out; in a second phase, the data obtained were confronted with the 45 protagonists of the news items through semi-structured interviews. It was found that most athletes lack knowledge and adoption of the progressive model of media representation of disability, so they value the “supercrip” media discourses with which they are represented as heroes or models of inspiration, not for their sporting achievements, but for their ability to cope “despite” disability. It is concluded that, to the extent that digital media show them as athletes, especially those who inspire other people with and without disabilities, they increase the chances of these athletes developing a media self-identity. In this sense, based on the positive or negative assessment of certain elements of the news, athletes felt media self-identified in an imposed, assumed, negotiated or rejected way.",,,Quaderns de Filologia - Estudis Lingüístics,,,,2021-12-20,2021,2021-12-20,,26,0,129-150,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meléndez-Labrador, Sandra","Meléndez-Labrador, Sandra (Universidad del Norte)",,"Meléndez-Labrador, Sandra (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://ojs.uv.es/index.php/qfilologia/article/download/21981/19629,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144162265,,

The general research strategy is constituted by four approaches: problematic, theoretical, methodical, and strategic-pedagogical; these approximations organize and define the results. The current planetary context is reflected in principles of complexity and transdisciplinarity that allow building strategies to face complex educational problems. It is considered that the diffusion of the theoretical-conceptual about complexity and transdisciplinarity has been abundant to promote a reform of thought for educational change, but not enough for teachers to carry it out in their educational practice. In the methodological route, a strategy was built to link the teaching-research loop. A case strategy was worked on, whose results were concatenated in a process of research-action-training.

De ahí que existan tan pocos trabajos enfocados en recuperar una parte del pasado bibliográfico de las colecciones que todas las órdenes religiosas conformaron desde el siglo XVI y hasta la primera mitad del siglo XIX. Dicha realidad contrasta con un conjunto importante de evidencias históricas que se conservan en repositorios mexicanos, y que muestran prácticas culturales cercanas a las de la península con ciertos matices de realidades sociales diferentes. Estas colecciones fueron útiles tanto para el trabajo cotidiano de la evangelización y fortalecimiento de los valores de la religión Católica, como para la transmisión de valores europeos que debieron adaptarse a las realidades del mestizaje. Los restos de tal riqueza bibliográfica constituyen habitantes en bibliotecas públicas y privadas, tanto como objetos poco apreciados, exceptuando para pocos interesados. Cada libro de esta naturaleza posee elementos de procedencia que permiten relacionarlo con alguna de estas órdenes: jesuitas, franciscanos, dominicos, mercedarios, agustinos, entre otras.

A broad approach to characterization initially controlled by UV-vis spectrophotometry has been directed, the formation mechanism was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the magnetic properties by characterization by Physical Property Measurement System (PPSM), in addition to a large number of techniques such as X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (DRX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and Z potential to confirm the formation of FeO NP. The results suggest better characteristics for FeO NP synthesized using 96% alcoholic solvent extract. The successful synthesis was directly proven in the removal of metals (Cr-VI, Cd, and Pb) as a potential alternative in the remediation of agricultural soils.","The authors would like to thank LABNANO/CBPF for the technical support during the electron microscopy work.

Mobile learning creates an opportunity for growth and the application of innovative practices in educational settings. The Colombian government has implemented investment strategies to improve educational quality and provided schools throughout the country with mobile devices. However, the mobile applications contained in these devices lack contents in accordance with student’s context and educational level and UX/UI design; moreover, they do not promote an improvement in the teaching-learning process. This study presents a model that non-programming teachers can use to develop educational mobile applications, which integrates didactic and methodological strategies aimed at academic improvement. Descriptive research with a mixed-methods approach was employed here to interpret the results obtained and analyze the mediation of the mobile applications created adopting this model to support the teaching-learning process. Teachers from ten public educational institutions, who exhibited little appropriation and ignorance of mobile learning, participated in this study. As a result, a model to develop educational mobile applications was created, which represents a contribution to the existing literature in the field of mobile learning and the development of innovative teaching practices. It was concluded that the development model proposed in this paper can be used by non-developer teachers to implement educational mobile applications that serve as a mediating didactic tool in the teaching-learning process in primary and secondary education.",,,TecnoLógicas,,,,2021-12-16,2021,2021-12-16,,24,52,e2065-e2065,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escobar-Reynel, Jorge Luis; Baena-Navarro, Rubén; Giraldo-Tobón, Beatriz; Macea-Anaya, Mario; Castaño-Rivera, Samir","Escobar-Reynel, Jorge Luis (Universidad de Santander, Colombia); Baena-Navarro, Rubén (Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Colombia); Giraldo-Tobón, Beatriz (Universidad de Santander, Colombia); Macea-Anaya, Mario (Universidad de Córdoba, Colombia); Castaño-Rivera, Samir (Universidad de Córdoba, Colombia)",,"Escobar-Reynel, Jorge Luis (University of Santander); Baena-Navarro, Rubén (Cooperative University of Colombia); Giraldo-Tobón, Beatriz (University of Santander); Macea-Anaya, Mario (University of Córdoba); Castaño-Rivera, Samir (University of Córdoba)",3,0,,2.61,https://revistas.itm.edu.co/index.php/tecnologicas/article/download/2065/2206,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144041102,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Estudio multicéntrico de pruebas diagnósticas.,"Introduction: There are no sensitive or specific tests available to diagnose systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).
Objective: To assess the utility as diagnostic tests of total ferritin (TF) levels greater than 5 times the normal value (TF>5N) and the decreased percentage (less than or equal to 20% of TF) of glycosylated ferritin (GF≤20%) for the diagnosis of sJIA in patients with fever of unknown origin evaluated by pediatric rheumatology.
Materials and methods: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of diagnostic tests in children under 16 years of age hospitalized between 2010 and 2014. The reference diagnostic standard was the fulfillment of the classification criteria or confirmed diagnosis at follow-up. We determined the measures of utility of the tests.
Results: We included 40 patients with fever of unknown origin, 11 with sJIA, and 29 with other diagnoses. The median TF was higher in sAIJ (3992 ng/ml) versus other causes of fever of unknown origin (155 ng/ml) (p=0.0027), as well as TF>5N (90.91% versus 51.72%) (p=0.023). The percentage of GF≤20% was higher in patients with other causes of fever of unknown origin (96.5%) compared to sJIA (81.8%) (p=0.178). TF>5N had a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 48%, positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.76, and negative LR of 0.19 demonstrating greater utility for the diagnosis of sJIA than the combination of FT> 5N with GFR <20%, with a sensitivity of 81.8%, specificity of 48.3%, positive LR of 1.58, and negative LR of 0.38.
Conclusion: In patients with FUO evaluated by pediatric rheumatology, TF> 5N proved useful as a screening test for the diagnosis of sJIA.",Al Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe por el apoyo para el desarrollo de la investigación.,,Biomédica,,,"Arthritis, Juvenile; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Ferritins; Fever of Unknown Origin; Humans",2021-12-15,2021,2021-12-15,,41,4,787-804,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eraso, Ruth; Benitez, Claudia Patricia; Jaramillo, Sergio; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena; Quevedo, Augusto","Eraso, Ruth (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia); Benitez, Claudia Patricia (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia); Jaramillo, Sergio (Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Colombia); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (División Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, División Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Colombia); Quevedo, Augusto (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación, Medellin, Colombia)","Eraso, Ruth (University of Antioquia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe)","Eraso, Ruth (University of Antioquia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Benitez, Claudia Patricia (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia); Jaramillo, Sergio (Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Quevedo, Augusto (University of Antioquia; Hospital Universitario de San Vicente Fundación)",3,2,0.23,1.35,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5849/4897,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140860567,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Neuromonitoring has been a standard of care for patients presenting with traumatic brain injury in most critical care centres for the past several years. Neuromonitoring is composed of multiple variables, which not only provides a better dynamic of the pathophysiology of the compromised brain but also how it might respond to the corresponding management procedures. Although the clinical neurological examination is the standard for monitoring the neurocritical patient, the results obtained in the latter may be insufficient or inconclusive to detect or prevent secondary brain injury. Therefore, multiple neuromonitoring tools have been developed to measure different physiological variables that can contribute to a better follow-up of patients with traumatic brain injury. These variables include cerebral blood flow, cerebral electrical activity, cerebral metabolism, cerebral oxygenation and cerebral pressure. Thanks to monitoring as an adjuvant in critical care, it has been possible to avoid, identify and manage secondary brain injuries that commonly aggravate patients.

Millions of people left Venezuela, with Colombia as their main destination. This means a challenge for integration, where women have been those who have been in a more precarious condition. This research aims to determine how the living conditions of Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia have changed in the context of the pandemic. This work is based on a mixed methodology that uses data from the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, February and December 2020, and interviews with fourteen women in Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla. From this information, it is inferred that the Venezuelan migrant status and gender are factors that strongly condition access to employment and social rights, with women in an irregular migratory situation being the most affected. In addition, dependence on support networks, xenophobic events, and effects on mental health are key aspects to understanding the difficulties that migrants experience in the new normal.",,,Revista Latinoamericana Estudios de la Paz y el Conflicto,,,,2021-12-15,2021,2021-12-15,,3,5,160-182,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valencia, Solange Bonilla; Vásquez, Sergio Hernández","Valencia, Solange Bonilla (Corporación Unificada Nacional); Vásquez, Sergio Hernández (Corporación Universitaria para el Desarrollo Empresarial y Social)",,"Valencia, Solange Bonilla (Corporación Unificada Nacional); Vásquez, Sergio Hernández (Corporación Universitaria para el Desarrollo Empresarial y Social)",5,5,,3.67,https://camjol.info/index.php/ReLaPaC/article/download/12808/14847,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143860604,44 Human Society; 4403 Demography,3 Good Health and Well Being; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Thousands of them have arrived in Colombia in search of reproductive health care. Notwithstanding Colombia’s government efforts to provide some relief measures to the massive influx of Venezuelan migrants, pregnant women are not receiving the prenatal and postnatal care they need. One of the primary barriers to health care access is their immigration status and the health system structure regarding migrants.

The methodology used was a systematic review of scientific publications, between the period 2013-2017, available in the Scopus database related to adverse experiences in childhood and drug use in adolescence and adulthood that yielded a total of 69 publications included in the study. Adverse experiences in childhood have a high relation with the use and/or abuse of drugs in adolescence and adulthood. Drug use in adolescents and adults exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood occurs mainly in men. The most commonly used drugs are alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and non-prescription drugs, and to a lesser extent opioids, cocaine and amphetamines. Drugs, in this sense, play the role of chemical barrier to distance the emotional pain that derives from the memory of the traumatic experiences and its intense psychic load.

From the literature reviewed, it has been found that THz spectroscopy is still in constant development, both in the physical part of the equipment and in the data processing techniques. Despite these advances, the frequency ranges in which the identification of compounds are influenced by the interference of the water composition of food have not been clearly identified, even molecular behavior of water in the frequency ranges corresponding to the spectral band of THz is still little known. When performing a meta-analysis of the data specifying the frequency ranges in relation to the water content of food samples, reported in the literature, two intervals have been identified, where the action of THz waves have a better response in terms of the quantification of water, as well as of other compounds, which are mainly evidenced in lower water content, explained by the mechanisms of water relaxation in response to the interaction of THz waves. This result suggests that the influence of water content on the quantification of compounds should be considered, as it may be under or overestimated.",,,Scientia Agropecuaria,,,,2021-12-15,2021,2021-12-15,,12,4,625-634,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arteaga, Hubert; León-Roque, Noemí; Oblitas, Jimy","Arteaga, Hubert (Escuela de Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Chota, Campus Colpa Huacaris, Chota, Cajamarca); León-Roque, Noemí (Facultad de Ingeniería Química e Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Calle Juan XXIII 391, Lambayeque, Perú); Oblitas, Jimy (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

Two schools appear to be opposed to each other: the philological school and a creolistic view. The philological school tried to demonstrate with meticulous research of sources that Afrikaans is a full daughter of 17th century Dutch, which set foot ashore with van Riebeeck in 1652 at the Cape of Good Hope. Linguists who thought of a pattern of creolization in the formation of Afrikaans point to the influence of the languages of slaves brought to South Africa and to the influence of the original inhabitants, the Khoi and the San. This contribution mainly outlines the ideological background of these two schools of thought.

However, few studies have been published that allow us to estimate the potential of Oithona nana culture under controlled conditions. This work evaluated the effect of the microalgae Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans as single (200,000 cells/mL) and mixed diets (100,000 + 100,000 cells/mL) on population and individual growth, ingestion rate, number of spawnings, fertility, development time by stage, and sex ratio of O. nana. We cultured this copepod at 28 ± 0.5 °C, 35 PSU salinity, 125 lux, and 12:12 photoperiod. Results showed that diet had no effect on the final population level (6273-7966 ind/L) or on individual growth, nor on sex ratio, with less males than females. With C. calcitrans, O. nana had a higher filtration rate (57 ng C/ind/day). On the other hand, a mixed diet induced a higher number of spawns (0.4 events/day) and nauplii per spawn (23 ind). Similarly, a single or mixed diet, containing I. galbana, accelerated the development rate by 6.33-7.00 days. We concluded that O. nana can be cultured with both microalgae, indicating its potential use in an intensive system for production. However, more research is required to improve the productivity of O. nana rearing.","This work constitutes the thesis research to qualify for the degree of Magíster en Acuicultura mención Cultivo de Recursos Hidrobiológicos, from the la Universidad Arturo Prat, Arica, Chile.

Despite this, little is known about the intention of students to use online learning. The objective of this research is to study the continuance intention of online learning in the post-COVID-19 period in higher education. The research focuses on online learning tools and technologies by applying a modified Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) developed from earlier theoretical models, including three new constructs: the self-management of learning, computer anxiety, and habit. The international research compares three countries—Spain (Europe), Chile (Latin America), and Jordan (Asia)—which differ economically and culturally. The Partial Least Squares approach (PLS-SEM) was used to test the research model. As a conclusion of the study, the relationships of the proposed model’s constructs vary among the three countries, given their socioeconomic, technological, and cultural differences. Interestingly, self-management learning is a key factor that has a significant positive influence on continuance intention for the three countries, especially in Jordan.

In this context, it is important to develop new protocols to characterise the mineralogical variability of archaeological copper ores. A comprehensive and representative methodology in the analysis of minerals, the application of non-destructive analytical techniques, and the combination of insights from geological, archaeological and local knowledge are key to developing a copper mineral repository of the Atacama Desert area. Geochemical analyses were applied to the study of 568 samples from the archaeological site Pukara de Turi, with different techniques such as micro-XRF, XRD, QEMSCAN, Raman spectroscopy and technological studies. This exhaustive analysis allowed for the recognition of two mineralogical associations: atacamite/brochantite (99%) and azurite/chrysocolla (1%). The study of various minerals allows data to be interpreted more reliably and to trace the likely geological sources of these minerals. The azurite/chrysocolla samples appear to belong to the same mineral association found in the Cerro Verde district, which is probably the source of these samples. The atacamite/brochantite samples appear to come from more than one geological source, including, but not limited to, Chuquicamata-Radomiro Tomic and El Abra-Conchi.","The analyses presented were conducted at Unidad de Equipamiento Científico-MAINI at Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.

194,pub.1143742044,10.1111/ddi.13458,,,Glacier influence on bird assemblages in habitat islands of the high Bolivian Andes,"Abstract  Aim Climate projections for the upcoming decades predict a significant loss of ice mass particularly critical for glaciers in tropical mountains. In the dry landscapes of the southern Andes (from Southern Peru to Chile), this global trend has strong ecological impacts on high‐altitude wetlands that support a unique avifauna for feeding, roosting and nesting. As glacier runoffs are expected to affect the area and the quality of wetland habitats, these changes may potentially affect bird communities. To address this issue, we studied the structural and functional diversity of bird assemblages in glacier‐fed high‐altitude wetlands (>4500 m).   Location Five valleys of the Cordillera Real, Bolivia.   Methods We surveyed bird communities during dry, wet and intermediate seasons in 40 wetlands (total of 27,720 observations of birds and habitats from 540 transects) showing different degrees of dependence on glacial meltwater. We examined the potential effect of glacier retreat on bird communities through changes in wetland area and environmental quality and heterogeneity.   Results We found strong relationship between wetland area and taxonomic and functional diversity, but not on phylogenetic diversity. Generalized additive models revealed that avian diversity was influenced by wetland's productivity and elevation and maximized at intermediate levels of glacier influence. Multivariate analysis further showed that habitat productivity and humidity, both potentially influenced by future glacial retreat trends, are the main drivers of bird community composition, with the wettest habitats being crucial for aquatic birds and uncommon species.   Main conclusions Glacier retreat may significantly affect bird community diversity and composition through changes in both area and quality of high‐altitude wetlands, with a particular concern for aquatic birds.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was funded by the Fond Français pour l&#x27;Environnement Mondial (FFEM) and the Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversité (FRB) (Modeling BIOdiversity and land use interactions under changing glacial water availability in Tropical High Andean Wetlands (BIOTHAW, AAP‐SCEN‐2011‐II).

The objective of this study was to determine the body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (% BF), waist circumference (WC), and anemia in university students. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2,285 university students from Lima, Peru. The sample was selected by nonprobability convenience sampling. Anthropometric data and hemoglobin levels were measured. The Chi-square test was used. The analysis of the associated factors was done using binary logistic regression. A significance level of 5% was considered. There were no significant differences between men and women in BMI (p > 0.05). The men presented significantly high and very high levels of % BF (p < 0.001).

In 2012, the Ministry of Health provided a technical guide for high-altitude workers that included a series of actions to mitigate the effects of hypoxia. Previous studies have shown the positive effect of oxygen enrichment at high altitudes. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radiotelescope operates at 5,050 m [Array Operations Site (AOS)] and is the only place in the world where pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and liquid oxygen technologies have been installed at a large scale. These technologies reduce the equivalent altitude by increasing oxygen availability. This study aims to perform a retrospective comparison between the use of both technologies during operation in ALMA at 5,050 m. In each condition, variables such as oxygen (O2), temperature, and humidity were continuously recorded in each AOS rooms, and cardiorespiratory variables were registered. In addition, we compared portable O2 by using continuous or demand flow during outdoor activities at very high altitudes. The outcomes showed no differences between production procedures (PSA or liquid oxygen) in regulating oxygen availability at AOS facilities. As a result, big-scale installations have difficulties reaching the appropriate O2 concentration due to leaks in high mobility areas. In addition, the PSA plant requires adequacy and maintenance to operate at a very high altitude. A continuous flow of 2-3 l/min of portable O2 is recommended at 5,050 m.","We are grateful to all the volunteers from the ALMA who participated in this study, the nurses and paramedics who participated in all the evaluations performed at the OSF and AOS rooms, and the facility support by the safety manager, ALMA.",,Frontiers in Physiology,,,,2021-12-08,2021,2021-12-08,,12,,775240,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lopez, Ivan; Aravena, Reinaldo; Soza, Daniel; Morales, Alicia; Riquelme, Silvia; Calderon-Jofré, Rodrigo; Moraga, Fernando A.","Lopez, Ivan (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Aravena, Reinaldo (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Soza, Daniel (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Morales, Alicia (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Riquelme, Silvia (Departamento de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Calderon-Jofré, Rodrigo (Laboratorio de Fisiología, Hipoxia y Función Vascular, Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Moraga, Fernando A.

The proposed framework integrates green supply chain management and circular economy within the sustainability perspective as drivers for improvements in sustainable development. Within the framework, the greening factor is introduced as a new concept that measures the required effort for a productive process to become sustainable. On one hand, the framework aims at computing the greening factor based on the impacts of resources exploitation and products generation. Additionally, the greening factor computation was designed based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of economic, social, and environmental mainstays. On the other hand, this paper presents a general application of the framework on the five biggest Chilean industries, i.e., mining, wine, forest, agriculture, and aquaculture. Based on the presented generalized application, it is possible to foresee the potentiality of Chile becoming a green country in spite of its productive matrix being mainly based on primary industries.",The authors want to thank the relevant contribution of Rocío Rivera Cid and Ronald Dotte Zuñiga on improving the manuscript writing.,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2021-12-08,2021,2021-12-08,,13,24,13575,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tapia-Ubeda, Francisco J.; Muga, José A.

Here, we describe details of the eyes of the Cretaceous brachyuran Callichimaera perplexa, which possessed remarkably large eyes and a highly disparate body form among brachyurans. The eyes of C. perplexa preserve internal optic neuropils and external corneal elements, and it is the first known post-Paleozoic arthropod to preserve both. Additionally, a series of specimens of C. perplexa preserve both the eyes and carapace, allowing for the calculation of the optical growth rate. C. perplexa shows the fastest optical growth rate compared with a sample of 14 species of extant brachyurans. The growth series of C. perplexa, in combination with the calculation of the interommatidial angle and eye parameter, demonstrates that it was a highly visual predator that inhabited well-lit environments.","We thank E.A.

However, the migratory process and assimilation of behaviors after extended exposure to the host country could increase the consumption of these substances. The aim of this study was to compare cigarette and alcohol consumption among Colombian migrants and Chileans residing in Chile.
METHODS: In 2019, data were collected from 963 Colombian migrants and 909 Chileans in three cities in Chile. The chi-squared test was used to analyze significant differences in cigarette and alcohol consumption between the groups. Subsequently, the relative risk (RR) and corresponding p-values were obtained.
RESULTS: Colombian migrants had a significantly lower consumption of cigarettes than Chileans (16.6% and 25.1%, respectively). Regarding alcohol consumption, Colombian migrants reported lower consumption than Chileans (43.3% and 48.4 %, respectively ).
CONCLUSIONS: The lower consumption of cigarettes and alcohol by Colombian migrants compared to Chileans is positive for the health of migrants. However, it is advisable to promote health interventions to avoid an increase in the consumption of these substances, especially considering that migrants could assimilate the consumption habits of Chileans.","This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo -ANID (Ex CONICYT), through the project FONDECYT (Grants: 1140843 and 1180315).",,Tobacco Induced Diseases,,,,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,2021-12-07,19,December,1-5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hun, Nelson; Urzúa, Alfonso; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; López-Espinoza, Antonio; Aragón, Diego","Hun, Nelson (Escuela de Nutrición y Dietética, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta, Chile; Instituto de Investigaciones en Comportamiento Alimentario y Nutrición, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ciudad Guzmán, México); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); López-Espinoza, Antonio (Instituto de Investigaciones en Comportamiento Alimentario y Nutrición, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ciudad Guzmán, México); Aragón, Diego (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Hun, Nelson (Universidad Santo Tomás; University of Guadalajara); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); López-Espinoza, Antonio (University of Guadalajara); Aragón, Diego (University of Valparaíso)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/pdf-143088-70304?filename=Cigarette and alcohol.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143696576,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

What does a ""good"" choral music performance sound like? Is there an objective standard of performance excellence, or is beauty in the eye of the beholder? In teacher preparation programs, choral directors in the United States have been taught to identify and teach particular, culturally-bounded standards of choral tone in their students. Choral directors evaluate their students' voices along two dimensions: health and appropriateness. They discern and describe whether the student's musical instrument-their voice-is producing sound in a healthy and non-damaging way. They also judge whether the style of their sound is appropriate for the music they are singing. However, teacher preparation programs do not provide common standards or lexicon for describing tone. This may increase implicit bias of individual directors, and inadvertently exacerbate ethnocentrism and harm students' self-perception. Using a computational text analysis approach, we evaluate the content of open-ended survey responses from teachers, finding that the language used to describe and rate choral performance varies by experience, and by the choral selection (e.g., whether it is a traditional Western or non-Western song). We suggest that regularizing the terminology and providing common training through professional organizations can minimize potential bias and generate more systematic, precise use of qualitative descriptors of health and appropriateness, which will benefit students and teachers.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Qian-Jie Fu,Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Singing; Teaching; United States; Voice Quality,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,,16,12,e0256587,All OA; Gold,Article,"Frizzell, Emily Y.; Windsor, Leah Cathryn","Frizzell, Emily Y.

Previous AD epidemiologic studies have been mainly retrospective and/or have been performed through surveys instead of in-person visits. Epidemiological studies concerning AD in Latin American countries are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To describe sociodemographic and clinical features and the economic burden of AD on children and adult patients in Colombia through in-person visits.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 212 patients that included sociodemographic and clinimetric data. The diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka was used and data relating to disease distribution, disease severity (through the BSA: Body surface area; EASI: Eczema Area and Severity Index; SCORAD: Scoring Atopic Dermatitis), Fitzpatrick's skin phototypes, personal and familiar history of allergic diseases, previous treatments, and personal history of comorbidities, was collected.
RESULTS: Patient age range was 12-76, and 52.8% were female. Disease distribution was mainly flexural (19.6%). Early age start, Denni-Morgan fold, and infections tendency were more frequent in adolescents compared to adults. Mean age of diagnosis was 12 years old, AD diagnosis was made mostly by a dermatologist, 48.1% (102 patients) reported alcohol consumption, and 59% of consumers were heavy drinkers. Comorbidities found were: chronic rhinitis (68.9%) food allergy (32.5%), allergic conjunctivitis (29.7%), and asthma (28.8%). Around 81% earned less than $896 US dollars and 59% invested 6-30% of their monthly budget yearly, and 40% had work or school absenteeism. Mean scores of BSA, EASI, and SCORAD involvement were 32.6, 13.7, and 42.4, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds well-supported data through an in-depth clinical and economical characterization of Colombian adolescents and adult patients with atopic dermatitis and shows its high impact and burden on patients and their families. It also contributes to understand the burden of AD in Latin America.","We thank all the patients for their willingness to participate.

Participants included 121 volunteers, 56 physicians and 65 nurses, between the ages of 22 and 67 . The results show a low prevalence of burnout syndrome. For psychological well-being, differences were found by gender, with men scoring higher in self-acceptanc and life purpos than women. As regards the sector of employment, employees in the private sector reported greater personal growth than those in the public sector. As to burnout, differences were found between physicians and nurses in the depersonalization factor, with physicians scoring higher. Comparisons by sector showed that those who work in a private context reported higher levels of personal fulfillment, than those that belong to a public one.

Among emerging contaminants, antimicrobials have received particular attention in recent decades, mainly due to the concerning development of antibiotic resistance observed in bacteria, but little is known about the toxicological and ecological impact that antimicrobials can have on aquatic ecosystems. Their high consumption in human and veterinary medicine, food-producing animals and aquaculture, as well as persistence and poor absorption have caused antimicrobials to be discharged into receiving waters, with or without prior treatment, where they have been detected at ng-mg L−1 levels with the potential to cause effects on the various organisms living within aquatic systems. This review presents the current knowledge on the occurrence of antimicrobials in aquatic ecosystems, emphasizing their occurrence in different environmental matrixes and the effects on aquatic organisms (cyanobacteria, microalgae, invertebrates and vertebrates).","This work was supported by a fellowship of the Latin American Association of Postgraduates (AUIP) in agreement with the Simón Bolívar University of Colombia, the PROPLAYAS Network, the Caribbean Marine and Limnological Research Center CICMAR and the University of Cadiz in Spain.

Higher diversity in the composition of new cohorts of students, generated mainly in countries where public and institutional policies have enabled access to students from low socioeconomic conditions and races who unusually attend postsecondary education, make these effects even more relevant. This research estimates and analyzes the effect of peers’ academic performance and course composition by socioeconomic origin on students’ academic achievement at a private Colombian university between 2008 and 2019. The estimates, by Ordinary Least Squares and Multilevel models, support the existence of significant peer effects. There was a positive effect of peers’ performance on Calculus I academic results, principally of medium and high-performance peers, and a null effect of the socioeconomic level in Calculus I, but a significant effect in Communication Skills I, although with a limited impact. By introducing heterogeneities, it is evident that students perceived a greater benefit from performance improvements from peers who are in the same performance category or socioeconomic level. These results provide evidence of the existence, direction, and magnitude of peer effects in Colombian higher education. Additionally, they suggest that the most relevant characteristic of classmates is their academic performance and not their socioeconomic origin.","The authors thank the Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education-Icfes for providing access to the results of the national test Saber11 and for linking this database with the institutional records of the Universidad del Norte that allowed the realization of this work.

The orientation starts from the critical analysis of the discourse that the Frankfurt School makes to the cultural industry, which highlights the manipulation carried out by the media in modern society manifested -particularly- with the tourist or consumer of the message that is promoted when modeling their behavior and decision making. The methodological proposal has as its central axis the critical discourse analysis (ACD) in which the virtual three-dimensionality of tourism promotion is analyzed from three categories: textuality (written or spoken), discursive practice and social practice, instrumentalized by the Atlas.ti program. The literature review shows the line that the critical discourse analysis has followed, passing through the linguistic turn to the epistemic assessment of language and the relevance it has acquired in analyzing the discourses and texts.

In this research, we analyzed the relationships of different facets of social class with well-being and affectivity across 8 Ibero-American countries. Moreover, we also tested the potential mediating role of perceived risk of COVID-19 and perceived collective efficacy. The results obtained (a) revealed that a lower social class was related to reduced well-being and positive affect as well as to greater negative affect, (b) confirmed that subjective social class was a better predictor of well-being and affectivity than educational level (i.e., an objective indicator of social class), and (c) showed that subjective social class was indirectly linked to well-being/affectivity via its effects on the perceived risk of COVID-19 and perceived collective efficacy.

Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects. For this, feces and blood were collected. The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners.","This research was funded by Universidad de Antioquia (CODI 2015-7857; sostenibilidad), Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia (INV2732) and Corporación Universitaria Remington.

The stigma is a relevant barrier to diabetes management. However, evidence in this regard is scarce in Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the level of stigma surrounding type 2 diabetes in the Colombian population and its relationships with sociodemographic, clinical, psychosocial variables and behaviors related to management of the disease (self-management behaviors). This cross-sectional study included 501 Colombian adults with type 2 diabetes. We estimated the relation between stigma and selected variables through linear regression models. Additionally, we analyzed the mediator role of psychosocial variables in the relationship between stigma and self-management behaviors through structural equation models. A total of 16.4% of patients showed concerning levels of stigma. The time elapsed since diagnosis (β = -0.23) and socioeconomic status (β = -0.13) were significant predictors of the level of stigma. Stigma was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (β = -0.36), self-esteem (β = -0.37), and relationship with health care provider (β = -0.46), and positively correlated with stress (β = 0.23). Self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the relationships with health care providers had a mediation role in the relationship between stigma and self-management behaviors. These variables would be part of the mechanisms through which the perception of stigma harms self-management behaviors. The stigma of type 2 diabetes is frequent in the Colombian population and negatively associated with important aspects of disease management.",,"This research was funded by Universidad Andres Bello, grant number, DI-01-19/CB and Universidad Andres Bello-Universidad del Norte (Colombia) Research Collaboration Agreement UN-OJ-2019-46584.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Ana López De Andrés, Lisa Newson, Ian Davies, Julie Abayomi","Adult; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Self Concept; Social Stigma",2021-12-01,2021,2021-12-01,,18,23,12657,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pedrero, Victor; Manzi, Jorge; Alonso, Luz Marina","Pedrero, Victor (Nursing Faculty, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago 8370146, Chile; School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile;, jmanzi@uc.cl); Manzi, Jorge (School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile;, jmanzi@uc.cl); Alonso, Luz Marina (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, lmalonso@uninorte.edu.co)","Pedrero, Victor (Andrés Bello National University; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)","Pedrero, Victor (Andrés Bello National University; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Manzi, Jorge (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Alonso, Luz Marina (Universidad del Norte)",12,11,1.61,5.04,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/23/12657/pdf?version=1638340471,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143557999,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The objective is to propose a mathematical model to estimate the quality of life index (ICV) in older adults. The case study corresponds to nursing homes in the periurban area of ​​Asuncin, Paraguay. This is a cross-sectional descriptive observational study. 33 adults over 60 years of age, of both sexes, participated, for whom the ICV was estimated through the ICV Assessment in Older Adults (FUMAT) survey. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to estimate the ICV using parameters of different indicators. Regarding the quality of life indicators, it was found that the lowest averages concerning the indicators correspond to those related to law (43 19), material well-being (45 30) and self-determination (48 24). The proposed model presents an excellent agreement with the initial data. The standard error and RMSE values are 0.22% and 0.10, respectively. Furthermore, the model correctly reproduces the dependence of the different indicators on the ICV value.

Information was collected from 10 stations in the city’s air quality monitoring network over a ten-year period. The temporal relationship between air pollutants, their spatial variation, and the occurrence of extreme pollution episodes was studied using Box-Jenkins models. The results showed that the moving average term of the models developed was the main indicator of spatial distribution for the daily pollutant concentrations. In the case of atmospheric particulate matter < 10 μm, the following spatial distribution was identified in the megacity: northwestern, center-southwest, and southeast. For atmospheric particulate matter < 2.5 μm: north, center, and southwest. For ozone: northwest, center, and south. Maximum hourly particulate matter concentrations were observed between 6-10 a.m., and between 11 a.m. - 4 p.m. for ozone.

Based on uncertainty theory, the stock price’s distribution and inverse distribution function under the risk-neutral measure are first derived. Then these two proposed functions are applied to price the European and American options, and verify the parity relationship of European call and put options.",,"This work was supported by Shandong Natural Science Foundation (No.ZR2019BG015), Shandong Provincial Higher Education Science and Technology Plan Project (No.J18KA236), Shandong Youth University of Political Science Doctoral Fundation (No.XXPY21025).",Symmetry,,,,2021-12-01,2021,2021-12-01,,13,12,2285,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huang, Hong; Ning, Yufu","Huang, Hong (School of Information Engineering, Shandong Youth University of Political Science, Jinan 250103, China;, huanghong@sdyu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing Technology and Security, Universities of Shandong, Jinan 250103, China); Ning, Yufu (School of Information Engineering, Shandong Youth University of Political Science, Jinan 250103, China;, huanghong@sdyu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing Technology and Security, Universities of Shandong, Jinan 250103, China)","Ning, Yufu (Shandong Youth University of Political Science; Shandong University)","Huang, Hong (Shandong Youth University of Political Science; Shandong University); Ning, Yufu (Shandong Youth University of Political Science; Shandong University)",1,1,,0.63,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/12/2285/pdf?version=1638349848,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143560667,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",

This study aimed to compare students' performance in team-based learning and traditional lectures.
METHODS: A total of 176 class 4 and 202 class 6 medical students from University of Bahri, Khartoum, Sudan, participated in the study during 2018. Experienced staff were selected to conduct the teaching and assessment of the two groups, using the standard team-based learning procedure (iRAT, gRAT and AppT) in the first topic and the lecture-based learning procedure in the second, within the same time limit for the two methods.
RESULTS: The two classes overall mean score has a significant 5.1 points difference (p<0.001; 95% CI: 3.5, 6.0). Separate analysis showed consistency of superiority of TBL to LBL in either gender. A remarkable difference was observed when we compared the two methods in class 6 separately from class 4. Class 6 mean score was high for both TBL and LBL (77.2 and 70.2, respectively), with a significant mean difference of 7.0 (p<0.001; 95% CI: 5.1, 8.9). In class 4, the score was lower for both methods (mean of 62.8 for TBL and 59.9 for LBL). The mean difference of 2.95 points was still significant (p<0.05; 95% CI: 0.46, 5.43). Separate multivariate linear regression for TBL and LBL showed no significant difference in performance of males and females in either method. Controlling for gender in TBL, class 4 had a mean of -14.26 points, (p<0.001; 95% CI: -12.54, -15.98) less than class 6. Similarly, in LBL, class 4 had a mean of -10.18 points (p<0.001, 95% CI: -7.02, -13.35), less than class 6.
CONCLUSION: Students' performance using team-based learning was superior to lecture-based learning, irrespective of students' gender, noticeable among senior students.","The authors would like to share condolences with all colleagues and reader for the sad death of our senior coauthor Professor Elfatih Elsamani, who pass away during the preparation and submission of this manuscript, due to COVID-19 and special condolences to his family and students, without his meticulous hands on and guidance this work might not be materialized.

ABSTRACT Background and aim: Breastfeeding (BF) is a protective factor against childhood obesity; however, the mechanisms associated with this effect have not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to describe the mechanisms related to the protective effect of breastfeeding against childhood obesity. Methods: A search on PUBMED, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library and SCIELO databases was carried out to develop a descriptive review of the scientific evidence. The key words were breastfeeding; obesity; mechanism and diet. Articles were reviewed in Spanish and English from 1977 to 2020. Results: The protective effect of BF against childhood obesity is given by a combination of several mechanism. Its nutritional composition and the contribution of bioactive substances stand out, some of them regulated by the energy intake. Infants who are breastfed choose healthier foods in preschool, regardless of sociodemographic factors.

Currently, the standards and guidelines (existing) do not adequately standardize the production process (molding procedures) under laboratory conditions. This fact hinders its correct application in the field since it does not have enough parameters to verify at least the compacting of the material (unit weight in the field). Compaction has a great influence on pervious concrete (PC) properties: porosity, permeability, and consequently, mechanical strength. Thus, this study aims to propose procedure standardization for molding cylindrical and prismatic specimens of PC (in laboratory conditions) using the unit weight like control parameter. The standard procedure chosen was the proctor hummer (2.5 kg and 305 mm of heigh fall), due to its ease and good results (low variability), both in the cylindrical specimens and in the prismatic ones where the point of application of the compaction blows was also defined. Finally, an experimental program was carried out to verify the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the produced PC, and the compliance of the standards was verified. Then it was verified that the proposed molding procedure produces PC within the standard parameters. Additionally, a control abacus related to the unit weight and the porosity (input data) was proposed to determine the number of blows to compact the PC, giving the opportunity to choose a porosity, and as a consequence, a prediction of the strength, facilitating the production process, depending on the final application of the material.",The authors acknowledge the State University of Londrina (UEL); the CAPES for the financial support; the CNPQ for the productivity scholarship; the Paraná Federal Institute – IFPR – Foz do Iguaçu Campus; the UDC University Center; and the ITAIPU BINACIONAL for the laboratories and for the technical support.,,Case Studies in Construction Materials,,,,2021-12,2021,,2021-12,15,Constr.

Based on the story The Very Hungry Caterpillar , by the author Eric Carle (1996), the study including playful activities in two first grade elementary school classes, one which has English Language as a curricular component in a private school in Caxias do Sul, and the other in a public school in Porto Alegre within the framework of the Project: LIVE LIBRARY: support space for the teaching and learning process. It also aimed to identify students’ learning outcomes in both realities, comparing the possibilities of public and private contexts. Within the implementation of the teaching practice, we observed that, regardless of the available resources or the space in the curriculum, teaching a Foreign Language, in this case, English Language, can be performed effectively in the school context, whether public or private since, even without previous knowledge, the students achieved the previously determined objectives based on working with the proposed contents connected to storytelling in a playful way. Resumo O presente artigo visa analisar quais as contribuições que uma prática de ensino fundamentada em uma abordagem lúdica a partir da contação de histórias pode proporcionar para a aprendizagem da Língua Inglesa no 1º Ano do Ensino Fundamental. Tomando-se por base a história The Very Hungry Caterpillar , do autor Eric Carle (1996), o estudo contempla atividades lúdicas em duas turmas de 1º Ano do Ensino Fundamental, sendo uma delas que tem a Língua Inglesa como componente curricular na rede privada de Caxias do Sul, e a outra em uma escola pública de Porto Alegre no âmbito do Projeto BIBLIOTECA VIVA: espaço de apoio aos processos de ensino e aprendizagem . Buscou-se, ainda, identificar os resultados da aprendizagem dos alunos nas duas realidades, comparando as possibilidades das escolas pública e privada. Com a execução da prática de ensino, evidenciou-se que, independentemente dos recursos disponíveis ou do espaço na grade curricular, o ensino de Língua Estrangeira, no caso a Língua Inglesa, pode acontecer sim no contexto escolar, seja ele público ou privado, uma vez que os alunos, mesmo não dispondo de conhecimento prévio, atingiram os objetivos previamente estipulados a partir do trabalho com os conteúdos propostos em sintonia com a contação de uma história de forma lúdica.

The latter are generally identified in quantitative studies. The affectation of the quality of life and the oral health approach of the experiences of people with NSCLP and their families have not been qualitatively documented. Purpose: To identify the perception of quality of life of children and adolescents with NSCLP undergoing comprehensive treatment at the Cleft Lip and Palate clinic of the Javeriana University from Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: It was a qualitative phenomenological study in which eight patients, five parents/guardians, and four professionals from the interdisciplinary care group participated. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with each participant and two focus groups, one with guardians/parents and another one with professionals, led by an expert. After transcription, findings were coded and classified according to the categories proposed using the Atlas TI software. Subsequently, a narrative reduction and the corresponding analysis were performed. Results: Participants shared their perspectives on the impact of living with NSCLP and how it impacted their quality of life. Social and psychological dimensions were the most affected. The narrations revealed feelings of sorrow, anguish, and shyness, as well as longings and desires for greater sociability. Conclusion: The reconstruction of the narratives showed how the experience of living with NSCLP generates challenges, situations, and thoughts that affect quality of life, especially from the social and psychological perspectives.",,,Universitas Odontologica,,,,2021-11-30,2021,2021-11-30,,40,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Osorio, Niyireth Rocío Rocha; del Pilar Bernal Pardo, María; Montaño, Oscar Mauricio; Castillo, Ángela Suárez; Alba, John Roberto","Osorio, Niyireth Rocío Rocha (Fuerza Aérea Colombiana.

This work is related to the kinetic study of the leaching of gold and copper contained in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and silver contained in mining wastes (MW), using the O2-thiosemicarbazide system. The results obtained show that this non-toxic leaching system is adequate for the leaching of said metals. Reaction orders were found ranging from 0 (Cu), 0.93 (Ag), and 2.01 (Au) for the effect of the reagent concentration and maximum recoveries of 77.7% (Cu), 95.8% (Au), and 60% (Ag) were obtained. Likewise, the activation energies found show that the leaching of WEEE is controlled by diffusion (Cu Ea = 9.06 and Au Ea = 18.25 kJ/Kmol), while the leaching of MW (Ea = 45.55 kJ/Kmol) is controlled by the chemical reaction. For the case of stirring rate, it was found a low effect and only particles from WEEE and MW must be suspended in solution to proceed with the leaching. The pH has effect only at values above 8, and finally, for the case of MW, the O2 partial pressure has a market effect, going the Ag leaching from 33% at 0.2 atm up to 60% at a 1 atm.",The authors are thankful to CONACyT of the Mexican Government for the support with the scholarship awarded to the master student (A.H.R.-C) with CVU 739728 and the doctorate student (E.A.C.-R) with CVU 778782.,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,Ndue Kanari,,2021-11-30,2021,2021-11-30,,14,23,7329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cerecedo-Sáenz, Eduardo; Cárdenas-Reyes, Edgar A.; Rojas-Calva, Abner H.; Reyes-Valderrama, Ma.

Survey Results of the European PROspective Penile Cancer Study (E-PROPS),"BACKGROUND: Penile cancer represents a rare malignant disease, whereby a small caseload is associated with the risk of inadequate treatment expertise. Thus, we hypothesized that strict guideline adherence might be considered a potential surrogate for treatment quality. This study investigated the influence of the annual hospital caseload on guideline adherence regarding treatment recommendations for penile cancer.
METHODS: In a 2018 survey study, 681 urologists from 45 hospitals in four European countries were queried about six hypothetical case scenarios (CS): local treatment of the primary tumor pTis (CS1) and pT1b (CS2); lymph node surgery inguinal (CS3) and pelvic (CS4); and chemotherapy neoadjuvant (CS5) and adjuvant (CS6). Only the responses from 206 head and senior physicians, as decision makers, were evaluated. The answers were assessed based on the applicable European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines regarding their correctness. The real hospital caseload was analyzed based on multivariate logistic regression models regarding its effect on guideline adherence.
RESULTS: The median annual hospital caseload was 6 (interquartile range (IQR) 3-9). Recommendations for CS1-6 were correct in 79%, 66%, 39%, 27%, 28%, and 28%, respectively. The probability of a guideline-adherent recommendation increased with each patient treated per year in a clinic for CS1, CS2, CS3, and CS6 by 16%, 7.8%, 7.2%, and 9.5%, respectively (each p < 0.05); CS4 and CS5 were not influenced by caseload. A caseload threshold with a higher guideline adherence for all endpoints could not be perceived. The type of hospital care (academic vs. non-academic) did not affect guideline adherence in any scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence for most treatment recommendations increases with growing annual penile cancer caseload. Thus, the results of our study call for a stronger centralization of diagnosis and treatment strategies regarding penile cancer.",We would like to thank all participating clinics and physicians for supporting the E-PROPS project.,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-29,2021,2021-11-29,,11,,759362,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lebentrau, Steffen; Wakileh, Gamal Anton; Schostak, Martin; Schmid, Hans-Peter; Suarez-Ibarrola, Rodrigo; Merseburger, Axel S.; Hutterer, Georg C.; Necknig, Ulrike H.; Rink, Michael; Bögemann, Martin; Kluth, Luis Alex; Pycha, Armin; Burger, Maximilian; Brookman-May, Sabine D.; Bründl, Johannes; May, Matthias","Lebentrau, Steffen (Department of Urology, Werner Forßmann Hospital, Eberswalde, Germany); Wakileh, Gamal Anton (Department of Urology, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany); Schostak, Martin (Department of Urology and Urooncology, University Medical Center Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany); Schmid, Hans-Peter (Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland); Suarez-Ibarrola, Rodrigo (Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany); Merseburger, Axel S.

After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 subjects were eligible to participate in the later stages of the research-15 subjects with DS (mean age 10.1 ± 1.1) and 15 healthy controls (mean age 9.8 ± 1.0). The electrical potentials of the SOO and IOO muscles were recorded using a DAB-Bluetooth electromyography machine (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany) during the following tasks: At clinical rest, saliva swallowing, lip protrusion, lip compression, and production of the syllable/pa/. The Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare the study results between the groups. An analysis of the electromyographical (EMG) recordings showed that the electrical activity of the orbicularis oris muscle in children with DS and lip incompetence was significantly higher compared to healthy children during saliva swallowing, lip compression, and when producing the syllable/pa/, and this may suggest greater muscular effort due to the need to seal the lips during these functional conditions.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,Mark A.

These effects are particularly relevant in the lung context, given the dynamic nature of cyclic stretch that the ECM is continuously subjected to during breathing. This work uses an in vivo model of pulmonary fibrosis to characterize the macro- and micromechanical properties of lung ECM subjected to stretch. To that aim, we have compared the micromechanical properties of fibrotic ECM in baseline and under stretch conditions, using a novel combination of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and a stretchable membrane-based chip. At the macroscale, fibrotic ECM displayed strain-hardening, with a stiffness one order of magnitude higher than its healthy counterpart. Conversely, at the microscale, we found a switch in the stretch-induced mechanical behaviour of the lung ECM from strain-hardening at physiological ECM stiffnesses to strain-softening at fibrotic ECM stiffnesses. Similarly, we observed solidification of healthy ECM versus fluidization of fibrotic ECM in response to stretch. Our results suggest that the mechanical behaviour of fibrotic ECM under stretch involves a potential built-in mechanotransduction mechanism that may slow down the progression of PF by steering resident fibroblasts away from a pro-fibrotic profile.",,"This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PID2020-113910RB-I00-AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SAF2017-85574-R, and PID2020-116808RB-I00 AEI-Retos) and SEPAR (900-2019).

It has been used as a predictor of long-term survival and prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of CCI score on mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients and test the efficacy of the CoLACD score (COVID-19 lymphocyte ratio, age, CCI score, dyspnoea) in predicting mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
METHODOLOGY: It was a retrospective cohort, and the data of this study were gathered from two tertiary hospitals of Karachi, including Liaquat National Hospital and Ziauddin Hospital. Data of patients hospitalized in any of these tertiary care hospitals and diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 infection were used in the study from January 15, 2021, to April 30, 2021.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 53.22 (±14.21) years. The majority of participants were males (74.91%). Predictors of mortality include CCI score, age of participants, D-dimer, smoking status, and shortness of breath. The sensitivity of this CoLACD score was 80.23%, and specificity was 50.23% (diagnostic accuracy is 60.45%). The negative predictive value (NPV) of this test was 39.44%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 83.01%.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that CCI can be used in a clinical setting to achieve a prediction of mortality in COVID-19 patients.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-11-27,2021,2021-11-27,2021-11-27,13,11,e19937,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmed, Jawad; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Capriles, Natalia M.

The objective was to analyze communicationally and evaluate the programs of both media. Thirty-two pieces from all educational levels were discussed, in seven months, with 27 expert communicators, and the experience from 50 target actors of the strategy was evaluated. The study was methodologically naturalistic, with a qualitative approach, indirect hermeneutical and phenomenological typologies, and under an open coding design. Eight categories generated by free will were found to show results on biased content and questionable forms of presentation; gaps were made visible at the educational, digital, and generational levels, and disarticulation between the education and communication axes.

Introducing novel dynamical variables, and a dimensionless time variable, the resulting dynamical system is studied. The main difficulties arising in the standard dynamical systems approach, where expansion normalized dynamical variables are usually adopted, are due to the oscillations entering the nonlinear system through the Klein–Gordon (KG) equations. This motivates the analysis of the oscillations using methods from the theory of averaging nonlinear dynamical systems. We prove that time-dependent systems, and their corresponding time-averaged versions, have the same late-time dynamics. Then, we study the time-averaged system using standard techniques of dynamical systems. We present numerical simulations as evidence of such behavior.","Genly Leon and Esteban González have the financial support of Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID through the program FONDECYT Iniciación Grant no. 11180126.

We determined the Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn levels in C. quitensis roots, leaves, and soils of origin using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. In January 2017, we collected samples from four geographical zones on the longitudinal gradient along which C. quitensis is distributed, starting from Punta Arenas (PAR) at the extreme south of mainland Chile and moving southwards to the Antarctic territory from King George Island (KGI) to Hannah Point Peninsula (PHA) and finally Lagotellerie Island (LAT). We used certified reference material to validate the plant tissues and soil samples we collected. The highest concentrations of metals that we measured in the soils and in the C. quitensis roots and leaves were in samples we collected at the KGI station, the zone with the greatest human activity. The lowest concentrations we measured were at the LAT station, an island with little human intervention and scarce fauna. The mean concentrations of metals in the roots and leaves of C. quitensis followed a similar order at all sampling locations: Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cd. In contrast, in soil, they followed the following order: Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cd. The concentration levels obtained for the different metals in the soil and plants tissue samples in this region of Antarctica indicated that the area was non-polluted. However, the metallic trace element (MTE) concentrations may be at an early stage of contamination, as described in other areas of the Antarctic, being a new threat to this continent.","The authors thanks the Environmental Chemistry Laboratory of the Natural Resources Chemistry Institute of the University of Talca, Talca, Chile, and INACH.","This research was funded by ANID-PIA-Anillo INACH ACT 192057 and by FONDAP-IDEAL, grant number 15150003.",Plants,,,,2021-11-26,2021,2021-11-26,,10,12,2593,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tapia, Jaime; Molina-Montenegro, Marco; Sandoval, Camila; Rivas, Natalia; Espinoza, Jessica; Basualto, Silvia; Fierro, Pablo; Vargas-Chacoff, Luis","Tapia, Jaime (Institute of Natural Resources Chemistry, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, j.espinoza@utalca.cl); Molina-Montenegro, Marco (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.); Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, CEAZA, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Sandoval, Camila (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Rivas, Natalia (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Espinoza, Jessica (Institute of Natural Resources Chemistry, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, j.espinoza@utalca.cl); Basualto, Silvia (EULA Center, University of Concepción, Concepción 4030000, Chile;, sbasualt@udec.cl); Fierro, Pablo (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile); Vargas-Chacoff, Luis (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Centro Fondap de Investigación de Altas Latitudes, FONDAP-IDEAL Center, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems, BASE, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile)","Tapia, Jaime (University of Talca); Fierro, Pablo (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile); Vargas-Chacoff, Luis (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Centro Fondap de Investigación de Altas Latitudes, FONDAP-IDEAL Center, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems, BASE, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile)","Tapia, Jaime (University of Talca); Molina-Montenegro, Marco (University of Talca; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.); Catholic University of the North); Sandoval, Camila (University of Talca; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Rivas, Natalia (University of Talca; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Espinoza, Jessica (University of Talca); Basualto, Silvia (University of Concepción); Fierro, Pablo (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile); Vargas-Chacoff, Luis (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Centro Fondap de Investigación de Altas Latitudes, FONDAP-IDEAL Center, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems, BASE, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile)",6,4,0.18,,https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/10/12/2593/pdf?version=1637913684,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143559361,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences",

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with kidney cancer were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to comprise the training group from 2010 to 2017, and the validation group was drawn from our academic medical center. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses explored the statistical relationships between the included variables and BM. Statistically significant risk factors were applied to develop a nomogram. Calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, probability density functions (PDF), and clinical utility curves (CUC) were used to verify the predictive performance. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves demonstrated survival differences between two subgroups of kidney cancer with and without BMs. A convenient web calculator was provided for users via ""shiny"" package.
RESULTS: A total of 43,503 patients were recruited in this study, of which 42,650 were training group cases and 853 validation group cases. The variables included in the nomogram were sex, pathological grade, T-stage, N-stage, sequence number, brain metastases, liver metastasis, pulmonary metastasis, histological type, primary site, and laterality. The calibration plots confirmed good agreement between the prediction model and the actual results. The area under the curve (AUC) values in the training and validation groups were 0.952 (95% CI, 0.950-0.954) and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.809-0.860), respectively. Based on CUC, we recommend a threshold probability of 5% to guide the diagnosis of BMs.
CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive predictive tool consisting of nomogram and web calculator contributes to risk stratification which helped clinicians identify high-risk cases and provide personalized treatment options.",The authors thank Haoxi Feng for his help in processing the figures.,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81601901) and Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning, China (No. 2019-MS-079).",Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-25,2021,2021-11-25,,11,,731905,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dong, Shengtao; Yang, Hua; Tang, Zhi-Ri; Ke, Yuqi; Wang, Haosheng; Li, Wenle; Tian, Kang","Dong, Shengtao (Department of Bone and Joint, First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China; Department of Spine Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China); Yang, Hua (Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China); Tang, Zhi-Ri (School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Ke, Yuqi (Department of Orthopaedics Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China); Wang, Haosheng (Orthopaedic Medical Center, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China); Li, Wenle (Department of Orthopedics, Xianyang Central Hospital, Xianyang, China; Clinical Medical Research Center, Xianyang Center Hospital, Xianyang, China); Tian, Kang (Department of Bone and Joint, First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China)","Li, Wenle (Xian Yang Central Hospital; Clinical Medical Research Center, Xianyang Center Hospital, Xianyang, China); Tian, Kang (Dalian Medical University)","Dong, Shengtao (Dalian Medical University; Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Yang, Hua (Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Tang, Zhi-Ri (Wuhan University); Ke, Yuqi (Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Wang, Haosheng (Second Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University); Li, Wenle (Xian Yang Central Hospital; Clinical Medical Research Center, Xianyang Center Hospital, Xianyang, China); Tian, Kang (Dalian Medical University)",15,10,1.16,5.61,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.731905/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143508172,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Solid complexes were separated from water by vacuum filtration, and factors such as lime/sodium carbonate ratio, kaolin content, flocculation time, and flocculant dose are evaluated. The growth of the aggregates was captured in situ by a focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) probe. Solid magnesium and calcium complexes are formed in raw seawater at pH 11, impairing the performance of flocculant polymers based on polyacrylamides. The results show that the settling rate improved when the treatment's lime/sodium carbonate ratio increased. That is, when a greater removal of magnesium is prioritized over calcium. The amount of magnesium required to be removed depends on the mineralogy of the system: more clay will require more significant removal of magnesium. These results respond to the structural changes of the flocs, achieving that the more magnesium is removed, the greater the size and density of the aggregates. In contrast, calcium removal does not significantly influence flocculant performance. The study suggests the necessary conditions for each type of tailing to maximize water recovery, contributing to the effective closure of the water cycle in processes that use seawater with magnesium control.","Ricardo I.

Here, we aimed to develop an m6A-related risk signature to improve prognostic and immunotherapy responder prediction performance in the context of melanoma. We comprehensively analyzed the m6A cluster and immune infiltration phenotypes of public datasets. The TCGA (n = 457) and eleven independent melanoma cohorts (n = 758) were used as the training and validation datasets, respectively. We identified two m6A clusters (m6A-clusterA and m6A-clusterB) based on the expression pattern of m6A regulators via unsupervised consensus clustering. IGF2BP1 (7.49%), KIAA1429 (7.06%), and YTHDC1 (4.28%) were the three most frequently mutated genes. There was a correlation between driver genes mutation statuses and the expression of m6A regulators. A significant difference in tumor-associated immune infiltration between two m6A clusters was detected. Compared with m6A-clusterA, the m6A-clusterB was characterized by a lower immune score and immune cell infiltration but higher mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi). An m6A-related risk signature consisting of 12 genes was determined via Cox regression analysis and divided the patients into low- and high-risk groups (IL6ST, MBNL1, NXT2, EIF2A, CSGALNACT1, C11orf58, CD14, SPI1, NCCRP1, BOK, CD74, PAEP). A nomogram was developed for the prediction of the survival rate. Compared with the high-risk group, the low-risk group was characterized by high expression of immune checkpoints and immunophenoscore (IPS), activation of immune-related pathways, and more enriched in immune cell infiltrations. The low-risk group had a favorable prognosis and contained the potential beneficiaries of the immune checkpoint blockade therapy and verified by the IMvigor210 cohort (n = 298). The m6A-related signature we have determined in melanoma highlights the relationships between m6A regulators and immune cell infiltration. The established risk signature was identified as a promising clinical biomarker of melanoma.",We would like to thank Dr. Xiangchun Li for his helpful discussion and advice.,This work was supported by the Tianjin Municipal Education Commission (No. 2016YD21).,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,,,2021-11-25,2021,2021-11-25,,9,,718912,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wu, Liuxing; Hu, Xin; Dai, Hongji; Chen, Kexin; Liu, Ben","Wu, Liuxing (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Hu, Xin (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Dai, Hongji (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Chen, Kexin (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Liu, Ben (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China)","Liu, Ben (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital)","Wu, Liuxing (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Hu, Xin (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Dai, Hongji (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Chen, Kexin (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Liu, Ben (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital)",8,4,0.43,2.05,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.718912/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143507025,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Literature has identified around 140 possible growth factors, therefore given the contradictory results obtained from previous empirical studies it is crucial we understand the actual role of the Internet. Using the conditional convergence theory and a Bayesian panel data model averaging method from a sample of 100 countries between 1994 and 2017, our results demonstrate that an increase in access to the Internet is a non-determinant factor in economic convergence, being its probability of inclusion in the true growth model conditioned by the regressors included in the estimates and the time span analysed.

For the service sector and, particularly for the retail industry, we initially propose a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model that determines how many employees should be multiskilled, in which and how many departments they should be trained, and how their weekly working hours will be assigned. Then, the deterministic model is reformulated using a two-stage stochastic optimization (TSSO) model to explicitly incorporate the uncertain personnel demand. The methodology is tested for a case study using real and simulated data derived from a Chilean retail store. We also compare the TSSO approach solutions with the myopic approaches' solutions (i.e., zero and total multiskilling). The case study is oriented to answer two key questions: how much multiskilling to add and how to add it. Results show that TSSO approach solutions always report maximum reliability for all levels of demand variability considered. It was also observed that, for high levels of demand variability, a k-chaining policy with k≥2 is more cost-effective than a 2-chaining policy. Finally, to evaluate the conservatism level in the solutions reported by the TSSO approach, two truncation types in the probability density function (pdf) associated with the personnel demand were considered. Results show that, if the pdf is only truncated at zero (more conservative truncation) the levels of required multiskilling are higher than when the pdf is truncated at 5th and 95th percentiles (less conservative truncation).",,,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,,,Cost-Benefit Analysis; Policy; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,2021,19,1,892-917,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mercado, Yessica Andrea; Henao, César Augusto; González, Virginia I.","Mercado, Yessica Andrea (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

We also aimed to explore differences in body composition (BC), physical fitness (PF), and physical activity (PA) between satisfied and dissatisfied adolescents and to find the associations between BD and these parameters.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study carried out in Jalisco (Mexico) in which 451 adolescents (43.68% males, 43.90% rural) aged 13-17 years were evaluated. BD and self-perceived PF and PA were assessed with validated questionnaires, while objectively measured PF (strength, explosive strength, speed-agility, and cardiovascular fitness) was assessed using field tests. To evaluate BC, anthropometric measures and bioelectric impedance analysis were carried out. Regression analysis was used to ascertain the associations between health-related factors and body dissatisfaction.
RESULTS: Girls obtained higher scores on the BD questionnaire than boys (11.12 ± 3.13 vs. 10.33 ± 2.73; p < 0.05), whereas no geographical differences between rural and urban adolescents were found. BD was positively associated with higher fat mass (β = 0.15; p < 0.001), and negatively associated with muscle mass and PF (β = -0.24 and β = -0.23; p < 0.001). However, PA was not associated with any of the measured parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: selected parameters of BC, PF, and sex have an impact on the Mexican adolescent's body satisfaction levels and should be considered when designing future health policies.","The authors would like to thank the North School (CUNORTE) and the School of Health Sciences (CUCS) of the University of Guadalajara, Mexico and the professionals and the students who collaborated making this study possible.",This study received funding from CONACYT (CVU 22064) and from the Program to Strengthen Research and Graduate Studies of the University of Guadalajara.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Mexico; Physical Fitness,2021-11-20,2021,2021-11-20,,18,22,12215,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera-Ochoa, María; Arroyo-Bello, Marta; Mañas, Asier; Quesada-González, Carlos; Vizmanos-Lamotte, Barbara; González-Gross, Marcela; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia","Rivera-Ochoa, María (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.); North University Center, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara 44430, Mexico); Arroyo-Bello, Marta (Department of Psychology, University of Westminster, London W1B 2HW, UK;, m.arroyobello@hotmail.com; Department of Psychology, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), 28040 Madrid, Spain); Mañas, Asier (Deapartment of Physical Activity and Sports Sciences, GENUD Toledo Research Group, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 45071 Toledo, Spain;, asier.manas@uclm.es; Carlos III Health Institute, CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), 28029 Madrid, Spain); Quesada-González, Carlos (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.); Department of Applied Mathematics to Information and Communication Technologies, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Vizmanos-Lamotte, Barbara (Institute of Nutrigenetics and Translational Nutrigenomics, University Center for Health Sciences, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara 44430, Mexico;, bvizmanos@yahoo.com.mx); González-Gross, Marcela (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.)); Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.); Carlos III Health Institute, CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), 28029 Madrid, Spain)","Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia (Technical University of Madrid; Instituto de Salud Carlos III)","Rivera-Ochoa, María (Technical University of Madrid; University of Guadalajara); Arroyo-Bello, Marta (University of Westminster; National University of Distance Education); Mañas, Asier (University of Castilla-La Mancha; Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Quesada-González, Carlos (Technical University of Madrid; Technical University of Madrid); Vizmanos-Lamotte, Barbara (University of Guadalajara); González-Gross, Marcela (Technical University of Madrid); Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia (Technical University of Madrid; Instituto de Salud Carlos III)",2,2,,0.83,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/22/12215/pdf?version=1637646724,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143321931,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3213 Paediatrics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

One of the leading causes is the expansion of large-scale operations that exploit natural resources for world market exportation with low processing. In this paper, we study the changes in agricultural activities, livestock, and land use in the Calama oasis (the Atacama Desert, northern Chile) in relation to the growth of large-scale copper mining and other chained processes (urbanization and increased demand for water resources); based on a mixed methodology combining descriptive statistics, archival and bibliographic review, ethnography, and spatial analysis. We present the results through a historical reconstruction of the analyzed dimensions and their relationships, accounting for contradictory dynamics in time and space. We identify how mining and urban growth promote some agricultural and livestock activities under certain economic and political conditions, while in other contexts, these activities have been severely weakened, seeing increasing urbanization of rural land, rural-urban pluriactivity, and a growing deagrarianization.","We acknowledge support from Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID), Fondecyt 1201527.

Currently only little information on toxicity and drug interaction potential of the extracts is available. This study now evaluated the effects of two Salix cortex extracts on human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells, in view of clinically relevant CYP450 enzyme activity modulation, cytotoxicity and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Drug metabolism via the CYP450 enzyme system is considered an important parameter for the occurrence of drug-drug interactions, which can lead to toxicity, decreased pharmacological activity, and adverse drug reactions. We evaluated two different bark extracts standardized to 10 mg/ml phenolic content. Herein, extract S6 (S. pentandra, containing 8.15 mg/ml total salicylates and 0.08 mg/ml salicin) and extract B (industrial reference, containing 5.35 mg/ml total salicylates and 2.26 mg/ml salicin) were tested. Both Salix cortex extracts showed no relevant reduction in cell viability or increase in ROS production in hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells. However, they reduced CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzyme activity after 48 h at ≥25 μg/ml, this was statistically significant only for S6. CYP2C19 activity inhibition (0.5 h) was also observed at ≥25 μg/ml, mRNA expression inhibition by 48 h treatment with S6 at 25 μg/ml. In conclusion, at higher concentrations, the tested Salix cortex extracts showed a drug interaction potential, but with different potency. Given the high prevalence of polypharmacy, particularly in the elderly with chronic pain, further systematic studies of Salix species of medical interest should be conducted in the future to more accurately determine the risk of potential drug interactions.","The authors are grateful to Monika Phillip for experimental support.

The proper logistics village selection is a crucial, complicated, and time-consuming process for decision-makers who have to make the right and optimal decision on this issue. Decision-makers need a methodological frame with a practical algorithm that can be implemented quickly to solve these decision-making problems. Within this scope, the current paper aims to present an evaluation tool, which provides more reasonable and reliable results for decision-makers to solve the logistics village selection problem that is very complicated and has uncertain conditions based on fuzzy approaches. In this study, we propose the Improved Fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (IMF SWARA), a modified and extended version of the traditional fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (F-SWARA) to identify the criteria weights. Also, we suggest applying the fuzzy Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (F-MABAC) technique to determine the preference ratings of the alternatives. This combination has many valuable contributions. For example, it proposes to use a more reliable and consistent evaluation scale based on fuzzy sets. Hence, decision-makers can perform more reliable and reasonable pairwise comparisons by considering this evaluation scale. Besides, it presents a multi-attribute evaluation system based on the identified criteria weights. From this perspective, the proposed model is implemented to evaluate eight different logistics village alternatives with respect to nine selection criteria. According to the analysis results, while A8 is the most appropriate option, C1 Gross National Product (GNP) is the most significant criterion. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness and validation of the proposed model, and the results of the analysis approve the validity and applicability of the proposed model. As a result, the suggested integrated MCDM framework can be applied as a valuable and practical decision-making tool to develop new strategies and improve the logistics operations by decision-makers.",,,Technological and Economic Development of Economy,,,,2021-11-18,2021,2021-11-18,2021-12-09,27,6,1582-1612,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Görçün, Ömer Faruk; Küçükönder, Hande","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Faculty of Business, Kadir Has University, Cibaly, Fatih Istanbul, Turkey); Küçükönder, Hande (Faculty of Economics, Bartin University, Merkez, Bartin, Turkey)",,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Görçün, Ömer Faruk (Kadir Has University); Küçükönder, Hande (Bartin University)",30,23,,,https://journals.vilniustech.lt/index.php/TEDE/article/download/16004/10884,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143772478,38 Economics; 44 Human Society; 49 Mathematical Sciences,

During the last decade, a shift in serotype prevalence has occurred as traditionally less prevalent serotypes are increasing in frequency of infections, especially those related to poultry meat contamination. S. Infantis is one of the major emerging serotypes, and these strains commonly display antimicrobial resistance and can persist despite cleaning protocols. Thus, this work aimed to isolate S. Infantis strains from a poultry meat farm in Santiago, Chile and to characterize genetic variations present in them. We determined their genomic and phenotypic profiles at different points along the production line. The results indicate that the strains encompass 853 polymorphic sites (core-SNPs) with isolates differing from one another by 0-347 core SNPs, suggesting variation among them; however, we found discrete correlations with the source of the sample in the production line. Furthermore, the pan-genome was composed of 4854 total gene clusters of which 2618 (53.9%) corresponds to the core-genome and only 181 (3.7%) are unique genes (those present in one particular strain). This preliminary analysis will enrich the surveillance of Salmonella, yet further studies are required to assess their evolution and phylogeny.","Genome sequencing was carried out by MicrobesNG (http://www.microbesng.uk, accessed on 13 February 2021), which is supported by the BBSRC (grant number BB/L024209/1).

A total of 5183 people from the aforementioned countries participated, selected using the snowball sampling method. Measurement invariance was assessed by multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) and Multi-Group Factor Analysis Alignment (CFA-MIAL). In addition, item characteristics were assessed based on Item Response Theory. The results indicate that the original five-item version of the PCIBS is not adequate; whereas a four-item version of the PCIBS (PCIBS-4) showed a good fit in all countries. Thus, using the MG-CFA method, the PCIBS-4 achieved metric invariance, while the CFA-MIAL method indicated that the PCIBS-4 shows metric and scalar invariance. Likewise, the four items present increasing difficulties and high values in the discrimination parameters. The comparison of means of the PCIBS-4 reported irrelevant differences between countries; however, Mexico and Peru presented the highest frequency of preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. It is concluded that the PCIBS-4 is a unidimensional self-report measure which is reliable and invariant across the twelve participating Latin American countries. It is expected that the findings will be of interest to social and health scientists, as well as those professionals directly involved in public health decision making.","The authors would like to thank the respondents, who kindly participated in this research.",This research was funded by COVID-19 crisis seed grant from Universidad Privada del Norte to TC-R (registry number: FCS_UPN_2021-2).,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-11-16,2021,2021-11-16,,12,,763993,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Valencia, Pablo D.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Vivanco-Vidal, Andrea; Saroli-Araníbar, Daniela; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; White, Michel; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Gallegos, Miguel; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Palacios, Diego Alejandro; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Ferrari, Ilka Franco; Flores-Mendoza, Carmen; Figares, Andrés Buschiazzo; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín Enrique; Calderón, Raymundo; Tapia, Bismarck Pinto; Gallegos, Walter L.

One of its complications is neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), which is mainly caused by sympathetic hyperactivity. Due to the complexity of the pathophysiological process and the unspecificity of the clinical presentation, it is little known by general practitioners, medical students and other health care workers not directly related to the neurological part, making the management of this chaotic condition difficult. This review aims to present recent evidence on clinical concepts relevant to the identification and management of NPE secondary to SAH.Main body of the abstractNPE is defined as a syndrome of acute onset following significant central nervous system (CNS) injury. Its etiology has been proposed to stem from the release of catecholamines that produce cardiopulmonary dysfunction, with this syndrome being associated with spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disorders, traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, and meningitis. NPE has long been considered a rare event; but it may occur more frequently, mainly in patients with SAH. There are two clinical presentations of NPE: the early form develops in the first hours/minutes after injury, while the late form presents 12–24 h after neurological injury. Clinical manifestations consist of non-specific signs of respiratory distress: dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia, pink expectoration, crackles on auscultation, which usually resolve within 24–48 h in 50% of patients. Unfortunately, there are no tools to make the specific diagnosis, so the diagnosis is by exclusion. The therapeutic approach consists of two interventions: treatment of the underlying neurological injury to reduce intracranial pressure and control sympathetic hyperactivity related to the lung injury, and supportive treatment for pulmonary edema.Short conclusionSAH is a severe condition that represents a risk to the life of the affected patient due to the possible complications that may develop. NPE is one of these complications, which due to the common manifestation of a respiratory syndrome, does not allow early and accurate diagnosis, being a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, in any case of CNS lesion with pulmonary involvement, NPE should be suspected immediately.",Not applicable.,FundingThis study was not funded by any source.

Our study is to identify a robust prognostic marker for bladder cancer.
METHODS: The transcriptome and clinical data of bladder cancer were downloaded from multiple databases. We searched for genes with robust prognosis by Kaplan-Meier analysis of the whole genome. CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithm was used to calculate the degree of immune cell infiltration.
RESULTS: We identified OLFML2B as a robust prognostic marker for bladder cancer in five cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a high level of OLFML2B expression had a poor prognosis. The expression of OLFML2B increased with the increase of stage and grade. We found that patients with high expression of OLFML2B still had a poor prognosis in two small bladder cancer cohorts. OLFML2B also has the prognostic ability in ten other tumors, and the prognosis is poor in high expression. The correlation analysis between OLFML2B and immune cells showed that it was positively correlated with the degree of macrophage infiltration and highly co-expressed with tumor-associated macrophage markers. Finally, the Wound-healing assay and Colony formation assay results showed that the migration and proliferation ability of bladder cancer cell lines decreased after the knockdown of OLFML2B.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, OLFML2B is a robust risk prognostic marker, and it can help patients with bladder cancer improve individualized treatment.","We appreciate the free use of TCGA, GEO, ArrayExpress databases.",,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,,11,,650678,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lin, Jiaxing; Xu, Xiao; Li, Tianren; Yao, Jihang; Yu, Meng; Zhu, Yuyan; Sun, Dan","Lin, Jiaxing (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Xu, Xiao (Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, The Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Li, Tianren (Department of Gynaecology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Yao, Jihang (Department of Gynaecology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Yu, Meng (Department of Reproductive Biology and Transgenic Animal, China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Zhu, Yuyan (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Sun, Dan (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China)","Sun, Dan (First Hospital of China Medical University)","Lin, Jiaxing (First Hospital of China Medical University); Xu, Xiao (Sheng Jing Hospital); Li, Tianren (First Hospital of China Medical University); Yao, Jihang (First Hospital of China Medical University); Yu, Meng (China Medical University); Zhu, Yuyan (First Hospital of China Medical University); Sun, Dan (First Hospital of China Medical University)",5,4,0.41,1.28,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.650678/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142580058,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Se realizó un estudio cualitativo basado en el análisis fenomenológico interpretativo (AFI) para comprender la experiencia de hospitalización en una clínica psiquiátrica. Los participantes fueron tres usuarios que respondieron a entrevistas semiestructuradas, analizadas a través de los lineamientos del AFI. Los resultados indicaron tres temas maestros: la persona en la esquizofrenia, las experiencias previas a la hospitalización, y la hospitalización como una experiencia compleja. El análisis permite considerar la importancia del ingreso voluntario o involuntario en la experiencia de admisión, la angustia e incertidumbre por falta de información, la escasa participación en el proceso de tratamiento, y la percepción de inseguridad dentro de las instituciones de internación. Por otra parte, se hizo mención al rechazo al uso de la contención o aislamiento, la falta de actividades, el énfasis en la medicación, el diagnóstico y los síntomas, así como la actitud deshumanizada de algunos profesionales de la salud mental. Se requiere más investigación respecto a la eficacia de la internación en unidades de salud mental y la superioridad frente a otras alternativas basadas en la comunidad.

The participants were three users who responded to semi-structured interviews, analyzed through the AFI guidelines. The results indicated three master themes: the person in schizophrenia, experiences prior to hospitalization, and hospitalization as a complex experience. The analysis allows considering the importance of voluntary or involuntary admission in the admission experience, the anguish and uncertainty due to the lack of information and participation in the treatment process, the perception of insecurity within the institutionalization. On the other hand, the rejection of the use of restraint and isolation, the lack of activities, the emphasis on medication, diagnosis, and symptoms, as well as the dehumanized attitude of some mental health professionals.

Two types of knowledge, whose link has been taken for granted, but which has seldom been analyzed in depth in order to fully dimension the interdefinitions and reciprocity between these fields of knowledge. Regularly, history and archival science have fallen into a meaningless feud over who is ""auxiliary to"" whom. A legacy of the old intellectual hierarchies of positivism that still does not seem to be out of date. It is argued that archival science is a central part of the historical institution, just as historical rationality is an inseparable component of the archival knowledge structure. In other words, the relationship between archiving and historical inquiry is dialectical and mutually complementary, without one the other is not possible.",,,e-Ciencias de la Información,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Puentes-Cala, Mauricio","Puentes-Cala, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, COLOMBIA)",,"Puentes-Cala, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,1.05,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/eciencias/article/download/48172/49374,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145027342,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,
427,pub.1142575061,10.1002/er.7472,,,Ultrahigh‐areal‐capacitance aqueous supercapacitors enabled by soft biomass‐derived porous carbon membrane,"Sustainable biomass‐derived carbons in powdery forms have shown to be high‐performance capacitive electrode materials for application in supercapacitors (SCs) due to their large specific surface area, distinct porous structure, and low cost; however, their practical applications are being largely hampered due to their powdery status‐related issues including tedious electrode assembly process and insufficient capacitance and cycling stability. Herein, we develop a porous carbon membrane, termed as PECM, by direct carbonization of Pleurotus eryngii (PE) using KOH as activator. The as‐fabricated PECM features a hierarchically nanostructure with high porosity, large specific surface area, and excellent electrolyte wettability, which cannot only afford a large usable active area for the interfacial adsorption of electrolyte ions but also supply fast diffusion pathways for electrolyte ions. Moreover, the as‐fabricated PECM is doped with N and also has large amounts of O, S, and P‐containing functional groups, which would be expected to contribute additional pseudocapacitance. More importantly, the as‐fabricated PECM has excellent mechanical performance and can be directly used to assembly an aqueous symmetric SC device. Attributing to the above structural merits of PECM, the two‐electrode symmetric SC assembled using two identical PECM‐800 electrodes (~20 mg cm−2 for each electrode), exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with ultrahigh areal capacitance (4.6 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2), excellent long‐term cycling stability (113% capacitance retention after 20 000 cycles), and superior energy densities of 0.24 to 0.09 mWh cm−2 at power densities of 5.20 to 51.9 mW cm−2. This work offers a new insight on employing biomass to prepare value‐added and practically applicable carbon materials for the application in SCs. A heteroatom‐doped porous carbon membrane (PECM) is fabricated via direct pyrolysis of Pleurotus eryngii (PE) using KOH as an activator and directly used as a self‐supported electrode for assembling an aqueous supercapacitor. The PECM possesses a hierarchically porous structure, high graphitization degree, excellent mechanical strength, and superior electrolyte wettability. The symmetric aqueous supercapacitor based on PECM exhibits ultrahigh areal capacitance of 4.6 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 and a maximum energy density of 0.24 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 5.20 mW cm−2.","This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province (2021AAC02016 and 2021AAC03201), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University (FWNX41), the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Projects for Returnees of Ningxia Province, the Foundation of Academic Top‐notch Talent Support Program of the North Minzu University (2019BGBZ08), the Leading Talents Program of Science and Technology Innovation in Ningxia Province (2020GKLRLX14), and the Cooperative Scientific Research Project of Chunhui Plan of Ministry of Education of China (201900081).","Funding information Foundation of Academic Top‐notch Talent Support Program of the North Minzu University, Grant/Award Number: 2019BGBZ08; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University, Grant/Award Number: FWNX41; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Projects for Returnees of Ningxia Province; Leading Talents Program of Science and Technology Innovation in Ningxia Province, Grant/Award Number: 2020GKLRLX14; Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province, Grant/Award Numbers: 2021AAC02016, 2021AAC03201; the Cooperative Scientific Research Project of Chunhui Plan of Ministry of Education of China, Grant/Award Number: 201900081",International Journal of Energy Research,,,,2021-11-14,2021,2021-11-14,2022-03-25,46,4,4781-4793,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cui, Mengxia; Wang, Fang; Zhang, Zhengguo; Min, Shixiong","Cui, Mengxia (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China); Wang, Fang (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China); Zhang, Zhengguo (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China); Min, Shixiong (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China)","Min, Shixiong (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University)","Cui, Mengxia (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University); Wang, Fang (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University); Zhang, Zhengguo (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University); Min, Shixiong (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University)",13,11,,1.78,https://doi.org/10.1002/er.7472,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142575061,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Translocated orangutans exposed to human diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), pose risks to wild and previously released conspecifics. Wildlife disease risk experts recommended halting great ape translocations during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize risk of disease transmission to wild populations. We collected data on orangutan releases and associated disease risk management in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic, and developed a problem description for orangutan disease and conservation risks. We identified that at least 15 rehabilitated ex-captive and 27 wild captured orangutans were released during the study period. Identified disease risks included several wild-to-wild translocated orangutans in direct contact or proximity to humans without protective equipment, and formerly captive rehabilitated orangutans that have had long periods of contact and potential exposure to human diseases. While translocation practitioners typically employ mitigation measures to decrease disease transmission likelihood, these measures cannot eliminate all risk, and are not consistently applied. COVID-19 and other diseases of human origin can be transmitted to orangutans, which could have catastrophic impacts on wild orangutans, other susceptible fauna, and humans should disease transmission occur. We recommend stakeholders conduct a Disease Risk Analysis for orangutan translocation, and improve pathogen surveillance and mitigation measures to decrease the likelihood of potential outbreaks. We also suggest refocusing conservation efforts on alternatives to wild-to-wild translocation including mitigating human-orangutan interactions, enforcing laws and protecting orangutan habitats to conserve orangutans in situ.","We thank all participating individuals for information on orangutan releases, other conservation activities, and disease risks.

METHODOLOGY: It was a retrospective study, and the data was acquired at Ziauddin Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. All patients admitted between February and May 2021 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal samples were included in the study, including those who received at least five-day treatment of remdesivir and who did not receive even a single dose of remdesivir.
RESULTS: Data of overall 174 patients were used, out of which 71 (40.80%) received remdesivir. After propensity score matching, 71 patients in the remdesivir group were successfully matched with the non-remdesivir patients on the basis of age, gender, and disease severity. Results of multivariable logistic regression showed that there is no significant difference in deaths between patients who received remdesivir and patients who did not receive remdesivir (p-value=0.122). However, the length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the remdesivir group than in the control group (p-value=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Results of this study can provide evidence that remdesivir can be efficient in reducing the duration of COVID-19 illness, and a five-day course of treatment is sufficient for patients to get clinical benefits.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-11-11,2021,2021-11-11,2021-11-11,13,11,e19487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Butt, Ahmad G.; Ahmed, Jahanzeb; Shah, Syed Muhammad Huzaifa; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Al-Rihani, Hady; Ahmed, Bilal; Salman, Muhammad; Devi, Arti; Wali, Sher; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño","Butt, Ahmad G.

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a frequent threat to computer networks because of its disruption to the services they cause. This disruption results in the instability and/or inoperability of the network. There are different classes of DDoS attacks, each with a different mode of operation, so detecting them has become a difficult task for network monitoring and control systems. The objective of this work is based on the exploration and choice of a set of data that represents DDoS attack events, on their treatment in a preprocessing phase, and later, the generation of a model of sequential neural networks of multi-class classification. This is done to identify and classify the various types of DDoS attacks. The result was compared with previous works treating the same dataset used herein. We compared their classification method, against ours. During this research, the CIC DDoS2019 dataset was used. Previous works carried out with this dataset proposed a binary classification approach, our approach is based on multi-classification. Our proposed model was capable of achieving around 94% in metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score.

It is usually associated with hypertensive states, but it is not exclusively related to those.  A healthy 18-year-old primigravid woman with no proteinuria or hypertension on admission presented with normotensive PRES. She had an intense diffuse headache that preceded a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Her neurological status deteriorated, and hypertension was detected afterward. Brain imaging revealed bilateral vasogenic edema in the occipital region. Magnesium sulfate and antihypertensive medications were administered.

This study explored the association between ureteral double J stent colonization and lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) severity. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2021 to June 2021 in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, who required double J stent (DJS) insertion. Patients who came to the site for stent removal were invited to participate in the study and enrolled using a consecutive sampling technique between January 15, 2021, and March 15, 2021. Results The study enrolled 176 patients, of whom 73.33% had colonization and the remaining had no colonization. The factors significantly associated with symptom severity included colonization of the DJS (P-value = 0.001) and the patients' ages (P-value = 0.046). The two groups have significantly different symptoms, which included incontinence (P-value = 0.001), polyuria (P-value = 0.001), and nocturia (P-value = 0.001).

This paper presents a highly automated, novel method to enhance the accuracy of utility distribution feeder models to capture their performance by matching simulation results with corresponding field measurements. The method is demonstrated using an actual feeder from an electrical utility with high penetration of DERs. The method proposed uses advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) voltage and derived active power measurements at the customer level, and data acquisition systems (DAS) measurements at the feeder-head, in conjunction with an AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) to estimate customer active and reactive power consumption over a time horizon, while accounting for unmetered loads. The ACOPF uses the measured voltage magnitudes, derived active power measurements, and the feeder head measurements to obtain a complete active power and reactive power capture of the feeder loads. Additionally, the method proposed estimates both voltage magnitude and angle for each phase at the unbalanced distribution substation. The accuracy of the method developed is verified in two stages: by comparing the time-series power flow results obtained from the enhancement algorithm with OpenDSS results and with the field measurements available. The proposed approach seamlessly manages the data available from the optimization procedure through the final model verification automatically.","This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy under Award DE-AR0001001 and in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, Solar Energy Technologies Office, under Award DE-EE0008773.",,IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy,,,,2021-11-08,2021,2021-11-08,2022-01-01,9,,2-15,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montano-Martinez, Karen; Thakar, Sushrut; Ma, Shanshan; Soltani, Zahra; Vittal, Vijay; Khorsand, Mojdeh; Ayyanar, Rajapandian; Rojas, Cynthia","Montano-Martinez, Karen (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Thakar, Sushrut (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Ma, Shanshan (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Soltani, Zahra (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Vittal, Vijay (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Khorsand, Mojdeh (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Ayyanar, Rajapandian (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Rojas, Cynthia (Arizona Public Service, Phoenix, AZ, 85072, USA)","Vittal, Vijay (Arizona State University)","Montano-Martinez, Karen (Arizona State University); Thakar, Sushrut (Arizona State University); Ma, Shanshan (Arizona State University); Soltani, Zahra (Arizona State University); Vittal, Vijay (Arizona State University); Khorsand, Mojdeh (Arizona State University); Ayyanar, Rajapandian (Arizona State University); Rojas, Cynthia (Arizona Public Service, Phoenix, AZ, 85072, USA)",15,11,,5.07,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8784343/9662292/09606764.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142522889,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

The worldwide prevalence of H. pylori infection is greater than 50%, constituting a public health problem. Different species of Helicobacter were described, which affect both animals and humans, and may be responsible for zoonoses. The colonization process of this bacterium depends largely on its binding to glycoconjugates present in the gastric mucosa of the host. The pig represents the animal model of choice for the study of infection by this bacterium. The objective of the present work was to analyze the behavior of the glucose/mannose glycoconjugate in the gastric mucosa of pigs affected by gastritis caused by Helicobacter sp. Samples from the antral region of the stomach of crossbred pigs were used, obtained from slaughterhouse in the Río Cuarto (Argentina).

The hypotheses of this study hold that (1) self-reports of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients and caregivers would be positively correlated, (2) caregivers would self-report a greater impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and (3) patients infected with COVID-19 would experience lower levels of mental health improvement and higher levels of psychological distress. Hypotheses were tested using correlations, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen's d). The results showed that patients with schizophrenia who had been in quarantine for almost a year showed similar levels of concern as their caregivers in the domains of health and social life. However, caregivers showed significant differences from patients in the areas of income, concern, and employment status. In addition, patients who were infected with COVID-19 showed lower levels of well-being and worse psychological recovery. The implications of the findings highlight the need to incorporate mental health interventions in the pandemic health context for caregivers of people with schizophrenia.

A total of 4,881 individuals, selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. Moderate and severe levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety were identified, as well as a moderate average level of fear of COVID-19. In addition, it was observed that about a quarter of the participants presented symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and a major depressive episode. Fear of COVID-19 significantly and positively predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas the effects of socio-demographic variables are generally low [χ2(287) = 5936.96, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.064 [0.062, 0.065]; CFI = 0.947; and SRMR = 0.050]. This suggests the need for the implementation of preventive actions in the general population of these countries, with the aim of reducing the prevalence of depressive, anxious and fearful symptoms related to COVID-19.","The authors would like to thank the respondents, who kindly participated in this research.",This research was funded by COVID-19 crisis seed grant from Universidad Privada del Norte to TC-R (registry number: FCS_UPN_2021-2).,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-11-05,2021,2021-11-05,,12,,695989,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Tomás, José M.; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Cervigni, Mauricio; Gallegos, Miguel; Martino, Pablo; Barés, Ignacio; Calandra, Manuel; Anacona, César Armando Rey; López-Calle, Claudio; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Chacón-Andrade, Edgardo René; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; del Carpio, Perla; Quintero, Yazmín; Robles, Erika; Lombardo, Macerlo Panza; Recalde, Olivia Gamarra; Figares, Andrés Buschiazzo; White, Michael; Videla, Carmen Burgos","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Tomás, José M.

In this context, the identification of key and fragile habitat-forming species is particularly important. Despite their ecological importance, whip corals in the order Antipatharia remain poorly studied around the world, and especially in the South Pacific. During recent expeditions to explore mesophotic and deep benthic habitats around Rapa Nui (Easter Island), dense assemblages of whip black corals were observed in situ. We here report the first detailed description of the distribution and abundance of these black coral assemblages and their associated fauna and habitat. These descriptions were based on analysis of video surveys collected on 67 remotely operated vehicle dives conducted in 2014 through 2019 at three sites (Pukao seamount, Apolo peak, and Rapa Nui Island shelf and slope) within the Easter Island Ecoregion at depths between 50 and 330 m. At least four morphotypes (yellow, red, white/orange, and Pukao) of unbranched black corals were detected. Each morphotype had polyps arranged in a single row on only one side of the corallum, a diagnostic morphological character currently assigned to the antipatharian genus Stichopathes. Samples of the yellow and red morphotypes were collected and studied using morphological and molecular techniques. These analyses indicate that the genus Stichopathes is not monophyletic and requires further revisions, a conclusion that is consistent with previous studies. Extensive fields of whip black corals, primarily of the yellow and red morphotype, were present at 28 sites from 60 to 245 m on rocky substrates, coarse sand, or rhodoliths. Densities of these assemblages per frame were up to 58.2 ± 5.2 colonies m–2 (average: 13.2 ± 0.8), which represent some of the highest reported densities for black corals to date. Numerous faunal groups, including ophiuroids, echinoids, and fishes, were associated with these whip black coral assemblages. Our observations should be considered in future management and conservation efforts around Rapa Nui, where a multi-use marine protected area was established in 2018, as well as in adjacent international waters that remain unprotected but likely harbor similar assemblages.","We thank Poky Tane Haoa, Ricardo Hito, Enrique Pate, and Enrique Hey from the Rapa Nui community for their collaboration during field work.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Satisfaction with Sex Life Scale (SWSLS). Methods: 2,154 Portuguese individuals (M = 34.67 years, SD = 17.18) participated. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and item response theory (IRT) were used. Specifically, the internal structure, reliability and factor invariance of the SWSLS were evaluated by sex and age, as well as the characteristics and performance of the items based on the IRT analysis. Results: The SWSLS Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed that a one-dimensional model fit the data well, both for the total sample and for each sex and age group. Furthermore, the SWSLS has adequate reliability for internal consistency. Factor invariance across sex and age was supported by confirmatory multigroup factor analysis. The graduated response model showed a good fit for the one-dimensional model, while the item and test information curves indicated that the SWSLS is more informative to identify high levels of sexual satisfaction.

We conducted a survey of infaunal communities within three separate water basins [Mosquito Lagoon (ML), Indian River (IR), and Banana River (BR)] in the larger Northern Indian River Lagoon, FL, United States to establish a database of infaunal community structure and function. Twenty-seven sites were sampled quarterly from 2014 to 2016. Analysis of all samples determined that basin, season, and sediment composition were the primary drivers of macrobenthic community composition. Diversity was highest in the ML, and lower in spring compared to other seasons. The occurrence of a brown tide (Aureoumbra lagunensis) in 2016 allowed a comparison of winter and spring communities before (2015) and during (2016) a bloom event. Community composition and diversity at the BR sites were the most affected by the bloom event with the lowest diversity and abundances during the bloom. Diversity in the IR was also lower during the bloom, while the ML was unaffected by the bloom. Species of all feeding groups were affected by the bloom, with lower abundances found in all groups. In addition, to determine the overall trophic diversity of infaunal communities, we collected infaunal organisms from two of the quarterly sampled sites for isotope analyses. Values of δ13C and δ15N from infaunal tissue were compared to those of potential food sources at each site. Substantial interspecific variation in isotope values of infaunal organisms within a site suggests the presence of diverse nutritional modes that include suspension and deposit feeding and predation. Together, these data suggest that infaunal communities contribute to benthic pelagic coupling and nutrient cycling within the estuarine communities, but the overall function of these communities may be tightly linked to their species composition.","We thank SMS staff, especially Sherry Reed and William Lee, Griffin Bell and Richard Paperno, numerous volunteers, and interns for their invaluable help in logistical support, sample collection, and processing.

Dextral strikes-slip is expressed in NW–SE striking faults of the Atacama Fault System, and reverse displacement dominates in E–W faults. This deformation results of the convergence in a concave-seaward continental margin. On September 11th, 2020, a Mw 6.3 earthquake and its subsequent aftershocks took place in the coastal region of northern Chile, revealing the reactivation of the deepest segment of a WNW–ESE striking upper plate fault. The reactivation of this fault occurred after the Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake, and it seems to be connected to a N–S interplate locking segmentation of the plate margin, which is clearly shown by the locking pattern before the Iquique earthquake. This poses the question of how heterogeneous locking influences upper plate seismicity and how it relates to trench-parallel shortening.","This work was supported by the FONDECYT project 1200170 and the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN) CONICYT/FONDAP project 15110017.

However, many governments have hesitated to implement them due to their costs. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI program to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia.
METHODS: We developed a Markov simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both the health system and the societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity loss, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
FINDINGS: Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduces COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saves an average of $1,045 and $850 per case when observed from the social and the health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to two times the current health expenditures in Colombia per year.
INTERPRETATION: The TTI program is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Colombia. TTI programs depend on their successful and speedy implementation.

Silver nanoparticles (NP Ag) were synthesized, through the reducing action of the alcoholic extracts of eucalyptus on the precursor silver nitrate (AgNO3) evaluating the influence of alcoholic solvent (70 ° and 96 °) and pH in the synthesis. The silver colloids obtained were evaluated by UV-vis spectrophotometry, which shows the formation of nanoparticles through the plasmon resonance peak; showing that for pH values 9.9 and 10 with alcohol extract of 70 ° and 96 ° respectively, silver nanoparticles with plasmon resonance peaks at 410 nm and 412.5 nm are obtained. While for pH values 3.86, 11.8 (96°) and 4.7, 8.2 (70°) nanoparticles with higher polydispersity and in a lower proportion are obtained.

For the synthesis, copper sulfate pentahydrate CuSO4 (5H2O) was used as a precursor agent and ascorbic acid (AA) as a reducing agent. Cu NPs was characterized by the following techniques: UV-Visible spectrophotometry to evaluate structural changes that are evidenced in the absorbance peak and atomic absorption spectrophotometry to define nanoparticulate concentrations material in the precipitated and supernatant phases generated. On the methodology it was possible to observe a controlled formation based on the increase in the volume of ascorbic acid in the presence of sodium hydroxide, noticing a production of Cu nanostructures with a tendency to oxidation over time. The UV-visible results showed characteristic surface plasmon resonance peaks of metallic copper for the colloid containing 1.2 mL of A.A; as well as a specific copper concentration of 0.14 ppm in the supernatant and 1519.1 ppm in the precipitate. It is also evidenced that the solution exhibits a rapid reaction on exposure to air by shifting the absorbance peak to 386 nm.

However, the scale of the urban project, understood as the operationalization of climate change actions, has been neglected. The current three generations of urban projects are revisited (modern city, morphologic articulation, large urban projects) and a fourth-generation within the context of climate change is identified as missing; it combines adaptation and mitigation strategies for urban projects. While adaptation strategies are oriented to minimizing the negative impact of climate change on rising sea-levels, floods and rivers’ changes through green and blue infrastructures, mitigation strategies are twofold: one oriented to minimizing CO2 gas emissions and the other to reducing the risks of deterioration of natural systems due to human intervention or natural causes. Integrating the four generations, a typology of a 2x2 matrix of urban projects is drawn up. The four quadrants of types of urban projects are explained and accompanied by examples. Potential and desirable shifts between the quadrants are discussed to understand how changes are needed to advance to develop this new generation of urban projects. The paper contributes to expanding our understanding of urban projects in the context of climate change with heuristics purposes for researchers, practitioners and academia, and to prepare public policy makers to encourage the debate of climate change actions of adaptation and mitigation that should be materialized on an urban project scale.

The article is based upon two complementary approaches, a multilevel analysis from sustainable transitions theory and a framework of interrelations of urban mitigation and adaptation projects. The methodological design is a case study; we analyzed the case of Medellin that, at the beginning of the 2000's, implemented public transport projects, urban parks, educational and cultural facilities, and risk mitigation projects in the surrounding hills. The main findings are that specific projects at an urban scale are operating as niches or experiments, taking advantage of windows of opportunities, and triggering changes in the urban design routines, framing a new sociotechnical system. It is found that governance, leadership, teams of experts and urban planners are drivers for the transition of urban projects, which were initially designed for social and transport needs, to urban mitigation projects for climate change. At the same time, urban mitigation projects such as the Metropolitan Green Belt are transiting to adaptation projects for climate change. The conclusion for this case study is that while most urban projects retain their traditional role, a new generation of projects with mitigation and adaptation features is emerging in the context of climate change. This article contributes to expanding the empirical analysis of the literature on the theory of sustainable transitions specifically related to cities and urban projects. The theoretical framework of urban projects and their linkages with climate change are enriched. The conceptual framework of the analysis is replicable and useful for practitioners in the field of urban design and researchers interested in comparisons to identify patterns or typologies. In addition, the article contributes to sensitize actors involved in public urban design policies in their roles as managers of transitions.",,,IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering,,,,2021-11-01,2021,,2021-11-01,1203,3,032011,All OA; Gold,Article,"Perez-Lancellotti, Gino; Ziede, Marcela","Perez-Lancellotti, Gino (Escuela de Arquitectura, Universidad Católica del Norte, sede Antofagasta, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Ziede, Marcela (Via Flaminia 53, Cantiano (PU), 61044, Italy)",,"Perez-Lancellotti, Gino (Catholic University of the North); Ziede, Marcela (Via Flaminia 53, Cantiano (PU), 61044, Italy)",0,0,,0.0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1203/3/032011/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143581775,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13 Climate Action

Unfortunately, the reduction of native populations and the partial or complete absence of ovigerous females during the months of autumn and winter are serious obstacles towards a successful, responsible, and profitable cultivation of such palaemonid species. When reviewing the natural environment at the start of the reproductive season, an increase in both, water temperature and daylight is easily perceived, thus we decided to investigate their effects (temperature and photoperiod) on the ovarian maturation in a subtropical freshwater palaemonid of commercial interest (Cryphiops caementarius) with promising results for a strong and prosperous commercial cultivation. Adult females of C. caementarius were randomly distributed among four treatment groups (G1, G2, G3, and G4). The study was developed in two phases, an initial conditioning phase in which the four treatment groups were exposed to winter environmental conditions for 42 days (photoperiod 10 L:14D, temperature 13 °C) and a final test in which each group was exposed to a specific combination of photoperiod and temperature for a term of 105 days: G1-winter photoperiod and winter temperature (10 L:14D, 13 °C), G2-summer photoperiod and summer temperature (14 L:10D, 25 °C), G3-summer photoperiod and winter temperature (14 L:10D, 13 °C), G4- winter photoperiod and summer temperature (10 L:14D, 25 °C). All the females were individually marked and the events of maturity and spawning were monitored. Maturity events were not recorded in any of the treatment groups exposed to winter temperatures, while 39 % and 31 % of the females exposed to summer temperatures in G2 and G4 respectively, had at least one maturity event during the testing phase. The results obtained suggest that an increase in temperature could be the environmental cue responsible for triggering the process of ovarian maturity in C. caementarius and that an adequate thermal control would allow the production of ovigerous females during the winter months. Controlling crustacean reproduction in captivity using environmental variables instead of invasive techniques such as eyestalk ablation or hormone injection opens a feasible path towards recovering natural populations and/or consolidating commercial farming through friendly aquaculture procedures.","We want to acknowledge and thank the crustacean research staff of the Aquaculture Department of the Universidad Católica del Norte for their support in the collection of the specimens.

Chile is faced with a significant risk posed by its collection of the most unsustainable and antiquated smelter operations among major copper producers worldwide. Moreover, forecasts also indicate a trend toward higher proportions of copper sulphide ores that carry high impurities, especially arsenic. To achieve the planned production increases, improve competitiveness in the global market, and reduce reliance on international smelting capacities, Chile must make significant and justifiable investment into new and/or existing smelting operations through equipment modernization. The required investment for upgrades may be on the order of billions of dollars. This review analyzes current roadblocks faced by the Chilean copper smelters and potential solutions according to environmental, economic and strategic factors. Recent advances in smelting technologies have focused on flash and bath smelting; despite a general trend toward flash furnace systems, recent bath furnace methods (e.g. China's SKS-BBS) are equally promising, particularly for varying and complex feeds. Strategic policies should focus on regionalized, non-integrated custom smelters, which can handle ores from a variety of sources while reducing overall operating costs. The government must play a fundamental role to incentivise the investments necessary to develop new smelter operations and upgrade existing infrastructure. With a large portion of copper concentrate exports coming from privately owned mines, synergistic efforts with industry partners will be crucial to increase overall smelting capacity and position Chile as a global leader in the smelting of copper concentrates.",Kevin Pérez acknowledges the infrastructure and support of the doctoral program in mineral process engineering at the Universidad de Antofagasta and thanks to Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

State of the Art Review","The use of renewable energy sources, especially wind energy, has been widely developed, mostly during the last decade. The main objective of the present study is to conduct a literature review focused on the evaluation under uncertainty of wind energy investment using the real options approach to find out whether public opposition (NIMBY projects) has been contemplated, and if so, what have been the flexible strategies applied for its intervention. Overall, 97 publications were analyzed, identifying 20 different models or approaches, which were grouped into eight categories: 1. Real options, 2. Optimization, 3. Stochastics, 4. Financial evaluation, 5. Probabilistic, 6. Estimation, 7. Numerical prediction, and 8. Others. The real options approach, present in 32% of the studies, was the most popular. Twenty-eight types of uncertainties were identified, which were grouped, for better analysis, into nine categories. In total, 62.5% of the studies included the price of electricity as a source of uncertainty; 18.8%, the velocity of wind; and 15.6%, the feed-in rates-subsidy. Both random and non-random techniques were applied to assess the real options and to model the uncertainties. When evaluating real options, the Monte Carlo simulation technique was the most preferred, with 16 (51.6%) applications, followed by non-randomized techniques, decision tree, and dynamic programming, with eight (25.8%) applications each. There is a marked tendency to use stochastic processes to model uncertainty, particularly geometric Brownian motion, which was used in 61.3% (19) of the studies in the sample. When searching for “real options AND (nimby OR public opposition)”, no study was found, which shows the possibility of developing research on this aspect to determine its impact on investments in wind energy projects.",,"This research was funded by the departmento de La Guajira-Colombia, through the project: Master’s and Doctoral Studies inside and outside the Country for Professionals in the departamento de La Guajira- BPIN 2013000100032, with resources of Direct Allocation of Royalties, granted through the agreement of Condonable Educational Credit PFAN 019 of 2015, executed by the “Universidad de La Guajira”; and the “Universidad del Norte”.",Applied Sciences,,,,2021-10-31,2021,2021-10-31,,11,21,10213,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murgas, Benjamin; Henao, Alvin; Guzman, Luceny","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.)); Guzman, Luceny (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.))","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia)","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte; Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.)); Guzman, Luceny (Universidad del Norte; Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.))",9,9,,5.27,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/21/10213/pdf?version=1635928759,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143006869,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 40 Engineering",13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This research tested the design of a prototype for applying artificial light photoperiods controlled by light-emitting diodes on an industrial scale for generating forced stress in H. pluvialis cells during two seasons of the year (winter and spring 2019) in the Coquimbo region in Chile. Three different culture structures were used for the four stages of the alga production cycle. Two containers, A and B, were used for the first and second culture stages, while a raceway (large pool) was used for the third and fourth culture stages. Experiments with four different photoperiods (PP) that represent hours of light:darkness were conducted in two trials (spring 16:8 and winter 18:6) and two for control (spring 11:13 and winter 10:14). In the experiment, an exponential increase of β-carotenoid was achieved, used in human and animal food for its health properties and as a natural colorant in the salmonids industry. Biomass and astaxanthin production under forced stress were measured with physical and chemical variables such as light intensity, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen.

This study aims to characterize the motivations for studying Dentistry and to identify the associated factors in Cuban students. Material and Methods: A total of 1324 students from nine Cuban universities participated in this cross-sectional, analytic, observational, multicenter and questionnaire-based study. The “Dental Motivation Scale”, a validated test, was used to measure social, altruistic, economic, and prestige motivators. For statistical analysis, frequencies and percentages were described, and generalized linear models were used to establish statistical associations. Results: Sixty six percent of the surveyed students were female and the mean age was 21.2. The students were more motivated to major in Dentistry by their desire to study for constant progress (57%) as well as the possibility of being able to help others (50%). Those who had relatives that were dentists had a lower social/altruistic motivation (studying for constant progress; p=0.004). Family pressure was associated with an increase in economic/prestige motivators: economic security (p=0.001), stable job (p<0.001) and reaching high social status (p<0.001). Conclusion: Students coming from families related to Dentistry were less motivated by social/altruistic aspects.

However, reanalysis datasets require detailed validation to determine their accuracy and reliability. This paper evaluates the performance of MERRA2 and ERA5 regarding their monthly rainfall products, comparing their areal precipitation averages with estimates based on ground measurement records from 49 rain gauges managed by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) and the Thiessen polygons method in the Sinu River basin, Colombia. The performance metrics employed in this research are the correlation coefficient, the bias, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results show that ERA5 generally outperforms MERRA2 in the study area. However, both reanalyses consistently overestimate the monthly averages calculated from IDEAM records at all time and spatial scales. The negative NSE values indicate that historical monthly averages from IDEAM records are better predictors than both MERRA2 and ERA5 rainfall products.",,,Atmosphere,,,,2021-10-29,2021,2021-10-29,,12,11,1430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vega-Durán, Jean; Escalante-Castro, Brigitte; Canales, Fausto A.; Acuña, Guillermo J.; Kaźmierczak, Bartosz","Vega-Durán, Jean (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 #55-66, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Escalante-Castro, Brigitte (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 #55-66, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Canales, Fausto A.

Some of the oceanographic processes at small (<1 km) and submeso (1–10 km) scales manifest themselves as slicks at the sea surface, which might have the potential to concentrate organisms and particles (such as positively buoyant plastics), putting species that feed in these areas at risk of ingesting plastics. Slicks can be filaments, lines, meanders, or patches, which are lighter in color and smoother in surface roughness compared to the surrounding area. Here we tested the hypothesis that passive particles (including plastics) and organisms are aggregated in the surface waters within these slicks. According to their main features (orientation to coast and/or wind), the studied slicks were most likely generated by oceanographic processes such as topographically controlled fronts, other types of fronts and internal waves. Neuston samples were collected from the sea surface inside and outside of slicks (n = 11 sites with slicks) in the coastal waters of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) during two campaigns in austral summer (January 2018) and autumn (April 2019). In general, passive particles, including plastics, exuviae, eggs and foraminiferans, were found more frequently inside than outside the slicks. In some cases, motile zooplankton organisms such as chaetognaths, vertically migrating crustaceans and early developmental stages (EDS) of fish were also more common within the slicks. In addition, a positive relationship was found between plastics and planktonic organisms such as foraminiferans, snails and jellyfish (e.g., Velella velella), although a strong correlation was also found with fish EDS and chaetognaths. These results suggest that surface slicks are areas of aggregation for both passive particles and active organisms, thus playing an important ecological role in food retention and particle concentration where the risk of plastic ingestion by fish and seabirds is enhanced.",We thank Abril Sanchez and Benjamin Aguila for their support in the 2018 samplings in Rapa Nui.

Various authors have proposed changes in lipid metabolism (total cholesterol decrease) as a possible biological marker for suicidal behavior. The objective of this study was to review the studies that have demonstrated a relationship between serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior and to describe the possible pathophysiological mechanisms that associate changes in cholesterol concentration and suicidal behavior. Relevant literature related to serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior was identified through various database searches. The data from the existing literature present the findings that relate low cholesterol levels and possible pathophysiological mechanisms (neuroinflammation, serotonergic neurotransmission), genes related to cholesterol synthesis, pharmacological treatments that alter lipid metabolism and the possible participation in suicidal behavior. Nevertheless, future research is required to describe how serum cholesterol affects cholesterol metabolism in the CNS to establish and understand the role of cholesterol in suicidal behavior.",,This research received no external funding.,Biomedicines,,"Marta Rodríguez-Arias, Carmen Ferrer-Perez",,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,9,11,1559,All OA; Gold,Article,"González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz; Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia; León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia; Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín; Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther; Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso; López-Narváez, María Lilia; Marín-Medina, Alejandro; Nicolini, Humberto; Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina; Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel","González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Jalpa de Méndez, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Jalpa de Méndez 86205, Tabasco, Mexico;, thelma.glez.castro@gmail.com, (T.B.G.-C.);, yazmin.hdez.diaz@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.)); Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia (Departamento de Genética Psiquiátrica, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México 14610, Mexico;, adgenis@inmegen.gob.mx); León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Comalcalco, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Comalcalco 86650, Tabasco, Mexico;, ivanniaescalante10@gmail.com); Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Jalpa de Méndez, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Jalpa de Méndez 86205, Tabasco, Mexico;, thelma.glez.castro@gmail.com, (T.B.G.-C.);, yazmin.hdez.diaz@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.)); Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.)); Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Comalcalco, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Comalcalco 86650, Tabasco, Mexico;, ivanniaescalante10@gmail.com); López-Narváez, María Lilia (Secretaría de Salud de Chiapas, Hospital Chiapas Nos Une “Dr. Gilberto Gómez Maza”, Tuxtla Gutiérrez 29045, Chiapas, Mexico;, dralilialonar@yahoo.com.mx); Marín-Medina, Alejandro (Universidad de Guadalajara, CUCS, Guadalajara 44340, Jalisco, Mexico;, stat5A@hotmail.com); Nicolini, Humberto (Departamento de Genética Psiquiátrica, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México 14610, Mexico;, adgenis@inmegen.gob.mx); Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.)); Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.))","Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Nicolini, Humberto (National Institute of Genomic Medicine)","González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia (National Institute of Genomic Medicine); León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); López-Narváez, María Lilia (Secretaría de Salud de Chiapas, Hospital Chiapas Nos Une “Dr. Gilberto Gómez Maza”, Tuxtla Gutiérrez 29045, Chiapas, Mexico;, dralilialonar@yahoo.com.mx); Marín-Medina, Alejandro (University of Guadalajara); Nicolini, Humberto (National Institute of Genomic Medicine); Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco)",7,6,0.39,1.46,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/9/11/1559/pdf?version=1635416974,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143007229,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,3 Good Health and Well Being

According to its physiology it can be classified as cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. The clinical signs involve dyspnea, cough, tachypnea, and alteration of the normal sounds on pulmonary auscultation. In this report, was described a case of a female canine, SRD, 10 years old that initially went to the clinic for coughing. However, after a few days it returned to the emergency room presenting dyspnea. After stabilizing the patient, radiography, ultrasonography, and electrocardiogram were performed, which revealed cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to left heart disease. After the emergency approach, the patient remained hospitalized for a period of 24 hours, after which it was released. Chronic treatment of the heart disease was prescribed and follow-up with a cardiologist every 6 months was requested. Although this is a veterinary emergency, when treated correctly and then solving the underlying cause, the prognosis tends to be favorable.

Of particular interest is the LP family of surfactin, immunogenic molecules involved in induced systemic resistance (ISR) and the bacterial colonization of plant surfaces. We hypothesize that the concentration of surfactin produced by a strain correlates directly with its ability to colonize and persist on different plant surfaces, which conditions its capacity to trigger ISR. We used two Bacillus velezensis strains (BBC023 and BBC047), whose antagonistic potential in vitro is practically identical, but not on plant surfaces. The surfactin production of BBC047 is 1/3 higher than that of BBC023. Population density and SEM images revealed stable biofilms of BBC047 on leaves and roots, activating ISR on both plant surfaces. Despite its lower surfactin production, strain BBC023 assembled stable biofilms on roots and activated ISR. However, on leaves only isolated, unstructured populations were observed, which could not activate ISR. Thus, the ability of a strain to effectively colonize a plant surface is not only determined through its production of surfactin. Multiple aspects, such as environmental stressors or compensation mechanisms may influence the process. Finally, the importance of surfactin lies in its impacts on biofilm formation and stable colonization, which finally enables its activity as an elicitor of ISR.","The authors are thankful to Stefanie Maldonado, Williams Arancibia and Juan Pablo Araya for technical support in the laboratory, UCN Coquimbo for granting access to the SEM platform as well as to Servicios y Almacigos SA for providing assistance with seedling growth.","This research was funded by Projects BIP 30127532 and BIP 30403034 (Regional Fund of Innovation for Competitiveness Coquimbo Region FIC-R, Chile) (A.S.) and ANID Beca Doctorado Nacional Grant/Award N° 21140504 (R.S.-M.).",Microorganisms,,,,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,9,11,2251,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stoll, Alexandra; Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo; González, Máximo; Araya, Michael","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Departamento de Biología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena 1720170, Chile;, rsmesteban@gmail.com); Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo (Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Departamento de Biología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena 1720170, Chile;, rsmesteban@gmail.com); González, Máximo (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl); Araya, Michael (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Algas CIDTA, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, mmaraya@ucn.cl)","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; University of La Serena)","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; University of La Serena); Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo (University of La Serena); González, Máximo (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl); Araya, Michael (Catholic University of the North)",33,23,2.84,7.93,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/11/2251/pdf?version=1635429038,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143009653,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,2 Zero Hunger

Combining X-ray diffraction analyses, scanning electron microscopy and molecular diversity studies, we have characterized twenty previously unexplored Andean microbial ecosystems in eight different lakes and wetlands from the middle-east and south-east regions of this salt flat. The mats and microbialites studied are mainly formed by calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite) and halite, whereas the endoevaporites are composed predominantly of gypsum and halite. The carbonate-rich mats and microbialites are dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, the most abundant classes are Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. While in the phylum Bacteroidetes, the most abundant classes are Bacteroidia and Rhodothermia. Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia phyla are also well-represented in the majority of these systems. Gypsum endoevaporites, on the contrary, are dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Euryarchaeota phyla. The Cyanobacteria phylum is also abundant in these systems, but it is less represented in comparison to mats and microbialites. Regarding the eukaryotic taxa, diatoms are key structural components in most of the microbial ecosystems studied. The genera of diatoms identified were Achnanthes, Fallacia, Halamphora, Mastogloia, Navicula, Nitzschia, and Surirella. Normally, in the mats and microbialites, diatoms form nano-globular carbonate aggregates with filamentous cyanobacteria and other prokaryotic cells, suggesting their participation in the mineral precipitation process.

Among the various leaching processes to treat chalcocite, chloride media show better results and have a greater industrial boom. Chalcocite dissolution is a two-stage process, the second being much slower than the first. During the second stage, in the first instance, it is possible to oxidize the covellite in a wide range of chloride concentrations or redox potentials (up to 75% extraction of Cu). Subsequently, CuS2 is formed, which is to be oxidized. It is necessary to work at high concentrations of chloride (>2.5 mol/L) and/or increase the temperature to reach a redox potential of over 650 mV, which in turn decreases the thickness of the elemental sulfur layer on the mineral surface, facilitating chloride ions to generate a better porosity of this. Finally, it is concluded that the most optimal way to extract copper from chalcocite is, during the first stage, to work with high concentrations of chloride (50–100 g/L) and low concentrations of sulfuric acid (0.5 mol/L) at a temperature environment, as other variables become irrelevant during this stage if the concentration of chloride ions in the system is high.

182,pub.1142224345,10.3389/feart.2021.722056,,,The Evolution of Peteroa Volcano (Chile–Argentina) Crater Lakes Between 1984 and 2020 Based on Landsat and Planet Labs Imagery Analysis,"One of the major challenges in the understanding of the crater lakes dynamics and their connection with magmatic/hydrothermal processes is the continuous tracking of the physical behavior of lakes, especially in cases of remote and poorly accessible volcanoes. Peteroa volcano (Chile–Argentina border) is part of the Planchón–Peteroa–Azufre Volcanic Complex, one of the three volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes with crater lakes. Peteroa volcano is formed by a ∼5 km diameter caldera-type crater, which hosts four crater lakes and several fumarolic fields. Peteroa volcano has a large history of eruptive activity including phreatic-and-phreatomagmatic explosions and several episodes of strong degassing from its crater lakes. Here, we used TIR and SWIR bands from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images available from October 1984 to December 2020 to obtain thermal parameters such as thermal radiance, brightness temperature, and heat fluxes, and Planet Labs Inc. images (RapidEye and PlanetScope) available between May 2009 and December 2020 to obtain physical parameters such as area, color, and state (liquid or frozen) of the crater lakes. We reviewed the historical eruptive activity and compared it with thermal and physical data obtained from satellite images. We determined the occurrence of two eruptive/thermal cycles: 1) Cycle 1 includes the formation of a new fumarolic field and two active craters during a short eruptive period, which includes thermal activity in three of the four crater lakes, and a strong degassing process between October 1998 and February 2001, coincident with a peak of volcanic heat flux (Qvolc) in two craters. The cycle finished with an eruptive episode (September 2010–July 2011). 2) Cycle 2 is represented by the thermal reactivation of two crater lakes, formation and detection of thermal activity in a new nested crater, and occurrence of a new eruptive episode (October 2018–April 2019). We observed a migration of the thermal and eruptive activity between the crater lakes and the interconnection of the pathways that feed the lakes, in both cases, partially related to the presence of two deep magma bodies. The Qvolc in Peteroa volcano crater lakes is primarily controlled by volcanic activity, and seasonal effects affect it at short-term, whilst at long-term, seasonal effects do not show clear influences in the volcanic heat fluxes. The maximum Qvolc measured between all crater lakes during quiescent periods was 59 MW, whereas during unrest episodes Qvolc in single crater lakes varied from 7.1 to 38 MW, with Peteroa volcano being classified as a low volcanic heat flux system. The detection of new thermal activity and increase of Qvolc in Peteroa volcano previous to explosive unrest can be considered as a good example of how thermal information from satellite images can be used to detect possible precursors to eruptive activity in volcanoes which host crater lakes.","Our acknowledgements to Planet Labs Education and Research Standard Program for providing us the PlanetScope and RapidEye imagery.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, N. pectoralis is assessed globally as Data Deficient. Using low-coverage short Illumina 300 bp pair-end reads sequencing, this study reports, for the first time, the genome size, single/low-copy genome content, and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S rRNA DNA operon and microsatellites, in N. pectoralis. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer approach was 816.04 Mbp, which is within the range previously reported for other representatives of the Carangiformes order. Single/low-copy genome content (63%) was relatively high. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to the known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were considerably more abundant than Class I-Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements and Class I-LTR Retroviral elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon in N. pectoralis consists of, in the following order: a 5' ETS (length = 948 bp), ssrDNA (1835 bp), ITS1 (724 bp), a 5.8S rDNA (158 bp), ITS2 (508 bp), lsrDNA (3924 bp), and a 3' ETS (32 bp). A total of 44 SSRs were identified. These newly developed genomic resources are most relevant for improving the understanding of biology, developing conservation plans, and managing the fishery of the iconic N. pectoralis.",J.A.B. thanks Vincent P.

Starting from the communication sciences—journalism in particular—and digital humanities via the history of communication, we show how to use interactive digital maps for the production and publication of knowledge through and/or for participation. Firstly, we establish the theoretical-conceptual framework necessary to base the practices, dividing the elements into three areas: interactive maps and knowledge production (decentralization, pluralization, reticularization, and humanization), maps as instruments to promote political and social participation (egalitarianism, horizontality, and criticism), and maps as instruments for the visualization of data that favors the user experience (interactivity, multimediality, reticularity of reading, and participation). Next, we present two cases that we developed to put into practice the theoretical concepts that we established: the Mapa Infoparticipa (Infoparticipa Map), which shows the results of the evaluation of the transparency of public administrations, and the Ciutadania Plural (Plural Citizenship) web platform for the production of social knowledge about the past and the present. This theoretical and practical model shows the possibilities of interactive maps as tools to promote political participation and as instruments for the construction of social knowledge in a collaborative, participatory, networked way.",,This research received no external funding.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,,,,2021-10-26,2021,2021-10-26,,10,11,722,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Navas, Pedro Molina; Lalinde, Johamna Muñoz; Morales, Narcisa Medranda","Rodríguez-Navas, Pedro Molina (Department of Audiovisual Communication and Advertising, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain); Lalinde, Johamna Muñoz (Mass Communication and Journalism, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, lalinde@uninorte.edu.co); Morales, Narcisa Medranda (School of Social Communication, Universidad Polítécnica Salesiana, Quito 170517, Ecuador;, nmedranda@ups.edu.ec)","Rodríguez-Navas, Pedro Molina (Autonomous University of Barcelona)","Rodríguez-Navas, Pedro Molina (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Lalinde, Johamna Muñoz (Universidad del Norte); Morales, Narcisa Medranda (Politecnica Salesiana University)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/11/722/pdf?version=1635424276,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143008882,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience; 40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering,

Resumen en Inglés Background/Purpose: The Spanish version of the Educational Needs Assessment Tool (SpENAT), is a self-completed questionnaire that assesses the educational needs (ENs) in osteoarthritis (OA) patients, with the purpose of providing tailored and patient-centered information. This study established the sources of information that patients use and to evaluate the ENs of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) using the SpENAT. Material and Method: An international multicenter, prospective cross-sectional study in patients with KOA was performed in 9 Latin American countries. Demographic data, educational level, clinics, VAS, RAPID3 and sources of information were recorded. SpENAT Questionnaire consists of 39 questions grouped into 7 domains [Managing pain, movement, feelings, arthritis process (OA), medical treatments, self-help measures and support systems]. It was used to evaluate patient’s attitudes toward OA (score of ENs 0 to 156). Results: 1341 patients with KOA (78.9% women) from 9 Latin American countries were included in this study. Mean age was 63.99 years. Work disability was found in 1.8%. SpENAT median scores for patients with KOA were 116 (IQR 101–134). The scores for each domain were as follows: mean for pain domain 17.42, mobility 15.44, feelings 12.95, medical treatments 20.64, personal treatment 17.41 and support system 11.7. Information on KOA was obtained from Rheumatologist 74.9%, Traumatologist 16.8%, internet 14.3%, primary care physician 10%, other health professionals 9.9%, written press 3.6%, radio 1.9%, television 0.9%, family and friends 10.7%. Conclusion: The majority of patients show considerable educational needs (high SpENAT) and a greater interest in knowing about KOA and its treatment. Most patients presented high SpENAT and had a greater interest in knowing about KOA and its treatment. The greatest value of SpENAT was associated with resorting to a rheumatologist for better information. We consider it important recognizing both the ENs and sources of information that our patients with KOA use as an important starting point to develop better therapeutic decisions and strategies.

The research is carried out under the descriptive method using a mixed approach, considering a qualitative part since there is a conceptual, theoretical and documentary reference; and another quantitative part, due to the use of statistical methods and data tabulation for the presentation of the results, in addition, a survey structured by sections according to the type of tax benefit is used as an instrument for collecting the information. The results indicate that there are several tax benefits that SMEs in the department of Quindío do not use, either due to ignorance or because they do not meet the requirements to access them. In addition, it is evidenced that entrepreneurs use the most well-known tax benefits, such as those granted in the simple tax regime, considering that it allows them to reduce the payment of taxes and generate savings to invest, hire more employees and grow in the market.",,,Libre Empresa,,,,2021-10-25,2021,2021-10-25,,18,1,29-59,All OA; Gold,Article,"Torres-Castaño, Ana Gladys; Fajardo-Calderón, Constanza Loreth; Alzate-Palacio, Johanna Marcela","Torres-Castaño, Ana Gladys (Universidad del Quindío, Armenia - Colombia); Fajardo-Calderón, Constanza Loreth (Universidad del Quindío, Armenia - Colombia); Alzate-Palacio, Johanna Marcela (Universidad del Quindío, Armenia - Colombia)",,"Torres-Castaño, Ana Gladys (University of Quindío); Fajardo-Calderón, Constanza Loreth (University of Quindío); Alzate-Palacio, Johanna Marcela (University of Quindío)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.unilibre.edu.co/index.php/libreempresa/article/download/8448/7613,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148163639,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",

The history of tachinid collectors in Chile and authors who have contributed to the systematic knowledge of Chilean tachinids is extensively reviewed. The classification has been updated and 122 genera and 264 species are recognised in Chile. There is a significant amount of endemism with 28 genera and 100 species known only from Chile. There are also 113 species with distributions shared only between Chile and Argentina, particularly in the southern portions of these countries comprising Patagonia. The catalogue is based on examination of the original descriptions of all nominal species and all other references known to us containing relevant taxonomic and distributional information, for a total of approximately 450 references. Many of the name-bearing types and other Chilean specimens housed in collections were examined. Taxa are arranged hierarchically and alphabetically under the categories of subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus (where recognised), and species. Nomenclatural information is provided for genus-group and species-group names, including lists of synonyms (mostly restricted to Neotropical taxa) and name-bearing type data. Species distributions are recorded by country within the New World and by larger geographical divisions in the Old World. Additional information is given in the form of notes and references under valid names at the level of tribe, genus, and species. Two genera are newly recorded from Chile: Chaetoepalpus Vimmer & Soukup, 1940 (Tachinini) (also newly recorded from Argentina) and Patelloa Townsend, 1916 (Goniini). Four species are newly recorded from Chile or other countries: Lyphaornata Aldrich, 1934 (Chile); Chaetoepalpuscoquilleti Vimmer & Soukup, 1940 (Argentina and Chile); Phytomypteraevanescens (Cortés, 1967) (Argentina); and Xanthobasisunicolor Aldrich, 1934 (Chile). Eight species previously recorded from Chile are deemed to have been misidentified or misrecorded from Chile (known distributions in parentheses): Archytasincertus (Macquart, 1851) (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay); Archytasseminiger (Wiedemann, 1830) (Brazil, Colombia); Goniacrassicornis (Fabricius, 1794) (Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Middle America, West Indies, Nearctic); Lespesiaandina (Bigot, 1888) (Cuba); Lespesiaarchippivora (Riley, 1871) (widespread Nearctic and most of Neotropical); Neoethillaignobilis (van der Wulp, 1890) (Mexico, United States); Siphona (Siphona) geniculata (De Geer, 1776) (Palaearctic, Nearctic [introduced]); and Winthemiaquadripustulata (Fabricius, 1794) (Palaearctic, Nearctic, Oriental]. As First Reviser we fix Paratheresiarufiventris Townsend, 1929 as the senior homonym and Sarcoprosenarufiventris Townsend, 1929 as the junior homonym when the two are placed together in Billaea Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830; and we fix Mayophoriniaangusta Townsend, 1927 as the senior homonym and Metarrhinomyiaangusta Townsend, 1927 as the junior homonym when the two are placed together in Myiopharus Brauer & Bergenstamm, 1889.

However, few studies have analyzed the relationship between identity from different theoretical perspectives, and the mental health of migrants in the Latin-American context. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between several identity indicators such as ethnic identity, collective self-esteem, identity fusion (with the country of origin and the host country) simultaneously, and different dimensions of psychological well-being of Colombian migrants living in Chile. The sample consisted of 887 Colombian migrants, of whom 435 (49%) were men and 452 (51%) were women. Participants were residents of the cities of Arica (n=204; 23%), Antofagasta (n=469; 52.9%), and Santiago (n=214; 24.1%) in Chile. The results revealed by structural equation modeling indicate that collective self-esteem and ethnic identity show positive relationships with almost all dimensions of psychological well-being, while identity fusion with Colombia only showed a positive relationship with the dimension positive relationships and identity fusion with Chile only showed a positive relationship with the dimension autonomy. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed at the end.",,"This publication is derived from the project FONDECYT Regular #1180315, funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of the Government of Chile.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,,12,,707101,All OA; Gold,Article,"Henríquez, Diego; Urzúa, Alfonso; López-López, Wilson","Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); López-López, Wilson (Facultad de Psicología, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); López-López, Wilson (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",7,4,1.3,2.28,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.707101/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142006061,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Likewise, Peru has a high ecological and climate diversity, which makes it the possessor of renewable energy potential, specifically solar and wind power. The rapid growth of tourism is leading to generating prospects for becoming a sustainable destination. In this sense, it is important to understand and evaluate the Peruvian legislative framework for sustainable tourism and the current state of the implementation of the scenarios provided by the governmental entity in terms of sustainability, and its link with tourism activity. Based on what has been described, this study is aimed at evaluating the four most relevant museums in the northern part of Peru; in addition, it contributes to the studies that exist at the intersection of tourism and sustainability in the chains of activities related to tourism and calls for rationality applied to tourism management in this region of Latin America. The results of the literature review of the Peruvian legal framework reveal a lack of specific laws and regulations on sustainable tourism; on the contrary, there are policies in force that contribute to promoting the development of sustainable tourism. The quantified evaluation of the solar and wind potentials of the geographical area under study indicates the minimum renewable energy potential necessary for its transformation and use in the development of sustainable museums and its contribution to sustainable tourism.","Dirección de Investigación e Innovación of the Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), for the support in the translation and financing of the APC payment.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,2021-10,7,10,e08188,All OA; Gold,Article,"Calderón-Vargas, F.; Asmat-Campos, D.; Chávez-Arroyo, P.","Calderón-Vargas, F.

151,pub.1142806744,10.3390/math9212641,,,Exact Formulation and Analysis for the Bi-Objective Insular Traveling Salesman Problem,"This paper aims at studying the Bi-Objective Insular Traveling Salesman Problem (BO-InTSP), which searches for a set of efficient, single visit sequences to collect (or distribute) freight from a set of islands. In this problem, the selection of ports (nodes) to be visited at each island, along with the associated port visit sequence, are optimized simultaneously, while the maritime transportation costs and the ground transportation costs inside the islands are minimized with a bi-objective perspective. This approach is employed since these costs are of a conflictive nature. A previous Approximated Formulation of the BO-InTSP relies on aggregating the actual demand locations within each island in a certain number of centroids for computing the ground transportation costs. Conversely, this paper proposes and develops a novel Exact Formulation for the problem based on the actual demand locations, instead of aggregating the demand inside the islands. Additionally, a systematic evaluation approach is developed to compare the two alternative formulations with different levels of demand aggregation inside the islands, considering the bi-objective nature of the problem. The results reveal that the novel Exact Formulation significantly outperforms the previous aggregated approach in terms of the solutions quality and computational resources.",,This research received no external funding.,Mathematics,,,,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,,9,21,2641,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miranda-Gonzalez, Pablo A.; Maturana-Ross, Javier; Blazquez, Carola A.; Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo","Miranda-Gonzalez, Pablo A.

Here, we evaluate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) present in pre-transmission infant and maternal plasma and breast milk (BM) against the contemporaneous maternal HIV-1 variants. HIV-1-exposed uninfected compared with HIV-1-exposed infected infants have higher ADCC and a combination of ADCC and nAb responses against their corresponding mother's strains. ADCC does not correlate with nAbs, suggesting they are independent activities. The infected infants with high ADCC compared with low ADCC, but not those with higher ADCC plus nAbs, have lower morbidity up to 1 year after birth. A higher IgA to IgG ratio, observed in BM supernatants and in a higher proportion of the infected compared with the uninfected infants, associates with lower ADCC. Against the exposure strains, ADCC, more than nAbs, associates with both lower mother-to-child transmission and decreased post-infection infant morbidity.","We thank the participants of the BAN study, without whom none of this work would be possible.

Thirteen barriers were previously listed from the literature, and information about them was collected from 24 experienced managers who know the realities of small and medium-sized companies in the sector. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The frequency distribution showed that in each barrier, there was more than 50% of the responses allocated in the upper range, that is, medium or intense observation, demonstrating that SMEs experience many difficulties in this theme. When comparatively analysed via Fuzzy TOPSIS, difficulties associated with lack of knowledge and financial resources/incentives that can support SMEs in adopting sustainable practices are highlighted.

It is related to enhanced rates of disability and mortality, enhanced disease burden, decreased function levels, and it can affect the wellbeing and daily activities of people, including loss of autonomy and independence. The aim of the current study is to determine the predictors of quality of life among patients with multimorbidity in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology It was a cross-sectional study conducted in 12 health care facilities of six districts in Karachi, Pakistan. Two health care facilities were selected from each district using a convenient sampling technique. The total sample size of this study was 690, equally distributed among 12 health care facilities. Results The majority of participants (33.47%) belonged to the age group of 40 to 49 years, while 29.85% of participants had an age between 30 to 39 years. More than half of the participants were females (50.87%). Overall, the multivariate analysis showed being male, married, younger, high educational status and employed were positively associated with quality of life. While having lower family income is negatively associated with quality of life. Conclusion The findings of this study had important implications for identifying distinct multimorbidity individuals who were at risk of a lower quality of life, and they emphasized the need for disease detection and treatment at an early stage. The study can also give important evidence for decision-makers when it comes to allocating health resources more efficiently, and health administrative departments can improve chronic disease management.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-10-15,2021,2021-10-15,2021-10-15,13,10,e18803,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hussain, Malik Hatim; Jilanee, Daniyal A.; Aziz, Safa; Tariq, Sheharyar; Devi, Arti; Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo A.; Tousif, Sohaib; Barkat, Rahil; Jilanee, Daniyal; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño","Hussain, Malik Hatim (); Jilanee, Daniyal A.

The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines produced during immunological responses contributes to disease prognosis and progression. Parasite tissue persistence can induce chronic inflammatory stimuli, which can cause long-term tissue injury and fibrosis. Chronic Chagas' patients exhibit increased levels of interleukin (IL)-9, an important cytokine in the regulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic processes. Data on the role of IL-9 in other pathologies are sometimes contradictory, and few studies have explored this cytokine's influence in Chagas' disease pathology. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of IL-9 in the progression of T. cruzi infection in vivo and in vitro. In vitro infection demonstrated that IL-9 reduced the number of infected cells and decreased the multiplication of intracellular amastigotes in both C2C12 myoblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages. In myoblasts, the increased production of nitric oxide (NO) was essential for reduced parasite multiplication, whereas macrophage responses resulted in increased IL-6 and reduced TGF-β levels, indicating that parasite growth restriction mechanisms induced by IL-9 were cell-type specific. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice with T. cruzi trypomastigotes of the Y strain implicated a major role of IL-9 during the chronic phase, as increased Th9 and Tc9 cells were detected among splenocytes; higher levels of IL-9 in these cell populations and increased cardiac IL-9 levels were detected compared to those of uninfected mice. Moreover, rIL9 treatment decreased serum IL-12, IL-6, and IL-10 levels and cardiac TNF-α levels, possibly attempting to control the inflammatory response. IL-9 neutralization increased cardiac fibrosis, synthesis of collagens I and III, and mastocyte recruitment in BALB/c heart tissue during the chronic phase. In conclusion, our data showed that IL-9 reduced the invasion and multiplication of T. cruzi in vitro, in both myoblasts and macrophages, favoring disease control through cell-specific mechanisms. In vivo, IL-9 was elevated during experimental chronic infection in BALB/c mice, and this cytokine played a protective role in the immunopathological response during this phase by controlling cardiac fibrosis and proinflammatory cytokine production.",We thank Wiley Editing Services for the careful English review and Daniela Teixeira for the flow cytometry critical help and analysis.,"This work was supported by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) (2016/15000-4 and 2017/17103-8), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,,"Animals; Chagas Disease; Cytokines; Humans; Interleukin-9; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Trypanosoma cruzi",2021-10-15,2021,2021-10-15,,11,,756521,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva; Orikaza, Cristina Mary; de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues; dos Santos, Luana Aguiar; Salu, Bruno Ramos; Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela; de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita; Mortara, Renato Arruda","de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); dos Santos, Luana Aguiar (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Salu, Bruno Ramos (Biochemistry Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela (Biochemistry Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita (Electronic Microscopy Center, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil)","Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Federal University of São Paulo); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Federal University of São Paulo)","de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva (Federal University of São Paulo); Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Federal University of São Paulo); de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues (Federal University of São Paulo); dos Santos, Luana Aguiar (Federal University of São Paulo); Salu, Bruno Ramos (Federal University of São Paulo); Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela (Federal University of São Paulo); de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita (Federal University of São Paulo); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Federal University of São Paulo)",6,3,0.62,2.71,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.756521/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141910784,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Such attributes are of great importance for use in industrial purposes. Understanding how these characteristics are affected is still complex, but with the help of molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum calculations (QM), it is possible to understand the behavior of polymers at the molecular level with great consistency. This study was applied to polymers derived from polyacrylamide (PAM) due to its great use in various industries. The polymers studied include hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) (PAMPS), polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylene oxide polymer (PEO), and guar gum polysaccharide (GUAR). Each one has different attributes, which help in understanding the effects on the polymer and the medium in which it is applied along a broad spectrum. The results include the conformation, diffusion, ion condensation, the structure of the water around the polymer, and interatomic polymer interactions. Such characteristics are important to selecting a polymer depending on the environment in which it is found and its purpose. The effect caused by salinity is particular to each polymer, where polymers with an explicit charge or polyelectrolytes are more susceptible to changes due to salinity, increasing their coiling and reducing their mobility in solution. This naturally reduces its ability to form polymeric bridges due to having a polymer with a smaller gyration radius. In contrast, neutral polymers are less affected in their structure, making them favorable in media with high ionic charges.","G.R.Q., J.S. and R.I.J. thank the Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/Fondap/15130015 for financial support.

The totality path with eclipse magnitude 1.012 passed through the Villarrica (Lon. 72.2308°W and Lat. 39.2820°S) in south Chile during 14:41:02.0 UTC to 17:30:58.1 UTC and maximum occurred ~ 16:03:49.5 UTC around the local noon. The vertical total electron content (VTEC) derived by GPS sites across the totality path for two PRN’s 29 and 31 show almost 20–40% of reduction with reference to ambient values. The percentage reduction was maximum close to totality site and decreases smoothly on both sides of totality sites. Interestingly, the atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) with a period ~ 30–60 min obtained using wavelet analysis of VTEC timeseries show the presence of strong AGWs at the GPS sites located north of the totality line. But the AGWs do not show any significant effect on the VTEC values to these sites. Our analysis suggests, possibly an interplay between variability in the background plasma density and eclipse-generated AGWs induced plasma density perturbation could explain the observations.","The study was supported by the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN), CONICYT/FONDAP/15110017 and Fondecyt Initiation Project 11200558.

A new species is described from egg masses of two commercial crabs, Cancer porteri and Romaleon setosum, inhabiting the central-north Chilean coast. This is the first species of Carcinonemertes described from the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Total body length of Carcinonemertes camanchaco sp. nov. ranged from 2.38 to 4.93 and from 4.29 to 8.92 mm, in males and females, respectively. Among others, traits that distinguish this new species from other previously described congeneric species include: presence of two gonad rows on each side of the intestine, a simple (not decorated) mucus sheath, and a relatively wide stylet basis. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses distinguished this new species from all other species of Carcinonemertes with available cox1 sequences in GenBank. Prevalence and mean (± SD) intensity of C. camanchaco sp. nov. was 24% and 2.6 (± 2.07) worms per egg mass in C. porteri and 38.1% and 3.8 (± 2.4) worms per egg mass in R. setosum.

Celery slices of 2 mm thick were pretreated for 5 min using ultrasound (32 W/L, 40 kHz), vacuum (75 kPa vacuum pressure) and ethanol (99.8% v/v, as drying accelerator) applied individually or in combination. To evaluate individual effects of ultrasound and vacuum, the treatments were also performed with distilled water or air medium, respectively. Moreover, the cavitational level was characterized in each condition. Drying kinetics was evaluated tending into account the drying time required by each treatment and the Page's model parameters. In addition, microstructural effects and shrinkage were evaluated. As results, ethanol combined with ultrasound significantly improved drying kinetics reducing drying time by around 38%. However, vacuum pretreatment did not affect drying kinetics even in combination with ethanol and/or ultrasound. Microstructural evaluation did not evidence cell disruption, suggesting changes in intercellular spaces, pores and/or cell wall permeability. The use of ethanol and vacuum showed a greater effect on shrinkage after pretreatment and after drying, respectively. In conclusion, at the studied conditions, the drying acceleration by vacuum and ultrasound is lower compared to the effect produced using ethanol.","The authors are grateful to the Programa Nacional de Investigación Científica y Estudios Avanzados (PROCIENCIA) from the ‘‘Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT, to the Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN, Peru) for funding the project n° 20201005, to the São Paulo Research foundation (FAPESP, Brazil), for funding the project n° 2019/05043-6, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil), for funding the productivity grant of PED Augusto (310839/2020-3).",,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,,,Apium; Desiccation; Ethanol; Vacuum; Vegetables,2021-10-08,2021,2021-10-08,2021-11,79,,105779,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miano, Alberto Claudio; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Augusto, Pedro E D","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru.); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru.); Augusto, Pedro E D (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North); Augusto, Pedro E D (Universidade de São Paulo)",27,17,1.94,3.69,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105779,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141720456,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Aims: To present relevant and updated information about genetic, pathophysiological and clinical processes  related to Intracranial Germ Cell Tumors. Development: Systematic research of scientific publications, by using the PICO strategy, in electronic databases. Conclusions: Intracranial germ cell tumors are classified into Germinoma and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors. These subgroups are very different. The genetic changes that explain the origin of both tumors are completely opposite: Germinomas have DNA hypomethylation while non germinomas have hypermethylation. Histologically, non germinomatous tumors show atipical cells with a high mitotic rate, which confers a poor prognosis, on the contrary to Germinoma, which is less aggressive. The diagnosis involves the measurement of Biomarkers, which are usually negative for the germinoma and positive for non germinomas; neuroimaging does not offer enough differential information, and the confirmation is histological. The treatment depends on the prognosis, so it will be more impetuous for non germinomatous tumors.",,,Universitas Médica,,,,2021-10-07,2021,2021-10-07,,62,4,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cárdenas, Juan Camilo Marchán; Spirko, Lila Piedad Visbal; Fernández, Sinforoso Alfonso Acosta","Cárdenas, Juan Camilo Marchán (Hospital Universidad del Norte.

University teaching is increasingly utilizing these audiovisual, digital and multimedia resources to provide a better learning experience. For the production of these materials, designated spaces have been created, however, there is a lack of consensus regarding the name attributed to them. In this study, we carried out a bibliographical review of the production of educational audiovisual content and the spaces devoted to this end in order to contextualise it prior to the in-depth interviews. With the aim of getting to know and delve deeper into the audiovisual proposals that are taking place in the Ibero-American sphere, we interviewed the people responsible for these innovative spaces in three universities. We concluded that the three institutions dedicated human resources, equipment and specialised spaces for video development; pedagogical support is necessary to outline the educational intention of the materials to be created; and it is necessary to empower both teachers and students in the development and curation of materials.

In the former, conciliation is the most developed alternative dispute resolution mechanism, while in the latter, mediation is the most developed. In order to deepen this comparison, a qualitative research of interpretative nature has been developed with the support of bibliographic-documentary material. The main conclusion is that access to justice is a human right that has been positivized as a fundamental right in the constitutions of both Colombia and Russia. However, the Colombian Constitution allows individuals to exercise their jurisdictional functions on a temporary basis, unlike the Russian Constitution, which only authorizes judges from the Federation to exercise their jurisdictional functions. While conciliation in Colombia is developed and implemented through State-supervised Conciliation and Arbitration Centers, mediation in Russia is in its initial phase and has gradually gained acceptance in society. In both states, the implementation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms has been driven by the need to decongest the courts and tribunals of ordinary justice. Therefore, it is useful to insist on the massive use of these instruments to make possible a justice that comes from the parties in conflict, that can repair the relations of the subjects in dispute and that tends towards the construction of more peaceful societies.",,,Justicia,,,,2021-10-06,2021,2021-10-06,,26,40,128-142,All OA; Gold,Article,"López, Milton Arrieta; Godoy, Abel Meza; Afanasiev, Ilya Vladimirovich; Sekerin, Vladimir Dmitriyevich; Noli, Sara","López, Milton Arrieta (Universidad de la Costa, Colombia); Godoy, Abel Meza (Universidad de la Costa); Afanasiev, Ilya Vladimirovich (Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation); Sekerin, Vladimir Dmitriyevich (Moscow Polytechnic University); Noli, Sara (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"López, Milton Arrieta (University of the Coast); Godoy, Abel Meza (University of the Coast); Afanasiev, Ilya Vladimirovich (Financial University); Sekerin, Vladimir Dmitriyevich (Moscow Polytechnic University); Noli, Sara (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,5.11,https://revistas.unisimon.edu.co/index.php/justicia/article/download/4773/5298,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142250352,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Although this phenomenon has been previously mentioned and deep-water emergent species have been described from the fjord regions of North America, Scandinavia, and New Zealand, local or global hypotheses to explain this phenomenon have rarely been tested. This publication includes the first literature review on DWE. Our knowledge of distribution patterns of Chilean marine invertebrates is still very scarce, especially from habitats below SCUBA diving depth. In our databases, we have been gathering occurrence data of more than 1000 invertebrate species along the Chilean coast, both from our research and from the literature. We also distributed a list of 50 common and easily in situ-identifiable species among biologically experienced sport divers along the Chilean coast and recorded their sighting reports. Among other findings, the analysis of the data revealed patterns from 28 species and six genera with similar longitudinal and bathymetric distribution along the entire Chilean coast: along the Chilean coast these species are typically restricted to deep water (>200 m) but only in some parts of Chilean Patagonia (>39°S–56°S), the same species are also common to locally abundant at diving depths (<30 m). We found 28 of these ‘deep’ species present in shallow-water of North Patagonia, 32 in Central Patagonia and 12 in South Patagonia. The species belong to the phyla Cnidaria (six species), Mollusca (four species), Arthropoda (two species) and Echinodermata (16 species). We ran several analyses comparing depth distribution between biogeographic regions (two-way ANOVA) and comparing abiotic parameters of shallow and deep sites to search for correlations of distribution with environmental variables (Generalized Linear Models). For the analyses, we used a total of 3328 presence points and 10635 absence points. The results of the statistical analysis of the parameters used, however, did not reveal conclusive results. We summarize cases from other fjord regions and discuss hypotheses of DWE from the literature for Chilean Patagonia.","Many thanks to all the former assistants, volunteers, and employees who supported the work at Huinay Scientific Field Station, and to the Huinay Foundation.","This research was supported by the Fondecyt project 1201717 to GF, Fondecyt project 1161699 to VH, and Fondecyt project 1181153 to JS and CI.

In this context, Fe(III), Zn(II), and Mn(II) are three metals contained in industrial copper-rich solutions in high quantities and eventually can be co-extracted with the copper. The purpose of the current study was to determine the feasibly of solvent extraction with the use of ionic liquid methyltrioctyl/decylammonium bis (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate (R4NCy) as an extractant of Cu(II) in the presence of Fe(III), Zn(II), and Mn(II). In general terms, the results showed a high single extraction efficiency of all the metals under study. In the case of Fe(III) and Zn(II), the extraction was close to 100%. On the contrary, the stripping efficiency was poor to Fe(III) and discrete to Zn(II), but very high to Cu(II) and Mn(II). Finally, the findings of this study suggest that the ionic liquid R4NCy is feasible for the pre-treatment of the copper solvent extraction process to remove metal impurities such as Fe(III) and Zn(II).","This work was supported by the Universidad de Atacama (project DIUDA 22317).

In the light of current discussions on the vaccinations of children it seems necessary to better identify children who are immune against SARS-CoV-2 due to a previous infection and to better understand COVID-19 related immune reactions in children. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, children aged 1-17 were recruited through primary care pediatricians for the study (a) randomly, if they had an appointment for a regular health check-up or (b) if parents and children volunteered and actively wanted to participate in the study. Symptoms were recorded and two antibody tests were performed in parallel directed against S (in house test) and N (Roche Elecsys) viral proteins. In children with antibody response in either test, neutralization activity was determined. Results: We identified antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 162 of 2,832 eligible children (5.7%) between end of May and end of July 2020 in three, in part strongly affected regions of Bavaria in the first wave of the pandemic. Approximately 60% of antibody positive children (n = 97) showed high levels (>97th percentile) of antibodies against N-protein, and for the S-protein, similar results were found. Sufficient neutralizing activity was detected for only 135 antibody positive children (86%), irrespective of age and sex. Initial COVID-19 symptoms were unspecific in children except for the loss of smell and taste and unrelated to antibody responses or neutralization capacity. Approximately 30% of PCR positive children did not show seroconversion in our small subsample in which PCR tests were performed. Conclusions: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are unspecific in children and antibody responses show a dichotomous structure with strong responses in many and no detectable antibodies in PCR positive children and missing neutralization activity in a relevant proportion of the young population.","We are grateful to all participants for their bravery in giving blood and their parents for their great support, the Bavarian red cross for support in Tirschenreuth and especially Mr. Schedel; the students who helped organizing the study, packing study sets, transporting sets and samples across the study areas; the assistants and helpers in all pediatric outpatient clinics who did a tremendous job on top of their routine work; all lab personal in the involved laboratories for extra and weekend hours; and Birgit Kulawik for providing graphic design.

288,pub.1141632686,10.3390/f12101353,,,Differential Impact of an Eclipse on Photosynthetic Performance of Trees with Different Degrees of Shade Tolerance,"Solar eclipses represent a natural and unexpected event for plants that can potentially affect photosynthetic performance at the individual level. This effect, however, has seldom been evaluated. Here, we measured the impact of a total solar eclipse on the photosynthetic rate of different tree species—located in the Bosque Fray Jorge National Park, Chile—with varying degrees of shade tolerance. Specifically, we assessed whether the rapid and progressive light limitation facilitated by a solar eclipse would negatively impact the photosynthetic responses of these tree species and whether their photosynthetic performance would have a greater decrease when the percentage of eclipse shadow was higher, particularly in the less shade-tolerant species. To accomplish this, we compared daily changes in the photosynthetic rates of three tree species during a control (non-eclipse) vs. an eclipse day that occurred on 2 July 2019. Overall, tree species showed differences between a non-eclipse and eclipse day in the daily dynamics of their photosynthetic performance, with this trend being most evident at the peak of the solar eclipse. Additionally, each species showed a different pattern of de-epoxidation in accordance with its degree of shade tolerance. Our results suggest that solar eclipses negatively affect the photosynthesis of the studied Chilean tree species, which may be related to energy dissipation capacity via the de-epoxidation of xanthophyll pigments. This effect was more evident in shade-intolerant species, indicating that eclipses can present different consequences for the overall performance of various plant species.","We thank Paula Rodríguez, Matias Contreras, and Fabrizio Guerra for their assistance in the field with leaf photosynthesis measurements and lab assays.",This research received no external funding.,Forests,,,,2021-10-04,2021,2021-10-04,,12,10,1353,All OA; Gold,Article,"Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.; Atala, Cristian; Carrasco-Urra, Fernando","Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.

However, national-level action plans that bring together diverse scientific experts, non-governmental organizations, and governmental agencies to focus on improving the status of endangered species are generally rare. Here, we highlight one such plan published a decade ago, the Brazilian National Action Plan for the Conservation of Muriquis, which promoted the integration of scientific findings about the behavioral ecology, demography, and genetics of northern muriquis with conservation measures supported by the Brazilian government. This plan provided a holistic framework for the development of an effective national strategy that has contributed to significant advances in research and management applied to the conservation of this Critically Endangered species. We hope that this model for muriquis will stimulate conservationists around the world to pursue integrative national-level sponsorship of action plans on behalf of other endangered species.","We are grateful to Marcelo Marcelino de Oliveira and Juliana G.

We use methods from non-linear dynamical systems theory and averaging theory considering a time-dependent perturbation function D. We define a regular dynamical system over a compact phase space, obtaining global results. That is, for KS metric the global late-time attractors of full and time-averaged systems are two anisotropic contracting solutions, which are non-flat locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Kasner and Taub (flat LRS Kasner) for 0≤γ≤2$$0\le \gamma \le 2$$, and flat FLRW matter-dominated universe if 0≤γ≤23$$0\le \gamma \le \frac{2}{3}$$. For closed FLRW metric late-time attractors of full and averaged systems are a flat matter-dominated FLRW universe for 0≤γ≤23$$0\le \gamma \le \frac{2}{3}$$ as in KS and Einstein–de Sitter solution for 0≤γ<1$$0\le \gamma <1$$. Therefore, a time-averaged system determines future asymptotics of the full system. Also, oscillations entering the system through Klein–Gordon (KG) equation can be controlled and smoothed out when D goes monotonically to zero, and incidentally for the whole D-range for KS and closed FLRW (if 0≤γ<1$$0\le \gamma < 1$$) too. However, for γ≥1$$\gamma \ge 1$$ closed FLRW solutions of the full system depart from the solutions of the averaged system as D is large.

The prevalence is on the rise worldwide, with a current frequency of 200 per 10 000 children. There is no established prevalence in Colombia, according to the Colombian Autism League. The incidence rate is on the rise, unclear if the increase is related to changes in the diagnostic criteria, the study methodology, an actual increase in the incidence of autism, or a combination of these factors. Objective: to characterize a group of patients with autism spectrum disorder and to recognize socio-environmental changes related to the population described. Methods: A descriptive observational study. Patients between 1 and 18 years of age, clinically diagnosed by neurology and child psychiatry, with autism spectrum disorder, between 2011 and 2017, in a reference center for pediatric neurological rehabilitation. Results: Data were obtained from 253 patients with autism spectrum disorders, with a mean age of symptom onset of 22.4 months (SD = 9.72) and an age at diagnosis of 43.2 months. The most frequent autism spectrum disorder was grade 1 or mild (39.5 %), the most common symptom being motor stereotypies (78.3 %), followed by interaction and social communication deficit (75.5 %). Conclusion: the importance of early recognition of clinical manifestations changes the opportunity for diagnosis and early initiation of treatment.",,,Pediatría,,,,2021-10-03,2021,2021-10-03,,54,2,63-70,All OA; Gold,Article,"De La Peña sanabria, Ivan David; Giovanetti, Laury Berdejo; Ruiz, Nataly Chavarriaga; Gulfo, Diana Carolina López; Manjarez, Laura Marcela Rueda; Charria, Oscar Dario Sánchez; Laza, Nicolas","De La Peña sanabria, Ivan David (ES"";s:3:""Dr "";}); Giovanetti, Laury Berdejo (Neuróloga Pediatra.

Among them, parasquilloids (superfamily Parasquilloidea) possess eyes with 2-3 midband rows of hexagonal ommatidia and spearing appendages. Here, we assembled and analyzed the complete mitochondrial genome of the parasquilloid Faughnia haani and explored family- and superfamily-level phylogenetic relationships within the Stomatopoda based on mitochondrial protein coding genes (PCGs).ResultsThe mitochondrial genome of F. haani is 16,089 bp in length and encodes 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and a control region that is relatively well organized, containing 2 GA-blocks, 4 poly-T stretches, various [TA(A)]n-blocks, and 2 hairpin structures. This organized control region is likely a synapomorphic characteristic in the Stomatopoda. Comparison of the control region among superfamilies shows that parasquilloid species are more similar to gonodactyloids than to squilloids and lysiosquilloids given the presence of various  poly-T stretches between the hairpin structures and [TA(A)]n-blocks. Synteny is identical to that reported for other stomatopods and corresponds to the Pancrustacea ground pattern. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on PCGs revealed that Parasquilloidea is sister to Lysiosquilloidea and Gonodactyloidea and not to Squilloidea, contradicting previous phylogenetic studies.ConclusionsThe novel phylogenetic position of Parasquilloidea revealed by our study indicates that ‘spearing’ raptorial appendages are plesiomorphic and that the ‘smashing’ type is either derived (as reported in previous studies) or apomorphic. Our results raise the possibility that the spearing raptorial claw may have independently evolved twice. The superfamily Parasquilloidea exhibits a closer relationship with other stomatopod superfamilies with a different raptorial claw type and with dissimilar numbers of midband rows of hexagonal ommatidia. Additional studies focusing on the assembly of mitochondrial genomes from species belonging to different genera, families, and superfamilies within the order Stomatopoda are warranted to reach a robust conclusion regarding the evolutionary history of this iconic clade based on mitochondrial PCGs.",Constructive comments from anonymous reviewers are gratefully acknowledged.,,BMC Genomics,,,"Animals; Biological Evolution; Crustacea; Genome, Mitochondrial; Humans; Phylogeny; RNA, Transfer",2021-10-02,2021,2021-10-02,2021-12,22,1,716,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hwang, Hee-seung; Jung, Jongwoo; Baeza, Juan Antonio","Hwang, Hee-seung (Research Institute of EcoScience, Ewha Womans University, 03760, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Jung, Jongwoo (Division of EcoCreative, Ewha Womans University, 03760, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Science Education, Ewha Womans University, 03760, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Baeza, Juan Antonio (Department of Biological Sciences, 132 Long Hall, Clemson University, 29634, Clemson, SC, USA; Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, 701 Seaway Drive, Fort Pierce, 34949, Florida, USA; Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Jung, Jongwoo (Ewha Womans University; Ewha Womans University); Baeza, Juan Antonio (Clemson University; Smithsonian Marine Station; Catholic University of the North)","Hwang, Hee-seung (Ewha Womans University); Jung, Jongwoo (Ewha Womans University; Ewha Womans University); Baeza, Juan Antonio (Clemson University; Smithsonian Marine Station; Catholic University of the North)",1,1,,0.29,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12864-021-08034-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141599457,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,
301,pub.1141809375,10.3390/math9192451,,,Sustainability Ranking of the Iranian Major Ports by Using MCDM Methods,"The maritime industry is moving towards a sustainable supply chain (SSC), intending to increase the quality of logistics and make more profit. The sustainability of the maritime supply chain (MSC) in Iran is one of the topics that has not been widely studied. Ports play a crucial role in promoting Iran’s position in the international transit of products, strengthening economic, social, and environmental connections with neighboring eastern and northeastern countries, improving GDP, and promoting the role of the free zone in the national development of the country. Port development is one of the essential elements in the government’s strategic planning in developing and activating the East axis. It has a special priority in line with government policies based on deprivation elimination and improving people’s living standards. This paper considers five significant ports of Iran that are part of special economic zones and studies the sustainability of those ports. In this research, different multi-criteria decision-making methods were applied to solve a sustainability-ranking problem of major Iranian ports. First of all, by using the SWARA method, sub-criteria of loading and unloading oil, pier length, and population obtained the highest scores in economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability, respectively, which shows that they had the greatest impact on the sustainability assessment of Iranian ports. Finally, the MARCOS and CoCoSo techniques were the most similar in all three dimensions of sustainability, and both seemed to be suitable methods for evaluating the sustainability of ports. Furthermore, the implementation of sensitivity analysis and definition of different scenarios for port evaluation and the high efficiency of the MARCOS method were determined in solving the port-ranking problem. According to the MARCOS method results, economic, environmental, and social criteria were all effective criteria in the sustainable development of major Iranian ports and have been largely applied in Astara, Bushehr, and Imam Khomeini ports. Based on the analysis of the results, several managerial insights to make better industry decisions are also revealed.",,"Proyecto Nº 11190104: New approaches to the future-based decision making based on Prospective Multiple Attribute Decision Making (PMADM) outline; Programa Fodecyt, Conicyt, Ministrio de Educacion, Chile.",Mathematics,,,,2021-10-02,2021,2021-10-02,,9,19,2451,All OA; Gold,Article,"Majidi, Ali; Al-e-Hashem, Seyed M.

The purpose is to design a didactic sequence for the subject of electrical circuits, using two articulated pedagogical approaches so that students from a school of engineering in Mexico must solve an engineering problem linked to a relevant topic of physics, such as the characteristics of electrical circuits, the problem must be solved methodologically and systematically. The inquiry approach is quantitative, with a quasi-experimental design, a validated instrument is used for data collection. Subsequently, the hypothesis test for differences between means is applied and the results are analyzed. Thus, it is found that the development of critical thinking is incipient; however, the assessment of physics learning products reveals relevant findings such as the promotion of creativity. Likewise, the problem presented to the students allows them to contextualize their learning and recognize the relevance and application of the characteristics of electrical circuits. This inquiry confirms that the development of critical thinking through physics improves the comprehensive training of engineers. Therefore, according to the results, there is empirical evidence that both articulated methodologies can gradually favor the development of critical thinking; In addition, the methodological and contextualized learning of physics through the subject of electrical circuits is applied to a branch of engineering.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2021-10-01,2021,,2021-10-01,2073,1,012001,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moreno, F Escobar; Díaz, M H Ramírez","Moreno, F Escobar (Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México, México); Díaz, M H Ramírez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México, México)",,"Moreno, F Escobar (Instituto Politécnico Nacional); Díaz, M H Ramírez (Instituto Politécnico Nacional)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2073/1/012001,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142392564,51 Physical Sciences,4 Quality Education

Aim of the Study: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of TP in treating DKD and offer solid evidence for further clinical applications of TP. Materials and Methods: Eight databases (CNKI, VIP, CBM, WanFang, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were electronically searched for eligible studies until October 17, 2020. We selected animal experimental studies using TP versus renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or nonfunctional liquids to treat DKD by following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two researchers independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias tool. Fixed-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Inplasy registration number: INPLASY2020100042. Results: Twenty-six studies were included. Meta-analysis showed that TP significantly reduced albuminuria (14 studies; standardized mean difference SMD: -1.44 [-1.65, -1.23], I2 = 87%), urine albumin/urine creatinine ratio (UACR) (8 studies; SMD: -5.03 [-5.74, -4.33], I2 = 84%), total proteinuria (4 studies; SMD: -3.12 [-3.75, -2.49], I2 = 0%), serum creatinine (18 studies; SMD: -0.30 [-0.49, -0.12], I2 = 76%), and blood urea nitrogen (12 studies; SMD: -0.40 [-0.60, -0.20], I2 value = 55%) in DKD animals, compared to the vehicle control. However, on comparing TP to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in DKD treatment, there was no marked difference in ameliorating albuminuria (3 studies; SMD: -0.35 [-0.72, 0.02], I2 = 41%), serum creatinine (3 studies; SMD: -0.07 [-0.62, 0.48], I2 = 10%), and blood urea nitrogen (2 studies; SMD: -0.35 [-0.97, 0.28], I2 = 0%). Of note, TP exhibited higher capacities in reducing UACR (2 studies; SMD: -0.66 [-1.31, -0.01], I2 = 0%) and total proteinuria (2 studies; SMD: -1.18 [-1.86, -2049], I2 = 0%). Meta-regression implicated that the efficacy of TP in reducing DKD albuminuria was associated with applied dosages. In addition, publication bias has not been detected on attenuating albuminuria between TP and RAS inhibitors after the diagnosis of DKD.

The main clinical manifestations of KS include dysmorphic facial features, such as elongated palpebral fissures, eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids, and short nasal columella with a broad and depressed nasal tip. Additionally, patients also present with skeletal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic features, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hearing loss, and postnatal growth deficiency. We describe an 11-year-old girl from Colombia, who presented with characteristic clinical signs of KS. Genetic studies showed a KMT2D intronic variant (KMT2D NM_003482.3: c.511-2A> T) as a cause of KS.","All forms of support and funding for study design, data collection, data analysis and manuscript writing were provided by the employers of the authors (Universidad Icesi and Fundación Valle del Lili).

Objective To evaluate the leptospirosis epidemiological surveillance system in the municipality of Campinas, state of São Paulo, Brazil, between 2007 and 2014.  Method A study on the prevalence of leptospirosis cases was carried out in the epidemiological surveillance system. A total of 2949 reported cases were analyzed considering the attributes of the Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems and the parameters proposed by Souza et al. (2010) for the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The following attributes were assessed: completeness, acceptability, sensitivity, positive predictive value, representativeness, and timeliness.  Results The following percentages were found for the respective attributes: completeness (94.1%), acceptability (68.3%), positive predictive value (10.7%), representativeness (98.4%) and timeliness (71.4%).  Conclusion The leptospirosis epidemiological surveillance system in Campinas presented acceptable completeness and good positive predictive value of disease suspicion. Delays in the notification and investigation of cases and poor integration between the information systems were observed. The evaluation of the surveillance system provides important information for the organization of health services and should be part of the routine of actions provided for in the system.

In the different exergy and exergoeconomics studies applied in petrochemical plants, parameters of interest have been determined to evaluate the thermal efficiency, the potential for process improvement, the irreversibilities produced by the interaction between the components of the system and the operation of each one, and the energy costs associated with each of these irreversibilities. This paper presents an advanced exergy analysis and an exergy-economic analysis applied to a nitric acid production plant with an installed capacity of 350 metric tons per day, whose operating principle is based on the Ostwald method, and both the behavior of endogenous exergy destruction and the behavior of exogenous, avoidable and unavoidable exergy destruction are studied, exogenous, avoidable and unavoidable exergy destruction and the associated exergy costs in each of the heat transfer equipment and reactive equipment that make up the plant, about the cooling temperature in the intermediate stages of the compression train are studied using a mathematical model. The chemical reactions involved in the production process are the points of interest in the research of this work. Some of the results show that 54 % of the total exergy destruction can be recovered by intervening in the components. On the other hand, in the Catalytic Converter (CONV), it is convenient to consider the investment costs to reduce the exergy destruction costs. Similarly, in the Tail Gas Heater (TGH), it is beneficial to reduce the total investment to improve the process economics. On the other hand, the cost of exergy destruction of the plant resulted in 770.77 USD/h. In addition, it could be determined that the interactions between the components significantly affect the investment costs.",To the Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar for providing all the necessary resources to carry out this study.,,Case Studies in Thermal Engineering,,,,2021-10,2021,,2021-10,27,,101214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Ana Buelvas; Fajardo, Juan Gabriel; Barreto, Deibys; Caballero, Gaylord Enrique Carrillo; Escorcia, Yulineth Cárdenas; Tovar, Carlos Ramón Vidal; Hernández, Yimy Gordon","Hernández, Ana Buelvas (Universidad Del Norte, Engineering Faculty, Mechanical Engineering Department, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fajardo, Juan Gabriel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar (UTB), Engineering Faculty, Grupo de Investigación EOLITO, Cartagena, Colombia); Barreto, Deibys (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar (UTB), Engineering Faculty, Grupo de Investigación EOLITO, Cartagena, Colombia); Caballero, Gaylord Enrique Carrillo (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar (UTB), Engineering Faculty, Grupo de Investigación EOLITO, Cartagena, Colombia); Escorcia, Yulineth Cárdenas (Energy Department, Universidad de la Costa (CUC), Grupo de Investigación GIOPEN, Barranquilla, Colombia); Tovar, Carlos Ramón Vidal (Universidad Popular del Cesar, Ingeniería Agroindustrial, Grupo de investigación CRECI, Valledupar, Colombia); Hernández, Yimy Gordon (Universidad Popular del Cesar, Comercio Internacional, Grupo de investigación FACEUPC, Valledupar, Colombia)","Escorcia, Yulineth Cárdenas (University of the Coast)","Hernández, Ana Buelvas (Universidad del Norte); Fajardo, Juan Gabriel (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Barreto, Deibys (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Caballero, Gaylord Enrique Carrillo (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Escorcia, Yulineth Cárdenas (University of the Coast); Tovar, Carlos Ramón Vidal (Popular University of Cesar); Hernández, Yimy Gordon (Popular University of Cesar)",2,1,,0.51,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csite.2021.101214,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140049987,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This study also included the evaluation of specificity and sensitivity of VBGs values for the identification of abnormal ABG values.
METHOD: It was a retrospective, observational study conducted at the Indus Hospital and Health Network, Karachi, Pakistan. All VBG and ABG values in the same patient which were collected at the same time from April 2020 to May 2021 were included in the study.  Results: The study involved 377 patients; 52.8% of patients were female, while 47.2% were male. The mean age of patients was 53.4 years (±17.2). There is an acceptable agreement between the arterial and venous values of pH, bicarbonate (mEq/l), and lactate (mEq/l), respectively, and poor agreement in PCO2 (mmHg) and PO2.
CONCLUSION: The study found that analysis of VBG has the potential to be used in the emergency setting in general. Blood gas values of Lactate, HCO3, and pH have shown acceptable association and significant correlation, and they can be considered clinically interchangeable with ABGs values.

This has led society to seek alternatives. Bioethanol is a biofuel that can be obtained from the fermentation of different raw materials rich in sucrose such as sugarcane, which can be mixed with gasoline and used to reduce polluting emissions. The following investigation focused on studying the efficiency of three selected native yeasts in the fermentation of black sugarcane POJ 27-14 variety juice to produce bioethanol and other byproducts of biotechnological interest. A comparison between the size of the inoculum of three selected native yeasts (Lev6, Lev9, and Lev30) and two reference commercial controls in the fermentation process was performed. The phylogenetic classification was carried out based on the analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1 sequence, 5.8S ribosomal RNA, and internal transcribed spacer 2. Lev6 and Lev30 were classified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while Lev9 was Candida intermedia, with 99% nucleotide sequence identity. The results showed that the optimal growth temperature was 30 °C with constant agitation (200 rpm) for biomass production. The Lev30 strain presented the highest yield in the production of biomass from sugarcane juice fermentation, while the Lev6 strain presented the highest yield in ethanol production. Additionally, among native yeasts, Lev6 registered the highest ethanol concentration (Q) and volumetric productivity (Qp) values of 0.61 (g/L/h) and 43.92 g/L, respectively, which were comparable with the control yeasts. The gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated the presence of ethanol in all samples (98% to 99% relative percentages) along with some therapeutic substances such as (2-aziridinylethyl) amine and tetraacetyl-d-xylonic nitrile with greater efficiency than commercial controls from the alcoholic fermentation of black sugarcane juice.",The authors wish to thank J.

In this research, molasses waste from Laredo Agroindustrial Company was used as fuel, as well as graphite and zinc electrodes, managing to build low-cost cells. It was possible to generate voltage and current peaks of 0.389 ± 0.021 V and 1.179 ± 0.079 mA, respectively. The cells showed that acid pH levels and conductivity values were around 100 mS/cm during the period of the highest bioelectricity generation. The maximum power density was 3.76 ± 0.62 W/cm2 for a current density of 247.55 mA/cm2, showing a peak voltage of 0.459 ± 0.52 V. The yeasts showed a logarithmic phase up to day 25 reflecting an increase in cell growth. Microbial fuel cells are projected to be the most viable solution for organic waste and clean energy generation problems.",,,Environmental Research Engineering and Management,,,,2021-09-30,2021,2021-09-30,,77,3,15-22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores, Segundo Rojas; Nazario-Naveda, Renny; Betines, Santiago M.; De La Cruz–Noriega, M.; Cabanillas-Chirinos, L.; Valdiviezo-Dominguez, F.","Flores, Segundo Rojas (Universidad Señor de Sipan, Peru); Nazario-Naveda, Renny (Grupo de Investigación en Ciencias Aplicadas y Nuevas Tecnologías, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, 13007, Peru); Betines, Santiago M.

Nine MFCs were manufactured with zinc and copper electrodes; and as substrates, pineapple, potato and tomato pulp wastes were used in the anode chamber, and residual sludge in the cathode chamber. It was observed that the MFCs with pineapple substrate generated higher values of the electrical parameters, resulting in voltage and current values of 0.3484 ± 0.003 V and 27.88 ± 0.23 mA, respectively. It was also observed that the maximum power density was 0.967 ± 0.059 W/cm2 at a current density of 0.04777 A/cm2 for the same substrate. Acid pH values were observed in the three samples, while the conductivity reached its maximum value on day 23 (69.47 ± 0.91 mS/cm) which declined until the last day of monitoring; the turbidity values increased abruptly after day 22 until the last day where a value of 200.3 ± 2.52 UNT was observed for the pineapple substrate. The scanning electron microscopy for the pineapple substrate MFC electrodes shows the formation of a porous biofilm on the zinc and copper electrodes. These results show that a new form of electricity production has been achieved by generating high voltage and current values, using low-cost materials.",,,Environmental Research Engineering and Management,,,,2021-09-30,2021,2021-09-30,,77,3,6-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores, Segundo Rojas; Nazario-Naveda, Renny; Delfín-Narciso, Daniel; Cardenas, Moises Gallozo; Diaz, Natalia Diaz; Ravelo, Karen Valverde","Flores, Segundo Rojas (Research Group in Applied Sciences and New Technologies, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Perú); Nazario-Naveda, Renny (Research Group in Applied Sciences and New Technologies, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Perú); Delfín-Narciso, Daniel (Research Group in Applied Sciences and New Technologies, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Perú); Cardenas, Moises Gallozo (Research Group in Applied Sciences and New Technologies, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Perú); Diaz, Natalia Diaz (School of Environmental Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Perú); Ravelo, Karen Valverde (School of Environmental Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo 13007, Perú)",,"Flores, Segundo Rojas (Private University of the North); Nazario-Naveda, Renny (Private University of the North); Delfín-Narciso, Daniel (Private University of the North); Cardenas, Moises Gallozo (Private University of the North); Diaz, Natalia Diaz (Private University of the North); Ravelo, Karen Valverde (Private University of the North)",7,3,,1.26,https://erem.ktu.lt/index.php/erem/article/download/28493/15074,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141515343,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 40 Engineering,

We evaluate several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in a butterfly family, the Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generate a time-calibrated phylogeny containing 2,866 nymphalid species (~45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the latitudinal diversity gradient among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. The Neotropical diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and biotic interchanges with other regions are rare. Southeast Asia is also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, is the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, combined with tropical niche conservatism, played a major role in generating the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of nymphalid butterflies.","This study would not have been possible without the generous support of amateur and professional lepidopterists around the world, too many to name here; thank you to all for providing specimens and information about life histories of the butterflies.

Some regions show a narrow band of slightly increased oxygen concentrations within the ODL, an intermediate oxygen layer (iO2). CTD, oxygen and lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP, 300 kHz) profiles were taken on the shelf edge and outside down to mostly 2000 m. We evaluate here the acoustic volume backscatter strength of the LADCP signal representing organisms of about 5 mm size. Dominant features of the backscatter profiles were a minimum backscatter strength within the ODL, and just below the lOx a marked backscatter increase reaching a maximum at less than 3.0 μmol O2 kg–1. Below this maximum, the acoustic backscatter strength gradually decreased down to 1000 m below the lOx. The backscatter strength also increased at the iO2 in parallel to the oxygen concentration perturbations marking the iO2. These stable backscatter features were independent of the time of day and the organisms represented by the backscatter had to be adapted to live in this microaerobic environment. During daylight, these stable structures were overlapped by migrating backscatter peaks. Outstanding features of the stable backscatter were that at very low oxygen concentrations, the volume backscatter was linearly related to the oxygen concentration, reaching half peak maximum at less than 2.0 μmol O2 kg–1 below the lOx, and the depth-integrated backscatter of the peak below the lOx was higher than the integral above the Ox. Both features suggest that sufficient organic material produced at the surface reaches to below the ODL to sustain the major fraction of the volume backscatter-producing organisms in the water column. These organisms are adapted to the microaerobic environment so they can position themselves close to the lower oxycline to take advantage of the organic particles sinking out of the ODL.","We would like to thank the crew of the French R/V Atalante, and Anne Royer, Emmanuel de Saint Léger and Olivier Depretz De Gesincourt from French Technical Division (INSU/CNRS) for general logistics support.

Sin embargo, la falta de un tratamiento sistemático de los contratos del Estado por parte del legislador provocó una discusión que terminó reduciendo todos los acuerdos a compras de servicios.",,,Revista Digital de Derecho Administrativo,,,,2021-09-27,2021,2021-09-27,,,26,163-196,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores Díaz, Sebastián","Flores Díaz, Sebastián ()",,"Flores Díaz, Sebastián ()",1,1,,,https://revistas.uexternado.edu.co/index.php/Deradm/article/download/7297/10236,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139361422,,

Despite of its apparent generality, a growing body of evidence shows that 'anomalous' LDG (i.e., inverse or hump-shaped trends) are common among marine organisms along the Southeastern Pacific (SEP) coast. Here, we evaluate the shape of the LDG of marine benthic polychaetes and its underlying causes using a dataset of 643 species inhabiting the continental shelf (<200 m depth), using latitudinal bands with a spatial resolution of 0.5°, along the SEP (3-56° S). The explanatory value of six oceanographic (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), SST range, salinity, salinity range, primary productivity and shelf area), and one macroecological proxy (median latitudinal range of species) were assessed using a random forest model. The taxonomic structure was used to estimate the degree of niche conservatism of predictor variables and to estimate latitudinal trends in phylogenetic diversity, based on three indices (phylogenetic richness (PDSES), mean pairwise distance (MPDSES), and variation of pairwise distances (VPD)). The LDG exhibits a hump-shaped trend, with a maximum peak of species richness at ca. 42° S, declining towards northern and southern areas of SEP. The latitudinal pattern was also evident in local samples controlled by sampling effort. The random forest model had a high accuracy (pseudo-r2 = 0.95) and showed that the LDG could be explained by four variables (median latitudinal range, SST, salinity, and SST range), yet the functional relationship between species richness and these predictors was variable. A significant degree of phylogenetic conservatism was detected for the median latitudinal range and SST. PDSES increased toward the southern region, whereas VPD showed the opposite trend, both statistically significant. MPDSES has the same trend as PDSES, but it is not significant. Our results reinforce the idea that the south Chile fjord area, particularly the Chiloé region, was likely the evolutionary source of new species of marine polychaetes along SEP, creating a hotspot of diversity. Therefore, in the same way as the canonical LDG shows a decline in diversity while moving away from the tropics; on this case the decline occurs while moving away from Chiloé Island. These results, coupled with a strong phylogenetic signal of the main predictor variables suggest that processes operating mainly at evolutionary timescales govern the LDG.","Rodrigo A.

El objetivo de esta revisión es evaluar las alteraciones del sueño en periodos de emergencia y desastres. A lo largo de la historia, la esfera biopsicosocial y el sueño de las personas ha sido abrumada por múltiples eventos a gran escala, tales como desastres naturales, tragedias provocadas por el hombre, conflictos bélicos, crisis sociales y pandemias, cuya experiencia puede derivar en problemas de salud a corto, mediano y/o largo plazo. En los estudios analizados, se ha observado el impacto negativo de las emergencias y desastres en el sueño, por lo que ha cobrado gran relevancia la difusión y promoción de medidas que incentiven el buen dormir. Debido a la llegada del COVID-19 y a la situación de confinamiento por periodos prolongados en el hogar para prevenir su propagación, han surgido importantes consecuencias a nivel social. Ciertos factores ocupacionales y características de los desastres se asocian a mayor comorbilidad, un alto riesgo de experimentar agotamiento físico, trastornos psicológicos e insomnio en grupos altamente vulnerables, como lo son los profesionales de la salud, rescatistas y socorristas. El insomnio es el trastorno de sueño más frecuente en la población general y su empeoramiento en el contexto de pandemia por COVID-19 representa un nuevo problema en salud pública.

Nevertheless, regardless of much development since it was first used, the process advantages are restricted by low recoveries and long extraction times. It is becoming progressively clear that the selection of heap leaching as an appropriate technology to process a specific mineral resource that is both environmentally sound and economically feasible very much relies on having an ample understanding of the essential underlying mechanisms of the processes and how they interrelate with the specific mineralogy of the ore body under concern. This paper provides a critical overview of the role of gangues and clays minerals as rate-limiting factors in copper heap leaching operations.

Evidence shows that ED and INTP are associated with comorbidities. The relationship between these variables has not been the focus of studies on young people from Northern Chile. Children and adolescents are considered as an at-risk group, since they have been found to experience greater vulnerability to psychological problems than other age groups within the population and given the scarcity of studies in Chile, it is necessary to study the relationship between these variables.MethodsThis study analyzed the relationship between ED and INTP in Chilean high school students aged 12 to 18 years using Pearson's correlation. This is a non-experimental and transactional correlational study. We included 2277 students belonging to the public, government-subsidized, and private educational establishments in Northern Chile. The Child and Adolescent Evaluation System [Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA)] was used to detect a range of INTP, as well as ED. The Brief Self-Control Scale was used in this study.ResultsA strong and direct correlation of the eating disorder variable with depression and anxiety was found. Additionally, significant differences were observed with sex, highlighting females with a higher presence of INTP and ED.ConclusionsThere is a need to establish strategies in the school setting for detecting frequent symptomatology in adolescents with INTP and ED to achieve a timely and accessible intervention.Plain English SummarySince the symptomatology of ED is more prevalent in adolescents, this research evaluated relationships between ED and INTP in young people from Northern Chile. This research is relevant because the evidence on this topic in Chile is scarce and the relationships found could be the first research on the subject and serve to design an intervention plan at the school level in the medium and long terms. It is a non-experimental and transactional correlational study because all variables were measured at a single moment, and it sought to establish relationships between variables without assuming causality. The sample of secondary school students consisted of 2277 students, belonging to the public, subsidized, and private schools. Strong relationships were observed between INTP and ED, the strongest correlations being with the variables depression and anxiety. In addition, female participants presented greater problems in ED and INTP.",This research was funded by the ANID PIA CIE160007.,,Journal of Eating Disorders,,,,2021-09-26,2021,2021-09-26,2021-12,9,1,118,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Urzúa, Alfonso; Flores, Jerome; Acevedo, Daniel; Lorca, Jessica Herrera; Casanova, Jenifer","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Calle Antofagasta n°1520, 1000000, Arica, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Acevedo, Daniel (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Lorca, Jessica Herrera (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Casanova, Jenifer (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Acevedo, Daniel (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Lorca, Jessica Herrera (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Casanova, Jenifer (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile)",2,1,0.38,0.75,https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40337-021-00474-w,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141405562,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Most research in this field describes measurements and signal processing methods to determine the effect of some design modifications. However, the number of investigations that try to solve the problem from the design stage is much smaller. The following study presents a review of the trends in the analysis of vibrations of power transmission elements and their relationship to the use of systematic design methodologies in the principal power transmission elements. A revision is shown in design considerations to prevent mechanical vibrations or reduce them to acceptable levels. The effects in terms of improvement in reducing vibrations of the most important works that have taken into account the vibrations in design stages are shown. The results show the importance of considering the mechanical vibrations in the design of power transmission elements. Moreover, the analysis of the state of the art shows the areas to be investigated that contemplate the development or application of formal design methodologies that take into account mechanical vibrations.","The authors would like to thank the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Universidad del Norte, and Universidad de Magallanes for their academic support in this research.",The research was supported by MINCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 785.,Machines,,,,2021-09-25,2021,2021-09-25,,9,10,212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villalba, Rafael Tuirán; Ramírez, Heriberto Maury; Estrada, Héctor Águila","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Seccional Montería, Cra 6 #97A-99, Montería 230002, Colombia); Ramírez, Heriberto Maury (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, hmaury@uninorte.edu.co); Estrada, Héctor Águila (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad de Magallanes, Avenida Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile;, hector.aguila@umag.cl)","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Pontifical Bolivarian University)","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Ramírez, Heriberto Maury (Universidad del Norte); Estrada, Héctor Águila (University of Magallanes)",5,2,,1.59,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/9/10/212/pdf?version=1632713647,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141438685,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

A major factor of the modern-day ecological diversity of the group, and supposedly in the past as well, is represented by the highly specialised larval forms of lacewings. Quantitative analyses of the morphology of larvae revealed a loss of morphological diversity in several lineages. Here we explored the diversity of the larvae of mantis lacewings (Mantispidae), lance lacewings (Osmylidae), beaded lacewings (Berothidae and Rhachiberothidae, the latter potentially an ingroup of Berothidae), and pleasing lacewings (Dilaridae), as well as fossil larvae, preserved in amber, resembling these. We used shape analysis of the head capsule and stylets (pair of conjoined jaws) as a basis due to the high availability of this body region in extant and fossil specimens and the ecological importance of this region. The analysis revealed a rather constant morphological diversity in Berothidae. Mantispidae appears to have lost certain forms of larvae, but has seen a drastic increase of larval diversity after the Cretaceous; this is in contrast to a significant decrease in diversity in adult forms.","Mónica M.

However, the antioxidant behavior of its derivatives has not been well explored. In the present work, the antioxidant activity of 10 dapsone derivatives 4-substituted was determined by an evaluation in two in vitro models (DPPH radical scavenging assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power). These imine derivatives 1-10 were obtained through condensation between DDS and the corresponding aromatic aldehydes 4-substuited. Three derivatives presented better results than DDS in the determination of DPPH (2, 9, and 10). Likewise, we have three compounds with better reducing activity than dapsone (4, 9, and 10). In order to be more insight, the redox process, a conceptual DFT analysis was carried out. Molecular descriptors such as electronic distribution, the total charge accepting/donating capacity (I/A), and the partial charge accepting/donating capacity (ω+/ω-) were calculated to analyze the relative donor-acceptor capacity through employing a donor acceptor map (DAM). The DFT calculation allowed us to establish a relationship between GAPHOMO-LUMO and DAM with the observed antioxidant effects. According to the results, we concluded that compounds 2 and 3 have the lowest Ra values, representing a good antioxidant behavior observed experimentally in DPPH radical capturing. On the other hand, derivatives 4, 9, and 10 display the best reducing capacity activity with the highest ω- and Rd values. Consequently, we propose these compounds as the best antireductants in our DDS imine derivative series.","The authors thank the Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos, and CONACyT for the facilities to develop this work.","R.G.-A. thanks CONACYT for the scholarship, grant numbers 473085 and PEI-231815.

Objectives: the purpose is to analyze the methods used by these companies to recognize, measure and report revenues from ordinary activities for guest accommodation services. Materials and methods: the methodology used is a dynamic one that includes a documentary review of the legal and regulatory accounting framework, academic repositories, and the analysis of official reports, applying an exploratory and explanatory investigation of the current technical regulatory framework, using a mixed quantitative and qualitative research approach. Results: Revenues from hotel services are made according to Decrees 2706 of 2012 and 3022 of 2013. The revenues are recognized when a credible measurement can be made and the control, risks, and benefits of the good or customer service are transferred. Its measurement is based on fair value applying the active market method. Discussion: The implementation of section 23 of IFRS for SMEs has not affected the economic performance of SMEs in the ecotourism sector; instead, it has generated greater foreign investment and capital flows. Conclusions: Companies of groups two and three apply IFRS for SMEs, which may incorporate section 23 into its individual policies. Contribution/originality: It is expected to formulate an implementation guide for the accounting standard for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of service revenues for hotel companies in the ecotourism sector that meet the requirements to apply IFRS group two and, in the case of microenterprises in group three, if they wished, they would be able to incorporate section 23 into their individual policies.",,,Revista Geon (Gestión Organizaciones y Negocios),,,,2021-09-22,2021,2021-09-22,,8,2,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Palacio, Oscar William Salinas; Rincón, Johanna Cristina Serrano","Palacio, Oscar William Salinas (Corporación Universitaria Remington); Rincón, Johanna Cristina Serrano (Corporación Universitaria Remington)",,"Palacio, Oscar William Salinas (Corporación Universitaria Remington); Rincón, Johanna Cristina Serrano (Corporación Universitaria Remington)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistageon.unillanos.edu.co/index.php/geon/article/download/498/830,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141312353,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services","15 Life on Land; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

There are many ways to detect it, among them, with the use of blood biomarkers such as albumin, although the association between the two has not been confirmed yet.
This review synthesizes the knowledge on the association between sarcopenia and serum albumin among elderly individuals through a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on the etiology and risk factors. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute software for the review and conducted a search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS databases while two reviewers conducted an independent manual search. EpiDat, version 3.1 was used for the meta-analysis; mean differences with the albumin scores disaggregated by sarcopenia were analyzed by the random-effects model. The degree of heterogeneity was assessed with the DerSimonian and Laird Q test.

Food-borne diseases are considered a major public health challenge worldwide due to their incidence, associated mortality, and negative economic repercussions. Food safety is the guarantee that foods will not cause harm to the health of those who consume them, and it is a fundamental property of food quality. Food safety can be at risk of being lost at any stage of the food chain if the food is contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms. Many diverse bacteria are present in the environment and as part of the microbiota of food that can be transmitted to humans during the handling and consumption of food. Plesiomonas shigelloides has been mainly associated with outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases due to the consumption of fish. This bacterium inhabits the environment and aquatic animals and is associated with the microbiota of fish such as tilapia, a fish of importance in fishing, aquaculture, commercialization, and consumption worldwide. The purpose of this document is to provide, through a bibliographic review of databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, among others), a general informative perspective on food-borne diseases and, in particular, the consumption of fish and tilapia. Diseases derived from contamination by Plesiomonas shigelloides are included, and control and prevention actions and sanitary regulations for fishery products established in several countries around the world are discussed to promote the safety of foods of aquatic origin intended for human consumption and to protect public health.",Alejandro De Jesús Cortés Sánchez and Luis Daniel Espinosa-Chaurand acknowledge financial support given by the National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT) to “Cátedra” position at CIBNOR.

This work aims to measure the enzymatic activity and non-enzymatic activity of two microalgae species in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and carotenoids, respectively, in response to static magnetic fields-induced stress. Two magnet configurations (north and south) and two exposure modes (continuous and pulse) were applied. Two microalgae species were considered, the Scenedesmus obliquus and Nannochloropsis gaditana. The SOD activity increased by up to 60% in S. obliquus under continuous exposure. This trend was also found for CAT in the continuous mode. Conversely, under the pulse mode, its response was hampered as the SOD and CAT were reduced. For N. gaditana, SOD increased by up to 62% with the south configuration under continuous exposure. In terms of CAT, there was a higher activity of up to 19%. Under the pulsed exposure, SOD activity was up to 115%. The CAT in this microalga was increased by up to 29%. For N. gaditana, a significant increase of over 40% in violaxanthin production was obtained compared to the control, when the microalgae were exposed to SMF as a pulse. Depending on the exposure mode and species, this methodology can be used to produce oxidative stress and obtain an inhibitory or enhanced response in addition to the significant increase in the production of antioxidant pigments.",The authors would like to thank the Universidad de Antofagasta for their support in performing this study.,"This research was funded by ANID/FONDEF/IDEA, grant number ID15I10487, and in part by the Programa Semilleros de Investigación: “Caracterización de una línea base para el análisis y determinación de los components celulares”, by the Fondo para el Desarrollo en investigación científica y/o tecnológica de actividades de titulación de pregrado 2018: “Producción de metabolitos de alto valor económico mediante exposición a un campo magnético estático tipo continuo y tipo pulso en las microalgas Scenedesmus obliquus y Nannochloropsis gaditana”, and by Programa Asignación año 2021 de Asistentes de investigación de la Universidad de Antofagasta código ANT20992.",Marine Drugs,,Carlos Almeida,Animals; Magnetic Fields; Microalgae; Oxidative Stress,2021-09-21,2021,2021-09-21,,19,9,527,All OA; Gold,Article,"Serrano, Génesis; Miranda-Ostojic, Carol; Ferrada, Pablo; Wulff-Zotelle, Cristian; Maureira, Alejandro; Fuentealba, Edward; Gallardo, Karem; Zapata, Manuel; Rivas, Mariella","Serrano, Génesis (Laboratorio de Biotecnología Ambiental Aplicada, Departamento de Biotecnología, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

In addition to analyzing the theoretical elements of this approach applied to the educational system and reviewing recent empirical contributions from the literature; The specific problem in Colombia is analyzed to arrive at a study proposal that involves these theoretical elements supported by more realistic assumptions. The use of neoclassical logic to explain performance and limitations from agency theory is questioned, opening the way to the governance approach as an alternative study according to the nature of the organization and management processes of educational systems, especially in the public sector. It concludes in favor of the potential of the institutions and the contractual approach to approach the study of educational systems, despite the possible measurement problems that may be faced.

We hypothesized that the neurocognitive dysfunction present in KS relies on an imbalance in X-chromosome gene expression. Thus, the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern and neurocognitive X-linked gene expression were tested and correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We evaluated 11 KS patients by (a) IQ assessment, (b) analyzing the XCI patterns using both HUMARA and ZDHHC15 gene assays, and (c) blood RT-qPCR to investigate seven X-linked genes related to neurocognitive development (GTPBP6, EIF2S3, ITM2A, HUWE1, KDM5C, GDI1, and VAMP7) and XIST in comparison with 14 (male and female) controls. Considering IQ 80 as the standard minimum reference, we verified that the variability in IQ scores in KS patients seemed to be associated with the XCI pattern. Seven individuals in the KS group presented a random X-inactivation (RXI) and lower average IQ than the four individuals who presented a skewed X-inactivation (SXI) pattern. The evaluation of gene expression showed higher GTPBP6 expression in KS patients with RXI than in controls (p = 0.0059). Interestingly, the expression of GTPBP6 in KS patients with SXI did not differ from that observed in controls. Therefore, our data suggest for the first time that GTPBP6 expression is negatively associated with full-scale IQ under the regulation of the type of XCI pattern. The SXI pattern may regulate GTPBP6 expression, thereby dampening the impairment in cognitive performance and playing a role in intelligence variability in individuals with KS, which warrants further mechanistic investigations.","We thank reported patient and their mothers for their cooperation in this study, Patricia Monteagudo, Andrea Mathez, Joao Ferro, and Julia Oliveira for the clinical follow-up of patients; Janete Cerutti and Rui Maciel for lab support.

In low visibility areas, systematic subsurface testing is required, most often in the form of shovel test pits or ""STPs"". Decisions about the interval between STPs, and the size of such units, impact significantly both the effectiveness of survey for site location and the efficiency of such prospection efforts, and yet ""cookie-cutter"" survey strategies are often employed without a thorough examination of their costs and benefits. In this work, we present a simulation-based method (DIGSS, Determination of Intervals using Georeferenced Survey Simulation) by which archaeologists can simulate the effectiveness and efficiency of different survey strategies for both prospective and retrospective applications. Beyond permitting the design and implementation of survey strategies that both maximize the possibility of site detection in a given region and that husband precious resources (money and time), this method permits the generation of post hoc correction factors that make direct comparison of previous surveys possible. While DIGSS was designed with archaeological applications (artifacts and sites) in mind, it has potential ramifications in other fields of study where discrete spatial sampling is used as a means of determining the presence, absence, or abundance of discontinuous assemblages materials of interest in a survey region. As such, we can envision potential application in the fields of geology, ecology, and environmental/pollution monitoring.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Andrea Zerboni,"Algorithms; Archaeology; Artifacts; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Geology; Humans; Models, Statistical; Programming Languages; Software; Statistics as Topic",2021-09-20,2021,2021-09-20,,16,9,e0257386,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pestle, William J.; Hubbell, Cara; Hubbe, Mark","Pestle, William J.

Mineralized veins also contain variable amounts of base metals, some of which (e.g., copper and iron) are considered harmful to the extraction of precious metals. Iron and especially copper minerals are known cyanide consumers; ore type classification schemes that do not consider the detrimental effects of such mineralogy or process elements can ultimately result in metal losses from ore feed restrictions, as well as spikes in cyanide consumption and higher operating costs. Mineralogical and geological variation can nonetheless be managed by applying alternating modes of operation as demonstrated in this paper; the decision to switch between modes is governed by current and forecasted stockpile levels feeding into the process. Simulations based on experiences at the Alhué deposit are provided that demonstrate the importance of standardized operational modes and their potential impact on cyanide consumption control.","The authors thank the staff at the Florida Mine (Alhué, Chile) for their assistance and support in conceptualizing and describing their operational problems and providing preliminary data.

One hundred and fifty-one patients diagnosed with schizophrenia completed the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS-24), sociodemographic information, and clinical and treatment characteristics of patients with schizophrenia. Multivariate analysis with multiple linear regression was then performed to identify variables that were potentially associated with the recovery assessment (variable criterion). A significant association was found between adherence to antipsychotic medication and the Willing to Ask for Help dimension of Recovery (β = 0.239, p = 0.005). Association of clinical and socio-demographic variables with recovery were identified: negative symptoms with Personal Confidence and Hope (β = -0.341, p = 0.001) and Goal and Success Orientation (β = -0.266, p = 0.014); cognitive symptoms with Willing to Ask for Help (β = -0.305, p = 0.018) and no domination by symptoms (β = -0.351, p = 0.005); marital status with reliance on others (β = -0.181, p = 0.045); age with Personal Confidence and Hope (β = -0.217, p = 0.021), Goal and Success Orientation (β = -0.296, p = 0.003), and no domination by symptoms (β = 0.214, p = 0.025).

We use present-day relationships between fecal pellet diameters from ashy chinchilla rats (Abrocoma cinerea) and mean annual rainfall to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of pluvials (wet episodes) spanning the past 16,000 years in the Atacama Desert based on 81 14C-dated A. cinerea paleomiddens. A transient climate simulation shows that pluvials identified at 15.9 to 14.8, 13.0 to 8.6, and 8.1 to 7.6 ka B.P. can be linked to North Atlantic (high-latitude) forcing (e.g., Heinrich Stadial 1, Younger Dryas, and Bond cold events). Holocene pluvials at 5.0 to 4.6, 3.2 to 2.1, and 1.4 to 0.7 ka B.P. are not simulated, implying low-latitude internal variability forcing (i.e., ENSO regime shifts).

The mammal fauna of the savannas in the Alter do Chão region (Santarém Municipality), is dominated by Necromys lasiurus, whose populations have been studied by researchers of the National Institute of Amazonian Research since 1983. Here, we summarize the studies and advances made so far to better understand aspects related to population dynamics and ecology of savanna rodents and the strategies they use to persist in an environment with frequent fires subject to global climatic influences. In the Amazonian savannas the species acts as a seed disperser and population fluctuations are related to invertebrate availability, but not with fire or vegetation structure. Global climate appears to affect N. lasiurus population dynamics at local scale (i.e., plot scale) but not at the regional scale of the Alter do Chão savannas. The long-term studies in Alter do Chão generated many advances about Necromys lasiurus population dynamics and ecology, including aspects relating to feeding, home range, animal-plant interactions, the effects of fire and climate change.",We would like to thank Laudelino Sardinha and Edivaldo Vasconcelos for helping with data collection and Isla Marialva for preparing the map.,"In the last 3 years the data collection was financed by PELD (LTER)-POPA through the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científco e Tecnológico (CNPq), grant number 441443/2016-8.

The most used models in ST are linear and undulatory periodization. Objective: Evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of training by applying three different models of ST periodization: Linear Periodization (LP), Weekly Undulating Periodization (WUP) and Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP) on: upper limb (UL) strength (submaximal and endurance), submaximal strength and power of the lower limbs (LL) and on other components of physical fitness (flexibility, agility and abdominal endurance strength). Methods: Experimental, longitudinal study, with a convenience sample, in which 29 people of both sexes participated, randomly allocated to the groups. Tests were performed pre- and post-intervention. ANOVA (two-way) of repeated measures was performed. Results: There was a significant increase in submaximal strength of the UL in the three periodization models: LP (p<0.001), the WUP (p=0.002) and DUP (p=0.001). There was also a significant increase in submaximal strength of the LL with LP (p=0.002), WUP (p<0.001) and with DUP (p=0.001). No significant intergroup differences were found in any test and time. Conclusion: In individuals without training experience, 24 weeks of TF provided gains in different manifestations of strength, regardless of the periodization model (LP, WUP or DUP).

Here we evaluate TP measures as potential endophenotypes in Caribbean families ascertained from probands affected by ADHD. A total of 232 individuals were recruited and clinically evaluated using an extensive battery of neuropsychological tasks and reaction time (RT)-based task paradigms. Further, the heritability (genetic variance underpinning phenotype) was estimated as a measure of the genetics apportionment. A predictive framework for ADHD diagnosis was derived using these tasks. We found that individuals with ADHD differed from controls in neuropsychological tasks assessing mental control, visual-verbal memory, verbal fluency, verbal, and semantic fluency. In addition, TP measures such as RT, errors, and variability were also affected in individuals with ADHD. Moreover, we determined that only omission and commission errors had significant heritability. In conclusion, we have disentangled omission and commission errors as possible TP endophenotypes in ADHD, which can be suitable to assess the neurobiological and genetic basis of ADHD. A predictive model using these endophenotypes led to remarkable sensitivity, specificity, precision and classification rate for ADHD diagnosis, and may be a useful tool for patients' diagnosis, follow-up, and longitudinal assessment in the clinical setting.","We express our highest appreciation to the families enrolled in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 24 adult patients with relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma from January 2014 to September 2020 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. We summarized the chemotherapy regimens and classified them as fluorouracil based, platinum based, and paclitaxel based. Nine patients received XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimens, seven patients received TX (paclitaxel and capecitabine) regimens, and eight of them received chemotherapy including GP (gemcitabine and cisplatin), TP (paclitaxel and cisplatin), TN (paclitaxel and nedaplatin), and tislelizumab.
RESULTS: The disease control rate was 75%. Among all patients, one patient treated with XELOX achieved partial remission (PR), while 17 patients showed stable disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in all treated patients was 7.43 and 29.7 months, respectively. The patients receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy presented better PFS than those without platinum (median PFS 8.23 vs. 3.80 months, p = 0.032), but not significant for OS between two groups. There is no significant difference in PFS and OS for fluorouracil-based and paclitaxel-based groups as first-line regimen. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed TP53 mutation and low tumor mutational burden in five out of seven cases.
CONCLUSION: The platinum-based chemotherapy regimen is effective for relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma.","The authors thank all the patients, their families, and the institutions for supporting this study.

204,pub.1141110107,10.1111/ddi.13405,,,Historical biogeography of the Gondwanan freshwater genus Boeckella (Crustacea): Timing and modes of speciation in the Southern Hemisphere,"Abstract  Aim  We investigated evolutionary relationships and biogeographical patterns within the genus Boeckella to evaluate (1) whether its current widespread distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is due to recent long‐distance dispersal or long‐term diversification; and (2) the age and origin of sub‐Antarctic and Antarctic Boeckella species, with particular focus on the most widely distributed species: Boeckella poppei .    Location South America, sub‐Antarctic islands, maritime Antarctica, continental Antarctica and Australasia.   Methods  To reconstruct phylogenetic patterns of Boeckella , we used molecular sequence data collected from 12 regions and applied Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses using multiple loci. We also estimated divergence times and reconstructed ancestral ranges using two different models of species evolution.    Results  Phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimates suggested that Boeckella originated on the Gondwanan supercontinent and initially split into two main clades during the late Cretaceous ( ca . 80 Ma). The first clade diversified in Australasia, and the second clade is currently distributed in South America, various sub‐Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Dispersal from South America to the Kerguelen and Crozet archipelagos occurred during the Eocene/Oligocene ( B .  vallentini ) and in the late Pliocene ( B .  brevicaudata ), while South Georgia and the maritime Antarctic were likely colonized during the late Pleistocene ( B .  poppei ).    Main conclusions  Boeckella has a Gondwanan origin, with further diversifications after the physical separation of the continental landmasses. Extant populations of Boeckella from the Scotia Arc islands and Antarctic Peninsula originated from South America during the Pleistocene, suggesting that original Antarctic Gondwanan lineages did not survive repeated glacial cycles during the Quaternary ice ages. A continuous decline in the species accumulation rate is apparent within the genus as the early Eocene, suggesting that Boeckella diversification may have decreased due to progressive cooling throughout the Cenozoic era.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding was obtained from PIA CONICYT ACT172065 to CSM, SR, JN, EP, CGW and AD.

202,pub.1141160351,10.3390/met11091454,,,Analysis of the Dynamics of Rougher Cells on the Basis of Phenomenological Models and Discrete Event Simulation Framework,"Due to the increase in the amount of copper sulphide minerals processed through concentration processes and the need to improve the efficiency of these production processes, the development of theoretical models is making an important contribution to generating a better understanding of their dynamics, making it possible to identify the optimal conditions for the recovery of minerals, the impact of the independent variables in the responses, and the sensitivity of the recovery to variations in both the input variables and the operational parameters. This paper proposes a method for modeling, sensitizing, and optimizing the mineral recovery in rougher cells using a discrete event simulation (DES) framework and the fitting of analytical models on the basis of operational data from a concentration pilot plant. A sensitivity analysis was performed for low, medium, and high levels of the operative variables and/or parameters. The outcomes of the modeling indicate that the optimum mineral recovery is reached at medium levels of the flow rate of gas, bubble size, turbulence dissipation rate, surface tension, Reynolds number of bubble, bubble–particle contact angle, superficial gas velocity and gas hold-up in the froth zone. Additionally, the optimal response is reached at maximum levels of particle size and density and at minimum levels of bubble speed, fluid kinematic viscosity and fluid density in the sampled range. Finally, the recovery has an asymptotic behavior over time; however, the optimum recovery depends on an economic analysis, examining the marginalization of the response over time in an operational context.",Pedro Robles thanks the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for the support provided.,This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2021-09-14,2021,2021-09-14,,11,9,1454,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saldaña, Manuel; Neira, Purísima; Flores, Víctor; Moraga, Carlos; Robles, Pedro; Salazar, Iván","Saldaña, Manuel (Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos Av. 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, vflores@ucn.cl); Neira, Purísima (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Avda.

This practice can place patients at risk and increase antibiotic resistance in the community.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate individuals' preferences regarding the use of antibiotics. The study also assessed the likely effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Bogotá, Colombia. The attributes were determined by a systematic literature review and four focus group sessions. The DCE included nine factors - cost, time to get attention, level of symptoms, efficacy, safety, among others- and one label -using or not antibiotics. Data analysis was carried out using a generalized multinomial logit (GMNL) model. Marginal probabilities of different sets of attributes' levels were compared to estimate the likely effectiveness of interventions.
RESULTS: The survey was administered to 222 participants from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The results suggest that participants preferred not taking antibiotics and having a physician as an advisor, but the probability of inappropriate antibiotic use increased as the waiting time or the cost of receiving advice rose. The pharmacy was the preferred source of antibiotics, and participants chose the pharmacy worker (nonprofessional) as an advisor over the nurse on the phone. In the absence of any interventions aimed at reducing the use of antibiotics, approximately 47.3% of people would misuse antibiotics. This reduces to 26.5% when people perceive the efficacy of the antibiotics as low and the potential risks of self-medicating as high. An alternative model using a nursing service would likely lower inappropriate use of antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though people prefer not using antibiotics or visiting a physician in case of disease rather than self-medicating, current access conditions might discourage them from appropriately use antibiotics. The results suggest that interventions that informing people about the risks of self-medication and the low efficacy might significantly reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Our results also suggest that programs that empower other health professionals to provide access to antibiotics would likely further lower inappropriate use.","Authors thank Jonathan Boyajian, PhD for his valuable contributions to statistical analysis and to the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation COLCIENCIAS and the University of California, Merced for funding.",,Pharmacy Practice,,,,2021-09-11,2021,2021-09-11,2021,19,3,2401-2401,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-González, Johanna; Brown, Paul; Eslava-Schmalbach, Javier","Aponte-González, Johanna (Pharm, PhD.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with different adipo- and immuno-modulatory capacities on metabolic and immunological parameters and intestinal composition microbiota in high-fat-diet-induced in mice fed a high-fat diet Methods: Balb/c weaning male mice were fed a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with or without supplementation with Limosilactobacillus fermentum CRL1446 (CRL1446), Lactococcus lactis CRL1434 (CRL1434), or Lacticaseibacillus casei CRL431 (CRL431) for 45 days. Biochemical and immunological parameters, white-adipose tissue histology, gut microbiota composition, and ex vivo cellular functionality (adipocytes and macrophages) were evaluated in SD and HFD mice. Results: CRL1446 and CRL1434 administration, unlike CRL431, induced significant changes in the body and adipose tissue weights and the size of adipocytes. Also, these strains caused a decrease in plasmatic glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, TNF-α, IL-6 levels, and an increase of IL-10. The CRL1446 and CRL1434 obese adipocyte in ex vivo functionality assays showed, after LPS stimulus, a reduction in leptin secretion compared to obese control, while with CRL431, no change was observed. In macrophages from obese mice fed with CRL1446 and CRL1434, after LPS stimulus, lower levels of MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6 compared to obese control were observed. In contrast, CRL431 did not induce modification of cytokine values. Regarding gut microbiota, all strain administration caused a decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes index and diversity. As well as, related to genus results, all strains increased, mainly the genera Alistipes, Dorea, Barnesiella, and Clostridium XIVa. CRL1446 induced a higher increase in the Lactobacillus genus during the study period. Conclusions: The tested probiotic strains differentially modulated the intestinal microbiota and metabolic/immunological parameters in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. These results suggest that CRL1446 and CRL1434 strains could be used as adjuvant probiotics strains for nutritional treatment to obesity and overweight. At the same time, the CRL431 strain could be more beneficial in pathologies that require regulation of the immune system.",We sincerely thank Jose Luis Alvarado for his technical assistance in animal care and Lic.

Combining brief socio-cognitive and behavioral evaluations with standard cognitive testing could better discriminate bvFTD from AD patients. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of brief socio-cognitive tests that may differentiate bvFTD and AD patients with low educational levels. Methods: A prospective study was performed on 51 individuals over the age of 50 with low educational levels, with bvFTD or AD diagnosed using published criteria, and who were receiving neurological care at a multidisciplinary neurology clinic in Lima, Peru, between July 2017 and December 2020. All patients had a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including a full neurocognitive battery and brief tests of cognition (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination version III, ACE-III), social cognition (Mini-social Cognition and Emotional Assessment, Mini-SEA), and behavioral assessments (Frontal Behavioral Inventory, FBI; Interpersonal Reactivity Index-Emphatic Concern, IRI-EC; IRI-Perspective Taking, IRI-PT; and Self-Monitoring Scale-revised version, r-SMS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) was performed to compare the brief screening tests individually and combined to the gold standard of bvFTD and AD diagnoses. Results: The AD group was significantly older than the bvFTD group (p < 0.001). An analysis of the discriminatory ability of the ACE-III to distinguish between patients with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.85) and the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS; AUC = 0.78) shows that the former has greater discriminatory ability. Social and behavioral cognition tasks were able to appropriately discriminate bvFTD from AD. The Mini-SEA had high sensitivity and high moderate specificity (83%) for discriminating bvFTD from AD, which increased when combined with the brief screening tests ACE-III and IFS. The FBI was ideal with high sensitivity (83%), as well as the IRI-EC and IRI-PT that also were adequate for distinguishing bvFTD from AD. Conclusions: Our study supports the integration of socio-behavioral measures to the standard global cognitive and social cognition measures utilized for screening for bvFTD in a population with low levels of education.",,Funding.

Objective: We sought to determine if thyroid dysfunction and vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are associated with cognitive disorders among older adults with memory complaints in Lima, Peru. Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients who presented for cognitive evaluations to a multidisciplinary neurology clinic in Lima, Peru from January 2014 to February 2020. We included individuals aged ≥60 years, native Spanish-speakers, with at least a primary school educational level and a complete clinical assessment. Patients had either subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, or dementia. One-way ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: We included 720 patients (330 SCD, 154 MCI, and 236 dementia); the dementia group was significantly older [mean age SCD 69.7 ± 4.1, dementia 72.4 ± 3.7 (p = 0.000)] and had lower folate levels than SCD patients. The MCI group had higher free T3 levels compared with SCD patients. Those with lower TSH had greater dementia risk (OR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.15-6.86) but not MCI risk in unadjusted models. B12 deficiency or borderline B12 deficiency was present in 34% of the dementia group, yet no clear correlation was seen between neuropsychological test results and B12 levels in our study. There was no association between MCI or dementia and thyroid hormone, B12 nor folate levels in adjusted models. Conclusion: Our findings do not support an association between metabolic and endocrine disorders and cognitive impairment in older Peruvians from Lima despite a high prevalence of B12 deficiency.

This species is characterized by a dark body with numerous white spots all over its dorsal side. Considering the type, shape, number, and distribution of these natural markings as potential identifiers at the individual level, we studied the variation in the spot patterns. Objective: Describe and compare the white spot pattern (type and distribution) of individuals and evaluate their potential use as identifiers at the individual level. Methods: We analyzed 54 videos (105 subsequent extracted photos) and 19 photographic records that were taken at different sites along the Pacific coast of northern Costa Rica. Results: Seventeen distinctive types of white spots were identified across the entire dorsal side of the rays.  Significant differences between each major body section (pectoral fins, back, head, and pelvic fins) were found in the type and frequency of white spots. The type ‘single spot’ was commonly distributed across the entire dorsal side, and the spot pattern on the pelvic fins was informative to identify 72 individuals. Conclusions: The analysis of the type, shape, and distribution of white spots in A. laticeps determined several combinations of white spot patterns that be used for further taxonomic description and provide potential identification of the individual for future population studies along with its distribution.",,,Revista de Biología Tropical,,,,2021-09-06,2021,2021-09-06,,69,Suppl.2,s267-s276,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fallas-Madrigal, Diego; Castelo-Corona, Alejandra; Mejías, Diego; Stephens-Cárdenas, Steve; Astorga-Arias, Jennyfer; Molina-Quirós, José-L.; Hernández, Sebastián","Fallas-Madrigal, Diego (Biomolecular Laboratory, Center for International Programs and Sustainability Studies, Universidad Veritas, San José, Costa Rica); Castelo-Corona, Alejandra (Tecnológico Nacional de México, Campus Bahía Banderas, Jalisco, México); Mejías, Diego (Locomotion Producciones, Guanacaste, Costa Rica); Stephens-Cárdenas, Steve (Escuela de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad Latina de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica); Astorga-Arias, Jennyfer (School of Management and Spanish Department, California Lutheran University, Thousand Oaks, California, United States of America); Molina-Quirós, José-L.

Fecundity as a trait does not evolve independently, and rather interacts with other traits such as body and egg size. Here, our aim was to correctly infer the macroevolutionary trade-offs between body length, egg length, and potential fecundity, using cephalopods as study model. The correlated evolution among those traits was inferred by comparative phylogenetic methods. Literature data on biological and reproductive traits (body length, egg length, and potential fecundity) was obtained for 90 cephalopod species, and comparative phylogenetic methods based on a previous molecular phylogeny were used to test the correlated evolution hypothesis. Additionally, we estimated the phylogenetic signal and fitted five different evolutionary models to each trait. All traits showed high phylogenetic signal, and the selected model suggested an evolutionary trend toward increasing body length, egg length, and fecundity in relation to the ancestral state. Evidence of correlated evolution between body length and fecundity was observed, although this relationship was not detected between body length and egg length. The robust inverse relationship between fecundity and egg length indicates that cephalopods evolved a directional selection that favored an increase of fecundity and a reduction of egg length in larger species, or an increase in egg length with the concomitant reduction of fecundity and body length in order to benefit offspring survival. The use of phylogenetic comparative methods allowed us to properly detect macroevolutionary trade-offs.","Thanks to Annie Lindgren for providing her published phylogenetic tree.

Poor quality transport infrastructure implies higher travelling times and costs. This indirectly affects the productivity of a region since transportation costs are directly related to sales prices. Therefore, infrastructure investments become important for improving the competitiveness of a region. The problem with these investments is that they take time and require a large amount of money. Consequently, it is extremely important to prioritise this type of investment. This paper will first explain whether transportation investment or a sustainable transportation method affect the exported freight accessibility and if it also affects regional productivity using a linear regression model with the aid of a data-driven geographical information system. It uses spatial separation, gravity, and cumulative opportunity measures to calculate accessibility. Finally, the paper denotes which regions are highly affected by improvements in road, river, and railway networks using Colombia as a case study. The comparison considers travelling time and costs savings under each scenario. The results indicate that the gravity measure was the most appropriate accessibility measure for analysing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The scenario analyses suggest that zones farthest from the seaports are more sensitive to accessibility changes; consequently, they will receive higher improvements in their regional GDP with a national-level implementation of transport infrastructure investments. Thus, project prioritisation should be performed in regions where the investments lead to a decreased travel cost between regions and ports.",,,Journal of Advanced Transportation,,Chansung Kim,,2021-09-02,2021,,2021-09-02,2021,,1-22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jubiz-Diaz, Maria; Saltarin-Molino, Maria; Arellana, Julian; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos; Yie-Pinedo, Ruben","Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co); Saltarin-Molino, Maria (Sanofi Aventis, Calle 50 Evolution Tower, Panama City, Panama, sanofi-aventis.com); Arellana, Julian (Department of Civil Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co; Department of Management Information Systems, Fowler College of Business, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Dr., San Diego, CA 92182, USA); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co)","Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Universidad del Norte)","Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Universidad del Norte); Saltarin-Molino, Maria (Sanofi Aventis, Calle 50 Evolution Tower, Panama City, Panama, sanofi-aventis.com); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos (Universidad del Norte; San Diego State University); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte)",12,10,,4.81,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2021/5530114.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140847086,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

We study changes in the configurations of different technology fields via the power-law, small-world, preferential attachment, shrinking diameter, densification law, and gelling point hypotheses. Similar to the existing literature, we obtain mixed results. Based on network statistics, we argue that the sudden rise of large networks in six technology sectors can be understood as a phase transition in which small, isolated networks form one giant component. In two other technology sectors, such a transition occurred much later and much less dramatically. The examination of inventor networks over time reveals the increased complexity of all technology sectors, regardless of the individual characteristics of the network. Therefore, we introduce ideas associated with the technological diversification of inventors to complement our analysis, and we find evidence that inventors tend to diversify into new fields that are less mature. This behavior appears to be correlated with the compliance of some of the expected network rules and has implications for the emerging patterns among the different collaboration networks under consideration here.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Petter Holme,Humans; Intellectual Property; Interprofessional Relations; Inventions; Inventors; Patents as Topic; Social Interaction; Social Network Analysis,2021-09-02,2021,2021-09-02,,16,9,e0256956,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pinto, Pablo E.; Honores, Guillermo; Vallone, Andrés","Pinto, Pablo E.

METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to a cohort of persons from the general population of eight countries: Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) from April 22 to May 5 and May 26 to June 1, 2020. Country-level stringency indices were adopted from the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Primary outcomes were HRQoL, measured using the EQ-5D-5L, and mental well-being, measured using the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being (WHO-5).
FINDINGS: 21,354 respondents were included in the study. Diseased respondents had lower EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 scores compared to healthy respondents. Younger respondents had lower WHO-5 scores than older respondents. The stringency index had a stronger association with the EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 among diseased respondents compared to healthy respondents. Increasing stringency was associated with an increase in EQ-5D-5L scores but a decrease in the WHO-5 index.
CONCLUSION: The stringency of government response is inversely related to HRQoL and mental well-being with a small positive relation with HRQoL and strong negative relation with mental well-being. The magnitude of effects differed for healthy and diseased persons and by age but was most favourable for diseased and older persons.","We thank Periklis Charalampous, Vanessa Gorasso, Svetlana S.

1557,pub.1141913640,10.2478/lf-2021-0015,,,Grammatical Tenses and Communicative Intentions: A case study of the German Perfekt and Präteritum,"Abstract  Recent research in syntax and corpus linguistics has shown how the German Perfekt (present perfect) and Präteritum (simple past) are widely used in written language—even though these tenses are commonly described in DAF (German as a foreign language) materials as used respectively in the spoken and written forms. While these analyses only focus on written corpora, an extensive study on the use of tenses in spoken interaction is still missing. In this paper, I try to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the use of Perfekt and Präteritum in the recordings of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, held in Frankfurt am Main, from December 20, 1963, to August 19, 1965, and available on the web page of the Fritz Bauer Institute. Textual analyses of the depositions of five former German prisoners of the Polish concentration camp show that German native speakers use both tenses in their spoken interactions. These results widely contradict their depiction in DAF materials, textbooks, and grammars. Furthermore, the types of Präteritum found are far more diverse than is traditionally held by scholars, who claimed that the use of this tense in spoken language is limited to verbs such as sein (to be), haben (to have) and modals, such as können (can), müssen (must), sollen (should), etc. The outcome of this study shows how the difference between Perfekt and Präteritum is determined by the subjective attitude of the speakers in relation to the information they want to convey.",,,Linguistic Frontiers,,,,2021-09-01,2021,2021-10-14,2021-09-01,4,2,31-37,All OA; Gold,Article,"Concu, Valentina","Concu, Valentina (Assistant Professor.

Las funciones ejecutivas medidas fueron: fluidez verbal (fonológica y semántica), atención selectiva, flexibilidad cognitiva, planificación e inhibición; para lo cual, se empleó la Evaluación Neuropsicológica de las funciones ejecutivas en niños (ENFEN) y el rendimiento académico se evaluó a partir del promedio académico acumulativo en el año. Resultados. De acuerdo con el análisis de correlación de Spearman, los resultados arrojados señalan que existe una relación estadísticamente significativa entre rendimiento académico y los componentes de las funciones ejecutivas: fluidez fonológica (p=.01) y flexibilidad cognitiva (p=.01). Por otro lado, la regresión logística arrojó que la fluidez semántica y la inhibición son factores predictivos para el rendimiento académico en un 76.4%. Discusión y conclusiones.  Se sugiere que las funciones ejecutivas se asocian y a su vez predicen el rendimiento academico en estudiantes de básica primaria, en especial si este es bajo.",,,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,,,,2021-09-01,2021,2021-09-01,,19,54,351-368,All OA; Gold,Article,"Torres, Maria F.

However, its application is often reduced to a legally stipulated administrative act. In contrast, this article sets out the principles, attributes and evidence of transparency from a communication perspective, taking into consideration that transparency is treated as a process through which recipients obtain, understand and use information. This study focuses on the transparency of local town councils, although most of the concepts could be applied at other levels of public administration. To establish this framework, the legislation and application of transparency in three countries (Spain, Ecuador and Colombia) was studied using the Infoparticipa method designed with a communication approach in mind. A comparative study was then carried out using methods designed in other disciplines. Through this approach, the benefits of transparency were categorized to define six principles—disclosure, strengthening, visibility, comprehensibility, dissemination and humanism—and eight attributes of transparent information: veracity, timeliness, accessibility, usability, intelligibility, universality, pluralism and plurality. For each attribute, the evidence of its application was determined.

Seventy-two students from the 1st year of a basic education degree course at a university in the north of Portugal participated in the study. The data were obtained through the application of a questionnaire, covering the concepts of ratio, proportion, and direct proportionality. In this work, only one of the various tasks of the questionnaire is explored, the one that refers to the application of direct proportionality to the resolution of a daily problem-situation. In terms of the main results obtained, we highlight a better performance in the situation whose resolution requires the use of only one expression of direct proportionality, which decreases much when the situation required the simultaneous use of two expressions of direct proportionality and, even more, when the inversion of arithmetic operations was added. Hence, the present study stresses the need to confront the prospective teachers with situations whose resolution requires the simultaneous application of more than one expression of direct proportionality.",,,Educação Matemática Pesquisa Revista do Programa de Estudos Pós-Graduados em Educação Matemática,,,,2021-09-01,2021,2021-09-01,,23,2,076-098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernandes, José António","Fernandes, José António (Universidade do Minho)",,"Fernandes, José António (University of Minho)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.pucsp.br/index.php/emp/article/download/53451/37596,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141208278,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

Seed availability from commercial hatcheries is critical due to recurrent massive mortalities associated with bacterial infections, especially during the veliger larval stage. The immune response plays a crucial role in counteracting the effects of such infections, but being energetically costly, it potentially competes with the physiological and morphological changes that occur during early development, which are equally expensive. Consequently, in this study, energy metabolism parameters at the individual and cellular levels, under routine-basal status and after the exposure to the pathogenic strain bacteria (Vibrio splendidus VPAP18), were evaluated during early ontogeny (trochophore, D-veliger, veliger, pediveliger, and early juveniles) of A. purpuratus. The parameters measured were as follows: (1) metabolic demand, determined as oxygen consumption rate and (2) ATP supplying capacity measured by key mitochondrial enzymes activities [citrate synthase (CS), electron transport system (ETS), and ETS/CS ratio, indicative of ATP supplying efficiency], mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and mitochondrial density (ρ m) using an in vivo image analysis. Data revealed that metabolic demand/capacity varies significantly throughout early development, with trochophores being the most efficient in terms of energy supplying capacity under basal conditions. ATP supplying efficiency decreased linearly with larval development, attaining its lowest level at the pediveliger stage, and increasing markedly in early juveniles. Veliger larvae at basal conditions were inefficient in terms of energy production vs. energy demand (with low ρ m, ΔΨm, enzyme activities, and ETS:CS). Post-challenged results suggest that both trochophore and D-veliger would have the necessary energy to support the immune response. However, due to an immature immune system, the immunity of these stages would rely mainly on molecules of parental origin, as suggested by previous studies. On the other hand, post-challenged veliger maintained their metabolic demand but decreased their ATP supplying capacity, whereas pediveliger increased CS activity. Overall, results suggest that veliger larvae exhibit the lowest metabolic capacity to overcome a bacterial challenge, coinciding with previous works, showing a reduced capacity to express immune-related genes. This would result in a higher susceptibility to pathogen infection, potentially explaining the higher mortality rates occurring during A. purpuratus farming.","The authors would like to thank Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos of the UCN for providing the infrastructure for carrying out the experiments, especially German Lira and Daniel Gonzalez for animal maintenance.

The model belongs in the structuralist tradition and it is inspired by the Colombian economy. In contrast to neoclassic development economics models, we prove that: 1) relaxing the credit crunch would foster formal sector growth but it may nevertheless not imply formal employment growth; and 2) the economy can converge to a pattern where the extractive sector increases while the formal one shrinks.

This work, investigates the effect of modified nanomagnetite, Fe3O4 (nM), for biocatalytic support on properties associated with catalytic behavior and potential use in MSFBR. The nM was either synthesized and then modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilano (nM-APTES) or stabilized with oleic acid (nM-OA) and later modified with chitosan (nM-OA-Cs). A novel correlation study was carried out about the support dimension effect, enzymatic surface loading and retained activity. Both nM-based supports were morphologically, structurally and magnetically characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, Mössbauer and Fourier-transform Infrared spectroscopies, as well as vibration sample magnetometry, scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopies. The nM-APTES and nM-OA samples disclosed crystal sizes of 8.07 and 8.69 nm, respectively. From TEM imagens, the average particles sizes were 10.9 nm for nM-APTES and 12.6 nm for nM-OA. The nM-OA-Cs displayed an average particles size of 918.6 μm. These magnetic supports displayed high saturated magnetization, 79.6 emu/g for nM-APTES and 72.7 emu/g for nM-OA. The amano lipase AK enzyme was immobilized on supports activated with glutaraldehyde. The enzyme loading density of nM-APTES-GA-Lip (122 mg/g) with 61% immobilization yield was higher than that of nM-OA-Cs-GA-Lip (46 mg/g) with 23% immobilization yield. The catalytic activity of nM-APTES-GA-Lip (85%) was higher than that of nM-OA-Cs-GA-Lip (46%), which reflected the correlation between enzyme loading efficiency on the magnetic nanosupports and their relative activity, essential to potential use in MSFBR.","The funding from LDRX-UFF as well as the Brazilian agencies CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior), CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico) (310108/2017-9) and FAPERJ (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro) (CNE 239703) is gratefully acknowledged.",,Journal of Materials Research and Technology,,,,2021-09,2021,,2021-09,14,,1112-1125,All OA; Gold,Article,"Morte, Ellen F.

The discovery and selection of web services currently face optimization problems. Many services might satisfy a requirement with similar quality criteria. Because of this, software developers have to choose the most appropriate services for a given composition, complicated by the rapid increase in providers and services available in the cloud. Service composition also implies coupling according to a composition flow and non-functional requirement criteria. Such requirements make selection and composition a complex task not previously solved in the literature. This paper presents Ar_WSDS, a computational approach for web services discovery and selection in cloud environments, which bases its implementation on the brain’s pattern recognition systematic functioning. This process allows classifying web services through recognition modules created dynamically based on their quality parameters, resulting in a set of web services suitable for a web service composition. This approach allows a solution to the selection problem using less complex tasks. This paper introduces an architectural and procedural definition that provides the web service description with a pattern to recognize and select services using different recognition levels. We simulated our approach and evaluated it using a dataset from the QWS project that offers a set of quality criteria collected from different providers. The web services are recognized and classified using different quality criteria for the composition and each of their services. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovery and selection process compared to other approaches. Furthermore, Ar_WSDS allows us to recognize and filter out web services with ambiguity and similarity in their provider information, a process that minimizes the discovery space for services.",The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander and Universidad del Norte for their academic support.,The first author received a Doctoral scholarship from the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander of Colombia.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,,11,17,8092,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adarme, Marco; Jimeno, Miguel","Adarme, Marco (Department of Systems and Informatics, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta 540003, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, majimeno@uninorte.edu.co)","Adarme, Marco (Francisco de Paula Santander University)","Adarme, Marco (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte)",3,2,,1.3,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/17/8092/pdf?version=1631065283,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140791644,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4612 Software Engineering,

Objective: To identify factors associated with family cohesion in adolescents from the municipality of Envigado (Colombia). Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study using a primary source of information and a sample of 1008 students from two schools from Envigado. The following instruments were used: family cohesion scale; Zung’s Depression scale; Gismero’s Social Skills scale; and sociodemographic and substance use questions. Results:  61.5% of adolescents were not at risk for alcoholism, 73.8% were not drug dependent, 16.5% were at risk of depression, and 81.7% had adequate social skills. The prevalence of family cohesion was 96.6%. A feeling of satisfaction with their families and absence of depression were associated with good family cohesion.

He was purposively sampled due to his impact upon South African society. As an intellectual, novelist, journalist, and politician, Plaatje was also a founder member of the South African Native National Congress, which later became the African National Congress. His life history reflected a significant degree of spiritual wellness, which was uncovered through the systematic analysis of publicly available life-history materials, including primary and secondary sources. The Wheel of Wellness (WoW) model by Sweeney and Witmer was applied to interpret the biographical evidence of spirituality and meaning in his life. Spirituality, as the central life task of the WoW, and regarded as the most influential domain of a healthy individual, incorporates religious beliefs and other individualised aspects of meaning-making. Findings indicate that spirituality characterised Plaatje's childhood years and continued to play a role throughout his adult years. His sense of meaning and purpose was personified in the promotion and preservation of human rights and dignity, which embraced inter-racial respect, compassion, and service to others.","The authors have no additional (i.e., non-financial) support to report.",,Europe’s Journal of Psychology,,Claude-Hélène Mayer,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,,17,3,221-232,All OA; Gold,Article,"Welman, Crystal; Fouché, Paul J.

METHODS: We made a cross-sectional study of psychometric evaluation conducted between January 2019 and February 2020. It involved the voluntary and anonymous participation of 316 health professionals and administrative workers from 17 health centers in Peru, who were administered the 22-item psychological violence scale. In addition, three other instruments were used to assess convergent and discriminative validity.
RESULTS: In contrast to other findings using similar instruments, the item composition of the abbreviated psychological violence scale converges on three components that assess isolation, intimidation, and belittling violence. This validation provides evidence of good fit in criterion and construct, explaining 66.7% of the accumulated variance and up to 54.3% when the final version is reduced to 13 items and three factors. The data reflect a high inverse association between psychological violence and intrinsic job satisfaction.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and reliability of an instrument to measure medical students' lifestyles.
METHODS: A lifestyle questionnaire was developed using the Delphi technique by a group of experts. The final questionnaire was applied to 332 students of the School of Medicine of the Ricardo Palma University in 2017. A preliminary examination was carried out to assess preconditions for construct validityincluding the correlation matrix, the Kaiser Meyer Olkin statistic, and the Bartlett sphericity test. Factor analysis was used for construct validity, and the possible resulting factors were extracted through the principal component analysis. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated to assess the instrument reliability.
RESULTS: In this study, 41.6% of participants were men with a mean age of 20 years (standard deviation = 3). The preconditions for the factor analysis were a Kaiser Meyer Olkin coefficient = 0.773 and a significant Bartlett sphericity test. For the 47 items of the final questionnaire, the factor analysis showed an explained variance of 56.7% with eigenvalues greater than one. Cronbach's alpha was 0.78. The final questionnaire could assume values between -23 to 151 points. Based on a cut point of 71 points, the prevalence of students with an unhealthy lifestyle was 73.6%.
CONCLUSION: The developed instrument has acceptable validity and reliability to measure lifestyle in medical students.

This approach is compared with that of ontological personalism and the results of the so-called ""post-metaphysical"" attempt to achieve a philosophy of communion that overcomes humanism.

The isolates were recovered from fin lesion and kidney samples of diseased rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, during two Flavobacteriosis outbreaks occurring in freshwater farms located in Southern Chile. The strains were identified as Epilithonimonas spp. by using biochemical tests and by genome comparison analysis using the PATRIC bioinformatics platform and exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxytetracycline of 128 µg/mL. The tet(X) genes were located on small contigs of the FP105 and FP233-J200 genomes. The sequences obtained for the tet(X) genes and their genetic environment were compared with the genomes available in the GenBank database of strains of the Chryseobacterium clade belonging to the Flavobacterium family, isolated from fish and carrying the tet(X) gene. The Tet(X) proteins synthesized by the Chilean Epilithonimonas strains showed a high amino acid similarity (range from 84% to 100%), with the available sequences found in strains belonging to the genus Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium isolated from fish. An identical neighborhood of tet(X) genes from both Chilean strains was observed. The genetic environment of tet(X) observed in the two strains of Epilithonimonas studied was characterized by the upstream location of a sequence encoding a hypothetical protein and a downstream located alpha/beta hydrolase-encoding gene, similar to the observed in some of the tet(X) genes carried by Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium strains isolated from fish, but the produced proteins exhibited a low amino acid identity (25-27%) when compared to these synthesized by the Chilean strains. This study reports for the first time the carriage of the tet(X) gene by the Epilithonimonas genus and their detection in fish pathogenic bacteria isolated from farmed salmonids in Chile, thus limiting the use of therapies based on oxytetracycline, the antimicrobial most widely used in Chilean freshwater salmonid farming.

Regarding the main findings, it was found that the lack of allocation of times and spaces to dedicate to the gestation of investigative activities and the lack of economic resources, are the causes that prevent a good development of the investigative processes in public institutions.",,,Revista EDUCARE - UPEL-IPB - Segunda Nueva Etapa 2 0,,,,2021-08-26,2021,2021-08-26,,25,2,187-214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Albornoz, Deivis Robinson Mosquera; Cerón, Blanca Nelly Gallardo","Albornoz, Deivis Robinson Mosquera (Universidad Católica de Oriente (Colombia)); Cerón, Blanca Nelly Gallardo (Universidad Católica de Oriente (Colombia))",,"Albornoz, Deivis Robinson Mosquera (Universidad Católica de Oriente); Cerón, Blanca Nelly Gallardo (Universidad Católica de Oriente)",1,0,,0.83,https://revistas.investigacion-upelipb.com/index.php/educare/article/download/1446/1445,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140690643,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 44 Human Society,4 Quality Education

The study was conducted in 2019 at five selected South African universities – University of Johannesburg, University of South Africa, University of Limpopo, University of Venda and Tshwane University of Technology – which offered the language under investigation as an L1 module. In addition, language experts (practitioners) at the Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) and its sub-structures and the National Department of Arts and Culture, including Limpopo and Gauteng Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation, were also involved in the study. Quota sampling was used to select all the 267 participants in the study. The study found that both Sepedi and Sesotho sa Leboa (Northern Sotho) language names are rejected by onomastic principles of naming an official language. An overwhelming majority of the participants opined that this language should be renamed, with the anticipation that the new name will bring peace, unity and solidarity to the L1 speakers of Sepedi.",,,Literator,,,,2021-08-26,2021,2021-08-26,,42,1,14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rakgogo, Tebogo J.; Zungu, Evangeline B.","Rakgogo, Tebogo J.

289,pub.1140688414,10.3390/gastroent12030034,,,Should the Endoscopic Restrictions during COVID-19 Pandemic Remain Unchanged?,"(Background) Endoscopic procedures are interventions that have been defined as carrying a high-risk of infection with COVID-19. Most endoscopy units restrict their activity based on pre-endoscopic diagnosis. (Objective) To determine the consequences of endoscopic restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on digestive cancer diagnosis. (Design) A comparison of upper digestive endoscopies and colonoscopies with gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed between three endoscopic centers, two of which restricted their procedures and one that did not but performed the procedures under a strict protocol. (Setting) A retrospective analysis was performed collecting data between 15 March 2019 and 15 August 2020. Two-factor ANOVA and a Tukey’s a posteriori test were used as statistical tests. (Main outcome measures) There was variation in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis between 2019 and 2020, considering the endoscopic procedures performed each year. (Result) There was a significant decrease in the total endoscopic procedures performed between 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001), the result of reduced testing at the two centers (p < 0.001) with pre-endoscopic restrictions, which was not compensated for by a slight increase in procedures at the center without restrictions (p = 0.139). Regarding the total cancers diagnosed, while a significant decrease was observed for the two centers with pre-endoscopic restrictions (p = 0.007), a significant increase was registered in the center that maintained its endoscopic productivity (p < 0.001). After 851 procedures (537 upper digestive endoscopies and 314 colonoscopies) there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in the endoscopic staff. (Conclusion) Endoscopic restrictions based on pre-endoscopic diagnosis should be reassessed in consideration of local pandemic situations, and a balance should be sought between COVID-19 infection risk and the detrimental delay of potential cancer diagnosis.",,This research received no external funding.,Gastroenterology Insights,,,,2021-08-25,2021,2021-08-25,,12,3,358-365,All OA;

All participants provided verbal consent prior to completing the survey. A 37-question web-based survey with no personal identifiers was sent to 212 previously identified AD patients. Itching, sleep disturbances, SARS-CoV-2, illness cost, economic dependence, monthly income, and monthly investment in AD before and during the pandemic, were all included in the analysis. A response rate of 73.1% was obtained. The mean age of participants was 30 years-old, and 57% were women. Around 75% reported AD worsening, and 59.4% of the patients reported sleep problems. Uncertainty, anxiety, and pessimism were frequent during the pandemic. Only 1.3% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and it was only significantly associated with comorbidities (p=0.03; Chi2 Test). A significant difference was found in economic dependence and monthly income when compared between before and during the pandemic. This study provides probably the best possible assessment of the clinical, social, and economic effects of the pandemic on patients with an already proven diagnosis of AD.","We thank all the patients for their willingness to participate.

We observed extensive fields of filamentous cyanobacteria-like mats covering sandy substrates and mostly dead mesophotic Leptoseris spp. reefs. These mats covered up to 100% of the seafloor off Hanga Roa, the main village on the island, located on its western side. The highest mortality of corals was observed at depths between 70 and 95 m in this area. Healthy Leptoseris reefs were documented off the northern and southeastern sides of the island, which are also the least populated. A preliminary morphologic analysis of samples of the mats indicated that the assemblage is composed of at least four filamentous taxa, including two cyanobacteria (cf. Lyngbya sp. and Pseudoanabaena sp.), a brown alga (Ectocarpus sp.), and a green alga (Cladophora sp.). An ongoing eutrophication process is suggested as a potential driver of the proliferation of these filamentous mats off Hanga Roa village.","This work was supported by grants FONDECYT 1180694 and 1181153, as well as funding from the ANID- Millennium Science Initiative ESMOI.

The first studies emphasized the differences among socioeconomic levels. Later, there was an interest in minority groups, such as indigenous people and Afro-descendants. Although most of the research lacked long-term vision, the overall balance shows that the country has been improving in anthropometric indicators over time, across territories, and in different socioeconomic groups.","The authors would like to acknowledge Hernando Baquero, Juliana Jaramillo, and Jaime Bonnet for their comments on another version of this work.",This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Anthropometry; Child; Colombia; Humans,2021-08-23,2021,2021-08-23,,18,16,8868,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meisel-Roca, Adolfo; Granger, Angela","Meisel-Roca, Adolfo (Department of Economy, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 1569, Colombia.); Granger, Angela (Department of Economy, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 1569, Colombia.)","Granger, Angela (Universidad del Norte)","Meisel-Roca, Adolfo (Universidad del Norte); Granger, Angela (Universidad del Norte)",2,1,0.29,1.47,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/16/8868/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140605818,44 Human Society; 4403 Demography,

Validation of the Content of the Diagnostic Label Professional Traumatic Grief,"(1) Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has put our healthcare systems to the test, exposing their vulnerability and demanding a high degree of commitment and dedication from healthcare teams to confront and contain the disease. In this sense, nursing professionals have played a prominent role in the treatment of complex cases that have required hospitalisation and have manifested pre-existing health complications or mortality. This unprecedented situation made it difficult to regulate the emotional impact and manage grief, often turning it into a traumatic grief whose psychological and emotional manifestations are increasingly evident but very little researched in the current context. (2) Purpose: Validation of the definition, defining characteristics and related factors for the proposal of the nursing diagnosis of professional traumatic grief. (3) Method: Based on Fehring's content validation model, the label name, defining characteristics and other related factors were agreed upon by Spanish experts. (4) Results: The content validity index was 0.9068. A total of 21 defining characteristics were validated by the experts, as all of them scored above 0.6. With respect to the related factors of the proposed 10, all were validated. (5) Conclusion: The present study supports the proposal to develop a nursing diagnosis for professional traumatic grief. The use of standardised language is only the first step in establishing professional traumatic grief as a diagnostic category.",,"This research has not received financial aid from the public sector, the private sector nor non-profit entities.",Healthcare,,,,2021-08-23,2021,2021-08-23,,9,8,1082,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gilart, Ester; Lepiani, Isabel; Núñez, María José Cantizano; Roman, Inmaculada Cabrera; Bocchino, Anna","Gilart, Ester (Doctor López Cano Hospital of Cadiz, 11010 Cadiz, Spain;, esther.gilart@gmail.com); Lepiani, Isabel (Nursing University Salus Infirmorum of Cadiz, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, Isabel.lepiani@ca.uca.es); Núñez, María José Cantizano (Emergency Department Bahia de Cadiz, La Janda, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, mjcanty14@hotmail.com, (M.J.C.N.);, valentinaspain@hotmail.com, (I.C.R.)); Roman, Inmaculada Cabrera (Emergency Department Bahia de Cadiz, La Janda, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, mjcanty14@hotmail.com, (M.J.C.N.);, valentinaspain@hotmail.com, (I.C.R.)); Bocchino, Anna (Nursing University Salus Infirmorum of Cadiz, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, Isabel.lepiani@ca.uca.es)","Bocchino, Anna (Nursing University Salus Infirmorum of Cadiz, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, Isabel.lepiani@ca.uca.es)","Gilart, Ester (Doctor López Cano Hospital of Cadiz, 11010 Cadiz, Spain;, esther.gilart@gmail.com); Lepiani, Isabel (Nursing University Salus Infirmorum of Cadiz, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, Isabel.lepiani@ca.uca.es); Núñez, María José Cantizano (Emergency Department Bahia de Cadiz, La Janda, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, mjcanty14@hotmail.com, (M.J.C.N.);, valentinaspain@hotmail.com, (I.C.R.)); Roman, Inmaculada Cabrera (Emergency Department Bahia de Cadiz, La Janda, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, mjcanty14@hotmail.com, (M.J.C.N.);, valentinaspain@hotmail.com, (I.C.R.)); Bocchino, Anna (Nursing University Salus Infirmorum of Cadiz, 11001 Cadiz, Spain;, Isabel.lepiani@ca.uca.es)",5,2,0.65,2.35,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/8/1082/pdf?version=1629711581,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140605793,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

For this, an approach that integrates the decision-making tool of the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used. To identify the selection criteria, the existing literature and the renewable resources available in the study area were considered. Seven sub-criteria were identified (solar irradiation, wind speed, protected areas, armed conflict, indigenous reservations, populated zones and roads), which were weighted with the AHP by 15 experts with experience in projects with renewable energies. After performing a consistency analysis, it was found that 5 experts were consistent, while another 5 were discarded for being highly inconsistent. A consistency correction method was implemented for the remaining 5 experts, in order to have 10 experts for the weighting process. Each sub-criterion represents a map of the study area, which were superimposed in a GIS environment to implement the weighting obtained with the experts. A global map for the implementation of renewable energy projects, considering environmental, social and local infrastructure criteria was obtained. The map was classified into five categories: not suitable, marginally suitable, moderately suitable, highly suitable and optimally areas.Keywords: Renewable Energy, Analytical Hierarchical Process, Energy Planning, Geographic Information SystemsJEL Classifications: Q20, D70, Q42, D81DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijeep.11266",,,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,,,,2021-08-20,2021,2021-08-20,,11,5,211-223,All OA; Gold,Article,"Olivero-OrtÃ­z, VÃ­ctor; Robles-AlgarÃ­n, Carlos; Viloria-Porto, Julie","Olivero-OrtÃ­z, VÃ­ctor (Universidad del Magdalena); Robles-AlgarÃ­n, Carlos (Universidad del Magdalena); Viloria-Porto, Julie (Universidad del Magdalena)",,"Olivero-OrtÃ­z, VÃ­ctor (University of Magdalena); Robles-AlgarÃ­n, Carlos (University of Magdalena); Viloria-Porto, Julie (University of Magdalena)",4,3,,2.3,https://econjournals.com/index.php/ijeep/article/download/11266/6018,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137177586,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

For greater control of these variables, the use of simulators arises as an alternative. Cooja is a WSN simulator/emulator which handles the devices’ controllers and multiple communication protocol implementations, such as RPL (RPL is one of the most used protocol in IoT). However, Cooja does not consider either the implementation of an energy model (it has infinite energy consumption) nor the visual behavior of the topology construction, although these aspects are crucial for effective network analysis and decision taking. This paper presents the design and the implementation of ViTool-BC, a software built on top of Cooja, which allows the creation of different energy estimation models and also to visualize in real time the behavior of WSN topology construction. In addition, ViTool-BC offers a heat map of energy consumption traces. Therefore, this tool helps researchers to monitor in real time the topology construction, node disconnection, and battery depletion, aspects to be considered in the analysis of the available routing protocols in Cooja.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-08-20,2021,2021-08-20,,11,16,7665,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jabba, Daladier; Acevedo, Pedro","Jabba, Daladier (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Acevedo, Pedro (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia)","Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte)","Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Acevedo, Pedro (Universidad del Norte)",9,8,,3.1,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/16/7665/pdf?version=1629461715,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140566228,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

It is therefore critical to study them during the design of food packaging. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of extrinsic factors on the expected acceptance, purchase intention and holistic perception of consumers of the popular Peruvian dessert mazamorra morada. Twelve stimuli were created by using a fractional factorial design considering packaging material, nutritional information, quality, convenience, and naturalness as factors, previously obtained by open-ended questions. Ninety-seven consumers answered an online survey indicating their expected acceptance, purchase intention and holistic perception. The results showed that the most salient factors for consumers, in terms of expected acceptance, purchase intention, and holistic perception, were packaging material and convenience.

203,pub.1140584261,10.3390/universe7080308,,,New Bounds for the Mass of Warm Dark Matter Particles Using Results from Fermionic King Model,"After reviewing several aspects about the thermodynamics of self-gravitating systems that undergo the evaporation (escape) of their constituents, some recent results obtained in the framework of fermionic King model are applied here to the analysis of galactic halos considering warm dark matter (WDM) particles. According to the present approach, the reported structural parameters of dwarf galaxies are consistent with the existence of a WDM particle with mass in the keV scale. Assuming that the dwarf galaxy Willman 1 belongs to the region III of fermionic King model (whose gravothermal collapse is a continuous phase transition), one obtains the interval 1.2 keV ≤ m ≤ 2.6 keV for the mass of WDM particle. This analysis improves previous estimates by de Vega and co-workers [Astropart. Phys. 46 (2013) 14–22] considering both the quantum degeneration and the incidence of the constituents evaporation. This same analysis evidences that most of galaxies are massive enough to undergo a violent gravothermal collapse (a discontinuous microcanonical phase transition) that leads to the formation of a degenerate core of WDM particles. It is also suggested that quantum-relativistic processes governing the cores of large galaxies (e.g., the formation of supermassive black holes) are somehow related to the gravothermal collapse of the WDM degenerate cores when the total mass of these systems are comparable to the quantum-relativistic characteristic mass Mc=ℏc/G3/2m−2≃1012M⊙ obtained for WDM particles with mass m in the keV scale. The fact that a WDM particle with mass in the keV scale seems to be consistent with the observed properties of dwarf and large galaxies provides a strong support to this dark matter candidate.","The author would like to thank “Núcleo de Investigación No.7 UCN-VRIDT 076/2020, Núcleo de modelación y simulación científica (NMSC)” for the scientific support.

Furthermore, free-roaming domestic animals and use of yucca and/or manioc as a primary food source favor the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths, e.g., Toxocara&nbsp;canis and Toxocara&nbsp;cati, the roundworms of dogs and cats. Infection may result in the clinical picture of toxocarosis, one of the most common zoonotic helminthoses worldwide. To estimate the Toxocara seroprevalence in four different villages of the Wiwa community, serum samples from 483 inhabitants were analyzed for anti-Toxocara-antibodies. Overall, 79.3% (383/483) of analyzed samples were seropositive. Statistically significant differences were observed between the four villages, as well as age groups (adults > adolescents > children), while sex had no effect. The high seropositivity rate demonstrates the risk of zoonotic roundworm infections and potential clinical disease in vulnerable indigenous inhabitants.","The authors would like to thank the Else-Kröner-Fresenius-Foundation for funding an earlier project in which the blood samples were collected.

With the aim of finding non-toxic and effective P-gp inhibitors, we investigated a panel of quinolin-2-one-pyrimidine hybrids. Among the active compounds, two of them significantly increased intracellular doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 accumulation by inhibiting the efflux mediated by P-gp and restored doxorubicin toxicity at nanomolar range. Structure–activity relationships showed that the number of methoxy groups, an optimal length of the molecule in its extended conformation, and at least one flexible methylene group bridging the quinolinone to the moiety bearing the pyrimidine favored the inhibitory potency of P-gp. The best compounds showed a similar binding pattern and interactions to those of doxorubicin and tariquidar, as revealed by MD and hybrid QM/MM simulations performed with the recent experimental structure of P-gp co-crystallized with paclitaxel. Analysis of the molecular interactions stabilizing the different molecular complexes determined by MD and QTAIM showed that binding to key residues from TMH 4–7 and 12 is required for inhibition.","This work was supported by the Universidad Católica de Córdoba, CONICET (PIP 2014-2016), FONCyT (PICT 2014-1594, PICT 2017-1381 and PICT 2015-1769), the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, project #RTI2018-098560-B-C22, Universidad de Jáen, Consejería de Innovación, Ciencia y Empresa (Junta de Andalucía, Spain).

Nevertheless, standard protocols generate large volumes of solvent waste. Here, we present a protocol for the multiple Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis in tea bags, where reagent recycling steps are included. Fifty-two peptides with wide amino acid composition and seven to twenty amino acid residues in length were synthesized in less than three weeks. A clustering analysis was performed, grouping the peptides by physicochemical features. Although a relationship between the overall yield and the physicochemical features of the sequences was not established, the process showed good performance despite sequence diversity. The recycling system allowed to reduce N, N-dimethylformamide usage by 25-30% and reduce the deprotection reagent usage by 50%. This protocol has been optimized for the simultaneous synthesis of a large number of peptide sequences. Additionally, a reagent recycling system was included in the procedure, which turns the process into a framework of circular economy, without affecting the quality of the products obtained.",,"This research was funded by grants to F.G.

Therefore, glycerol prices dropped significantly worldwide in recent years; the more significant biodiesel production is, the more glycerol exists as a byproduct. glycerol prices also impact the biodiesel manufacturing business, as it could be sold according to its refinement grade. The primary objective of this work was to evaluate the economic potential of the production of 1,2-propanediol derived from the biodiesel produced in Colombia. A plant to produce 1,2-propanediol via catalytic hydrogenation of glycerol in a trickle-bed reactor was designed. The plant comprised a reaction scheme where non-converted excess hydrogen was recycled, and the heat generated in the reactor was recovered. The reactor effluent was sent to a separation train where 98% m/m purity 1,2-propanediol was attained. Capital and operational costs were estimated from the process simulation. The net present value (NPV) and the modified internal return rate (MIRR) of the plant were used to assess the viability of the process. Their sensitivity to key input variables was evaluated to find the viability limits of the project. The economic potential of the 1,2-propanediol was calculated in USD 1.2/kg; for the base case, the NPV and the MIRR were USD 54.805 million and 22.56%, respectively, showing that, for moderate variations in products and raw material prices, the process is economically viable.",Especial thanks to the Universidad del Atlántico in Barranquilla for the ongoing support and funding of Juan B.

We utilize public data for the consumer price index, the gross domestic product, and the employee and per capita income distributions as inputs for a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation, the solutions to which provide an in-depth analysis of the population dynamics. Specifically, the per capita income distribution stands out as a solution to the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. According to our results, the concavity of employee income distribution is a decisive input parameter and, in contrast to the distributions typically observed for Chile and other countries in Latin America, should ideally be non-negative. Based on the results of our model, we advocate for the implementation of social policies designed to stimulate social mobility by broadening the distribution of higher salaries.","We would like to acknowledge partial financial support from Fondecyt grants 1181558 and 11150182, and Beca de postdoctorado Universidad Católica del Norte No 004/2019&quot;.

Their distribution suggests an ancient origin during a cold period of the earth's history. In this study, we evaluated this hypothesis and corroborated the non-monophyly of the genus Sprattus, using a phylogenetic approach based on DNA sequences of five mitochondrial genome regions. Sprattus sprattus is more closely related to members of the genus Clupea than to other Sprattus species. We also investigated the historical biogeography of the genus, with the phylogenetic tree showing two well-supported clades corresponding to the species distribution in each hemisphere. Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses showed that an ancient divergence between Northern and Southern Hemispheres occurred at 55.8 MYBP, followed by a diversification in the Oligocene epoch in the Northern Hemisphere clade (33.8 MYBP) and a more recent diversification in the Southern Hemisphere clade (34.2 MYBP). Historical biogeography analyses indicated that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) likely inhabited the Atlantic Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. These results suggest that the ancestral population of the MRCA diverged in two populations, one was dispersed to the Northern Hemisphere and the other across the Southern Hemisphere. Given that the Eocene was the warmest epoch since the Paleogene, the ancestral populations would have crossed the tropics through deeper cooler waters, as proposed by the isothermal submergence hypothesis. The non-monophyly confirmed for the genus Sprattus indicates that its systematics should be re-evaluated.","This work was supported by the FIPA 2010-17, the CONICYT doctoral Internship, the FONDECYT 11180897, 1201506 and by ANID –Millennium Science Initiative –NCN16_034.

It is among the main causes of death both in Colombia and in the rest of the world and has a great social and economic burden; similar to other chronic diseases such as Arterial Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus. Governments have now made efforts to moderate their statistics; however, these have not been strong enough to keep under control the effect of these diseases on human health, so it is essential to strengthen the actions that promote such control. The objective of this review is to highlight the importance of a model of nefroprevention that suits our country; enable timely detection and prevention of cardiovascular and renal risk factors, and facilitate early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in order to circumvent its progression and potentially lethal consequences.",,,Revista Colombiana de Nefrología,,,,2021-08-18,2021,2021-08-18,,8,3,e399-e399,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abuabara-Franco, Emilio; Bohórquez-Rivero, José; Restom-Arrieta, José; Sáenz-López, José; Gómez-Franco, Alicia; Navarro-Quiróz, Roberto","Abuabara-Franco, Emilio (Servicio de Medicina Intensiva y Cuidado Crítico, Clínica Foscal Internacional, Floridablanca, Santander,Colombia); Bohórquez-Rivero, José (Grupo de Investigación GIBACUS, Escuela de Medicina, Universidad del Sinú, Seccional Cartagena, Cartagenade Indias, Colombia); Restom-Arrieta, José (Grupo de Investigación GIBACUS, Escuela de Medicina, Universidad del Sinú, Seccional Cartagena, Cartagenade Indias, Colombia); Sáenz-López, José (Grupo de Investigación GIBACUS, Escuela de Medicina, Universidad del Sinú, Seccional Cartagena, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia); Gómez-Franco, Alicia (Programa de Medicina, Facultad de ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Navarro-Quiróz, Roberto (Universidade Federal do ABC São Paulo, Brasil)",,"Abuabara-Franco, Emilio (Foscal Hospital); Bohórquez-Rivero, José (Universidad del Sinú); Restom-Arrieta, José (Universidad del Sinú); Sáenz-López, José (Universidad del Sinú); Gómez-Franco, Alicia (Autonomous University of Bucaramanga); Navarro-Quiróz, Roberto (Universidade Federal do ABC)",1,0,,0.32,https://revistanefrologia.org/index.php/rcn/article/download/399/871,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141924697,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

The method relies on a spatial and statistical analysis of infrastructure risks, along with traffic accident frequency and severity. A relevant feature of this methodology is related to its potential to be used in areas where there are no detailed historical records about traffic crashes, which is common in Global South countries. We applied the methodology to a rural road network in Colombia, where a recent law established that technical criteria should support the location of speed cameras. The case study uses accident information from six years, and risk data from a road safety audit carried out in the area under study. Even though historical records of accidents in the area were not fully available, the methodology allowed prioritising speed camera installations in the zone and identifying the relevant variables to define camera location. The relevant variables were the geometric characteristics of the road, traffic flows, risk factors, and proximity to populated centres. The use of speed controls should be part of a road safety management system, which allows defining camera location according to robust technical criteria.",,,Transport,,,,2021-08-17,2021,2021-08-17,2021-08-17,36,3,199-212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coronell, Garis; Arellana, Julián; Cantillo, Víctor","Coronell, Garis (Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Coronell, Garis (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)",4,2,,1.6,https://journals.vilniustech.lt/index.php/Transport/article/download/15117/10611,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140486942,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being

170,pub.1140402338,10.3389/fmars.2021.702051,,,High-Frequency Variability of the Surface Ocean Properties Off Central Chile During the Upwelling Season,"The ocean off south-central Chile is subject to seasonal upwelling whose intensity is mainly controlled by the latitudinal migration of the southeast Pacific subtropical anticyclone. During austral spring and summer, the mean flow is equatorward favoring coastal upwelling, but periods of strong southerly winds are intermixed with periods of relaxed southerlies or weak northerly winds (downwelling favorable). This sub-seasonal, high-frequency variability of the coastal winds results in pronounced changes in oceanographic conditions and air-sea heat and gas exchanges, whose quantitative description has been limited by the lack of in-situ monitoring. In this study, high frequency fluctuations of meteorological, oceanographic and biogeochemical near surface variables were analyzed during two consecutive upwelling seasons (2016–17 and 2017–18) using observations from a coastal buoy located in the continental shelf off south-central Chile (36.4°S, 73°W), ∼10 km off the coast. The radiative-driven diel cycle is noticeable in meteorological variables but less pronounced for oceanographic and biogeochemical variables [ocean temperature, nitrate (NO3−), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2sea), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO)]. Fluorescence, as a proxy of chlorophyll-a, showed diel variations more controlled by biological processes. In the synoptic scale, 23 active upwelling events (strong southerlies, lasting between 2 and 15 days, 6 days in average) were identified, alternated with periods of relaxed southerlies of shorter duration (4.5 days in average). Upwelling events were related to the development of an atmospheric low-level coastal jet in response to an intense along-shore pressure gradient. Physical and biogeochemical surface seawater properties responded to upwelling favorable wind stress with approximately a 12-h lag. During upwelling events, SST, DO and pH decrease, while NO3−, pCO2sea, and air-sea fluxes increases. During the relaxed southerly wind periods, opposite tendencies were observed. The fluorescence response to wind variations is complex and diverse, but in many cases there was a reduction in the phytoplankton biomass during the upwelling events followed by higher values during wind relaxations. The sub-seasonal variability of the coastal ocean characterized here is important for biogeochemical and productivity studies.","We appreciate the advice and loan of the SAMI instrument from Mike DeGrandpre (University of Montana, United States).","Funding.

The main parameters studied were temperature, pH, concentrations of different ammonia salts, the presence of sodium hypochlorite, pretreatment with sodium chloride, and curing period. In all ammoniacal solutions studied, increasing the temperature enhanced the dissolution of copper, but the dissolution of arsenic remained marginal. Mixing the copper concentrate with sodium chloride and leaving it to rest for 72 h before leaching in ammoniacal solutions significantly increased the dissolution of copper and slightly increased the dissolution of arsenic from the concentrate. A maximum of 35% of Cu and 3.3% of As were extracted when ammonium carbonate was used as the lixiviant. The results show relatively rapid dissolution of the concentrate with the addition of sodium hypochlorite in ammonium carbonate solution, achieving a dissolution of up to 50% and 25% of copper and arsenic, respectively. A copper dissolution with a non-linear regression model was proposed, considering the effect of NaClO and NH4Cl at 25 °C. These findings highlight the importance of using the correct anionic ligands for the ammonium ions and temperature to obtain a high dissolution of copper or arsenic. The results also showed that the curing time of the packed bed before the commencement of leaching appeared to be an important parameter to enhance the dissolution of copper and leave the arsenic in the residues.",,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,Peter Baláž,,2021-08-12,2021,2021-08-12,,14,16,4529,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian; Álvarez, Hans; Quezada, Víctor; García, Antonio","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (Escuela de Ingeniería Civil de Minas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Talca, Curicó 3340000, Chile); Álvarez, Hans (Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, haahans@gmail.com, (H.Á.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.);, agarcia@ucn.cl, (A.G.)); Quezada, Víctor (Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, haahans@gmail.com, (H.Á.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.);, agarcia@ucn.cl, (A.G.)); García, Antonio (Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, haahans@gmail.com, (H.Á.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.);, agarcia@ucn.cl, (A.G.))","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (University of Talca)","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (University of Talca); Álvarez, Hans (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, haahans@gmail.com, (H.Á.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.);, agarcia@ucn.cl, (A.G.)); Quezada, Víctor (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, haahans@gmail.com, (H.Á.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.);, agarcia@ucn.cl, (A.G.)); García, Antonio (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, haahans@gmail.com, (H.Á.);, vquezada@ucn.cl, (V.Q.);, agarcia@ucn.cl, (A.G.))",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/14/16/4529/pdf?version=1628762091,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140395509,40 Engineering,

To allow its broad use by family practice physicians (FPs), it was translated from English into nine European languages (Greek, Polish, Bulgarian, Croatian, Catalan, Galician, Spanish, Italian, and French) and the translation homogeneity was confirmed. This study describes this process. Methods: First, two translators (an academic translator and an FP researcher) were recruited for the forward translation (FT). A panel of English-speaking FPs that included at least 15 experts (researchers, teachers, and practitioners) was organized in each country to finalize the FT using a Delphi procedure. Results: One or two Delphi procedure rounds were sufficient for each translation. Then, a different translator, who did not know the original version of the HSCL-25, performed a backward translation in English. An expert panel of linguists compared the two English versions. Differences were listed and a multicultural consensus group determined whether they were due to linguistic problems or to cultural differences. All versions underwent cultural check. Conclusion: All nine translations were finalized without altering the original meaning.",We would like to thank all FPs who participated in the research process throughout Europe and all trainees in Family Medicine from Brest University who participated in the research process and our proof-reader Mrs. Alex Gillman for her accurate translations.,"Funding.

We employ a novelty procedure to explore this phenomenon. This procedure performs apriori segmentation based on gender and generation. It then applies the deep learning technique to identify the predictors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, altruism, telepresence, social identity, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, perceived physical condition, social norms, habit, and trust) by segments. The predictor variables were taken from the literature on the use of social network sites, and an empirical study was carried out by quota sampling with a sample size of 395 older people. The results show different predictors of social network sites considering all the samples, baby boomer (born between 1947 and 1966) males and females, silent (born between 1927 and 1946) males and females. The high heterogeneity among older people is confirmed; this means that dealing with older adults as a uniform set of users of social network sites is a mistake. This study demonstrates that the four segments behave differently, and many diverse variables influence the acceptance of social network sites.",,"Funding.

In this context, purinergic signaling emerges as a promising pathway for intervention due to its known role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. In this work, we explored in more detail the role of purinergic signaling in GC with several experimental approaches. First, we measured extracellular ATP concentrations on GC-derived cell lines (AGS, MKN-45, and MKN-74), finding higher levels of extracellular ATP than those obtained for the non-tumoral gastric cell line GES-1. Next, we established the P2Y2 and P2X4 receptors (P2Y2R and P2X4R) expression profile on these cells and evaluated their role on cell proliferation and migration after applying overexpression and knockdown strategies. In general, a P2Y2R overexpression and P2X4R downregulation pattern were observed on GC cell lines, and when these patterns were modified, concomitant changes in cell viability were observed. These modifications on gene expression also modified transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), showing that higher P2Y2R levels decreased TEER, and high P2X4R expression had the opposite effect, suggesting that P2Y2R and P2X4R activation could promote and suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively. These effects were confirmed after treating AGS cells with UTP, a P2Y2R-agonist that modified the expression patterns towards mesenchymal markers. To further characterize the effects of P2Y2R activation on EMT, we used cDNA microarrays and observed that UTP induced important transcriptional changes on several cell processes like cell proliferation induction, apoptosis inhibition, cell differentiation induction, and cell adhesion reduction. These results suggest that purinergic signaling plays a complex role in GC pathophysiology, and changes in purinergic balance can trigger tumorigenesis in non-tumoral gastric cells.","We are grateful with the Unidad de Microarreglos del Laboratorio Nacional de Apoyo a las Ciencias Genómicas from Instituto de Fisiología Celular-UNAM-México, to Adriana Gonzalez Gallardo for its technical assistance and to Hervis Galleguillos (UCN) for his technical assistance.","Our work was funded by FONDECYT Regular Grant 1161490, FONDEQUIP EQM140100, PAPIIT-UNAM-México IN202620, Intramural grant N° 20210401007 “Núcleo para el estudio del cáncer a nivel básico, aplicado y clínico”, VRIDT, UCN and Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain.

According to Greenpeace International (2018), the packaging “use-and-throw-away” lifestyle has unleashed an emergency that has struck the health of ecosystems and living beings due to the use of plastic. Industries need to speed up their migration from a “linear economy” model, which implies producing, using, and disposing of goods, towards a “circular economy” that maximizes the use of resources and converts their waste into new materials (WEF, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and McKinsey and Company, 2016). A descriptive methodology coupled with content analysis and in-depth interview was applied to characterize the use of PET bottles in the beverage industry in Colombia. The research identified the logistics chain (recycling - warehousing - transformer - producer - distributor - customer - consumption) and found problems in the recycling stage.

This problem was first articulated by Banerjee et al. (Phys Rev D 40:670, 1989) in which they provided a particular solution of the temporal equation. This simple exact solution has been widely utilised in modeling dissipative collapse with the most notable result being prediction of the avoidance of the horizon as the collapse proceeds. We study the dynamics of dissipative collapse arising from the general solution obtained via the method of symmetries and of the singularity analysis. We show that the end-state of collapse for our model is significantly different from the widely used linear solution.","AP and GL were funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID through the program FONDECYT Iniciación grant no. 11180126.

237,pub.1140335478,10.3390/sym13081460,,,Predicting the Intention to Donate Blood among Blood Donors Using a Decision Tree Algorithm,"The blood donation process is essential for health systems. Therefore, the ability to predict donor flow has become relevant for hospitals. Although it is possible to predict this behaviour intention from donor questionnaires, the need to reduce social contact in pandemic settings leads to decreasing the extension of these surveys with the minimum loss of predictivity. In this context, this study aims to predict the intention to give blood again, among donors, based on a limited number of attributes. This research uses data science and learning concepts based on symmetry in a particular classification to predict blood donation intent. We carried out a face-to-face survey of Chilean donors based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. These data, including control variables, were analysed using the decision tree technique. The results indicate that it is possible to predict the intention to donate blood again with an accuracy of 84.17% and minimal variables. The added scientific value of this article is to propose a more simplified way of measuring a multi-determined social phenomenon, such as the intention to donate blood again and the application of the decision tree technique to achieve this simplification, thereby contributing to the field of data science.",,"This research was partially funded by Universidad Austral de Chile (CHILE) and Universidad Católica del Norte (CHILE) and supported by ANID-Chile, through the FONDECYT program, grant no. 1210130.",Symmetry,,,,2021-08-10,2021,2021-08-10,,13,8,1460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salazar-Concha, Cristian; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio","Salazar-Concha, Cristian (Administration Institute, Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Universidad Austral de Chile, Independencia 631, Valdivia 5110566, Chile;, cristiansalazar@uach.cl); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile)","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)","Salazar-Concha, Cristian (Austral University of Chile); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)",9,6,,3.24,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/8/1460/pdf?version=1628574261,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140335478,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,
225,pub.1140335234,10.3390/met11081260,,,Pretreatment to Leaching for a Primary Copper Sulphide Ore in Chloride Media,"The dissolution of copper sulphide ores continues to be a challenge for the copper industry. Several media and leaching alternatives have been proposed to improve the dissolution of these minerals, especially for the leaching of chalcopyrite. Among the alternatives, pretreatment prior to leaching was proposed as an option that increases the dissolution of copper from sulphide ores. In this study, a mineral sample from a copper mining company was used. The copper grade of the sample was 0.79%, and its main contributor was chalcopyrite (84%). The effect of curing time (as pretreatment) in a chloride media on copper sulphide ore was evaluated at various temperatures: 25, 50, 70 and 90 °C. The pretreated sample and leaching residues were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and reflected light microscopy. Pretreatment products such as CuSO4, NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6, and S0 were identified although with difficulty, due to the low presence of chalcopyrite in the initial sample (1.99%). Under the conditions of 15 kg/t of H2SO4, 25 kg/t of NaCl, and 15 days of curing time, a copper extraction of 93.1% was obtained at 90 °C with 50 g/L of Cl− and 0.2 M of H2SO4.","The authors thank the Universitat de Barcelona and the Universidad Católica del Norte for the opportunity and funding provided to conduct this research.

This defect may allow abdominal contents to abnormally occupy the thoracic cavity, resulting in most cases in the compression of the developing lungs. Signs are typically shown during early childhood since the defect is usually present during development. In exceptional cases, however, Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia can be observed in asymptomatic adult patients, or in those whose initial diagnosis may include common respiratory pathologies such as asthma.Case presentationHere we describe the case of a 31-year-old Mestizo female patient admitted to the emergency room owing to sudden onset of pain in the left hypochondrium and in epigastrium, as well as signs of respiratory distress. Soon after admission, the patient entered cardiorespiratory arrest, and advanced cardiac life support was provided for 45 minutes without success. The patient was declared dead 1 hour 40 minutes after admission. Clinical autopsy concluded that cause of death was respiratory failure as a complication of a previously undiagnosed Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia.ConclusionsWe report an exceptional case of Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia as the cause of rapid-onset respiratory failure and death in an adult. Unfortunately, due to its unusual presentation, Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia is rarely considered among the list of differential diagnoses when admitting an adult patient with respiratory symptoms. By reporting this case, we encourage the medical community and trainees to consider diaphragmatic defects when approaching a patient with sudden onset of abdominal pain with concomitant respiratory symptoms.",Not applicable.,All funding for the analysis and report of this clinical case was provided by Universidad del Norte and Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte,Journal of Medical Case Reports,,,"Adult; Autopsy; Child, Preschool; Diaphragm; Dyspnea; Female; Hernia, Hiatal; Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital; Humans",2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-12,15,1,424,All OA; Gold,Article,"Machado Contreras, Luis Alfonso; Retamoso Díaz, Stephanie Paola; Valencia, Gerardo; Morales, Luis Carlos; Herrera Bedoya, María José","Machado Contreras, Luis Alfonso (Medical Student, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Retamoso Díaz, Stephanie Paola (Emergency Doctor, Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Valencia, Gerardo (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Morales, Luis Carlos (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Herrera Bedoya, María José (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Pathology, Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Herrera Bedoya, María José (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)","Machado Contreras, Luis Alfonso (Universidad del Norte); Retamoso Díaz, Stephanie Paola (Universidad del Norte); Valencia, Gerardo (Universidad del Norte); Morales, Luis Carlos (Universidad del Norte); Herrera Bedoya, María José (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)",2,1,0.33,0.9,https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13256-021-02907-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140220524,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Treatment options, such as surgery and cryotherapy may be difficult or not feasible. Alternative therapies, such as immunomodulating drugs, can potentially be used for companion large animals. The hypothesis of the following retrospective study is: following multiple intravenous and intralesional injections of a mycobacterial cell wall stimulant (MCW) regression of SCC in equine, bovine and caprine patients will be observed. In this observational-retrospective case series, patients included are 2 bovine, 2 caprine and 3 equine patients. The medical records at two different teaching veterinary hospitals were searched for cases with a positive histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma that were subsequently treated with MCW, as either the sole therapy, or in conjunction with other therapies. Seven cases were included in this retrospective study. The median duration of therapy was 56.5 days, with 3 of the 7 patients being euthanized. Significant complications were seen in 3/7 patients. Repeated injections of a MCW may lead to reduction in lesion size of SCC in some cases, but long-term resolution is unlikely and the risk of significant complications is high; due to limited sample size and the variety in species, it is difficult to conclude if MCW is an effective therapy for SCC.",The authors would like to acknowledge the staff at both Oklahoma State University and North Carolina State University for their assistance and help with each of the cases reported in the manuscript.

El 20% de las mujeres embarazadas son adolescentes, aunque la mortalidad materna es de 2 a 5 veces más alta en este grupo etario que entre las mujeres de 20 a 29 años. Además de las complicaciones maternoperinatales asociadas con la inmadurez biológica, tener un hijo antes de los 20 años genera un impacto socioeconómico negativo que puede prolongarse por toda la vida. Por esta razón y con el objetivo de mejorar la salud materna, en el año 2000 la ONU propuso como meta para el año 2015 la reducción mundial de la tasa de embarazo en adolescentes. Para cumplir con esta meta, El Ministerio de Salud de Colombia ha implementado estrategias para prevenir el embarazo no deseado, y aunque las actuales estrategias de prevención han demostrado ser efectivas en mejorar el conocimiento en sexualidad y métodos anticonceptivos, no han logrado modificar el comportamiento sexual ni reducir la prevalencia de embarazo en mujeres menores de 20 años. Otro aspecto a considerar es el deseo reproductivo inaplazable durante la adolescencia, ya que el 36% de las madres adolescentes querían su hijo en el momento que lo tuvieron. El objetivo de este artículo es reflexionar acerca de los diferentes factores que influyen en el embarazo deseado y no deseado durante la adolescencia y las diferentes estrategia de prevención, teniendo en cuenta que el embarazo en adolescentes en un evento multifactorial que requiere una intervención intersectorial.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-08-05,32,3,543-551,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castillo Riascos, Lina Lorena","Castillo Riascos, Lina Lorena ()",,"Castillo Riascos, Lina Lorena ()",4,2,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/8302/9752/40680,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140224065,,

Se han publicado cerca de 400 casos a nivel mundial. En Colombia se conocen cinco casos diagnosticados y publicados con lo que nuestro caso a presentar sería el sexto en nuestro país. Presentamos la descripción del caso de una paciente de 2 años y 6 meses con rasgos dismórficos compatibles con síndrome de Kabuki. Examen físico: fisuras palpebrales elongadas, eversión del tercio lateral párpado inferior, cejas arqueadas con tercio lateral más despoblado, puente nasal deprimido, boca en carpa, paladar hendido, pabellones auriculares de baja implantación con rotación posterior. El síndrome de Kabuki se caracteriza por sus anomalías faciales peculiares que se consideran son la única manifestación que puede orientar al diagnóstico del Síndrome de Kabuki sin excepciones. Recientemente, se han identificado mutaciones sin sentido y de corrimiento del marco de lectura, entre otras en el gen MLL2 en aproximadamente el 75% de los casos y en una menor proporción deleciones y mutaciones sin sentido en el gen KDM6A.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-08-05,32,3,565-575,All OA; Gold,Article,"Osorio Alarcón, Carlos; Olaya Mantilla, Diego; Silvera Redondo, Carlos; Garavito Galofre, Pilar","Osorio Alarcón, Carlos (); Olaya Mantilla, Diego (); Silvera Redondo, Carlos (); Garavito Galofre, Pilar ()",,"Osorio Alarcón, Carlos (); Olaya Mantilla, Diego (); Silvera Redondo, Carlos (); Garavito Galofre, Pilar ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/5810/9754/40682,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140224067,,

Materiales y métodos: La investigación es de corte cualitativo. Se privilegia el abordaje etnográfico en el que la observación participante, la co-residencia y las entrevistas abiertas de sesiones múltiples cumplen un rol primordial. La pesquisa se ha centrado en los pobladores locales que regularmente asisten a la posta sanitaria, los enfermeros, los agentes sanitarios y los miembros del equipo de salud itinerante. Resultados: Se ha constatado que los procesos de salud, enfermedad y cura no se limitan al cuerpo humano, sino que también en ellos intervienen el paisaje y los seres que lo pueblan. Se ha identificado que en la resolución de numerosas patologías resulta central la figura del especialista ritual. Se ha determinado la gente valora y utiliza la biomedicina, aunque la asistencia a la institución hospitalaria suele ser rehuida. Conclusión: Se ha identificado un uso combinado de ambos sistemas. En él influyen las valoraciones de las personas sobre la enfermedad de que se trate, pero también otros factores como la distancia hasta el centro asistencial y las relaciones interpersonales con los profesionales de la salud. Se resalta la relevancia del enfoque cualitativo para dar cuenta de las especificidades de las categorías locales, que resultan esquivas para un abordaje construido a partir de conceptos derivados del dualismo cartesiano.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-08-05,32,3,411-418,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez, Bárbara","Martínez, Bárbara ()",,"Martínez, Bárbara ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/6742/9741/40669,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140224055,,
1528,pub.1140224062,10.14482/sun.32.3.9749,,,Molecular pathophysiology in infection by Helicobacter pylori,"La infección por Helicobacter pylori es la infección bacteriana más común a nivel mundial, en 1994 la Agencia Internacional para la Investigación en Cáncer catalogó al Helicobacter Pylori como un carcinógeno tipo I. La infección por ésta bacteria incrementa el riesgo de padecer cáncer gástrico hasta 6 veces más que los individuos que no presentan la infección. Colombia tiene una prevalencia de infección por Helicobacter pylori del 86% en adultos mayores de 20 años y del 80% en niños mayores de 8 años. La infección persistente y recidivante de la mucosa gástrica puede generar una respuesta inflamatoria, o procesos silentes, que en el peor de los casos puede progresar a un adenocarcinoma gástrico tipo difuso o intestinal. Existen múltiples factores que influyen en las consecuencias clínicas de la infección por Helicobacter pylori, en mención: predisposición genética del huésped, inmunorregulación genética del paciente infectado, factores ambientales y heterogeneidad de los factores de virulencia de las diversas cepas. Por lo anterior se infiere que las patologías gástricas, en especial la gastritis y el adenocarcinoma, son padecimientos de etiología multifactorial que pueden originarse por diversas causas o condiciones. En la presente revisión se analizarán los principales aspectos relacionados con la fisiopatología molecular en la infección por Helicobacter pylori, en particular tópicos correspondientes a los factores de virulencia.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-08-05,32,3,500-512,All OA; Gold,Article,"Torres Jiménez, Franklin; Torres Bayona, Carlos","Torres Jiménez, Franklin (); Torres Bayona, Carlos ()",,"Torres Jiménez, Franklin (); Torres Bayona, Carlos ()",1,1,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/8383/9749/40677,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140224062,,

Materiales y métodos: Se realizaron una serie de cálculos docking proteína-proteína entre las macromoléculas de interés se empleó el programa Molsoft ICM, se utilizaron las estructuras cristalinas de la proteína Integrina αVβ3 y de fragmentos de la proteína fibrilina-1, además se generaron mutaciones en la fibrilina-1, las cuales son características en pacientes con síndrome de Marfan, realizando posteriormente el acoplamiento molecular. Se determinó los aminoácidos que con mayor frecuencia estaban presentes en el sitio de interacción y su hidrofobicidad. Resultados: Se cuantifico la cantidad de aminoácidos hidrófobos presentes en las zonas de interacción dadas por los acoplamientos, teniendo en cuenta la energía del sistema, estuvo entre el 40 y 50 % de los aminoácidos de la zona de interacción, con un porcentaje mayor con respecto a aminoácidos neutros o cargados. En los resultados obtenidos utilizando las mutaciones realizadas sobre los fragmentos cbEGF22-TB4-cbEGF23 y cbEGF9-hyb2-cbEGF10 de la fibrilina-1, se encontró que no se ubicaron en zonas cercanas al sitio de interacción en la mayoría de los casos. Conclusiones: Las interacciones entre los fragmentos de fibrilina-1, y estos con respecto a la integrina mostraron en sus zonas de interacción la presencia mayoritariamente de aminoácidos hidrofóbicos, que es lo esperado normalmente.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-08-05,32,3,369-383,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vivas-Reyes, Ricardo; Tirado, Yamiris; Valdiris, Verónica","Vivas-Reyes, Ricardo (); Tirado, Yamiris (); Valdiris, Verónica ()",,"Vivas-Reyes, Ricardo (); Tirado, Yamiris (); Valdiris, Verónica ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/5748/9738/40666,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140224053,,

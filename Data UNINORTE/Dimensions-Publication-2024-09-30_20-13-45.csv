We did not find any of the previously described associations with HLA-B52, and/or HLA-DRB1*1301 alleles. However, in our patients, HLA-DRB1*1602 and HLA-DRB1*1001 were significantly increased. The association of Takayasu arteritis with Amerindian and Asian HLA-DRB1 alleles (DRB1*1602 and DRB1*1001) in the Colombian mestizo patients reported here, and with HLA-B*3906 previously reported in Mexicans, suggest the possibility that some HLA and disease associations are markers for ethnicity of a population carrying a disease gene which is present in an admixed population with the disease.",,,International Journal of Cardiology,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Alleles; Colombia; Female; HLA-DR Antigens; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Middle Aged; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Takayasu Arteritis",2000-08,2000,,2000-08,75,,s113-s116,Closed,Article,"Salazar, M; Varela, A; Ramirez, L.A; Uribe, O; Vasquez, G; Egea, E; Yunis, E.J; Iglesias-Gamarra, A","Salazar, M (Corporation CorpoGen., Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Pathology, Fundación Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia); Varela, A (Corporation CorpoGen., Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia); Ramirez, L.A (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellı́n, Colombia); Uribe, O (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellı́n, Colombia); Vasquez, G (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellı́n, Colombia); Egea, E (Immunology Division, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Yunis, E.J (Division of Immunopathology and AIDS, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA); Iglesias-Gamarra, A (Department of Rheumatology, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Bogotá, Colombia; Universidad Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia)","Salazar, M (Corporation CorpoGen., Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Pathology, Fundación Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia)","Salazar, M (Corporation CorpoGen., Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Pathology, Fundación Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia); Varela, A (Corporation CorpoGen., Santafé de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia); Ramirez, L.A (University of Antioquia); Uribe, O (University of Antioquia); Vasquez, G (University of Antioquia); Egea, E (Universidad del Norte); Yunis, E.J (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Harvard University); Iglesias-Gamarra, A (Department of Rheumatology, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Bogotá, Colombia; National University of Colombia)",46,1,0.95,4.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034976790,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology,

Occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) education and practice have developed relatively recently in Colombia, mainly in response to a series of long overdue (and still partially implemented) reforms to the health care, social benefits, and education systems. Expansion in general and occupational health coverage of the Colombian population and development of OEM education and training were to be achieved through a clear stimulus to private sector initiatives. Despite some measurable overall progress, the goals remain elusive.

The purpose of the study was, therefore, to investigate attitudes towards gambling in African University students with the Gambling Attitude Scales by sex, course of study, and personality traits such as conservatism and risk-taking. The sample included 136 University of the North students, 80 first-year psychology and 56 second-year African law students. The students were 69 men and 65 women in the age range of 18 to 32 years (M of 21.8 yr., SD = 3.9). Analysis showed that men held more positive attitudes than women did towards gambling.

A group of 115 black female students attending a first-year pre-registration program at the University of the North participated in the study. A quantified food frequency questionnaire was used to gather data on each student's diet prior to entering the university. Height, weight, waist and hip measurements were taken, and body mass index (BMI) and waist-tohip ratio (WHR) were calculated for each participant. Each student also completed a nutrition knowledge test (NKT). Mean dietary intakes were generally comparable to the recommended dietary allowances (RDA), with the exception of calcium, zinc and iron, which were lower. Urban women consumed significantly more sugar (65.8 vs 52.2 g) and confectionery (290.4 vs 183.7 g), and significantly less legumes (6.3 vs 18.9 g), than did rural women. The prevalence of overweight (BM1 >= 25) was high in urban (22.7%) and rural (22.9%) women and WHR was significantly greater (P = 0.0003) in rural women (0.76) compared with urban ones (0.73).

SETTING: Department of Psychology, University of the North, South Africa.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty six female and sixty first year male psychology students, mean age 20.9 years (SD = 3.4), with a range from 17 to 34 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexual activity and condom use (6 items), A 16-item AIDS Health Belief Scale and a 28-item Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale.
RESULTS: Almost one third (29.2%) of the sample reported never using condoms, 35.4% always, 19.8% regularly and 8.5% irregularly in the past three months. Perceived barriers were associated with increasing age and reduced condom use intentions. In addition, perceived susceptibility was associated with past condom use. The total AIDS Health Belief was not related with age, gender, past condom use and condom use intentions. Self-efficacy of condom use was associated with decreasing age, past condom use and condom use intentions but not with gender.

1967,pub.1074615741,,10745969,,Weight and health status of black female students.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine black female students for the occurrence of risk factors associated with chronic diseases of lifestyle, namely obesity, hypertension, nicotine usage, dyslipidaemia and compromised mental health (depression).
DESIGN: A cross-sectional analytical study design was used. All participants were examined within a period of 3 months during 1994. Weight, height, and hip and waist measurements were taken. Body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference (WC) were calculated for each subject. Two systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were taken for each participant. Questionnaires were used to determine specific risk factors related to lifestyle. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to measure psychological well-being. Fasting blood samples were collected and analysed for serum lipids and iron status.
SETTING: The University of the North in the Northern Province of South Africa.
SUBJECTS: A complete data set of sociodemographic information, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure readings, as well as a psychological health test and a medical questionnaire, were obtained from 231 of the 431 first-year female students who attended the university orientation programme. Only students with a complete data set were included in the sample.
RESULTS: Eighteen per cent of students were overweight (BMI 25-29.9), 6.5% were obese (BMI > or = 30), and 26.8% were underweight. Mean blood pressure, BMI, WHR and WC increased significantly with age and were highest among the > or = 24-year-olds. Only 1.6% of students had elevated blood pressure, 1.0% smoked and 4.4% took snuff. BMI, WC and WHR were positively correlated with blood pressure and age. Few students had dyslipidaemia (3.8% cholesterol > 5.2 mmol/l). However 14.5% were anaemic (Hb < 11.5 g/dl) and 24.6% had microcytosis (< 80 fl). Nearly one-fifth of students (17.7%) were classified as being moderately to severely depressed.
CONCLUSIONS: Black female students younger than 24 years exhibited few risk factors associated with chronic diseases of lifestyle. However in older women (> or = 24 years) there were significant increases in BMI, WHR, WC and blood pressure.

DESIGN: Randomised study.
SETTING: Three urban secondary schools in Pietersburg, South Africa.
PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty six Grade 11 secondary school pupils, comprising 150 (41%) males, and 216 (59%) females, aged 17 to 24 years (mean age 19.3 years, SD=2.6). The three cultural groups were 142 Blacks, 112 Whites and 112 Asians.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire included items on socio-economic and family background, knowledge about HIV, perceived self-efficacy and behavioural intent regarding AIDS preventive behaviours.
RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed an adequate level of AIDS knowledge. However, there was considerable inaccuracy regarding AIDS transmission myths or how AIDS cannot be transmitted. The different cultural groups generally felt most self-efficacious regarding how to protect themselves from becoming infected (75-90%) and least self-efficacious on knowing where to go for information on AIDS (72-74%). Generally, participants reported a high behavioural intent. The Whites stand second in knowledge and more or less second in self-efficacy and behaviour intent.

The height and weight of each subject was also recorded. The results are discussed in relation to the different skin pigmented groups, for specific age groups, sex and visual status. Statistical outliers were excluded from the results. It appears that the Albino group has significantly (p = 0.06) higher vitamin D levels against the background of a similar dietary intake and similar exposure to sunlight/day length. Thus black children/subjects require a significantly higher intake of vitamin D to attain the same level as their Albino counterparts.

Results indicate that the most common violent crimes experienced among the participants were rape (attempted rape), followed by physical assault, armed robbery, attempted murder and threat in that order. The majority of the victims scored high on the Kölner Risk Index (for traumatization)--several case examples are given. Analysis of Variance indicated that almost all factors of the Kölner Risk Index seem to be significantly correlated with PTSD outcome measures (PTSS-10, IES-R, Peritraumatic Dissociation and Trauma Belief).

We encourage the use of a repeat negative PCR test over a one month period in combination with corroborative clinical and parasitological investigation to be suggestive of cure in experimental animals previously infected with trypanosomosis. In view of the exorbitant costs of Mel-B and its extreme toxicity, we recommend that Mel-B be given as one course of two injections (each equivalent to 10 mg/kg) separated by 2 d of rest in experimentally infected rodent models.",,,Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research,,,"Animals; Melarsoprol; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Trypanocidal Agents; Trypanosoma brucei gambiense; Trypanosomiasis, African",2000-03,2000,,2000-03,67,1,71-4,Closed,Article,"Mbati, P A; Hirumi, K; Inoue, N; Situakibanza, N H; Hirumi, H","Mbati, P A (Qwa-Qwa Campus, University of the North, Parasitology Research Programme, Phuthaditjhaba, Republic of South Africa.); Hirumi, K (); Inoue, N (); Situakibanza, N H (); Hirumi, H ()",,"Mbati, P A (Qwa-Qwa Campus, University of the North, Parasitology Research Programme, Phuthaditjhaba, Republic of South Africa.); Hirumi, K (); Inoue, N (); Situakibanza, N H (); Hirumi, H ()",1,0,0.03,0.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074649823,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",3 Good Health and Well Being

Antibodies from animals immunized with either L. major subcellular fractions alone or sandfly gut antigen alone were not very effective in inhibiting development of L. major in the sandfly. When P. duboscqi were fed on blood from animals immunized with both parasite flagella and sandfly gut antigen, development of L. major was significantly inhibited (P<0,05). Control sandflies fed on naive animals displayed a normal pattern of parasite development to the metacyclic stage. Electron microscopy studies showed that one of the mechanisms through which antisandfly gut antibody can cause inhibition of parasite development is by lysing sandfly gut epithelium.

DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
SETTING: Grade II Secondary school pupils chosen at random from three urban schools in Pietersburg.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 366 pupils, 150 (41%) males and 216 (59%) females, the mean age was 19.3 years (SD = 2.6), with a range from 17 to 24 years. The three cultural groups were 142 blacks, 112 whites and 112 Asians.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Socioeconomic and family background (14 items), suicide data (4 items), and a 30-item Multi-Attitude Suicide Tendency Scale for Adolescents (MAST-12).
RESULTS: Suicide ideation and plans to commit suicide are the highest among Asians, closely followed by Whites and lowest among Black pupils. The frequency of attempted suicide was lower among Blacks (11.3%) than that among Asians (13.5%) and Whites (13%). Analysis of variance indicated a significantly higher score among suicide attempters on attraction to death and repulsion by life and a significantly lower score on attraction to life and repulsion by death. Furthermore, this study found a significant correlation between total MAST, suicide ideation, suicide intent, history of completed suicide in family or friend, parents divorced, family size and suicide attempt.
CONCLUSION: This study found differential effects across diverse ethnocultural adolescent groups for suicidal ideation, plants and attempts.

As the fluid reached steady state, power was turned on and a uniform heat flux was imposed on the disk at its opposite surface. The numerical model considered both solid and fluid regions. Equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved in the liquid region taking into account the transport processes at the inlet and exit boundaries, as well as at the solid-liquid and liquid-gas interfaces. Inside the solid, only the heat conduction equation was solved. The shape and location of the free surface (liquid-gas interface) was determined iteratively as a part of the solution process by satisfying the kinematic condition as well as the balance of normal and shear forces at this interface. A non-uniform grid distribution, captured from a systematic grid-independence study, was used to adequately accommodate large variations near the solid-fluid interface. Computed results include the simulation of six different substrate materials namely, aluminum, constantan, copper, diamond, silicon, and silver, and three different impinging liquids, FC - 77, Mil - 7808, and water. The solids and fluids selected covered a wide range of possibilities of conjugate heat transfer phenomena. The analysis performed showed that the thermal storage capacity, defined as density times specific heat, is an important factor defining which material will attain steady state faster during conjugate heat transfer process, like the thermal diffusivity does it for pure conduction heat transfer.",,,,Heat Transfer: Volume 4,,,2000-11-05,2000,2021-11-09,2000-11-05,,,383-389,Closed,Proceeding,"Bula, Antonio J.; Rahman, Muhammad M.; Leland, John E.","Bula, Antonio J.

The programme was aimed at the caregivers of infants living in those villages.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey design undertaken in 1989 and again in 1992.
STUDY POPULATION: Female caregivers of infants living in three study villages (study area (SA)) and three control villages (control area (CA)) in Northern Province. Households were randomly selected. The response rate of households in the SA and CA was 70% (N = 1,040) at baseline and 84% (N = 1,263) after intervention.
METHODS: A baseline study was undertaken in the SA and CA in 1989. A questionnaire eliciting sociodemographic data and information on dietary practices and nutritional knowledge was developed and used in the baseline study and after intervention. A nutrition education programme was undertaken by 6 trained local women (nutrition advisers) in the SA. After 2 years the survey was repeated using the same questionnaire in both the SA and CA. The SA and CA were compared with regard to breast-feeding and infant feeding practices; use of milk, brown bread, legumes and nuts; and use of school lunch boxes by older children.
RESULTS: The percentage of women who initiated breast-feeding on the day of birth improved significantly in the SA from 60% to 90%. The frequency of feeding infants at 6 months improved significantly in the SA (P < 0.01). The introduction of solid foods to infants on the first day of life decreased from 26.5% to 6.3% in the SA. There were no significant differences in the SA only with regard to use of milk, brown bread, legumes, nuts, and school lunch boxes. However, some positive findings were a greater increase in the use of these items in the SA compared with the CA.

METHOD: 414 students in standard 9 and 10 in three secondary schools in the province filled-in a retrospective self-rating questionnaire in a classroom setting. Questionnaires included modified and adapted questions from the Finkelhor's (1979) Risk Factor Checklist, and asked for physical contact forms of sexual abusive experiences of participants before the age of 17 years with an adult or a person at least 5 years older or a person in a position of power.
RESULT: It shows an overall (N = 414) CSA prevalence rate of 54.2%. Only four factors (from eight)-ethnicity not Northern Sotho, mother employed and not as laborer, a stepparent present in the family during childhood, and violence at home not seldom-significantly discriminated CSA from non-abuse. Increase in the number of combination of the four significant factors also increases the probability of the discrimination in a linear manner.
CONCLUSION: With some caution, we recommend the four significant risk factors for use while planning preventive strategies against childhood sexual abuse, and a massive campaign against child sexual abuse in the province. More job opportunities should be created in the province.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the Department of Education of the Northern Province (South Africa), and the principals and students of the schools involved in this study for their support and cooperation.",,Child Abuse & Neglect,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; South Africa; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires",2000-02,2000,,2000-02,24,2,259-268,Closed,Article,"Madu, S.N; Peltzer, K","Madu, S.N (Department of Psychology, University of the North, Sovenga, South Africa); Peltzer, K (Department of Psychology, University of the North, Sovenga, South Africa)","Madu, S.N (University of Limpopo)","Madu, S.N (University of Limpopo); Peltzer, K (University of Limpopo)",90,2,1.56,21.58,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029472994,44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Analysis of ratings given on items of a questionnaire on AIDS prevention and education indicated that 'Isolating people who are HIV positive' and 'How to protect yourself from getting HIV/AIDS' received the highest ratings. Factor analysis extracted three factors on AIDS education explaining 48% of the variance. The items loading strongly on the first factor were use of condoms (.54), giving information (.53), finding a cure (.52), and no sex outside marriage (.42). On AIDS education two factors were extracted accounting for 52% of the variance. The first factor had significant item loadings for 'sexual behaviour and HIV/AIDS' (.75), 'knowledge of self-protection' (.68), 'how AIDS/HIV affects the body' (.66), and 'alcohol and sexual behaviour'.

As well as social unrest, a country's socioeconomic situation may affect food availability and, crucially, influence the generally low proportions of the Gross National Product devoted to health services. Additional determinants include changes in the roles of non-dietary adverse factors (i.e. smoking practice, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity) and of infections (i.e. gastroenteritis, malaria, tuberculosis and, particularly, HIV). As to future health in 2020, major increases in socioeconomic status are very unlikely; in fact, there has been a deterioration in some countries with food shortages affecting nutrition status and food security. However, with some measures of prosperity there are likely to be decreases in family size and falls in the proportions of children born with low birthweights or with protein-energy-malnutrition (PEM), and of children lying under the 5th percentile of growth reference standards. Simultaneously, though. there will be variable rises, especially in urban dwellers, in the occurrence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.

Since most nematode life cycles lie between 3 and 6 weeks, the treatment has to be given during this critical period if maximum economic advantage is to be gained from deworming. However, treating communally grazed sheep every 12 weeks was found to keep worm egg numbers relatively low and may be advantageous in providing seasonal control, especially in semi-arid environments.

An additional in vitro experiment was carried out to analyze activity of the monoamines dopamine and serotonin on the levels of these prostaglandins. For this, minced tissue of the female portion of the gonad was incubated for different time periods with each of the amines at 10(-5) M. PGs were determined in the tissue samples by radioimmunoanalysis. The results showed that the amounts of the PGs increased significantly in both parts of the gonad during the global process of spawning and decreased when it had been completed. Incubation of minced gonad with the amines affected the time course of PGs variations, i.e., the effect of these compounds depended on the incubation time used. The results support a model for the regulation of spawning which assumes the occurrence of a stimulus which is detected by receptors, processed by nerve cells, and sent to the gonad where intermediation by amines (changing the time course of the process) induces liberation of gametes, in some way modulated by prostaglandins.",,,Journal of Experimental Zoology,,,Animals; Dinoprost; Dinoprostone; Dopamine; Female; Gonads; In Vitro Techniques; Male; Mollusca; Oviposition; Seasons; Serotonin,2000-06-15,2000,2000,2000-06-15,287,1,86-91,Closed,Article,"Martínez, Gloria; Mettifogo, Livia; Lenoir, Ronny; Olivares, Ana","Martínez, Gloria (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Mettifogo, Livia (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Lenoir, Ronny (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Olivares, Ana (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)","Martínez, Gloria (Catholic University of the North)","Martínez, Gloria (Catholic University of the North); Mettifogo, Livia (Catholic University of the North); Lenoir, Ronny (Catholic University of the North); Olivares, Ana (Catholic University of the North)",26,2,0.33,2.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020514713,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences",

The growth rate was higher in Chidhuapi Channel than in Metri Bay.Mortality was concentrated in the initial phase of culture in pearl nets. During the culture phase in lantern nets, the mortality rate was lower than 3%. The mortality rate in scallops with epibionts was higher than when these were removed in the culture phase in pearl nets. In Metri Bay the mortality rate with predators was higher than without predators. Epibionts and predators did not affect mortality in the culture phase in lantern nets.Epibionts and predation are important factors in the early mortality of scallops and therefore in the success of culture. Epibiosis, however, is not important in scallop growth in southern Chile. This is related to the composition of the epibionts and to the low temperatures which probably limit the growth of algae and invertebrates.",,,Aquaculture International,,,,2000-09,2000,,2000-09,8,5,431-442,Closed,Article,"López, D.A.; Riquelme, V.A.; González, M.L.","López, D.A.

They are the basis of human nutrition in this region and of great relevance to human health. This region is characterized by volcanic events (eruptions, thermal springs, etc.). Most of the vegetables cultivated in this area enter the local markets for a population of approximately 4000 people, whose ancestors were mainly atacameños and quechuas (local indigenous people). The cadmium and lead in these foods was determined by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). Results indicate that the highest concentration of Pb and Cd are in the potato skin, while the edible part of the potatoes contained a lower concentration of these metals. The INAA analyses of As in the vegetables from Socaire and Talabre, two towns located close to active volcanoes (e.g. Lascar), show a very high As content: 1850 microg/kg in corn (Socaire) and 860 microg/kg in potatoes (+ skin) (Talabre). These values exceed the National Standard for arsenic (500 microg/kg) by approximately 400% and 180%, respectively. In general, the data show a concentration of Pb greater than Cd with the potential for some vegetables to accumulate heavy metals, The values, expressed in fresh weight, vary from 0.2 to 40 microg/g for Cd and from 0.6 to 94 microg/g for Pb. These concentration intervals, except that of arsenic, are within the recommended standards in the Food Sanitary Regulation (Decree 977), which, expressed as fresh weight, must be equal to or smaller than 500 microg/kg for Pb. There is no legal standard for Cd.","AcknowledgementsThe financial support of Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile, the Chilean Commission for nuclear Energy and the International Bureau of the BMBF is gratefully acknowledged.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Arsenic; Cadmium; Chile; Diet; Electrochemistry; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Indians, South American; Lead; Vegetables",2000-06-08,2000,,2000-06-08,255,1-3,75-84,Closed,Article,"Queirolo, F; Stegen, S; Restovic, M; Paz, M; Ostapczuk, P; Schwuger, M.J; Muñoz, L","Queirolo, F (Department of Chemistry, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Stegen, S (Department of Chemistry, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Restovic, M (Department of Chemistry, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Paz, M (Department of Chemistry, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Ostapczuk, P (Institute of Applied Physical Chemistry, Research Center Jülich, D-52425 Jülich, Germany); Schwuger, M.J (Institute of Applied Physical Chemistry, Research Center Jülich, D-52425 Jülich, Germany); Muñoz, L (Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory, Chilean Commission for Nuclear Energy, Amunategui 95, Santiago, Chile)","Ostapczuk, P (Forschungszentrum Jülich)","Queirolo, F (Catholic University of the North); Stegen, S (Catholic University of the North); Restovic, M (Catholic University of the North); Paz, M (Catholic University of the North); Ostapczuk, P (Forschungszentrum Jülich); Schwuger, M.J (Forschungszentrum Jülich); Muñoz, L (Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory, Chilean Commission for Nuclear Energy, Amunategui 95, Santiago, Chile)",110,3,2.15,6.77,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013692706,41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,

The problem is analyzed by using the two-problem approach originally proposed by Bosse and Arce (Electrophoresis 2000, 21, 1018-1025). The approach identifies the carrier fluid problem and the solute problem. This contribution is focused on the latter. The strategy uses a sequential coupling between the energy, momentum and mass conservation equations and, based on geometrical and physical assumptions for the system, leads to the derivation of analytical temperature and velocity profiles inside the cell. These results are subsequently used in the derivation of the effective dispersion coefficient for the cell by using the method of area averaging. The result shows the first design equation that relates the Joule heating effect directly to the solute dispersion in the cell. Some illustrative results are presented and discussed and their implication to the operation and design of the device is addressed.

In the ostrich, lowered hatchability and hatching trauma may be due to shell ultrastructural abnormalities. In the present study the ultrastructure of the calcified portion, and the outer shell membrane (OSM), of domesticated ostrich eggshells was investigated using standard electron microscopic techniques. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrated intimate contact between cup-shaped structures present on the OSM and the mammillary layer of the calcified portion of the shell. The initial calcium carbonate growth of the calcified shell was of a dendritic nature with nucleation sites on the surface of the cup's contents. The dendritic growth gave way to a more randomly-orientated, smaller crystallite growth structure, which changed in form as it neared the vertical crystal layer (VCL). The VCL is described as being both amorphous and 'crumbly' depending on the plane of fracture. These observations suggest that firstly, initial calcification is contained within the cups and is then directed outwards to form the shell and that secondly, the VCL may contain an evolutionary, calcified cuticular layer. These observations serve as a baseline for studies investigating the effect of shell structure and strength on hatchling trauma and the influence of maternal diet.",,,Journal of the South African Veterinary Association,,,"Animals; Calcium Carbonate; Crystallization; Diet; Egg Shell; Membranes; Microscopy, Electron; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Struthioniformes; Tensile Strength",2000-06,2000,2000-07-10,2000-06,71,2,97-102,All OA; Gold,Article,"Richards, P D; Richards, P A; Lee, M E","Richards, P D (Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Pretoria, South Africa. richards@medic.up.ac.za); Richards, P A (); Lee, M E ()",,"Richards, P D (University of Pretoria); Richards, P A (); Lee, M E ()",14,3,0.18,2.24,https://journals.jsava.aosis.co.za/index.php/jsava/article/download/687/661,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072224680,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",

The hydrodynamics of these cells is controlled by the viscous forces and by the buoyancy force caused by the temperature gradients due to the Joule heating generation. The analysis is based on differential models that lead to analytical and/or asymptotic solutions for the temperature and velocity profiles of the cell. The results are useful in determining the characteristics of the temperature and velocity profiles inside the cell. Furthermore, the results are excellent tools to be used in the analysis of the dispersive-mixing of solute when Joule heating generation must be accounted for. The analysis is performed by identifying two sequentially coupled problems. Thus, the ""carrier fluid problem"" and the ""solute problem"" are outlined. The former is associated with all the factors affecting the velocity profile and the latter is related to the convective-diffusion aspects that control the spreading of the solute inside the cell. The analysis of this contribution is centered on the discussion of the ""carrier fluid problem"" only. For the boundary conditions selected in the contribution, the study leads to the derivation of an analytical temperature and a ""universal"" velocity profile that feature the Joule heating number.

1105,pub.1070707373,10.2307/971851,,,Inka Administration of the Far South Coast of Peru,"This paper examines ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence of Inka imperial strategies for controlling resources and people in the Titicaca Basin and the coastal valleys of southern Peru and northern Chile, and suggests that Inka imperial policies were adapted to meet local conditions in a series of dynamic political and economic interactions. In the coastal region between the Tambo Valley of southern Peru and the Azapa Valley of northern Chile, Inka policies included, variously, the resettlement of labor colonists (mitmaqkuna), the direct incorporation of coastal groups, and the maintenance of alliances with autonomous coastal elites. Altiplano elites exploited the imperial system to extend their own networks of colonization and exchange. Recent archaeological surveys in the Ilo-Ite coastal region, as well as unpublished data collected by Gary Vescelius between 1958 and 1960, indicate that the Inka developed more direct control of the south-central coast than earlier polities had achieved, but that imperial control over this region was limited and influenced by the persistence of autonomous coastal groups. Groups around Ilo remained fairly independent, while parts of the Tambo and Sama valleys and the Quebrada Tacahuay were brought under direct imperial control.
Resumen Se consideran en este artículo las estrategias imperiales incaicas para gobernar recursos y gente en la Cuenca Titicaca y en la costa sur-central. Datos etnohistóricos y arqueológicos sugieren que los Inka adaptaron sus políticas imperiales para satisfacer condiciones locales por medio de una serie dinámica de interacciones politico-económicas. Se considera el desarrollo y ejercicio de estrategias administrativas, así como valoraciones ""locales"" de la complementaridad de recursos y las interacciones de los élite. Según muchos documentos coloniales, en la región costera entre los valles Tambo (Peru) y Azapa (Chile), las estrategias inkaicas incluyeron: la colonización de mitmaqkuna de la Cuenca Titicaca en Sama Grande, la incorporación directa de algunas gentes costeras en Pueblo Tacahuay, y el mantenimiento de alianzas con algunos kurakas costeros autónomos en Ilo. Los kurakas del altiplano utilizaban el sistema imperial para la extensión de sus redes de colonización e intercambio, una condición hecha posible bajo la integración política del imperio. Se presentan datos nuevos proporcionados por reconocimientos arqueológicos llevados a cabo recientemente en esta región, así como unos datos arqueológicos recobrados por el arqueólogo Gary Vescelius en 1958-1960. La evidencia regional sugiere que en la costa sur-central, los Inkas desarrollaron un control más directo que él de los estados más tempranos (Wari y Tiwanaku). No obstante, el control imperial en esta región fue limitado e influido por la persistencia de grupos costeros autónomos. En la región de Ilo, artefactos de contextos funerarios revelan que los kurakas costeros mantenían sus redes de intercambio utilizando recursos marítimos y agriculturales. Sin embargo, la arquitectura inkaica en los valles de Tambo y Sama, así como la quebrada costera de Tacahuay, revela un control imperial más directo en estas partes. El sitio arqueológico Pueblo Tacahuay tiene conjuntos arquitectónicos en el estilo inka, asociados con andenes y canales para la agricultura intensiva. Las cerámicas del sitio revelan la ocupación de grupos locales bajo del control del Tawantinsuyu. La diversidad vista en la evidencia arqueológica y documentaria sugiere por una parte que los Inka no efectuaron su desarrollo imperial de la costa, o por otra parte que no querían incorporar grupos costeros directamente. Visto desde la perspectiva local, es posible decir que los kurakas locales mantuvieron algunas opciones en sus interacciones con el Tawantinsuyu.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2000-06,2000,2017-01-20,2000-06,11,2,119-138,Closed,Article,"Covey, R.

However, it has been found at concentrations as high as 0.37% in ground water near munitions manufacturing and testing facilities.1–11 Perchlorate contamination has also been found in areas such as Texas, where fertilizers are used to maintain land for cattle farming. Two of the main ingredients in these commercial fertilizers, potash and Chilean nitrate, have been shown by Air Force Research Laboratory to contain up to 0.57% by weight perchlorate.

The rotifers, Brachionus rotundiformis (formerly called S-type) and Brachionus plicatilis (formerly called L-type), were mass-cultured at 23°C and 35‰ salinity, and then abruptly transfered into tanks at different temperatures (18°C, 23°C, 28°C) and salinities (10‰, 15‰, 20‰, 25‰, 30‰, 35‰). Their availability in the water column was then measured in non-turbulent beakers over time. Both species showed initial transfer shock. The number of rotifers 1 h after stocking was approximately 50% of that potentially available, but increased to approximately 75% after 6 h. Availability was reduced when rotifers were transferred from 23°C to 18°C, but was not affected by transfer from 23°C to 28°C and remained relatively constant over time. B. rotundiformis was slightly more tolerant at higher temperatures than B. plicatilis. Salinity had a greater effect on availability than temperature. Availability of rotifers decreased as salinity was reduced. The availability of rotifers increased over time indicating that some rotifers had acclimated to the transfer conditions. B. plicatilis was slightly more tolerant at lower salinity than B. rotundiformis. Rotifers should be cultured at lower temperatures and similar salinities to the fish larval rearing tanks or acclimated for at least 6 h to larval rearing conditions before transfer.","AcknowledgementsThis work formed part of a project of the Cooperative Research Centre for Aquaculture (Australia).

1022,pub.1040930265,10.1139/z99-250,,,Causes and consequences of arm damage in the sea star Leptasterias hexactis,"Leptasterias hexactis, a sea star common in rocky intertidal areas of Puget Sound, Washington, often has damaged or missing arms. We measured the frequency of arm damage in 5 populations and examined the causes and costs of the damage. Between 30 and 46% of L. hexactis found at the study sites were missing arms or parts of arms. Some of the damage, particularly when only parts of arms were missing, may result from physical disturbance (e.g., crushing). Most arm damage, however, appears to result from predation by the crab Cancer oregonensis. The ability to lose, or autotomize, arms has adaptive significance if it saves a sea star from death. However, it also carries costs. The greatest cost was a decrease in reproduction. Leptasterias hexactis missing arms showed a 44-69% drop in egg production 7 months after arm loss. The effect was still evident during the next reproductive season (19 months after arm loss). We estimate that natural levels of arm damage could decrease the reproductive output of a population of L. hexactis by 7-10%.",,,Canadian Journal of Zoology,,,,2000-04-02,2000,,2000-04-02,78,4,596-605,Closed,Article,"Bingham, Brian L; Burr, Jennifer; Head, Herb Wounded","Bingham, Brian L (); Burr, Jennifer (); Head, Herb Wounded ()",,"Bingham, Brian L (); Burr, Jennifer (); Head, Herb Wounded ()",32,3,,2.23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040930265,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

We pay particular attention to the fact that atomic fields actually consist of composite particles that can easily be separated into their basic constituents by a detection process such as photoionization. In the case of bosonic fields, that we specifically consider here, this leads to the appearance in the detection signal of exchange contributions due to both the composite bosonic field and its individual fermionic constituents.

The food, equivalent to 3% daily of the animal dry weight was supplied continuously by a peristaltic pump. The rates of different physiological processes were measured on 18 scallops (three replicates per temperature/diet combination) during the third week of conditioning. Nine scallops came from the group conditioned at 16 degrees C and other nine from the group conditioned at 20 degrees C (each scallop from a different tank). As in the conditioning experiment, physiological measurements were made in controlled temperature rooms using the same experimental diets. Argopecten purpuratus did not show significant differences in clearance rate between 16 and 20 degrees C when fed with pure microalgae and microalgae+lipids, showing a well known capability of bivalves to acclimate their physiological rates within a certain range of temperature. On the other hand a clear effect of the composition of the diet on the clearance rate was observed. When microalgae were supplemented with a lipid emulsion, clearance rate was highly stimulated, showing values significantly higher in comparison with either pure microalgae, or a mixed diet of microalgae+carbohydrate. These highest feeding rates can be related with the presence of essential fatty acids in the diet, which are considered as very important compounds during the gametogenesis of invertebrates as well as during the development of ova into normal larvae. Thus A. purpuratus can actively regulate clearance rate and does not simply switch between feeding and non-feeding states. The data also suggest the presence of chemical receptors at the level of the gills and/or labial palps, which seem able to detect specific nutritive compounds present in the diet. Absorption efficiency was independent of temperature and was higher with pure microalgae and with microalgae+lipids. The lowest efficiencies were recorded with the diet supplemented with carbohydrates. The energy expended in oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion was very similar in the different experimental diets and temperatures. Scope for growth in A. purpuratus appears mainly affected by the diet and not by temperature. While the lower SFG seems to be associated with diets composed of pure microalgae and microalgae+carbohydrates, the highest values being found for a diet rich in lipids. The data were in agreement with the reproductive conditioning of A. purpuratus, where the highest percentage of ripe scallops occurred in individuals fed with a diet of microalgae supplemented with lipids at both temperatures. Similarly the highest larval survival rate was obtained from gametes released by scallops conditioned with the diet containing lipids.","AcknowledgementsThe study was carried out with financial support from the Programa Acuicultura y Biotecnologı́a Marina, 1 (97), Fondap, Chile (Subprograma Invertebrados).

During one experiment, scallops were fed at 3% of their dry mass per day whereas during a second experiment, they were fed at 6% of their dry mass per day. During both experiments, total gonadal levels of lipids and protein increased markedly during conditioning with the two mixed diets at 16 degrees C. These increases were less pronounced at 20 degrees C. Carbohydrate gonadal levels only increased during the second experiment at both temperatures and with the three diets. Of the major biochemical components of the adductor muscle, carbohydrate levels changed most during conditioning. Whereas muscle protein levels increased slightly with gonadal maturation, carbohydrate levels dropped considerably. Despite the marked drop in the levels of glycolytic substrates, only the activities of octopine dehydrogenase in the adductor muscle of the scallops conditioned at 16 degrees C consistently decreased. Muscle levels of glycogen phosphorylase were higher in mature than in recently spawned (control) scallops, suggesting a role in the transfer of glucose equivalents from the adductor muscle to other tissues.","AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by a grant from the Programa Acuicultura y Biotecnologı́a Marina, 1 (97), FONDAP, Chile (Sub-programa Invertebrados).

Three independent themes emerged from the analysis of results: Meaning of the parenting role, life-style changes and support systems. The results further show that for these mothers the problem of teenage pregnancy and parenthood ends up being their problem.

944,pub.1007715319,10.1006/jasc.1999.0461,,,"Early Holocene Bone Technology at the La Olla 1 Site, Atlantic Coast of the Argentine Pampas","La Olla 1, in the Pampas of Argentina, is an open-air site located on the Atlantic coast in the Monte Hermoso District, southern Buenos Aires Province. Bones in lacustrine layers outcrop during very low tide exposed by longshore drift. Based on an initial analysis of the faunal assemblage, two species of sea mammal, guanaco, pampean deer, greater rhea, and a fish were represented in the almost 300 bones recovered during the rescue excavation. The lithic assemblage consisted of unifacially flaked tools, rounded cobbles reduced by bipolar technique, flakes, and artifacts with flat abraded surfaces. Radiocarbon determinations of c. 7300 and 6600 bp came from sea mammal femora. An informal bone tool recovered from the site is made from the left proximal tibia of an adult otariid. It is identified as a utilitarian bone tool on the basis of use-wear characters that are restricted in distribution, and as a fracture-based bone tool on the basis of technological characters. The element was dynamically impacted in the mid-diaphysis region. Use-wear characters are loss of edge angularity, microflaking, pitting, striae, and polish. Microflaking occurs along the posterior fracture surface and exterior adjacent cortical surface. Pitting of the fracture surface extends along the entire length of the worn edge, but is most concentrated along the posterior fracture surface. A multitude of very fine striae runs parallel to the fracture edge. The area of striations is limited to this edge with a well-demarcated boundary. Covering all of these characters is differential wear-polish. This high gloss polish is strongly reflective and occurs over very worn and rounded areas, providing a very bright, melted appearance. Based on these different use-wear patterns, the La Olla 1 bone tool is interpreted as a dual-purpose implement most likely used for carcass dismemberment and hide processing. The La Olla 1 tool is unusual in that it is made from pinniped bone. Biomechanical analysis of southern fur seal bone indicates, however, a strong suitability for impact-related tasks and, therefore, an appropriate choice for use as butchering tools.",,,Journal of Archaeological Science,,,,2000-06,2000,,2000-06,27,6,463-477,Closed,Article,"Johnson, Eileen; Politis, Gustavo; Gutierrez, Maria","Johnson, Eileen (Museum of Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, 79409–3191, U.S.A.); Politis, Gustavo (Conicet; INCUAPA, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Pcia. de Buenos Aires; and Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina); Gutierrez, Maria (INCUAPA, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Pcia. de Buenos Aires, Argentina)",,"Johnson, Eileen (Texas Tech University); Politis, Gustavo (Conicet; INCUAPA, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Pcia. de Buenos Aires; and Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina); Gutierrez, Maria (INCUAPA, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Pcia. de Buenos Aires, Argentina)",17,0,,5.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007715319,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",

The main notion is of being a personification of evil. In a cross-cultural comparison study we found in the Austrian sample 13 patients with negative delusional identities. Our present study is based on detailed interviews and evaluations of medical records of this sample. Our aim was to draft a typology of delusional identities as a basic requirement for a phenomenology of the negative manifestations. Further investigative goals were the efforts of self-explanation undertaken by the patients with regard to their altered condition, the search for a pathogenetic transitional series and the functional value of the new identities. According to our estimation the basic mood on which negative delusional identities are founded is timid and dejected. Further basic requirements are a disturbed conscience of the ego and the concurrence of grandeur and guilt ideas. Half of our patients imagined to be reincarnations of negative biblical figures, three regarded themselves as possessed, two attributed their identities to heredity. Despite of diverse situative points of departure a common pathogenetic transitional series emerged for all patients. From a functional point of view a negative delusional identity seems to offer some kind of protection from further structural disintegration as well as relief from feelings of guilt--all that however at the price of structural deformations with dynamic depletion.",,,Fortschritte der Neurologie · Psychiatrie,,,Adult; Affect; Austria; Delusions; Female; Humans; Male; Schizophrenic Psychology,2000-04,2000,,2000-04,68,4,169-175,Closed,Article,"Stompe, T; Strobl, R","Stompe, T (Universitätsklinik für Psychiatrie Wien, Klinische Abteilung für Sozialpsychiatrie und Evaluationsforschung (Leiter: Prof. Dr. H.

Its existence oscillates between authenticity and inauthenticity, anonymity and selfhood, expropriation and reapropriation of itself. Being and Time analyzes in depth those constitutive modes of being of each person. Thus, Section One develops a rich hermeneutics of everydayness, while Section Two outlines a suggestive hermeneutics of the self. In light of this double hermeneutics, the present paper makes the case that Being and Time can be read as an attempt to develop a peculiar ethics of care. On the one side, this major work is interpreted from the point of view of the classical tradition of the care for the self. On the other, Heidegger´s notion of the “self” is analyzed in the frame of recent theories of selfhood.

Experiences from a South African mathematics and science foundation year,"The selection of students is a critical issuecurrently facing South African higher educationinstitutions. The identification and selection ofdisadvantaged students with the potential to succeedin mathematics- and science-based study is aparticularly pressing problem. The new South Africanhigher education law requires that selection is donein a fair and transparent manner. Selection has to befollowed by adequate support for selected students tosucceed in their study programmes. Issues of accessare closely coupled to issues of retention andsuccess. The research results discussed in this paperillustrate how these issues can be successfullyaddressed and how selection fairness and effectivenessmay be optimised under the constraints of selectionefficiency. An optimal solution can be found bydeveloping test specifications and selection cut-offvalues based on the teaching programme for which theselection is done. The resulting close fit betweenselection testing and teaching after selection leadsto a reasonable expectation of success for selectedstudents in the study programme.

The sample included 793 Black University students from non-health courses chosen at random from the University of the North, South Africa. The students were 370 (46.7%) males and 423 (53.3%) females in the age range of 18 to 25 years (M age 21.0 years, SD=3.48). The following prevalences for healthy behaviour was found: almost half (44.7%) avoided fat and cholesterol and likewise 48% had exercised in the past 14 days. More than 90% were non-smokers and 84% were non-drinkers or drank alcohol only very occasionally. Sex emerged as an independent predictor for smoking and drinking. Men smoked and drank more than women did. The level of risk awareness about healthy behaviour seemed to be low in this sample. Risk awareness and prevalence of health behaviour was only found to have significant effects for non-smoking and not for the other health behaviours (exercise, fat intake, alcohol consumption). Beliefs were more important independent predictors of dietary fat intake and exercises than was risk awareness.",,,South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2000-12-01,2000,2000-12-01,2000-12,30,4,46-49,Closed,Article,"Peltzer, Karl","Peltzer, Karl (Dept. of Psychology, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga 0727, South Africa)","Peltzer, Karl (University of Limpopo)","Peltzer, Karl (University of Limpopo)",11,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063712568,52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

480,pub.1033988784,10.1080/03736245.2000.9713695,,,AN ASSESSMENT OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCE FROM SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING AND COMMUNITY PERCEPTION,"Assessment of land degradation in developing rural areas of South Africa is often hampered by a lack of reliable data. Physical land features are sparsely mapped, if at all. A cost-effective and time-efficient methodology is needed. Relatively inexpensive time-series analysis of Landsat MSS remote sensing data may offer partial solutions. Remote sensing of vegetation, using vegetation indices such as the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) are used in the study. These indices give an indication of a general decline in the vegetation environment at district level. Recent developments in the field of desertification and land degradation however suggests that only relying on physical criteria for assessment often leads to misleading results. This case study in the Sekgosese 2 district of the Northern Province proposes a combination of temporal remote sensing and local knowledge of degradation to provide a more accurate assessment methodology. A time-series of SAVI images revealed land degradation taking place. Although there seemed to be some local knowledge about the existence of degradation, most people in the community were unaware of the real causes and effects of land degradation.",,,South African Geographical Journal,,,,2000-06,2000,2012-02,2000-06,82,2,70-79,Closed,Article,"BOTHA, J.

Methods: Achondroplasia was used as the object of this pilot study. Genetically trained nurses invited patients with known or suspected achondroplasia to attend a clinic. The patients were seen by two medical students and a genetic scientist, who selected cases meeting predefined clinical and anthropometric criteria. X-rays were taken and blood was sampled for mutation analysis. The study took place in the period from March to August 1997. The patients were seen at six local hospitals. Reviewing of the X-rays and mutation analysis took place in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Results: Thirty-one patients were selected and invited to the clinics. From this group, presented to the medical students, 17 patients were thought to have achondroplasia. The selection was based on clinical features and anthropometrical measurements. After reviewing the X-rays and adding the results from the mutation analysis, 15 out of these 17 patients were diagnosed as having achondroplasia.

Two measures of practical experience i.e., perceived and received are presented. Perceived practical experience uses students' self-reported levels of exposure to experimental work while remembered practical experience is established through the extent to which students are able to name and describe the use of standard laboratory apparatus. The paper explores the validity of measuring practical experience through students' self-reports, by establishing statistically the association between their perceived and remembered practical experience. The effect of gender is investigated. The findings show that the two measures describe the same variable, i.e. level of practical experience, and that a significant association exists between the two measures for individual students. Women show a significantly lower level of remembered practical experience, although their perception of involvement in laboratory work is similar to that of men.

After first revealing their working class roots through personal narratives, they employ Clance's Impostor Phenomenon to explore and discuss their experiences as working-class women within the Scared Grove of the academe. Results seem to indicate a dichotomy between their working class values and the expectations of university academics. Results also reveal that men faculty are their current allies, indicating that, for these three working class women in the academe, class is more of an issue than gender.

This results in the formation of coralloid-like outgrowths that resemble cluster roots or proteoid roots. High densities of bacterial colonies, embedded in slime sheaths, occur on the root surfaces Infection takes place during early root development and bacteria were observed in young, undifferentiated cells behind the apical meristem. In response to the infection, the infected host root cells deposit cell wall material so that the bacteria are contained in thick-walled cells.

423,pub.1035425546,10.1016/s0277-3791(99)00075-x,,,From nature-dominated to human-dominated environmental changes,"To what extent is it realistic and useful to view human history as a sequence of changes from highly vulnerable societies of hunters and gatherers through periods with less vulnerable, well buffered and highly productive agrarian-urban societies to a world with regions of extreme overpopulation and overuse of life support systems, so that vulnerability to climatic-environmental changes and extreme events is again increasing? This question cannot be fully answered in our present state of knowledge, but at least we can try to illustrate, with three case studies from different continents, time periods and ecosystems, some fundamental changes in the relationship between natural processes and human activities that occur, as we pass from a nature-dominated to a human dominated environment.1. Early-mid Holocene: Nature dominated environment — human adaptation, mitigation, and migration. In the central Andes, the Holocene climate changed from humid (10,800–8000BP) to extreme arid (8000–3600BP) conditions. Over the same period, prehistoric hunting communities adopted a more sedentary pattern of resource use by settling close to the few perennial water bodies, where they began the process of domesticating camelids around 5000BP and irrigation from about 3100BP.2. Historical period: An agrarian society in transition from an “enduring” to an innovative human response. Detailed documentary evidence from Western Europe may be used to reconstruct quite precisely the impacts of climatic variations on agrarian societies. The period considered spans a major transition from an apparently passive response to the vagaries of the environment during the 16th century to an active and innovative attitude from the onset of the agrarian revolution in the late 18th century through to the present day. The associated changes in technology and in agricultural practices helped to create a society better able to survive the impact of climatic extremes.3. The present day: A human dominated environment with increasing vulnerability of societies and economies to extreme events and natural variability. The third example, dealing with the history and impact of floods in Bangladesh, shows the increasing vulnerability of an over-exploited and human-dominated ecosystem. Measurements exist for a short time only (decades), historical data allow a prolongation of the record into the last century, and paleo-research provides the long-term record of processes operating over millennia. The long-term paleo-perspective is essential for a better understanding of future potential impacts on an increasingly human-dominated environment. Understanding today's global change processes calls for several new perspectives and synergisms:•the integration of biophysically oriented climate change research with research about the increasingly dominant processes of human forcing,•a focus on overexploited or limited natural resources and on vulnerable and critical regions,•fuller use of our understanding of variability on a range of different timescales: “The present without a past has no future”.",,,Quaternary Science Reviews,,,,2000-01,2000,,2000-01,19,1-5,459-479,Closed,Article,"Messerli, Bruno; Grosjean, Martin; Hofer, Thomas; Núñez, Lautaro; Pfister, Christian","Messerli, Bruno (University of Bern, Institute of Geography, Hallerstrasse 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland); Grosjean, Martin (University of Bern, Institute of Geography, Hallerstrasse 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland); Hofer, Thomas (Forest Conservation, Research and Education Service (FORC), FAO Rome, Via delle Terme di Caracalla, I-00100, Rome, Italy); Núñez, Lautaro (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 17, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Pfister, Christian (University of Bern, Institute of History, Department for Economic, Social and Environmental History, Unitobler, CH-3000 Bern 9, Switzerland)","Messerli, Bruno (University of Bern)","Messerli, Bruno (University of Bern); Grosjean, Martin (University of Bern); Hofer, Thomas (Forest Conservation, Research and Education Service (FORC), FAO Rome, Via delle Terme di Caracalla, I-00100, Rome, Italy); Núñez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North); Pfister, Christian (University of Bern)",180,8,,13.25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035425546,37 Earth Sciences; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,13 Climate Action

Este estudio analiza los registros de 1.601 especies de macroinvertebrados bentnicos pertenecientes a: Demospongiae, Anthozoa, Polychaeta, Mollusca, Crustacea, Echinodermata y Ascideacea, agrupados en 10 zonas y tratados desde una perspectiva zoogeogrfica. Mollusca (611 especies), Polychaeta (403) y Crustacea (370) corresponden a los grupos mejor representados a lo largo de la costa chilena, determinantes en el patrn global de la biodiversidad. Este aumenta suavemente de norte a sur, interrumpido por mximos que sugieren esfuerzos diferenciales de estudio ms que un comportamiento natural de la biodiversidad. El grado de agrupamiento entre las zonas muestra las tres unidades biogeogrficas definidas recientemente por Lancellotti & Vsquez. Este arreglo, que representa lo exhibido por los grupos ms diversos, se ve alterado en los grupos menos representados donde las diferencias obedecen al patrn de afinidades mostradas por las zonas comprendidas dentro de la Regin Templada Transicional. El quiebre zoogeogrfico alrededor de los 41 S, sugerido largamente en la literatura, slo ocurre en Echinodermata y Demospongiae, evidenciando en los otros taxa la existencia de un rea de transicin entre los 35 y 48 S, caracterizada por un reemplazo gradual de especies. Dentro de las regiones la biodiversidad muestra homogeneidad, contrario al endemismo, el que alcanza un mximo de 52% en la Regin Templada Fra y que parece ser consecuencia del alto nmero de especies con registros nicos (38,2% de especies citadas para una sla zona). Esto sugiere un desconocimiento de los macroinvertebrados chilenos (distribucin y diversidad), sobrestimando el endemismo regional y distorsionando los patrones locales de biodiversidad The diversity of marine macroinvertebrates has received increasing attention, although with little emphasis on its biogeographical significance. The present study analyses an updated data base on 1,601 littoral benthic species, belonging to: Demospongiae, Anthozoa, Polychaeta, Mollusca, Crustacea, Echinodermata y Ascideacea, whose records grouped into 10 zones, have been studied from the zoogeographic perspective. The groups best represented along the Chilean coast include the Mollusca (611 species), Polychaeta (403) and the Crustacea (370), with an important influence on its general pattern of biodiversity. This biodiversity showed a mild but progressive increase along the latitudinal gradient from north to south, interrupted by maxima which appear to reflect differences in study effort rather than normal behavior. The degree of relationship between zones showed three faunistic units recently defined by Lancellotti & Vsquez. This arrangement, which was evident in the most diverse groups, became altered in the lesser speciose groups where differences obeyed a pattern of affinity to particular zones within the Transitional Temperate Region. The presence of a zoogeographic break near 41 S, as broadly suggested in the literature, was only seen in data for the Echinodermata and the Demospongiae; other taxa show the existence of a region of transitional character having gradual replacement of species. Within the Regions, the biodiversity showed great homogeneity, contrary to endemism, which reached 52% in the Cold Temperate Region, as a consequence of an important number of single species records (38.2% species recorded in only one zone). This represents the present lack of knowledge of the Chilean fauna, probably overestimating regional endemism, and thus distorting knowledge of local patterns of biodiversity",,,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,,,2000-03,2000,2000-03,,73,1,99-129,All OA; Gold,Article,"LANCELLOTTI, DOMINGO A.; VASQUEZ, JULIO A.","LANCELLOTTI, DOMINGO A.

A field experiment was established during the 1997/98 growing season to evaluate six cowpea varieties for their grain yield, protein content, yield components and proportion of seed N derived from symbiotic fixation (%Ndfa) through the natural abundance technique. The varieties evaluated were PAN311, Glenda, Bechauana white, Chappy, Encore and NWK. PAN311 produced the highest grain yield of 1635 kg ha−1 which was 90% higher than the average across varieties. The lowest yielding variety was Glenda with an average of 368 kg ha−1. The high grain yield of PAN311 could be attributed to its high number of pods per plant, seed mass as well as harvest index. Seed protein concentration ranged from 237–275 g kg−1 but did not differ among the varieties. Estimates of %Ndfa in seed ranged from 23.02–28.80% with Bechuana white showing the highest dependance and PAN311 the least. PAN311 is clearly the highest grain yielding variety, though several of the other varieties have the potential of improving farmers yield which is estimated to be about 400 kg ha−1.",,,South African Journal of Plant and Soil,,,,2000-01,2000,2013-01-15,2000-01,17,4,151-155,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ayisi, K.

The thermal properties were determined with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), while a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) was used to determine the thermal stability of the samples. The analyses of cross-link density of the samples indicated that the wax is grafted onto the LLDPE chains at higher wax concentrations. The DSC results indicated that LLDPE and wax are miscible in the crystalline phase, and that cross-linking reduces polyolefin crystallinity.

Although we think that the establishment of any conservation policies along the vast coastline of Chile must be based on a multitude of approaches and considerations, scientific, biological, and ecological principles should guide much of these efforts. In this paper, we attempt to present a general overview of the current knowledge about the ecology and biogeography of nearshore systems in Chile. Based on the most relevant existing information, our goals are to: 1) Identify major biogeographic and ecological features of nearshore ecosystems, and the obvious gaps in information, 2) identify the most harmful human activities impacting the structure and dynamics of these systems, and 3) suggest the possible use of indicators to assess the conservational status of different environments along the coast. This overview shows, on one side, the geographic areas of deficitary knowledge on nearshore environments that are critical for future marine conservation and management plans, and on the other, the availability of high quality information for other geographic areas along the coast. Regarding the taxonomy and large-scale patterns of species distribution, important gaps in information were detected, however no big changes in the total number of species are expected in the future. There are few large-scale patterns of species distribution are reported in the literature, and in this contribution, but more work needs to be done, particularly for some taxa, to identify areas of high species diversity as well as areas which possess unique characteristics in terms of ecosystem processes (e.g., particular disturbance and upwelling regimes in coastal marine ecosystems) and species (e.g., endemic and keystone species). For most marine invertebrates and macroalgae, hotspots in species diversity are present in southern Chile. New studies addressing the causal factors generating these large-scale patterns of species distribution are also needed; information about coastal oceanography and larval supply is still poor. This information crucial for the design of a marine reserve network. The information available on community structure and ecosystem functioning, especially highlighting the effect of human impact, comes from very few geographic regions. More information about community structure for other areas of the coast is required, particularly considering the strong differences in temperature, circulation patterns, habitat heterogeneity, species composition, as well as of upwelling and El Nio effects along the 4,000 km of coastline. Finally, we list what we think are the most harmful human activities by area and environment along the coast, and integrate this information to suggest possible environmental indicators, and basic needs and guidelines for marine conservation in Chile A pesar de que Chile ha sido un pas pionero en estudios del efecto del impacto humano sobre la estructura comunitaria en ambientes marinos, y a pesar de la enorme importancia econmica y social que el ambiente marino tiene para el pas, el desarrollo de programas de conservacin marina y de bases cientficas para la sustentabilidad no se han generado a la misma tasa a la que han explotado los recursos y se ha utilizado el ambiente costero para diversos fines. Aunque nosotros pensamos que el establecimiento de planes de conservacin a lo largo de la costa de Chile debe basarse en varios factores, los principios cientficos, biolgicos y ecolgicos deben guiar muchos de estos esfuerzos, y en este trabajo nosotros intentamos presentar una visin general del estado actual del conocimiento sobre la ecologa y la biogegrafa del sistema costero en Chile. En base a la informacin ms relevante existente, nuestros objetivos son: 1) identificar las caractersticas biogeogrficas y ecolgicas del ecosistema costero y tambin vacos en informacin, 2) identificar las actividades humanas ms dainas que tengan impacto en la estructura y dinmica de estos sistemas, y 3) sugerir el uso de posibles indicadores para determinar la situacin de diferentes reas de la costa de Chile, y las necesidades de conservacin. Esta revisin muestra, por un lado, reas geogrficas con informacin crtica deficitaria para planes futuros de manejo y conservacin marina , y por el otro lado, la disponibilidad de informacin de alta calidad para otras zonas geogrficas del pas. Respecto de la informacin existente sobre taxonoma y patrones de distribucin de especies a gran escala, existen importantes vacos de informacin; no se esperan en el futuro grandes cambios en el nmero total de especies. Existen pocos estudios sobre patrones de distribucin de especies a gran escala, y ms informacin es necesaria para identificar reas de alta diversidad de especies, especialmente para algunos taxa, como tambin para identificar reas que posean caractersticas nicas en relacin a especies (endmicas, especies claves) y a procesos ecosistmicos (disturbios, surgencias). Para la mayora de los invertebrados y macroalgas, las reas de alta diversidad de especies se encuentran en el sur de Chile. Nuevos estudios dirigidos a entender los factores que podran generar patrones a macroescala son necesarios, como tambin informacin sobre oceanografa costera y disponibilidad de larvas. Esta informacin es clave para el diseo de una futura red de parques marinos. Por otro lado, la informacin disponible sobre estructuras comunitarias y funcionamiento ecosistmico, especialmente sobre el efecto del impacto humano, provienen de pocas regiones geogrficas. Mas informacin sobre otras zonas geogrficas es requerida, particularmente si se consideran las diferencias notables en temperatura, patrones de circulacin, heterogeneidad del habitat, y composicin de especies, como tambin el efecto de surgencia y de El Nio a lo largo de los ms de 4.000 km de costa de Chile.

As a result these extensions in general, and the applied suffix in particular, were not examined extensively. Those scholars (Ziervoge, 1969; Mokgokong, 1975; Lombard, 1985, to mention but a few) who treated verbal extensions in Northern Sotho seem to have left many aspects of the applied suffix unexamined. This paper aims to explore the applied verbal suffix in Northern Sotho more comprehensively, with respect to the morphological, syntactic and semantic significance introduced by this suffix -el-. One of the most important effects that the applied suffix has is that it adds an extra internal argument to the verb. The paper will focus on the interpretation of the different arguments introduced by the applied suffix.

The objective was to determine the effects of various impacts on the fish populations of the river. This was done by analysing the water quality and by considering the effect of weirs and dams, as well as various illegal angling activities, on the fish community. The Groot Letaba River is not highly polluted and the decline in its flow seems to be the greatest threat to the system. During a preliminary study to develop the river's resource potential, it was stated that the annual water allocation from Tzaneen Dam was 103.9 million m3/annum for irrigation, 8.4 million m3/annum for domestic and industrial use and 14.7 million m3/annum for environmental purposes. However, the yield from Tzaneen Dam was only 98 million m3/annum, suggesting that more water had been allocated than was available. As a result only 20% of the simulated natural flow is observed at Letaba Ranch Weir at the lower end of the river. Over the past few years many weirs and dams, none of which have fishways, have been constructed in the Groot Letaba River, impacting on the flow regime and on the migration potential of many fish species. Tiger fish (Hydrocynus vittatus) and the largescale yellowfish (Barbus marequensis) are two of the more prominent species influenced negatively by these barriers. This problem is aggravated by the illegal netting of fish stranded below these barriers during their spawning migrations.",,,African Journal of Aquatic Science,,,,2000-01,2000,,2000-01,25,1,76-83,Closed,Article,"Vlok, W; Engelbrecht, JS","Vlok, W (); Engelbrecht, JS ()",,"Vlok, W (); Engelbrecht, JS ()",4,1,,0.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070958466,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology,

The article specifically assesses two case studies, the Equal Opportunity Employment Policy at the University of Cape Town, and the Staff Broadening Policy at the University of Stellenbosch, to determine their underlying assumptions, their overall objectives, and their effectiveness in recruiting and retaining Black academics.

In addition, particle bombardment is used to tailor the properties of semiconductor materials and devices. A reliable description of as-implanted depth and vacancy profiles and resulting damage is needed for technological development. The binary collision approximation (BCA) methods are a time economical tool to predict these profiles. During this investigation the BCA code, MARLOWE, was used with a Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark (ZBL) interatomic potential and Firsov’s model for electronic stopping. For each ion investigated (He, Ne, Ar and Kr) the depth profile and vacancy distributions created by the bombardment were calculated at different energies. From these results it is clear that the mass and energy of the ion used to bombard GaAs strongly influences the depth profile and vacancy distribution.",AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Professor E.

Chile),"The provenance of saline inputs to the Salar de Atacama has been studied by means of the isotopic composition of sulphates dispersed in drilling core samples and the analysis of the water of surface inflows. The pattern shown by the ratios of 87Sr/86Sr and the isotopic composition of sulphur and oxygen in sulphates, suggests a mixing of two water inputs: one coming from the north-east of the basin, higher in 87Sr/86Sr, δ34S and δ18O and the other from the south-west, lower in 87Sr/86Sr, δ34S and δ18O. Analysis of the recent inflows to the Salar have confirmed the existence of two solute sources: northern and eastern inputs show an enrichment in those elements related to hydrothermalism and volcanism, in relation to water present in the west of the basin.",AcknowledgementsThis study has been funded by DGES project PB96-0270 from Education and Culture Ministry of the Spanish Government and has benefit from discussions with Dr. Carles Ayora.

Based on the trace element analysis of obsidian artifacts from 160 archaeological sites, it can be established that the two major deposits of obsidian were being exploited by 9400 BP, and that volcanic glass was being transported over long distances throughout Andean prehistory. Inhabitants of the Cuzco region acquired most obsidian from the Alca source in central Arequipa, while those in the high plateau surrounding Lake Titicaca obtained most obsidian from the Chivay source in southern Arequipa.

The effects of several processing parameters such as polymer precipitation, surfactant, solvent, stirring and solvent evaporation rates were also considered. As a rule, low stirring rates at 500 rpm yielded particles ranging between 100 to 250 μm and at rates over 8000 rpm, diameters around 5–10 μm. The surfaces of the bigger particles, observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were rough and the smaller ones were even rougher, irregular, cauliflower like. The extraction of the chloroform under low pressure or to the open atmosphere did not produce any appreciable change in the morphology for either type of particle. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs suggest that microparticles obtained by o/w emulsions are monolithics but those obtained by w/o/w emulsions are of capsule-like structure. Microencapsulation of a peptide material such as follicle stimulating hormone was carried out with success using a double emulsion technique. This biomaterial, dissolved in the inner aqueous phase, was able to stabilize the primary emulsion without using a surfactant.","AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Dr Lea Lopes from the Macromolecular Institute ‘Professor Eloisa Mano’, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, for fruitful discussions and for helping in recording the DSC thermograms.",,Colloids and Surfaces B Biointerfaces,,,,2000-02,2000,,2000-02,17,2,111-116,Closed,Article,"Martin, M.A; Miguens, F.C; Rieumont, J; Sanchez, R","Martin, M.A (State University of the North Fluminense.

We introduce a potential model for FeS2 which reproduces experimental structural parameters, elastic constants and hydration energies of pyrite. We modeled the {100}, {110}, and {111} surfaces of pyrite and calculated the {100} surface to be the most stable and to show little surface relaxation, in agreement with experiment. The surfaces were hydrated by associative adsorption of water molecules which stabilized all three surfaces, especially the unstable {111} surface. The calculated adsorption energy of −47 kJ mol-1 for water on the {100} surface agrees well with an adsorption energy of −42 kJ mol-1, determined for the stoichiometric (100) surface by temperature-programmed desorption. Adsorption of water molecules at surface sites of lower coordination (four- or three- coordinated) showed increased reactivity of these sites. We calculated an increase in adsorption energy of 50−60 kJ mol-1 per loss of bond. We next created stepped {100} planes in order to model a more realistic {100} surface with one-dimensional defects. Four different steps were investigated in two orthogonal directions. Because of the asymmetry of the sulfur dimers, the geometry of the dimers on the edge showed the dimers either leaning forward (F-steps) or backward (B-steps) with respect to the {100} terrace. We used water molecules as a probe of the reactivity of the different surface sites. Corresponding adsorption sites (terrace, edge or below the step) on the F- and B-steps were found to have different reactivities toward water due to the different adsorption modes of the probe molecule. On the B-steps the increased reactivity of the low-coordinated edge iron atom toward water (approximately −70 kJ mol-1) was outweighed by the network of interactions of the water molecule to atoms on terrace and step wall in the position below the step (−91 kJ mol-1). On the F-steps the four-coordinated edge site was calculated to be the most reactive adsorption site.",We would like to thank Dr S. R.

In the Pietersburg greenstone belt, zircons from a metaquartz porphyry of the Ysterberg Formation yielded an age of 2949.7±0.2 Ma, while a granite intruding the greenstones, and deformed together with them, has an age of 2853 + 19/−18 Ma. These data show felsic volcanism in this belt to have been coeval with felsic volcanism in the Murchison belt farther east, and the date of ∼2853 Ma provides an older age limit for deformation in the region. In contrast, a meta-andesite of the Giyani greenstone belt has a zircon age of 3203.3±0.2 Ma, while a younger and cross-cutting feldspar porphyry has an emplacement age of 2874.1±0.2 Ma. The meta-andesite is intercalated with various mafic and ultramafic rocks and, therefore, the age of 3.2 Ga appears plausible for the bulk of the Giyani greenstones.Granitoid gneisses surrounding the Pietersburg and Giyani belts vary in composition from tonalite to granite and texturally from well-layered to homogeneous but strongly foliated. These rocks yielded zircon ages between 2811 and 3283 Ma. The pre-3.2 Ga gneisses are polydeformed and may have constituted a basement to the Giyani greenstone sequence, while the younger gneisses are intrusive into the older gneiss assemblage and/or into the greenstones.

The does showed a cyclical change in weight around the breeding cycle, the mean live weight at mating, immediately after kidding and 60 days after kidding were 30.0, 35.2 and 32.8kg, respectively. The month of mating and kidding had a major effect on live weight. The post-kidding weight of does kidding in the late-dry to early-wet season was approximately 25% less than that of does kidding at the end of the wet season. Does mating during the wet season had the greatest gains over the course of the breeding cycle. The mean mating weight of primiparous does was 24.0kg, approximately two-third that of adult does. Younger does tended to gain more weight over the course of the breeding cycle than older does. There were consistent differences in live weight among flocks. The results illustrate the profound effects of seasonal factors on live weight changes and the abilities of Matabele goats to adapt to their harsh environment.","AcknowledgementsThe financial support of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada, the University of Zimbabwe Research Board and the Rockefeller Foundation, USA, for a study grant at the Bellagio Study Center, Italy awarded to L.

The root of the crisis lies in the need to transform the university sector. The acceptability and effectiveness of tertiary education institutions rest fundamentally on visible institutional change that parallels the change the country is currently undergoing. However, the arbitrary and often paternalistic authority that management has displayed in the past (in disciplinary action in particular) is typical of the unitarist system. 2 The response of workers has often been strike action which underpins animosity between workers and management. This response is also indicative of deep-seated problems enmeshed in labour relations at tertiary institutions. This article attempts to put a short synopsis of labour relations developments in the South African university sector in general into perspective. The spotlight falls on the blue-collar workers as the lowest occupational category in this sector. Then, an attempt to provide a broad summary of factors that often lead to industrial action in the university sector in South Africa is provided. The methodological approach followed in this paper is then outlined, while a description of factors related to industrial action is provided.

The monovalent HDTMA cation was exchanged for the metal cations on the montmorillonite to prepare HDTMA-montmorillonite, changing its surface property from hydrophilic to organophilic. Adsorption affinity of DBS on HDTMA-montmorillonite was found to be slightly higher than that of Orange II, probably due to hydrophobic or nonpolar interactions between the long hydrocarbon chains of the HDTMA with an anion. The single-solute adsorption data were fitted to the Langmuir and the Redlich-Peterson (RP) adsorption models. The competitive Langmuir model and the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) coupled with the single-solute adsorption models were used to predict the bisolute competitive adsorption equilibria. Among the models, the IAST coupled with the Langmuir and the RP models for DBS and Orange II, respectively, yielded the most favorable representation of the bisolute competitive adsorption behavior.",,,Separation Science and Technology,,,,2000-01-03,2000,,2000-01-03,35,3,353-365,Closed,Article,"BAE, JAE -HYUN; SONG, DONG -IK; JEON, YOUNG -WOONG","BAE, JAE -HYUN (DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, KYUNGPOOK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, TAEGU, 702-701, SOUTH KOREA); SONG, DONG -IK (DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, KYUNGPOOK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, TAEGU, 702-701, SOUTH KOREA); JEON, YOUNG -WOONG (DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, KYUNGPOOK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, TAEGU, 702-701, SOUTH KOREA)","SONG, DONG -IK (Kyungpook National University)","BAE, JAE -HYUN (Kyungpook National University); SONG, DONG -IK (Kyungpook National University); JEON, YOUNG -WOONG (Kyungpook National University)",53,0,,4.55,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049456933,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry,

Daily food supply was 6% of dry biomass. Three replicate tanks were assayed for each treatment. The progress of gonadal recovery was followed by periodic determination of gonadic index and histological analysis during three months. Gonadal recovery was slower for the animals conditioned at 20°C than for those at 16°C. Recovery was poorest for the animals fed pure microalgae at 20°C. The highest percentages of mature animals, at the end of the experiment, were obtained for the animals conditioned at 16°C and the maximal value was obtained for those fed microalgae–lipids. This diet also rendered the best result for scallops maintained at 20°C. All scallops conditioned at 16°C responded to spawning induction; the poorest response was for individuals conditioned at 20°C and fed pure microalgae. The percentage fertilization of gametes from the different treatment broodstocks did not differ but the percentage of larvae D survival was much higher for those from scallops conditioned at 16°C and fed pure microalgae or microalgae–lipids. These results indicate that temperature affects gametogenesis and that enriched lipid diets may improve the conditioning of bivalve broodstock.","AcknowledgementsThe present study was carried out with financial support of Programa Acuicultura y Biotecnologı́a Marina, 1 (97), FONDAP, Chile (Subprograma Invertebrados).

Blending simple international trade theory with actual facts, this study supports the notion that production during the transition phase enjoyed a classical ""vent for surplus"" type of growth, involving increased utilisation of available factor inputs, which in turn produced increased per capita income. Coupled with the classical factors were several technological packages introduced to farmers in later years. These led to the attainment of output peaks mainly in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1998, cultures produced 16,474 t, while the highest landings recorded inthe entire history of the fishery was in 1984 (one year after the 1983 ElNiño) with 5275 t. The figures for stock size of the species in the pastand at present, show that the wild stock of scallops today represents notmore than 10–15% of the total stock of the species within Chile, with mostof the individuals being kept in sea farms. Thus it is concluded that thescallop already represents a domestic species and, considering theoccurrence and development of selection practices in sea farms,biodiversity within the species appears to be at risk. With the developmentof culture practices over its entire range, there is little use in trying torecover a wild fishery for this scallop.

Feeding on H. reedi intensified between 0900 and 1600 hours with a second, smaller peak between 2300 and 0200 hours. Assuming an exponential gastric evacuation model, the gastric evacuation rate was estimated as 0·197 % W h −1 (95% CI=0·025–0·369). The daily ration decreased latitudinally from north to south from 3·62 to 2·66 and from 2·06 to 0·41 %W , respectively.

The tectono-stratigraphic development of the forearc differs from established models. No relationship was found between changes in rate of relative plate convergence and amount and style of deformation. Forearc response to continual compression since the Oligocene has been uplift and segmentation into discrete tectono-stratigraphic zones. From west to east, these zones are the extensional Coastal Cordillera, the extensional and/or transtensional Central depression, and the transpressional and/or compressional Precordillera-Preandean depression. Each area has recorded almost continuous sedimentation from Oligocene (?Eocene) time to the present day. Accommodation space has been generated by basin-margin uplift rather than active subsidence. We propose a model in which uplift of the leading edge of the South American plate is driven by subcrustal accretion of material removed at the trench by subduction erosion. Uplift and subduction erosion result in the trenchward gravitational collapse of the plate edge. The tectono-stratigraphic complexity exhibited within the Central Andean forearc is likely to be representative of Cordilleran-type margins and would be difficult to recognize in an ancient continental forearc.",,,Geology,,,,2000,2000,,2000,28,4,331-334,Closed,Article,"Hartley, Adrian J.; May, Geoffrey; Chong, Guillermo; Turner, Peter; Kape, Stephanie J.; Jolley, Elizabeth J.","Hartley, Adrian J.

These objectives aim to integrate previously segregated areas through integrated development plans. This research aims firstly to identify and describe the historical development of the spatial form and structure of the secondary city and capital of the Northern Province, Pietersburg and its dispersed peripheral towns. Supervised classification of SPOT HRV multispectral imagery is used to support the theoretical explanation. Images from an airborne digital Kodak DCS 420 camera are used to provide training sites in the pre‐classification stages, and also provide field data to the process of post‐classification accuracy assessment. Secondly, SPOT HRV imagery is applied to identify the stark contrast in urban development between the city of Pietersburg and its surrounding former homeland towns. Both built and natural environmental aspects are investigated.

This theoryfurnishes us with a tool, e.g. for constructing approximate groupinvariant solutions. Usually, these solutions are determined by powerseries in the small parameter and hence they are well defined only in asmall region of independent variables. In this paper, we modify theapproximate symmetry analysis by combining it with the multiple timescales method. In this way, we can extend the domain of definition ofapproximate symmetries of differential equations with a small parameterand of their invariant solutions. The method is illustrated by the vander Pol equation. It is shown that, in this example, our approachprovides a group theoretical background of ad hoc methods widelyused in perturbation techniques.",,,Nonlinear Dynamics,,,,2000-05,2000,,2000-05,22,1,3-13,Closed,Article,"Baikov, V.

Islands that have received single colonisers may subsequently harbour large populations of a species, while other islands may completely lack this species. Exchange between islands is limited, thereby strongly affecting evolutionary processes. While this concept is widely used in the context of oceanic islands or habitat patches on the mainland, it is rarely used to explain and examine the distribution patterns of marine invertebrates. Benthic marine organisms inhabiting patches with island-like features may also be restricted in their movements between patches. Once established in a patch, it may be more favourable to remain there rather than moving to another patch. Juveniles of species with direct development may recruit to the island patch of their parents. Herein, we examined the peracarid fauna in patches that have island-like features, i.e. kelp holdfasts. The number of peracarid species within an individual holdfast increased with its size. Similarly, the number of individuals per holdfast increased with holdfast size. However, several peracarid species showed a strongly aggregated distribution pattern, being highly abundant in some holdfasts and almost completely absent in others. Our results suggest that these aggregations of conspecifics may be a consequence of the peracarid reproductive biology: fully developed juveniles emerge from the female’s marsupium and recruit to the immediate vicinity of their mother, showing little or no tendency to emigrate towards other patches. At present, while it is not known how long peracarid aggregations within kelp holdfasts persist, our data suggest that some juveniles may remain with the natal holdfast and possibly reproduce therein. It is concluded that, during certain time periods, reproduction rates of peracarids in a holdfast may exceed their migration rates between holdfasts.",,,Developments in Hydrobiology,"Island, Ocean and Deep-Sea Biology","M.

Browse (succulent, forb and woody species) contributed 94% to the annual diet of eland. The annual proportion of grass in eland diet was low (6%), even though palatable grass species were abundant in habitats favoured by eland. Most grass was eaten in the early wet season when grasses offered young green foliage. Woody species comprising dwarf shrubs and shrubs made up the bulk of the food eaten by eland. In each season, favoured woody species contributed substantial proportions to the diet of eland. Eland used the plateau habitats in the early wet season, but valleys and slopes in the late wet and dry seasons. Habitats favoured by eland contained high abundances of plants of woody species favoured by eland. Chemical analysis indicated that woody species favoured by eland offered lower total fibre contents than other woody species available to eland. The results of the study indicated that eland are browsers that select browse of low fibre content.
Résuné Cette recherche a étudié la composition du régime alimentaire et le choix de l'habitat des élands dans les zones buissonneuses semiarides dominées par les espèces de microphylles et de leptophylles présentant des feuilles basses à leur consommation : les taux de jeunes tiges. La consommation de feuilles (de plantes succulentes, de buissons et d'espèces ligneuses) représente 94% du régime alimentaire annuel des élands. La proportion des herbacées dans le régime annuel des élands est basse. Les élands mangent de l'herbe surtout au début de la saison des pluies lorsqu'elle présente de jeunes feuilles vertes. Les espèces ligneuses comprenant des buissons, nains ou pas, constituent la part la plus importante de l'alimentation des élands. A chaque saison, les espèces ligneuses favorites contribuent en grande partie au menu des élands. Ceux‐ci fréquentent les habitats de plateau au début de la saison des pluies, puis les pentes et les vallées à la fin et en saison sèche. Les habitats préférés des élands contiennent des grandes quantités des espèces ligneuses qu'ils préfèrent.

Hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) cation was exchanged for metal cations on the montmorillonite to the extent of the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the montmorillonite to prepare HDTMA–montmorillonite, changing its surface property from hydrophilic to organophilic. It was observed from the experimental results that the adsorption affinity on HDTMA–montmorillonite was in the order 4-EtP ≈ 2,4-DMeP 4-MeP phenol. The Langmuir, dual-mode sorption (DS), and Redlich–Peterson (RP) models were used to analyze the single-solute sorption equilibria. The competitive Langmuir model (CLM), competitive dual-mode sorption model (CDSM), and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), coupled with the single-solute models (i.e., Langmuir, DS, and RP models), were used to predict the multisolute competitive sorption equilibria. All the models considered in this work yielded favorable representations of both single- and multisolute sorption behaviors. DSM, CDSM, and IAST coupled with the DSM were found to be other satisfactory models to describe the single- and multisolute sorption of the phenolic compounds onto HDTMA–montmorillonite.","This paper was supported by Kyungpook National University Research Fund, 1997, for which one of the authors (D.-I.

These were the German and Netherlands tradition (Zeitungswissenschaft and Perswetenschap, i.e. media history, law, ethics), positivist, functionalist, interpretative and Marxist. The last four approaches corresponded broadly to three sociological paradigms, namely: the positivist, idealist and realist. Different academic departments combined elements of the three approaches in varying proportions and combinations, each developing a preferred paradigm. This article begins with a cursory historical sketch of South African journalism, followed by a brief overview of JMC departments. The main trends in scholarship are then discussed against the backdrop of a qualitative analysis executed for this article. The authors conclude that theoretical and political rapprochement rather than division is occurring and evolving within post-apartheid JMC; that there is increasing co-operation and willingness to debate issues; that there is a recognition of the value of paradigm difference in debating issues, and that there is the need to locate South African JMC in an African and global context.",,,Journalism Studies,,,,2000-01,2000,,2000-01,1,1,9-33,Closed,Article,"De Beer, Arnold S.; Tomaselli, Keyan G.","De Beer, Arnold S.

Larval development was also observed in vitro in one-liter glass beakers. It was found that males and females did not molt within the same time periods. Males molted between February and March every year when the temperature reached 17.0 0.5C or 16.9 0.4C. Females molted from the middle of April to the middle of June when temperatures varied between 15 0.5C and 13.1 0.2C. Growth at each molt was 1.3 to 3.6 mm in both males and females, and hardening of the new carapace occurred within three days. Initiation of the egg carrying (berried) stage occurred between June and August, and eclosion of larvae between October and December of each year. Embryonic development lasted 115 3 days at 13C and 78 9 days at 18C. In all cases observed, eclosion occurred after sunset and prior to midnight.

New results presented here include 19 Rb—Sr and 7 Sm—Nd whole-rock isotopic analyses and U—Pb analyses of zircon and titanite from the Batholith. Three U—Pb analyses of zircon define a discordia with an upper intercept of 2.78 ±0.01 Ga (2o) and a lower intercept of 0.61 ±0.13 Ga (2σ).The average of two U—Pb analyses of titanite is concordant at 2.76 ±0.015 Ga(2σ). A composite Rb—Sr whole-rock errorchron (MSWD = 50.6), for 18 new and 11 previously published analyses, yields an age of 2.78 ±0.015 Ga (2σ) and initial 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7013 ±0.0003 (2σ).Pervasive, sub-solidus alteration affected the rocks of the Batholith but because isotopic ages show it was early (deuteric), it contributed little or nothing to the excess scatter of data. Instead the scatter is attributed to variable 87Sr/86Sr ratios among the plutons comprising the Batholith. Whole-rock Sm—Nd isotopic data indicates an age of 2.72 ±0.04 Ga (2a), and initial 43Nd/144Nd ratio of 0.50902 ±0.00003 (2σ) (εNd = –172.72 Ga for depleted mantle). Again, excess scatter in these data (MSWD = 5.05) is attributed to variations in initial 43Nd/144Nd ratios of plutons comprising the Batholith. The closeness of ages derived using four different techniques strongly suggests that the Turfloop Batholith was emplaced at ~2.78 Ga. Isotopic, whole-rock major-, trace-, and rare-earth element data, the presence of mafic enclaves and emplacement into greenschist to amphibolite-facies rocks suggest that the various magmas giving rise to the Turfloop Batholith were generated when a deep-seated heat source, probably mafic magma, partially melted >2.8 Ga tonalitic and trondhjemitic lower crustal rocks similar in composition to the BaviaanskloofGneiss. The Turfloop Batholith was emplaced after deformation, northward thrusting, and low-grade metamorphism of the Pietersburggranite—greenstone terrane, thus these processes must have occurred prior to ~.2.78 Ga. The thrusting is possibly related to similarly directed thrusting of rocks of the Witwatersrand Supergroup to the south. Ifemplacement of theTurfloop Batholith also post-dates southwestward thrusting in the Southern Marginal Zone of the Limpopo Belt, that thrusting also occurred prior to ~2.78 Ga.",,,South African Journal of Geology,,,,2000-03-01,2000,,2000-03-01,103,1,38-46,Closed,Article,"Henderson, D.R.; Long, L.E.; Barton, J.M.","Henderson, D.R.

260,pub.1013903460,10.1111/1468-2427.t01-1-00234,,,"‘The basic assumptions as regards the nature and requirements of a capital city’ identity, modernization and urban form at Mafikeng’s margins","With their acute spatial dislocation and racial polarization, South African cities have always offered a great deal of interest for the specialist and non‐specialist alike. Arguably, however, this racial ‘uniqueness’ has in fact burdened and restricted analysis of these cities. Alternative insights are needed to fill out the wider picture of urban diversity in South Africa, particularly variants of the apartheid city within the neglected bantustan periphery. For almost twenty years Mmabatho was the capital of the nominally independent bantustan, Bophuthatswana. This capital was distinctive for being both newly planned and, as the regime intended, also an affirmation of ethnic identity. The article therefore argues that in accounting for Mmabatho’s urban form and its landscape of exclusion and inequality, the competing motivations underpinning its creation should be assessed. The two major motivations involved the planned modernism by consultants and the drive for modernization by the regime itself. Both favored ‘top‐down’ practices centered upon adapting the specificity of Tswana culture to the apparent universalism implicit to modernization. The cultural and political motives of the regime, coupled with the aesthetic functions defined by the architects and planners, reflected the ambiguities implicit in modernizing the urban landscape. Bophuthatswana’s experience can provide powerful insights into the contradictions of the apartheid project itself; a project which celebrated ethnicity and culture, yet, at the same time, insisted upon modernizing the less developed (and by implication racially and developmentally inferior) bantustan periphery. Bophuthatswana’s ‘nation‐building’ therefore failed to transcend the universalism implicit in modernist practices. This failure was most visible in the developmental bias towards Mmabatho and the conspicuous inequality between this city and its peri‐urban environs. The efforts to create enabling strategies and more democratic planning approaches could perhaps benefit from reflecting upon such ambiguity. Avec leurs bouleversements spatiaux intenses et leur polarisation raciale, les villes sud‐africaines ont toujours présenté beaucoup d’intérêt pour les spécialistes et pour les non‐spécialistes. Il est possible que ce caractère racial unique ait en fait encombré et restreint les analyses de ces villes. Des visions différentes sont nécessaires si l’on veut peindre un tableau plus complet de la diversité urbaine en Afrique du Sud, en particulier des variantes des villes apartheids dans la périphérie bantoue négligée. Pendant presque vingt ans, Mmabatho fut la capitale du pays bantou nominalement indépendant, Bophuthatswana. Cette capitale était particulière parce qu’elle était nouvellement planifiée et, comme le voulait le régime, elle était aussi une affirmation d’identité ethnique. Pour expliquer les formes urbaines et le paysage d’exclusion et d’inégalité de Mmabatho, les motifs différents qui soutiennent sa création doivent être explorés. Les deux principles raisons impliquent le modernisme planifié par les experts et la poussée vers la modernisation par le régime. Tous deux préfèrent les pratiques ’de haut en bas’ concentrées sur l’adaptation des caractéristiques de la culture tswana à l’universalisme apparent implicite dans la modernisation. Les motifs culturels et politiques du régime, associés aux fonctions esthétiques définies par les architectes et planificateurs, reflètent les ambiguités implicites dans la modernisation des paysages urbains. L’expérience de Bophuthatswana fournit des aperçus importants sur les contradictions du projet d’apartheid; un projet qui célébrait l’ethnicité et la culture et qui cependant, en même temps, voulait moderniser la périphérie bantoue la moins développée (et par implication inférieure en termes de race et de développement). La ’construction de la nation’ de Bophuthatswana n’a donc pas pu surpasser l’universalisme implicite des pratiques modernes. Cet échec fut particulièrement visible dans le biais de développement en faveur de Mmabatho et dans l’inégalité flagrante entre cette ville et ses environs péri‐urbains.

It is argued that the overriding theme of A Question of Power (1973) is the struggle of a displaced, marginalised woman for what she perceives as her rights in a hostile world. In similar vein, Dangarembga reveals in Nervous Conditions (1988) how patriarchy coupled with colonialism, causes different kinds of psychological afflictions in her female protagonists. In this article the thematically interpretive discourse-analytical method is employed to focus on the autobiographical mode used in the novels under discussion, while special attention is paid to characterization and stylistic aspects. The investigation exposes both similarities and dissimilarities in the writers’ handling of this universal problem. Moreover, Head and Dangarembga are hailed for breaking new ground in moving beyond the confines of their own literary conventions, while simultaneously destroying the social silencing and political disenfranchisement traditionally experienced by women of colour.",,,Literator,,,,2000-04-26,2000,2000-04-26,,21,1,37-52,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cloete, N.","Cloete, N.

253,pub.1048647112,10.2113/171.6.657,,,The Jurassic Thalattosuchia (Crocodyliformes) of Chile; a paleobiogeographic approach,"Abstract
                  The thalattosuchian fossils from the Jurassic of Chile are revised. Some specimens, dating from the Lower Lias (Sinemurian), are the oldest known thalattosuchians, but are too fragmentary to establish a precise taxonomic placement. New specimen related to the genus Metriorhynchus is described from the lower Bajocian. It is the oldest representative of the genus and fills an important gap in our knowledge of the paleogeographic history of this group. Other new cranial fragments, related to the Callovian species Metriorhynchus casamiquelai, are described and this species is revised in the light of new studies on the intraspecific variability in extant crocodilians. Up until now, the known distribution of Liassic Thalattosuchia suggested a circumpacific distribution with minimally episodic passages through the Caribbean Corridor. Nevertheless, the close affinities between the South American and the European Metriorhynchidae from the Callovian to the Tithonian suggest the possibility that more and more frequent communications were made via the Caribbean Corridor.

The model consists of a set of equations that represent the equilibrium relationships for the ionic reactions and the mass balances for the components present in the system. The effect of ionic strength was taken into account by correcting the equilibrium constants using a relationship proposed by Davies. Several species can be formed at various pH and temperature values, the principal ones being: HSO4−, H+, SO42−, Cu2+, and CuSO4(aq). Simulations show that concentrations are highly dependent on pH. Sulfuric acid speciates mainly as bisulfate ion (HSO4−) and hydrogen ion (H+) at pH values lower than 1. Calculations including Davies’ relationship show very good agreement with experimental values for the ionic conductivity of the solution. The conductivity of the aqueous CuSO4–H2SO4 solution decreases as cupric sulfate is added, due to the resulting decrease in hydrogen ion concentration. The model presented in this work can be applied to predict and to analyze the solution composition in electrolytic copper processes such as leaching, electrowinning and electrorefining, as well as the purification of industrial solutions used in hydrometallurgical processing.","AcknowledgementsThis work was funded by the Chilean government agencies FONDECYT (project 198 0757) and FONDEF (project 6F 1035).

The first ontogenetic stage is the typus morphotype, which is similar in morphology to the female. The last ontogenetic stage, the robustus morphotype, is characterized by extremely long third maxillipeds and powerful chelae. During ontogenetic development between these two morphs, males undergo several intermediate molts, which are termed “intermedius.” In mating experiments with pairs of single males and females, all ontogenetic male stages (typus, intermedius, robustus) behaved in a similar manner. First, they followed the female, then embraced it with the second pereiopods and held it beneath their bodies, encaged by the pereiopods, the 3rd maxillipeds, and the abdomen. Various stimulating and checking behaviors preceded the placement of the first spermatophore, which usually coincided with the start of the spawning process. Most spermatophores were placed during the first 30 minutes of spawning. Following spermatophore placement, males guarded the females during almost the entire spawning process, which could last longer than 120 minutes. The number of spermatophore transfer events during the mating process varied significantly between the two extreme ontogenetic male stages, being typus greater than robustus. No significant differences were found in the percentage of eggs lost by females that were fertilized by the three ontogenetic male stages. These results suggest that all male stages have the same potential to mate successfully with females in a competition-free environment. However, we propose that male mating success may change drastically when different ontogenetic male stages compete directly for access to reproductive females.",,,Journal of Crustacean Biology,,,,2000-01-01,2000,2016-11-09,2000-01-01,20,4,628-640,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Correa, Cristián; Baeza, Juan A.; Dupré, Enrique; Hinojosa, Ivan A.; Thiel, Martin","Correa, Cristián (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Campus Guayacan, Coquimbo, Chile); Baeza, Juan A.

Birds have been and remain an important resource in many local communities. Historically, the Egyptian husbandry of birds was notably extensive, equivalent to the present utilisation of birds in hunting and domestication, especially in Europe, North America and Asia. The modern complexities of sustainable utilisation are demonstrated with a feasibility study from South Africa that involved the Makuleke community and the Kruger National Park. Harvest and reintroduction were tested for the undeniably sustainable resource of redundant second-hatched chicks of African Hawk-eagle Hieraaetus spilogaster, Milky Eagle-owl Bubo lacteus and Southern Ground Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri. The technique is feasible but the economic sustainability remains to be determined. Discussion is also presented on the modern concept of sustainable utilisation, the levels at which it can be practiced and the biological risks involved. The features of birds that affect their utilisation are considered and possible avenues for avian research presented, to enhance our knowledge of birds as potential resources and products. The overall emphasis is that biologists must make a proper evaluation of birds as a potential product, so that objective decisions are possible on whether or not to utilise birds as a sustainable resource.",,,Emu - Austral Ornithology,,,,2000-12,2000,2016-12-22,2000-12,100,5,355-365,Closed,Article,"Kemp, Alan","Kemp, Alan (Department of Birds, Transvaal Museum, Northern Flagship Institution, PO Box 413, Pretoria, 0001, South Africa)",,"Kemp, Alan (Department of Birds, Transvaal Museum, Northern Flagship Institution, PO Box 413, Pretoria, 0001, South Africa)",4,0,,0.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003944426,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,

This was the first study that used a towed acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) in coastal Chilean waters and is one of the very few in semi-arid bays. The ADCP was towed for two semi-diurnal tidal cycles in early austral autumn, between March 23 and 24, 1997 along a triangular trajectory that covered most of the bay. Additional data consisted of moored current meters and CTD casts. The observations indicated the presence of a surface layer, above the pycnocline, that showed predominantly diurnal variability forced by the breeze regime and by tides. The tidal circulation in the surface layer featured amplitudes of 10cm/s within an anticyclonic gyre that occupied most of the bay. The subtidal circulation in the surface was characterized by a pair of counter-rotating gyres. The northernmost three-fourths of the bay showed an anticyclonic gyre, and the observations over the southern fourth implied a cyclonic gyre. The subtidal anticyclonic gyre had a counterpart rotating in opposite direction within a lower layer, underneath the pycnocline. The lower layer showed semidiurnal variability in addition to diurnal variability and was insulated by the pycnocline from heat and momentum fluxes through the air–water interface. Circulations that resemble estuarine and anti-estuarine patterns were found associated with the subtidal gyres. A horizontal divergence related to a 10cm/s near-surface outflow around Point Tortuga, to the south of the bay entrance, allowed the development of upward motion off the Point, as evidenced by the tilt of the isopycnals at the entrance to the bay.","AcknowledgementsThis study was financed by the Universidad Catolica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.

What is needed is a ‘theoretical praxis’ that is capable of changing social reality in a potentially emancipatory manner even as it illuminates them. For this reason the paper concentrates on certain aspects of Foucault's work because, as in the case of social theory, it opposes domination and simultaneously enables emancipatory empowerment. Hence, the potential of specific insights on the part of Foucault to provide a ‘theoretical’ compass and, simultaneously, a model for human or social scientific practice is explored. The argument further entails the claim that the social/ human world that Foucault enables one to engage with, in an effort to formulate and activate the intelligible conditions of possible changes, is necessarily highly specific, in this case South African society in the late 1990s. With reference to paradigmatic discourse-analytical procedures in his own work, it is argued that the very specificity of such a social condition calls for a Foucaultian approach in the human sciences because no mere descriptivist approach can deal with the kind of power struggles one witnesses in South Africa today. Moreover, not to look for new approaches would be to miss the opportunity to participate creatively in the current global restructuring of the human/ social sciences.",,,Society in Transition,,,,2000-01,2000,,2000-01,31,1,45-57,Closed,Article,"Olivier, Bert","Olivier, Bert (Centre for Advanced Studies, University of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, E-mail:, plaggo@upe.ac.za)",,"Olivier, Bert (Nelson Mandela University)",4,1,,0.93,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052975175,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The data were collected with a dense 44‐station seismic network including ocean bottom hydrophones. We performed a series of inversions with increasing complexity: 1‐D, 2‐D, and 3‐D. This approach was chosen to account for the heterogeneous seismicity distribution and to obtain a smooth regional model in areas of low resolution. Special efforts were made to assess the solution quality including standard resolution estimates and tests with synthetic travel times. The subducted plate is imaged between 20 and 50 km in depth as an eastward dipping high  V P  feature. High  V P  /  V S  ratios within the oceanic crust possibly indicate elevated fluid content. Underplating of material eroded close to the trench is found beneath the Mejillones Peninsula. The lower crust of the overlying plate is characterized by an average  V P  of 6.8–6.9 km/s and an average to low  V P  /  V S  ratio. Large areas of anomalously high  V P  are found in the lower crust south of the city of Antofagasta; they are interpreted as remants of magmatic intrusions. A zone of high  V P  /  V S  ratios is found within the rupture area of the Antofagasta main shock, just above the subducted slab. Its location within the region of highest stress release from the main shock suggests that the main shock rupture causes the high  V P  /  V S  ratio.

We studied two areas of exposed basement in northernmost Chile (Belen) and westernmost Bolivia (Cerro Uyarani). The Belen metamorphic complex has been known for some time and consists of fault-bounded amphibolites, gneisses, schists, and minor quartzites overlain by folded Mesozoic to Cenozoic strata. The Cerro Uyarani is the only basement outcrop on the Bolivian Altiplano and has only recently been found and studied by geological reconnaissance. It consists of foliated mafic and felsic granulites, charnockites, and amphibolites. How do these basement occurrences compare and how do they relate to the other Precambrian crustal domains in the Central Andes? To answer these questions, we used geothermobarometers to reconstruct the P–T conditions of metamorphism, as well as geochemical analyses and petrological methods to study these rocks. The two basement blocks were found to have distinct geological histories and are probably separated by a major crustal domain boundary. Isotopic fingerprinting by Pb-isotopes clearly exclude Laurentian crustal components either in the protoliths or as reworked material. This signature is quite distinct from basement rocks farther south in Chile and northwestern Argentina.","AcknowledgementsGW and FL thank the German Science Foundation for providing financial support through DFG-funded projects Se490/7-1+2 and LU501/1-1+2.

The novel is selected in an effort to draw some conclusions as to how Mofolo deals with narrative order and duration as viewed by Genette. It is found that though the writer uses anachronies abundantly, these do not violate the chronological order of events. The anachronies merely serve to recall past events and to mention in advance what to be expected in the story. There is no violation of narrative duration.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2000-01,2000,2012-10-24,2000-01,20,1,29-49,Closed,Article,"Zulu, N. S.","Zulu, N. S.

180,pub.1001352012,10.1007/978-3-642-59665-0,,,Potassic Igneous Rocks and Associated Gold-Copper Mineralization,"Potassic igneous rocks have gained much attention among petrologists worldwide, mainly due to their distinct geochemistry, and many geoscientists still consider them as petrological curiosities with an obscure petrogenesis. In the past, a plethora of genetic hypotheses and of local names for potassic igneous rocks from different localities have been created. This has produced some confusion in the literature. This book reviews the geochemical and petrological characteristics of the potassic igneous rock complexes and investigates the different tectonic settings in which these rocks occur. The authors provide an overview and a classification of these rocks and attempt to elucidate the geochemical differences between barren and mineralized potassic igneous complexes. Many epithermal gold and porphyry copper-gold deposits are hosted by high-K rocks. Therefore, this book is not only relevant to academic petrologists working on alkaline rocks, but also to exploration geologists prospecting for epithermal gold and/or porphyry copper-gold deposits in modern and ancient terranes. This third, updated and enlarged edition contains several new sections, new geochemical data and additional references.",,,,,,,2000,2000,,2000,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Müller, Daniel; Groves, David I.","Müller, Daniel (Institute for Mineralogy, Mining-Academy Freiberg, Brennhausgasse 14, 09596, Freiberg, Germany); Groves, David I.

174,pub.1041812310,10.1016/s0895-9811(00)00057-2,,,Proterozoic–Paleozoic development of the basement of the Central Andes (18–26°S) — a mobile belt of the South American craton,"The Late Precambrian–Early Paleozoic metamorphic basement forms a volumetrically important part of the Andean crust. We investigated its evolution in order to subdivide the area between 18 and 26°S into crustal domains by means of petrological and age data (Sm–Nd isochrons, K–Ar). The metamorphic crystallization ages and tDM ages are not consistent with growth of the Pacific margin north of the Argentine Precordillera by accretion of exotic terranes, but favor a model of a mobile belt of the Pampean Cycle. Peak metamorphic conditions in all scattered outcrop areas between 18 and 26°S are similar and reached the upper amphibolite facies conditions indicated by mineral paragensis and the occurrence of migmatite. Sm–Nd mineral isochrons yielded 525±10, 505±6 and 509±1Ma for the Chilean Coast Range, the Chilean Precordillera and the Argentine Puna, and 442±9 and 412±18Ma for the Sierras Pampeanas. Conventional K–Ar cooling age data of amphibole and mica cluster around 400Ma, but are frequently reset by Late Paleozoic and Jurassic magmatism. Final exhumation of the Early Paleozoic orogen is confirmed by Devonian erosional unconformities. Sm–Nd depleted mantle model ages of felsic rocks from the metamorphic basement range from 1.4 to 2.2Ga, in northern Chile the average is 1.65±0.16Ga (1σ; n=12), average tDM of both gneiss and metabasite in NW Argentina is 1.76±0.4Ga (1σ; n=22), and the isotopic composition excludes major addition of juvenile mantle derived material during the Early Paleozoic metamorphic and magmatic cycle. These new data indicate a largely similar development of the metamorphic basement south of the Arequipa Massif at 18°S and north of the Argentine Precordillera at 28°S. Variations of metamorphic grade and of ages of peak metamorphism are of local importance. The protolith was derived from Early to Middle Proterozoic cratonic areas, similar to the Proterozoic rocks from the Arequipa Massif, which had undergone Grenvillian metamorphism at ca. 1.0Ga.","AcknowledgementsThe research of this paper is a result of SFB 267 “Deformation Processes in the Andes”, and we acknowledge financial support and grant L-501/2 to F.L. by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

It adopts a first principles approach, with the main focus on educational purpose, treating technology as a tool that can serve education in various ways. To understand fully the implications of any technology for education and national development, we need to explore its growth and impact within different socio-economic, political and cultural contexts. Issues in Education and Technology richly illustrates this aspect of education and technology, through commissioned case studies drawn from Africa, the Caribbean, South-Asia and the United Kingdom.This book concentrates on three broad areas in which technology can have the greatest influence and impact on education, namely• access and equity,• management and efficiency,• pedagogy and quality.Issues in Education and Technology explores the current and potential role of technology in each of these areas, from historical and contemporary perspectives. This promotes a better understanding of the key issues, helping readers to relate them to their own experience and thus to improve their decision making.",,,,,,,2000-01-01,2000,,2000-01-01,,,,All OA; Green,Monograph,"Secretariat, Commonwealth","Secretariat, Commonwealth ()",,"Secretariat, Commonwealth ()",0,0,,0.0,https://www.thecommonwealth-ilibrary.org/index.php/comsec/catalog/download/880/880/7380,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107147434,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

No single territorial or political axis can adequately describe the complex regional relationships that comprise the nation, Goldman argues. The essays in this volume juxtapose African-American, Mexican-American, and Anglo American fictions produced in the wake of both the Civil War and the U.S.-Mexican War, contiguous national conflicts that remain segregated in critical practice. At once comparative and intertextual, the readings in this study redefine western literature in its relation to other U.S. regional literary formations. Goldman's arguments question critical sectionalism as extensively as they do regional divisions, by blurring generic distinctions, by reading across literary periods, and by juxtaposing writers who explore the same set of social issues during the same historical moment, but who are conventionally located in separate literary traditions: sentimental literature, the African American novel, literary modernism, early Mexican fiction.",,,,,,,2000,2000,,2000,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Goldman, Anne E.","Goldman, Anne E.

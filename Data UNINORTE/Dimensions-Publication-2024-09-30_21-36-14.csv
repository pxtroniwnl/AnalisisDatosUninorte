However, to reach high productions, more efficient photobioreactors are required. Different kinds of photobioreactors configurations have been proposed but only a few of them show high productivity levels. This article presents a comparison among various promising photobioreactors by evaluating the light regime, mass transfer and scale up to achieve an efficient operation of mass algae cultures. Finally, a promising configuration for reaching high productivity is determined.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"Volume 4: Energy Systems Analysis, Thermodynamics and Sustainability; Combustion Science and Engineering; Nanoengineering for Energy, Parts A and B",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-08-01,2011-01-01,,,197-202,Closed,Proceeding,"Pupo, Oscar R.; García, Samira; Valencia, Guillermo; Bula, Antonio","Pupo, Oscar R.

Three-dimensional simulations of computational fluid dynamics were developed on a triangular section channel for the heat exchanger considered. The simulation of the fin is done for a given geometry and compared with experimental data presented by other authors, then a plane is raised keeping the original geometry and louver walls are included. The air-side performance of the heat exchanger and the hydraulic behavior is evaluated by calculating the Colburn (j) and frictional (f) factor. The result for the fin showed a deviation close to 3% when compared to experimental data for similar geometries from Keys & London. The results show how the turbulence highly increases the heat transfer phenomena.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"Volume 10: Heat and Mass Transport Processes, Parts A and B",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-08-01,2011-01-01,,,153-158,Closed,Proceeding,"Medina, Julio; Bula, Antonio J.; Valencia, Guillermo","Medina, Julio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bula, Antonio J.

1862,pub.1092822418,10.1115/es2011-54484,,,A Novel Proposed Method for Achieving Cities With Zero Anthropogenic Methane Emissions,"The growth of urban population is increasing quickly worldwide, especially in developing countries. This fact substantially affects the generation of waste, whether liquid, gaseous or solid, which are deposited in places commonly known as landfills. The organic matter in solid residues promotes methane production, which is a high impact greenhouse gas. Researches on uses of biogas from anaerobic fermentation’s processes have been made; nevertheless most have focused on Biogas direct burning or on site generation of electricity, and a few on biofuel production for transportation purposes. Regardless of the development of technologies to use biogas as renewable energy source, there is not wide documentation of projects involving population growth and urban planning with sustainable power generation based on organic residues produced within cities. For the Latin American case the implementation of technologies for biogas utilization is poor and projects that allow the integration of methane production based on population growth with its energy needs would highly promote planning and implementation of policies for sustainable resources exploitation. Their impact in the short, medium and long term would be unprecedented at all levels. The model proposed here serves as analysis tool for developing sustainable energy policies based on urban growth prognostics leading to 100% utilization biogas emissions for both electrical and fuel power generation. In the methodology used is performed an identification and geographic location of the main emissions sources such as landfills and sewage plants. Main solid waste generation sources are identified and an estimation of organic residues amount is made. Based on organic residues and methane production models provided by EPA, it is possible to obtain a long-term estimate of landfill biogas generation according to demographic growth prognostics. The overall power generation provided by a purification and separation plant is obtained from past estimations. Electrical energy and pure methane are produced. Model is validated in Panama City, which authors analyze the implementation of a separation plant whose objective is the adaptation of biogas for automotive purposes covering all their energy demand with electrical energy generated from a percentage of collected biogas. It hopes to have a major impact on the public urban transport fleet of Panama and a future implementation of pipeline that will feed the energy requirements of the city.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2011 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A, B, and C",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-03-13,2011-01-01,,,1821-1830,Closed,Proceeding,"Coronado, Horacio Pinzón; Martínez, Lesme Corredor; Pacheco, Nilma Rosa Barsallo; Rincón, Armando Luis Lacera","Coronado, Horacio Pinzón (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martínez, Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pacheco, Nilma Rosa Barsallo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rincón, Armando Luis Lacera (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Coronado, Horacio Pinzón (Universidad del Norte); Martínez, Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte); Pacheco, Nilma Rosa Barsallo (Universidad del Norte); Rincón, Armando Luis Lacera (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092822418,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

As the targets positions and distribution are uncertain; the goal is to minimize the overall exploration time. Using cell maps, the key problem can be solved choosing the suitable cell for the individual robots so that they simultaneously explore different regions of the environment. We present an intelligent approach for the coordination of multiple robots, in which contrast to previous approaches, able to perform task allocations taking into account the trade-off between the costs of reaching the cell and its utility. This utility function has been modeled using neural networks and optimized with genetic algorithms. Besides, if the task produces some conflict between robots, a negotiation algorithm is used to collision avoidance. The proposed approach has been implemented in real-world experiments and its performance tested in simulation runs. The results given in this paper demonstrate that our coordination mechanism significantly reduces the exploration time and increase the effectiveness compared to previous approaches.","This work was partly supported by the project “Intelligent Robotic Agents applied to Technology Education in the Caribbean Region” in the Research and Project Management of the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.",,,"IX Latin American Robotics Symposium and IEEE Colombian Conference on Automatic Control, 2011 IEEE",,,2011-10,2011,,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"M, Christian G.

1793,pub.1092779306,10.1115/es2011-54662,,,Thermodynamic Characterization and Dynamic Simulation of a Micro Algae Air Lift Photobioreactor,"Micro algae production as a source of fatty biomass that can be used to produce biofuels is a promising alternative that needs to be thoroughly evaluated. The tendency to increase production and energy content and to reduce water usage has had an impact in the development of photobioreactors, due to the versatility of this equipment to control and optimize the production parameters. This system requires an adequate scheme for monitoring and controlling the variables such as temperature, light intensity, carbon dioxide and oxygen supply, in order to guarantee the micro algae growth. This paper presents a control strategy for algae growth in an airlift photobioreactor. A thermodynamic characterization was performed and the dynamic behavior of the system is modeled for system analysis and control. A mathematical model is developed using the equations describing the process. A PID controller is set to evaluate the parameters that control algae growth. The results show that the photobioreactor presents a substantial sensitivity to room temperature changes, and this is considered as the main disturbance of the process. For the dynamic characterization a non-linear differential equations-based model was developed, and after tuning a PID controller it was found that the system was robust to changes in ambient conditions.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2011 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A, B, and C",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-03-13,2011-01-01,,,1167-1173,Closed,Proceeding,"Avila, Adrian; Bula, Antonio; Gómez, Rafael; Mendoza, Jorge; Verdeza, Arnaldo","Avila, Adrian (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gómez, Rafael (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Mendoza, Jorge (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Verdeza, Arnaldo (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia)",,"Avila, Adrian (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Gómez, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Mendoza, Jorge (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Verdeza, Arnaldo (Pontifical Bolivarian University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092779306,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 40 Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

1747,pub.1092788772,10.1115/es2011-54663,,,Analysis and Energy Optimization for Biomethanol Production Using Palm Oil Biomass Residues,"Palm oil extraction generates a great amount of biomass residues; i.e. kernel pieces, fiber and fruit bunches. The last is the major quantity, but it has limited usage as an energetic source due to physical-chemical characteristics and high humidity. Biodiesel production requires methanol, which is mainly produced form natural gas in very large industrial plants, oscillating between 700×103 to 1400 x103 tons per year. This paper presents an economical and technical analysis for production of biometanol from oil palm biomass residues, considering the requirements for the year 2019 in Colombia, which are expected to be 92.5 x103 tons. Different technological approximations are considered and the different parts for the selected process are dimensioned, due to the small size of the plant required. The process simulation is carried out using ASPENPLUS™, giving a global efficiency around 48%, and a yield of 43% for the biomass used. The production simulation allows comparing with the international price for methanol, and the cutting point is U$ 152/Ton. This value is compared with the international price of crude oil and it was found that it is only superior when the oil price is under U$ 20. Due to the tendency for oil prices to increase, it is feasible, at least form the economical point of view, to develop a small scale biometanol plant.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2011 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A, B, and C",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-03-13,2011-01-01,,,1175-1182,Closed,Proceeding,"Gómez, Rafael; Corredor, Lesme; Ávila, Adrian; Mendoza, Jorge; Bula, Antonio","Gómez, Rafael (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ávila, Adrian (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Mendoza, Jorge (Universidad Pontifícia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Gómez, Rafael (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte); Ávila, Adrian (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Mendoza, Jorge (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte)",3,0,,0.23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092788772,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Since the order of terms in the Leeson's model can only provide at maximum −30 dB/dec slope, a model with higher order terms is proposed to determine an effective resonator quality factor Qeff and reflect the reduced contribution of the amplifier flicker-noise. The average fitting error of the proposed model to a 23 MHz in-plane shear (IPS) mode oscillator is found to be less than 1%.

Although the proposed configuration uses two PLLs, just one cut-off frequency exists eliminating the need for ultra narrow-band loops. Relaxed bandwidth requirements translate to smaller capacitor values in the loop filters which considerably reduce the overall footprint of the architecture. A 100 MHz clock-cleaner is demonstrated using ICs fabricated in a 0.5 Μm. 2P3M CMOS process. Experimental results show a 20dB PN improvement at 1 kHz offset frequency with only 3.5% of the capacitor area used in a state-of-the-art cascade-type PLL clock-cleaner.",The authors wish to thank the MOSIS Fabrication Service for IC fabrication.

However, at the same time, the concern of privacy has also increased on users who would like to protect their exact location from attackers or from the service provider. One technique to protect the location is called Location Obfuscation, which consists in non reversible ways to slightly alter the location such that it does not reflect the real location of the user, but still contains enough information to provide a satisfactory service. In this work, the N-Rand, N-Mix and the N-Dispersion techniques are introduced and compared with other two existing techniques, Rand and Distortion, in terms of distance-based metrics. The results show that the N-Rand and N-Dispersion techniques produce a larger minimum distance to the original location, and the greatest average distance to the original path.",,,,2011 IEEE Third Latin-American Conference on Communications,,,2011-10,2011,,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Wightman, Pedro; Coronell, Winston; Jabba, Daladier; Jimeno, Miguel; Labrador, Miguel","Wightman, Pedro (Departamento de Ingenieria de Sistemas, Universidad del Norte Barranquilla, Colombia); Coronell, Winston (Departamento de Ingenieria de Sistemas, Universidad del Norte Barranquilla, Colombia); Jabba, Daladier (Departamento de Ingenieria de Sistemas, Universidad del Norte Barranquilla, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Departamento de Ingenieria de Sistemas, Universidad del Norte Barranquilla, Colombia); Labrador, Miguel (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA)",,"Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); Coronell, Winston (Universidad del Norte); Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte); Labrador, Miguel (University of South Florida)",43,7,,10.6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095065198,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

In order to solve the model, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with two local searches is proposed an implemented. As the algorithm returns a set of efficient solutions, the tradeoff among placements in their number of relays with their energy dissipation is explored. The evaluation shows that the energy can be diminished greatly by choosing not the most efficient placement in terms of number of relays but other placement with more relays. In our experiments, it was found that the solution with one or two more relay sensors than the efficient placement helped greatly in diminishing the energy.

1519,pub.1092792779,10.1115/es2011-54329,,,Performance Analysis of a Rankine-Goswami Combined Cycle,"Improving the efficiency of thermodynamic cycles plays a fundamental role in reducing the cost of solar power plants. These plants work normally with Rankine cycles which present some disadvantages due to the thermodynamic behavior of steam at low pressures. These disadvantages can be reduced by introducing alternatives such as combined cycles which combine the best features of each cycle. In this paper a combined Rankine-Goswami cycle (RGC) is proposed and a thermodynamic analysis is conducted. The Goswami cycle, used as a bottoming cycle, uses ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid and produces power and refrigeration while power is the primary goal. This bottoming cycle, reduces the energy losses in the traditional condenser and eliminates the high specific volume and poor vapor quality presented in the last stages of the lower pressure turbine in the Rankine cycle. In addition, the use of absorption condensation in the Goswami cycle, for regeneration of the strong solution, allows operating the low pressure side of the cycle above atmospheric pressure which eliminates the need for maintaining a vacuum pressure in the condenser. The performance of the proposed combined Rankine-Goswami cycle, under full load, was investigated for applications in parabolic trough solar thermal plants for a range from 40 to 50 MW sizes. A sensitivity analysis to study the effect of the ammonia concentration, condenser pressure and rectifier concentration on the cycle efficiency, network and cooling was performed. The results indicate that the proposed RGC provide a difference in net power output between 15.7 and 42.3% for condenser pressures between 1 to 9 bars. The maximum effective first law and exergy efficiencies for an ammonia mass fraction of 0.5 are calculated as 36.7% and 24.7% respectively for the base case (no superheater or rectifier process).Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2011 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A, B, and C",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-03-13,2011-01-01,,,385-393,Closed,Proceeding,"Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Archibold, Antonio Ramos; Demirkaya, Gokmen; Besarati, Saeb; Goswami, D.

Some additional analysis were done in order to prepare the pipelines for use in a real-time system. This real-time system and a game application in which these pipelines are to be used were implemented. The game is set in a virtual environment where player is a wildlife photographer on an uninhabited island. Overt attention is used to adjust the angle of the first person camera, when the player is tracking animals. When making a photograph, the animal will flee when it notices it is looked at directly, so covert attention is required to get a good shot. Future work will entail user tests with this system to evaluate usability, user experience, and characteristics of the signals related to overt and covert attention when used in such an immersive environment.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the BrainGain Smart Mix Programme of the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.

It consists of topology construction and topology maintenance algorithms. While topology construction builds a reduced topology, topology maintenance changes the reduced topology when the current one is no longer optimal. The selection of an appropriate topology maintenance technique is rarely included in the evaluation of topology control solutions, even though the impact of such decision in the lifetime of the network (in terms of number of nodes or coverage) has been shown before. This paper makes two important contributions. First, it introduces a new topology construction algorithm called $A3Cov$, based on the $A3$ protocol, which increases the coverage ratio considerably compared to the original version. Second, the $A3Cov$ protocol is evaluated jointly with four topology maintenance techniques to determine the influence of the different maintenance schemes on the area coverage and the network lifetime. The results show that the dynamic global topology maintenance techniques with $A3Cov$ provide the best coverage and network lifetime for a substantially longer period of time compared to the ACOS protocol.",,,,2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference,,,2011-03,2011,,,,,522-527,Closed,Proceeding,"Wightman, Pedro M.; Labrador, Miguel A.","Wightman, Pedro M.

Classic techniques to answer this question are not up to the challenge because they rarely consider realistic radio models. This work proposes a methodology to evaluate the performance of network size estimation techniques in terms of connectivity efficiency under realistic radio scenarios. This study is carried out using Atarraya, a simulation tool for wireless sensor networks, considering three classical estimation techniques and a radio model based on the specifications of the ZigBee radio from off-the-shelf WaspMote nodes from Libelium. The results show that the hexagon-based optimal grid technique provides the most efficient estimate, offering a high connectivity level with the lowest estimated number of nodes for a given proximity radius parameter, followed by the circle packing and the triangle-based grid distribution. In addition, the results show that packet error rates of 10% could still produce highly connected topologies.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Ad-hoc, Mobile, and Wireless Networks","Hannes Frey, Xu Li, Stefan Ruehrup",,2011,2011,,2011,6811,,72-85,Closed,Chapter,"Wightman, Pedro; Jimeno, Miguel; Jabba, Daladier; Labrador, Miguel; Zurbarán, Mayra; Córdoba, César; Guerrero, Armando","Wightman, Pedro (Departament of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Departament of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jabba, Daladier (Departament of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Labrador, Miguel (Department of Computer Science, University of South Florida, 4202 E.

Considering these, we assessed the potential of copper- and chromium-resistant actinomycetes for bioremediation activity in polluted soils. Also, we assessed the effects of copper concentrations on roots, shoots, and leaf growth of maize and the copper uptake and accumulation by the maize plants. Four chromium resistant Streptomyces strains reduced hexavalent chromium up to 85–95% after 21 days. The novel copper-resistant actinobacterium Amycolatopsis tucumanensis efficiently immobilized copper when inoculated into copper-polluted soil microcosms: bioavailable Cu was 31% lower in soil compared to non-bioaugmented soil. Maize plant was found interesting both as biomarker and bioremediation tool. The bioremediation activity of A. tucumanensis inoculated maize plants grown in polluted soil microcosms correlated well with the values obtained with chemical and physical methods: 20% and 17% lower tissue contents of copper were measured in roots and leaves, respectively. The roots, shoots, and leaves of maize plants also showed a great ability to accumulate copper, which however increased with metal concentration. The metal concentrations were 382 times more in roots, 157 in shoots, and only 16 in leaves, compared to the control (without CuSO4).",,,Environmental Pollution,Biomanagement of Metal-Contaminated Soils,"Mohammad Saghir Khan, Almas Zaidi, Reeta Goel, Javed Musarrat",,2011-08-09,2011,2011-08-09,2011,20,,459-477,Closed,Chapter,"Benimeli, Claudia S.; Polti, Marta A.; Albarracín, Virginia H.; Abate, Carlos M.; Amoroso, María J.","Benimeli, Claudia S.

A random key predistribution scheme and its enhanced versions to deal with pairwise key establishment [3] are of popular approaches that have higher resilience for nodes compromising.

Securing the communication channel through encrypting messages sent between nodes grow to be a must. Message encryption using the public key cryptosystems [1] in WSN is infeasible due to its constrained resources. A random key pre-distribution scheme [2] is of popular approaches that perfectly securing a WSN and conserving its resources. The random key pre-distribution scheme or its enhanced editions is applied with assumptions of no prior deployment knowledge. The paper proposes a scheme that uses prior deployment knowledge in terms of the energy level carried by each node for modifying the polynomial pool based key pre-distribution scheme proposed in [3]. The paper shows that the node energy level observation can be used to control the creation and the selection of polynomial keys hold by this node. For the purpose of evaluating the proposed scheme it's applied on the A3 protocol as one of known topology control protocols [4]. The proposed scheme avoids the unnecessary key assignment and it reduces the number of active nodes per topology construction that positively reflects on the performance of the whole WSN.,,,,"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks",,,2011-07,2011,,,1,,184-189,Closed,Proceeding,"Fouad, Mohamed Mostafa M.; Mostafa, Mostafa-Sami M.; Dawood, Ahmed Reda","Fouad, Mohamed Mostafa M.

This paper presents the optimization of a combined power/cooling cycle, also known as the Goswami Cycle, which combines the Rankine and absorption refrigeration cycles. The cycle uses a special binary fluid mixture as the working fluid and produces power and refrigeration. In this regard, multi-objective genetic algorithms (GA) are used for Pareto approach optimization of the thermodynamic cycle. The optimization study includes two cases. In the first case the performance of the cycle is evaluated as it is used as a bottoming cycle, and in the second case as it is used as a top cycle utilizing solar energy or geothermal sources. The important thermodynamic objectives that have been considered in this work are, namely, work output, cooling capacity, effective first law and exergy efficiencies. Optimization is carried out by varying the selected design variables; boiler temperature and pressure, rectifier temperature, and basic solution concentration. The boiler temperature is varied between 70–150 °C and 150–250 °C for the first and the second cases, respectively.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2011 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A, B, and C",,,2011-01-01,2011,2012-03-13,2011-01-01,,,351-360,Closed,Proceeding,"Demirkaya, Gokmen; Besarati, Saeb M.; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Archibold, Antonio Ramos; Rahman, Muhammad M.; Goswami, D.

Early adolescents spend time and interact with their friends in environments that are real, electronic, or virtual. Together they share a range of experiences including achievement-related and social events at school, the affective ups and downs associated with family life, and the multifaceted experiences associated with adjusting to new freedoms and new internal states and desires. The importance of friendship during this period has not been lost on writers and filmmakers. The best known works of fiction about early adolescents typically tell a story about how a person of this age makes his or her way through life in the company of his or her friends. The Harry Potter stories are the best examples of this genre of literature. Millions and millions of readers have been captivated by the stories of the experiences that Harry shares with his friends – Ron and Hermoine – at their school. These stories, and many others, are exemplary in their depictions of the challenges and opportunities associated with friendship for early adolescent boys and girls. The challenges and opportunities posed by friendship in early adolescence have been well recognized by developmental psychologists. Research on friendship has been a mainstay of research on social development for more than a century (Bukowski & Sippola, 2005). This research has been motivated by multiple interests. Three research goals have been especially prominent: (a) to identify what friendship consists of, (b) to assess how friendship affects development and well-being, and (c) to examine the intersection between friendship and risk status. Attention has been devoted to each of these goals. Insofar as one needs to know what one is studying before it can be measured in a way that would reveal its developmental significance, attempts to identify the features of friendship have typically preceded efforts to identify the effects of friendship and its association with risk. Accordingly these three research streams have not run completely in parallel. Instead, research on the features of friendship has preceded research on the general effects of friendship, which, in turn has informed research on friendship and risk.",,,,Adolescent Vulnerabilities and Opportunities,"Eric Amsel, Judith Smetana",,2011-09-19,2011,2011-10-07,2011-09-19,,,159-181,Closed,Chapter,"Bukowski, William M.; Simard, Melissa; Dubois, Marie Eve; Lopez, Luz Stella","Bukowski, William M.

This evidence became observable in the shell mounds of Southern Brazil (Gaspar et al. 2008; Lima 1999–2000), Uruguay (Castiñeira et al. 2010; Inda et al. 2006), and Patagonia (Borella and Favier Dubois 2009; ómez Otero 2007; Moreno 2008; Sanguinetti de Bórmida 1999, among others). Moreover, in the island zone of Southern Patagonia, the Beagle Channel, and the Magallanian Strait were inhabited by coastal populations that also formed shell mounds. These societies were adapted to the exploitation of marine fauna with special technological equipment prepared for that purpose (i.e., harpoons and canoes) (Legoupil 2003; Orquera and Piana 1999; Vila et al. 1995; Zangrando 2009). Unlike the Atlantic sector, the Pacific coast of South America shows that maritime adaptations are very nearly as old as the presence of human groups in the continent (Sandweiss 2008:145).

750,pub.1020437917,10.1007/978-3-642-20496-8_5,,,A Darwinian Account of Self and Free Will,"A Darwinian account can reinterpret Llinas’ and Dennett’s neurobiological claims against the existence of the self, as well as several experiments by Nielson, Walter, Libet and Wegner that conclude that free will, like the self, is an illusion. And it can then serve to examine critically several important brain-imaging studies of self knowledge. For Llinas there is no centralizing “organ” in the brain, no tangible self. The self is a form of perception, ultimately an invention of the brain. For Dennett the self is an abstract center of narrative gravity. Both Llinas and Dennett assume that the self, if it exists, should be a Cartesian, conscious self. Nevertheless, since most of the brain’s cognitive functions are unconscious, the self should also be mostly unconscious. To survive, any organism needs to demarcate self from other. In more complex organisms, meeting that need requires the coordination of external information with information about the internal states of the organism. Such coordination, to be useful, must take into account the previous experience of the organism, as well as its genetic inheritance in the form, say, of basic emotions that will guide it to survive, reproduce, etc., as Damasio argues. Experience must be interpreted on the basis of what the organism takes itself to be, a mostly subconscious task assigned mainly to the brain. The brain has evolved, then, to function as a self. The issue of free will is not about having a little “prime mover” in residence but, as Watson argues, about whether our selves determine our actions. And since free will would be merely the means by which the mostly unconscious self determines its own actions, our free will should be rooted in unconscious processes as well. Now, if consciousness of the self is a sort of internal perception, then we should expect certain perceptual illusions (which can be explained by a Darwinian strategy of adaptation). This Darwinian approach also challenges the account of the self in terms of declarative memories, particularly episodic memories, prevalent in psychology and experimental neuroscience.",,,The Frontiers Collection,Evolution 2.0,"Martin Brinkworth, Friedel Weinert",,2011-07-12,2011,2011-07-12,2012,,,43-63,Closed,Chapter,"Munevar, Gonzalo","Munevar, Gonzalo (Humanities and Social Sciences, Lawrence Technological University, 21000 W.

libraries; however, through Google Scholar (GS) it is possible to determine
their use by the community. Between the years of 2003 and 2007 a classification
of 185 Colombian journals indexed in the Colombian National Bibliographical
Index (IBNP) was performed using the information provided by GS, basing
categorization on size indicators, indexation and citation. The indicators were
analyzed by grouping the journals in two general areas: sciences and social
sciences. In each area, the indicators provided by the digital libraries
Scopus, Redalyc and Scielo were compared. Additionally, the indicators provided
by IBNP journals categories (A1, A2, B and C) were also compared. The sciences
and social sciences had a similar pattern in their indicators. The existence of
positive correlations was established between some indicators and they
predicted that the number of citations per journal in GS and the h index
depends on its visibility in GS and Scopus. We put forward that the current
IBNP categories (A1, A2, B or C) faintly reflect the use of journals by the
community and we propose a classification based on the h index as an infometric
indicator, which reflects not only its visibility in Google Scholar, but also
its inclusion in certain international digital libraries, particularly Scopus.
Our results may be applied to the creation of public policies regarding science

In the Magdalena River, many anthropogenic influences, including a forest decrease by 40% in a 20-year period, an agricultural and pasture increase of 65%, poor practices of soil conservation and mining, and increasing rates of urbanization, may have accounted for the overall increasing trends in sediment load on a regional scale. These increasing trends in sediment load coincide with the overall decline of live coral cover in a 145km2 coral reef complex in the Caribbean Sea, the Rosario Islands. After three decades of sampling, live coral cover remaining in the area is only 23%. In the Pacific coast, the diversion of the Patía River has caused major environmental impacts, including distributary channel erosion, sediment deposition, mangrove die-off, delta-front erosion, changes in fishing resources, transportation and communication difficulties, and changes in lifestyles. This is the most impressive environmental change documented for any coastal system along the western coast of South America. The synthesis presented in this chapter is just the first step toward understanding the natural and human-induced factors that have produced the observed patterns of water discharge and sediment load into Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Colombia and to relating these processes to the impact on coastal ecosystems.",,,,Treatise on Estuarine and Coastal Science,,,2011,2011,,2011,,,289-314,Closed,Chapter,"Restrepo, J.D.; Alvarado, E.M.","Restrepo, J.D.

Each country has made a significant effort in providing basic legal texts, such as codes, laws and decrees, in a systematic, searchable, and reliable database. Jurisprudence of the courts, whose significance varies widely among these countries steeped in the civil law tradition, is often less accessible. Some countries have more means and better infrastructure than others which, naturally, is reflected in the quality of the databases, search engines, and archives. Most of these countries have enacted transparency laws to which all government entities are subjected. Countries with laws pertaining to transparency in order of strength of law are: Chile (2008), Peru (2002), Ecuador (2004), Uruguay (2008), Colombia (1985), Argentina (2003 decree), and Bolivia (2005 decree). These transparency laws do not only pertain to budget, fiscal responsibility, and political accountability, but also to free public access to legal information. The transparency laws from both Peru and Ecuador, for example, are entitled, Law of Transparency and Access to Information, and obligate government entities to be proactive in making legal information freely accessible. In the following report, the transparency laws are briefly discussed at the beginning of each country report. The focus of this overall project, however, is not specifically on whether a country has laws governing transparency and access to information, but rather, whether a country is indeed making available to its citizens free, current, reliable, official, and authentic legal information in a way that is easy to find, access, obtain, and read.

This method has new applications in nonmetallic minerals such as saltpeter and soil remediation. Although a number of experimental studies have been carried out as well as modeling, which allows better understanding of the phenomena and its operation, few studies have been carried out with the objective of optimizing the process. Most of the studies which consider optimization, either experimentally or through the use of models, have been done from a technical perspective. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for the design and planning of the heap leaching circuit. A superstructure which includes a number of alternative circuits is proposed. Then a mathematical model is developed that represents the constraints of the system and maximizes the profits. An example is considered to validate the proposed methodology.

Usually, the component to be separated is distributed with different concentrations into different particle sizes, showing different levels of recovery by size and concentration. Other times, we want to selectively remove more than one value component, taking advantage of differences in the components floatability at different values of pH and pulp potential. In literature, several methods for the design of these circuits have been presented. These methodologies can be classified among those that use heuristics and those that use mathematical optimization techniques. However, none of these options is used actually in industry. This is, the former is very simple to incorporate the complexities of the problem and the latter requires more specialized training for the designer.In this work, we use a sensitivity analysis to analyze and design separation circuits. We study the effect of each stage on the general circuit, identifying relationships between the recovery of each stage and the global recovery of the circuit. Based on these results, we propose a novel methodology to analyze and design separation circuits. This new method can be regarded as hybrid, since it uses a mathematical analysis, coupled with the experience of the designer.

For those minutiae triangles candidates for fingerprint matching, the texture information is extracted from the original raw image localized inside the triangle using Local Binary Patterns techniques (LBP). The preliminary results have shown that the merging technique is fairly robust for genuine fingerprint matching discrimination, reducing thus the error rate for FRR and FAR and the time comparison between fingerprint in the verification and/or identification process. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm is effective and reliable. Tests were conducted from the database BD1 and BD2 of FVC2002 competition, obtaining an EER of 6.18% and 3.17% respectively.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, Computer Vision, and Applications","César San Martin, Sang-Woon Kim",,2011,2011,,2011,7042,,692-700,All OA; Bronze,Chapter,"Chau, Alejandro Chau; Soto, Carlos Pon","Chau, Alejandro Chau (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Soto, Carlos Pon (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Chau, Alejandro Chau (Catholic University of the North); Soto, Carlos Pon (Catholic University of the North)",8,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-25085-9_82.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011203533,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

We review state-of-the-art approaches to gender classification and confirm that their performance drops significantly when classifying young or elderly faces. We hypothesize that this is caused by the existence of dependencies among the demographic variables that were not considered in traditional gender classifiers. In the paper we confirm experimentally the existence of such dependencies between age and gender variables. We also prove that the performance of gender classifiers can be improved by considering the dependencies with age in a multi-dimensional approach. The performance improvement is most prominent for young and elderly faces.,,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, Computer Vision, and Applications","César San Martin, Sang-Woon Kim",,2011,2011,,2011,7042,,264-271,All OA; Bronze,Chapter,"Bekios-Calfa, Juan; Buenaposada, José M.; Baumela, Luis","Bekios-Calfa, Juan (Dept. de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

The next logical step is to place this work into the context of an integrated software process for security engineering from design through enforcement. Towards this goal, we promote a secure software engineering process that leverages an extended unified modeling language (UML) to visualize COD/AWF policies to achieve a solution that separates concerns while still providing the means to securely engineer dynamic collaborations for applications such as the PCMH.

This fitting process is very expensive in terms of computational resources and prone to get stuck in local minima. This makes it impractical for analysing faces in resource limited computing devices. In this paper we build a face age regressor that is able to work directly on faces cropped using a state-of-the-art face detector. Our procedure uses K nearest neighbours (K-NN) regression with a metric based on a properly tuned Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) projection matrix. On FG-NET we achieve a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.72 years with manually aligned faces. Using face images cropped by a face detector we get a MAE of 6.87 years in the same database. Moreover, most of the algorithms presented in the literature have been evaluated on single database experiments and therefore, they report optimistically biased results. In our cross-database experiments we get a MAE of roughly 12 years, which would be the expected performance in a real world application.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis,"Jordi Vitrià, João Miguel Sanches, Mario Hernández",,2011,2011,,2011,6669,,281-288,Closed,Chapter,"Bekios-Calfa, Juan; Buenaposada, José M.; Baumela, Luis","Bekios-Calfa, Juan (Dept. de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

stellar populations (MSPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). Studying MSPs
and their accumulated data can shed more light on the formation and evolution
of GGCs and other closely related fundamental problems. We focus on the strong
relation between the radial distribution of evolutionary homogeneous stars and
their U-based photometric characteristics in the nearby GGC NGC 6752 and
compare this with a similar relation we found in NGC 3201 and NGC 1261. We use
our new multi-color photometry in a fairly wide field of NGC 6752, with
particular emphasis on the U band and our recent and already published
photometry made in NGC 3201 and NGC 1261. We found and report here for the
first time a strong difference in the radial distribution between the
sub-populations of red giant branch (RGB) stars that are bluer and redder in
color U-B, as well as between sub-giant branch (SGB) stars brighter and fainter
in the U-magnitude in NGC 6752. Moreover, the fainter SGB and redder RGB stars
are similarly much more centrally concentrated than their respective brighter
and bluer counterparts. Virtually the same applies to NGC 3201. We find
evidence in NGC 6752 as in NGC 3201 that a dramatic change in the proportion of
the two sub-populations of SGB and RGB stars occurs at a radial distance close
to the half-mass radius, R_h, of the cluster. These results are the first
detections of the radial trend of the particular photometric properties of
stellar populations in GGCs. They imply a radial dependence of the main
characteristics of the stellar populations in these GGCs, primarily of the
abundance, and (indirectly) presumably of the kinematics.",,,arXiv,,,,2011-01-26,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kravtsov, V.; Alcaino, G.; Marconi, G.; Alvarado, F.","Kravtsov, V.

One of them is cataclysmic variable stars (CV). These phenomena must be studied through indirect observation techniques, since modern instruments are not able to directly obtain information about their structure and behavior. One of such techniques, Doppler tomography, uses a search algorithm to generate an image, called tomogram that depicts the relevant structures of a cataclysmic variable star. One important drawback of this algorithm is that it lacks any criteria to decide when to stop the search. This paper proposes an approach to automatically stop the algorithm based on the quality of the tomogram. The approach is to process each tomogram with the Sobel operator and then calculate the standard deviation (SD) of the result. The SD values of all of the tomograms generated during the search are introduced into a feed-forward neural network that indicates which tomograms have the best scientific quality. The neural network training data was created with the assessment of an expert astronomer.",,,,2011 6th Colombian Computing Congress (CCC),,,2011-05,2011,,,,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.; Unda-Sanzana, Eduardo; Alfaro, Italo","Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.

The Cantor example of Chap. 5.3 and random perturbations of hyperbolic rational functions like the examples considered by Brück and Büger are typical random maps that we consider now.

Dynamics of the hospitality sector of each region is represented by the evolution of its economic efficiency. The investigation involves the following steps: a static Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the pure economic efficiency; two different notions of distances between time series and hierarchical clustering techniques are used to classify the economies in the sample. By using a correlation-based distance, three main clusters are detected, while two clusters are identified when the average distance is used. The trend patterns, identified by employing the correlation distance, can be interpreted in terms of exogenous factors that influence the economic efficiency of the group of regions, causing shocks picked up by the high volatility as well as structural breaks. By employing the average distance, one infers information on the cluster that have had similar efficiency values over the period under analysis. This efficiency can be also interpreted in terms of a particular type of hospitality management as well as the firm structure. Following the analysis, some policy and management implications are presented.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2011,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Brida, Juan Gabriel; Deidda, Manuela; Garrido, Nicolas; Pulina, Manuela","Brida, Juan Gabriel (Universidad de la República); Deidda, Manuela (Free University of Bolzano - Competence Centre in Tourism Management and Tourism Economics (TOMTE); Universita di Cagliari - Centre for North South Economic Research (CRENOS)); Garrido, Nicolas (Universidad Católica del Norte - Departamento de Economía); Pulina, Manuela (University of Sassari - Faculty of Economics (DEIR) - CRENoS; Economic Research Centre North South (CRENOS))",,"Brida, Juan Gabriel (University of the Republic); Deidda, Manuela (Free University of Bolzano - Competence Centre in Tourism Management and Tourism Economics (TOMTE); Universita di Cagliari - Centre for North South Economic Research (CRENOS)); Garrido, Nicolas (Catholic University of the North); Pulina, Manuela (University of Sassari)",0,0,,0.0,https://crenos.unica.it/crenos/sites/default/files/WP11-17_0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102322271,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 38 Economics",

In Maharaj itself, the appellant was committed for a term of imprisonment for contempt of court arising from an order made by a High Court Judge in violation of the principles of fundamental justice, and the State was held liable in damages. The damage in this case emanated from the deprivation of the right to personal liberty guaranteed the appellant by the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago. In its more recent decision in Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago v Ramanoop, the Privy Council however added a new dimension to claims for constitutional damages. In that case, a police officer patently abused his office in a naked show of police power in violation of a citizen’s right to personal liberty. The question was whether exemplary damages could be awarded by way of redress for contravention of the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. In holding that an 'additional award' rather than exemplary damages should be made in this case, the Privy Council made pronouncements which were to influence one way or another, the determination of the claim of the plaintiff in the subsequent case of James v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago. Here, two important issues arose in the consideration as to whether damages should be awarded in the event of a constitutional breach. The first is whether damage must be proved. The second is whether a constitutional breach requires to be marked by an award of damages.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2011,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Okpaluba, C.","Okpaluba, C.

Industrial participation and countertrade have remained surprisingly resilient as methods of public procurement exercises and potential means of leveraging technology transfers and economic and industrial development. However, analyzing the impact of such programmes and deciphering their myths (Balakrishnan and Matthews 2009) are challenges to the relevant state agencies, industry practitioners and scholars alike.

Healers seek to help patients understand the sociocultural basis of their health conditions, and how they can recognize, activate, or utilize resources and/or support systems necessary to alleviate their suffering. Treatment modalities include relaxation techniques, use of herbs, psychocultural education, dream interpretation, storytelling, use of proverbs, cleansing, libation, music, and ceremonies. In this chapter, we consider the importance of indigenous healing systems, history of research into traditional health care in Africa, national and international influences on African indigenous healing systems, current practices, legal and professional issues, and issues for research on African indigenous healing systems. LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to: Define indigenous healing. Outline traditionalist African core beliefs about health and well-being. Discuss the major approaches and techniques to healing by indigenous healers and their rationale. Differentiate among consultation procedures with African indigenous healers. Evaluate prospective areas of research that would advance knowledge of African indigenous healing systems. INTRODUCTION Through the ages, human societies have developed systems for responding to health problems and for improving the quality of life. As evidence, every region of the world has a form of traditional or indigenous healing system, either formal or nonformal (Gielen, Fish, & Draguns, 2004; Harley, 2006). The World Health Organization (WHO, 1978, 2001) defined traditional healing as knowledge and practices, whether explicable or not, used in the diagnosis, prevention, and elimination of physical, mental, and social imbalance and relying exclusively on practical experiences and observations handed down from generation to generation, mostly verbally, but also, to some limited extent, in writing.",,,,Counseling People of African Ancestry,Elias Mpofu,,2011-06-27,2011,2011-08-05,2011-06-27,,,3-21,Closed,Chapter,"Mpofu, Elias; Peltzer, Karl; Bojuwoye, Olaniyi","Mpofu, Elias (); Peltzer, Karl (); Bojuwoye, Olaniyi ()",,"Mpofu, Elias (); Peltzer, Karl (); Bojuwoye, Olaniyi ()",39,6,,7.01,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050721265,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 44 Human Society,3 Good Health and Well Being

1155-1760 A of the Seyfert 1 Mrk 509 obtained simultaneously with a
Chandra/LETGS spectrum as part of a multiwavelength campaign in 2009 that
included observations with XMM-Newton, SWIFT, and Integral. Our high S/N
spectrum detects additional complexity in the absorption troughs from a variety
of sources in Mrk 509, including the outflow from the active nucleus, the ISM
and halo of the host galaxy, and infalling clouds or stripped gas from a merger
that are illuminated by the AGN. Variability between the STIS and COS
observation of the -400 km/s component allows us to set an upper limit on its
distance of < 250 pc. Similarly, variability of a component at +150 km/s
between two prior FUSE observations limits its distance to < 1.5 kpc. The UV
absorption only partially covers the emission from the AGN nucleus. Covering
fractions are lower than those previously seen with STIS, and are comparable to
those seen with FUSE. Given the larger apertures of COS and FUSE compared to
STIS, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the AGN as the
explanation for the partial covering. As observed in prior X-ray and UV
spectra, the UV absorption has velocities comparable to the X-ray absorption,
but the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state with
lower total column density than the gas responsible for the X-ray absorption.
We conclude that the outflow from the active nucleus is a multiphase wind.",,,arXiv,,,,2011-07-04,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kriss, G. A.; Arav, N.; Kaastra, J.

Land remains a highly emotive issue in South Africa and the bulk of government strategies to restructure the agricultural sector since 1994 have revolved around land. How these strategies are being implemented and how they fit into the broader and more comprehensive land reform programme are interesting discussion points. This chapter reviews the land reform programme and how the various components, namely land redistribution, land restitution and tenure reform, are being implemented and what obstacles are in the way of achieving the target goal of transferring 30% of land previously owned by the white population to the black people as a way of redressing past wrongs.

The assessment has two main components or dimensions: the evaluation of UNDP’s contribution to development results in Chile and the Agency’s strategic positioning. It offers a synthesis of the context in its multiple dimensions: political, socioeconomic, human development, environmental and energy. This synthesis provides a framework for the treatment of the role of the United Nations system and of UNDP Chile during the period examined. The book illustrates the contributions of UNDP to development results and reviews UNDP’s strategic positioning.

Until recently, however, archaeologists believed that marine economies did not develop until the end of the Pleistocene, when the archaeological record begins to have evidence of marine life as part of the human diet. This has long been interpreted as a postglacial adaptation, due to the rise in sea level and subsequent decrease in terrestrial resources. Coastal resources, particularly mollusks, were viewed as fallback resources, which people resorted to only when terrestrial resources were scarce, included only as part of a more complex diet. Recent research has significantly altered this understanding, known as the Broad Spectrum Revolution (BSR) model. The contributions to this volume revise the BSR model, with evidence that coastal resources were an important part of human economies and subsistence much earlier than previously thought, and even the main focus of diets for some Pleistocene and early Holocene hunter-gatherer societies. With evidence from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, this volume comprehensively lends a new understanding to coastal settlement from the Middle Paleolithic to the Middle Holocene.",,,Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology,,"Nuno F.

Today, in many countries, it has to grapple with diversity and differences brought about by migration and changes in gender relations. Questions of values, human rights and the role of religions are raised. In this book scholars from Sweden, Norway, Germany, Great Britain, Canada, Namibia and South Africa discuss the issues above. Similarities as well as differences are highlighted. The varied contributors engage in a North-South dialogue. Among the questions addressed are: Can the Scandinavian countries be understood as more religious than their up-to-date, seemingly secularist reputation has led us to believe? How do some European, Muslim, Christian and secular pupils understand the religious education they receive? Could a global citizenship education, with a gendered understanding as an integral part, be accomplished? ‘Diversity’ and ‘social justice’: what does it take to theoretically integrate these two crucial parameters in education, in South Africa, and in Sweden? The role of religious and values education under changing circumstances is explored through the diverse contributions, that also challenge the hegemony of a Western understanding of democracy, among other values. The purpose of this is to assess what could now constitute global educational common ground.",,,,,"Karin Sporre, Jan Mannberg",,2011,2011,,2011,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,0,,3.14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034638409,44 Human Society; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies,4 Quality Education
53,pub.1108760095,10.1075/tsl.95,,,"Creoles, their Substrates, and Language Typology","Since creole languages draw their properties from both their substrate and superstrate sources, the typological classification of creoles has long been a major issue for creolists, typologists, and linguists in general. Several contradictory proposals have been put forward in the literature. For example, creole languages typologically pair with their superstrate languages (Chaudenson 2003), with their substrate languages (Lefebvre 1998), or even, creole languages are alike (Bickerton 1984) such that they constitute a “definable typological class” (McWhorter 1998). This book contains 25 chapters bearing on detailed comparisons of some 30 creoles and their substrate languages. As the substrate languages of these creoles are typologically different, the detailed investigation of substrate features in the creoles leads to a particular answer to the question of how creoles should be classified typologically. The bulk of the data show that creoles reproduce the typological features of their substrate languages. This argues that creoles cannot be claimed to constitute a definable typological class.",,,Typological Studies in Language,,Claire Lefebvre,,2011-02-11,2011,2011-02-11,2011-02-17,95,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,27,0,,13.86,http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstreams/04206e37-601d-49cb-904d-aaa22ff63e29/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108760095,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

What processes of knowledge exchange are most effective for increasing the uses of research results? How can research-produced knowledge be better ‘mobilized’ among users such as practicing educators, policy makers, and the public communities? These sorts of questions are commanding urgent attention in educational discourses and research policies now circulating around the world. This attention has been translated into powerful material exercises that shape what is considered to be worthwhile research and how research is funded, recognized, and assessed. Yet precisely what activities constitute effective knowledge mobilization, or even what is meant by ‘moving knowledge’, remains unclear. What politics are at play in determining knowledge ‘impact’ across radically different contexts? Who determines what counts as impact, and for what purposes? How are ‘results’ of educational research separated from its participants and processes? In addition knowledge mobilization also invokes debates about the languages through which knowledge is constructed, policy processes are enacted, and research unfolds. This volume is unique in bringing together these wide-ranging issues of knowledge mobilization in education. The volume editors critically analyse these complex issues and also describe various efforts of knowledge mobilization and their effects. While the contributors themselves speak from diverse material, occupational and theoretical locations. Leading scholars in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia bring disciplinary perspectives from law, digital media studies, museum studies, journalism and policy-making as well as fields of education.

In most regions, it contributes only a small part to the overall meat and food supply, but for reasons of animal welfare and sustainability it is sometimes considered an alternative to meat from farmed animals. Despite differences in game species, ante mortem conditions (free-range or fenced; wild or semi-domesticated), hunting or harvesting procedures and further handling of the carcass, there are common requirements as regards meat safety and quality. Whereas meat hygiene and safety have been an issue in game meat for export/import for a long time, primary production, domestic supply and direct supply to the consumer have recently been addressed by legislation and these sectors still present unresolved questions and challenges. This book combines 24 contributions presenting the view of experts in game meat hygiene and quality. They address four main topics: i.e. 'hygiene and microbiology', 'epidemiology', 'risk assessment and management' and 'muscle biology and meat quality'. In addition to contributions on this topic by authors from eight European countries, a South African perspective is provided, thus representing the standpoint of a major game meat exporter. This volume is the first in a series on safety and quality assurance along the game meat chain, following a 'from forest to fork' approach and is targeted at scientists in academia and industry, graduate students as well as at governmental officials in veterinary public health and food safety.",,,,,"P.

                  This book enters into the many worlds of expression brought forth across Africa by the ravaging presence of HIV/AIDS. Africans and non-Africans, physicians and social scientists, journalists and documentarians share here a common and essential interest in understanding creative expression in crushing and uncertain times. Chapters investigate and engage the social networks, power relationships, and cultural structures that enable the arts to convey messages of hope and healing, and of knowledge and good counsel to the wider community. And from Africa to the wider world, the text here brings intimate, inspiring portraits of the performers, artists, communities, and organizations that have shared here their insights and the sense they have made of their lives and actions from deep within this devastating epidemic. Covering the wide expanse of the African continent, the chapters include explorations of, for example, the use of music to cope with AIDS; the relationship between music, HIV/AIDS, and social change; visual approaches to HIV literacy; radio and television as tools for “edutainment”; several individual artists’ confrontations with HIV/AIDS; various performance groups’ response to the epidemic; combating HIV/AIDS with local cultural performance; and more. Source material, such as song lyrics and interviews, weaves throughout the collection, which is a nuanced and profoundly affective portrayal of the intricate relationship between HIV/AIDS and the arts in Africa.",,,,,"Gregory Barz, Judah Cohen",,2011-11-03,2011,2015-05-27,2011-11-03,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,47,4,,27.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108780154,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

The proposed approach takes into account the analysis of the signals that could be acquired from modern on-board diagnostic systems (OBD-II), global positioning systems (GPS) and other localization sensors. Diagnosis of erratic driving could be essential to reduce accident rates, because of several applications that may result based on it. The overall process can be summarized in three steps. First, extraction of suitable signals (throttle, brake, steering, velocity, location) related to driver actions. Secondly, mathematical processing of the above signals for a proper utilization by the intelligent system. Finally, driving faults detection and overall performance rating based on artificial neural networks. Experimental results show the feasibility and reliability of the proposed approach in different driving situations.",,,,2010 IEEE ANDESCON,,,2010-09,2010,,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Quintero, G.

A numerical model including hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphological updating was constructed using Delft3D. This was implemented in order to design river training structures that would deepen the navigation channel to the port, allowing it to accommodate larger ships and become more competitive in the region. The existing model was enhanced and re-validated to conditions during the project construction. It was then employed to re-evaluate and modify the structural design during construction of the system. It was found that the response of the system to the construction was slightly different than was originally expected and the design was modified to incorporate this response. This adaptive modeling approach can be useful in determining the most effective design for projects with a phased construction.",,,,Estuarine and Coastal Modeling (2009),,,2010-09-27,2010,2012-04-26,2010-09-27,,,566-581,Closed,Proceeding,"Schmied, L.; Cañizares, R.","Schmied, L.

The program, called RIDMD (Robotic Inverse Dynamic Modeling Deduction), is an application of Newton-Euler (NE) Recursive Methods to the derivation of closed form dynamic equations of robots, considered as a group of rigid bodies connected by suitable single degree-of-freedom (DOF) joints. The general procedure implemented in the program in order to calculated the model, begin estimating the Denavit-Hartenberg parameter, selecting a frame attached to each link of the robot arm and calculating the transformation matrix, which is a homogeneous transformation matrix that expresses the position and orientation of consecutives frames of reference for the robot. In addition, the kinematic inicial condition for the first link is determinate, and the kinematic variables transformation is developed, for prismatic or sliding joint. Finally, the force and torque transformation is solved with the program, which is transparent to the user and allows the symbolic calculation of dynamical models until five DOF.Copyright © 2010 by ASME",,,,"Volume 11: New Developments in Simulation Methods and Software for Engineering Applications; Safety Engineering, Risk Analysis and Reliability Methods; Transportation Systems",,,2010-01-01,2010,2012-04-30,2010-01-01,,,187-192,Closed,Proceeding,"Valencia, Guillermo E.; Turizo, John C.; Sanjuan, Marco E.","Valencia, Guillermo E.

This research is centered on the studies about formation process of the mixture in the intake system in a turbocharger dual engine. In this study the transport equations are established, it is associated to the fluids which enter to the intake engine during a period of engine operation. This model is simulated by means of CFD tools, using an electronic injector to provide natural gas. Also it is considered the fluidynamic behavior of mixture. Finally an experimental design applied to the simulations is made with the goal of optimize operational conditions of the injector that allow to get the most homogeneous mixture on the inlet runner to one of the cylinders engine. This mixture was obtained injecting natural gas at a pressure of 10 bars and placing the injector as close to the intake manifold.Copyright © 2010 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2010 4th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Volume 1",,,2010-01-01,2010,2010-12-22,2010-01-01,,,747-759,Closed,Proceeding,"Bermejo, Fabio A.; Corredor, Lesme A.","Bermejo, Fabio A.

From the top-down perspective, our algorithm applies shape priors probabilistically to candidate image regions obtained by pedestrian detection, and provides accurate estimates of the human body areas which serve as important constraints for bottom-up processing. Temporal propagation of the identified region is performed with bottom-up cues in an efficient level-set framework, which takes advantage of the sparse top-down information that is available. Our formulation also optimizes the extracted human volume across frames through belief propagation and provides temporally coherent human regions. We demonstrate the ability of our method to extract human body regions efficiently and automatically from a large, challenging dataset collected from YouTube.","We thank internal and external reviewers for their comments on our work.

1523,pub.1094209076,10.1109/latincom.2010.5641018,,,An Optimal Solution to the MCDS problem for Topology Construction in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Topology Construction (TC) is a very well-known technique to save energy and extend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. One common approach to implement TC is to select a small subset of nodes that can accomplish the global objective of the network and put the rest of the nodes in a low energy consumption mode to use their energy in the future. One way to select this subset of nodes is by solving the Minimum Connected Dominating Set problem (MCDS). This paper presents a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation that finds the optimal solution to this problem. The formulation is proposed as a benchmarking tool to compare the performance of existing and new heuristics that approximate the solution to the same problem. In fact, the paper compares the performance of three well- known CDS-based topology construction protocols versus the MIP-MCDS formulation. The results show that, in terms of the size of the CDS, the distance between the optimal and the approximate solutions increases with the communication radius and the number of nodes. In terms of the solution time, for low density and high node degree topologies the mathematical programming formulation is comparable, and sometimes better, to that of the heuristics. However, in topologies with low node degree and high node density the heuristic solutions outperform the mathematical programming solution.",,,,2010 IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications,,,2010-09,2010,,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Wightman, Pedro M.; Fabregas, Aldo; Labrador, Miguel A.","Wightman, Pedro M.

The period of analysis comprehends second quarters of the continuous household surveys between 2001 and 2005, for 13 cities and metropolitan areas. We find evidence that unemployment duration has a positive effect on the probability of being an informal worker in Colombia. Household heads have a lower probability of being informal, due in great part to the fact that their social security affiliation guarantees her family access to health services.

Monetary authorities have traditionally used a Monetary Conditions Index, which is a weighted average between the interest rate and the exchange rate, in order to assess the conditions of the market to determine the correspondent changes in policy. Goodhart (2001) proposed a Financial Condition index for the G-7 countries where some weight could be assigned to asset prices and housing prices. This Financial Conditions Index is found by using a reduced form coefficient estimates and a VAR model. This paper pretends to find this Financial conditions Index for a group of middle income countries. The idea is to compare the role of asset prices in less developed economies in forecasting inflation. It has been found that the effect of financial assets is small, but housing prices are particularly important in most of them, especially Mexico, Turkey and Colombia.

The p-Cycle is a novel protection approach based on pre-configured cycles to provide a fast recovery for single link failure. The optimal selection of cycles is the central problem to get a high protection performance of p-Cycle approach. In that sense, the importance of the length of a cycle for fast restoration is studied in this paper, because it affects directly the quality of restoration, therefore, the quality-of-service can be affected. This paper proposes a new heuristic approach and a new evaluation metric to solve the p-Cycle protection problem which simultaneously optimizes cost, protection, length and fairness of solutions in a mono-objective approach.

population in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) NGC 3201, which is irregularly
reddened across its face. We carried out a more detailed and careful analysis
of our recently published new multi-color photometry in a wide field of the
cluster with particular emphasis on the U band. Using the photometric data
corrected for differential reddening, we found for the first time two key signs
of the inhomogeneity in the cluster's stellar population and of its radial
variation in the GC. These are (1) an obvious trend in the color-position
diagram, based on the (U-B) color-index, of red giant branch (RGB) stars, which
shows that the farther from the cluster's center, the bluer on average the
(U-B) color of the stars is; and (2) the dependence of the radial distribution
of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in the cluster on their U magnitude, where
brighter stars are less centrally concentrated than their fainter counterparts
at a confidence level varying between 99.2% and 99.9% depending on the
color-index used to select the stars. The same effects were recently found by
us in the GC NGC 1261. However, contrary to NGC 1261, we are not able to
unambiguously suggest which of the sub-populations of SGB/RGB stars can be the
progenitor of blue and red horizontal branch stars of the cluster. Apart from
M4, NGC 3201 is another GC very probably with an inhomogeneous stellar
population, which has essentially lower mass than the most massive Galactic GCs

288,pub.1118317662,10.48550/arxiv.1005.1244,,,Orbital motion of the young brown dwarf companion TWA 5 B,"With more adaptive optics images available, we aim at detecting orbital
motion for the first time in the system TWA 5 A+B. We measured separation and
position angle between TWA 5 A and B in each high-resolution image available
and followed their change in time, because B should orbit around A. The
astrometric measurement precision is about one milli arc sec. With ten year
difference in epoch, we can clearly detect orbital motion of B around A, a
decrease in separation by ~ 0.0054 arc sec per year and a decrease in position
angle by ~ 0.26 degrees per year. TWA 5 B is a brown dwarf with ~ 25 Jupiter
masses (Neuhäuser et al. 2000), but having large error bars (4 to 145 Jupiter
masses, Neuhäuser et al. 2009). Given its large projected separation from the
primary star, ~ 86 AU, and its young age ~ 10 Myrs), it has probably formed
star-like, and would then be a brown dwarf companion. Given the relatively
large changes in separation and position angle between TWA 5 A and B, we can
conclude that they orbit around each other on an eccentric orbit. Some evidence
is found for a curvature in the orbital motion of B around A - most consistent
with an elliptic (e=0.45) orbit. Residuals around the best-fit ellipse are
detected and show a small-amplitude (~ 18 mas) periodic sinusoid with ~ 5.7 yr
period, i.e., fully consistent with the orbit of the inner close pair TWA 5
Aa+b. Measuring these residuals caused by the photocenter wobble - even in
unresolved images - can yield the total mass of the inner pair, so can test
theoretical pre-main sequence models.",,,arXiv,,,,2010-05-07,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Neuhäuser, R.; Schmidt, T. O. B.; Hambaryan, V. V.; Vogt, N.","Neuhäuser, R.

its photometric properties and characteristics, in the rarely studied southern
Galactic globular cluster NGC 1261. We focus on the brighter sequences of the
cluster's color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Like in our previous works, we rely
upon photometry in several passbands to achieve more reliable results and
conclusions. We carried out and analyzed new multi-color photometry of NGC 1261
in UBVI reaching below the turnoff point in all passbands in a fairly extended
cluster field, about 14'x14'. We found several signs of the inhomogeneity
(""multiplicity"") in the stellar population. The most prominent of them are: (1)
the dependence of the radial distribution of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in
the cluster on their U magnitude, with brighter stars less centrally
concentrated at the 99.9 \% level than their fainter counterparts; (2) the
dependence of the location of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the U-(U-B) CMD
on their radial distance from the cluster center, with the portion of stars
bluer in the (U-B) color increasing towards the cluster outskirts.
Additionally, the radial variation of the RGB luminosity function in the bump
region is suspected. We assume that both the SGB stars brighter in the U and
the RGB stars bluer in the (U-B) color are probably associated with blue
horizontal branch stars, because of a similarity in their radial distribution
in the cluster. We estimated the metalicity of NGC 1261 from the slope of the
RGB in U-based CMDs and the location of the RGB bump on the branch. These
metallicity indicators give [Fe/H]zw = -1.34 +/- 0.16 dex and [Fe/H]zw = -1.41
+/- 0.10 dex, respectively. We isolated 18 probable blue straggler candidates.
They are more centrally concentrated than the lower red giants of comparable
brightness at the 97.9 \% level.",,,arXiv,,,,2010-04-30,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kravtsov, V.; Alcaino, G.; Marconi, G.; Alvarado, F.","Kravtsov, V.

Although this system is likely to be severely affected by climate change, its response to current global warming is still uncertain. In this paper we analyze 10–166 year old sediments in two cores collected in Mejillones Bay, an anoxic sedimentary setting favorable for preservation of proxies. Based on a 166 year chronology we used indicators of bottom water oxygenation proxies (Mo, V, S, and the (lycopane+n-C35)/n-C31) ratio) and surface water productivity (biogenic opal, counts of diatom valves, biogenic Ba, organic carbon and chlorins) to reconstruct environmental variations in Mejillones Bay. We find that at decadal scales, and during the last two centuries, a shift in the coastal marine ecosystem off Northern Chile took place which was characterized by intense ENSO-like activity and large fluctuations in biological export productivity, in bottom water oxygenation, and increased eolic activity (inferred from Ti/Al and Zr/Al).

The history of state repression in the 1960s-1980s is particularly challenging to study, with many holes in the traditional accounts of events. Several dictatorships (especially military governments) emerged during this period dominated by the development of the Cold War and the consequences of the Cuban Revolution. Repressive regimes remained in power for decades, until internal and international changes allowed democracy to take over a firm hold. State terrorism included censorship, exile, detention, torture, murder, and forced disappearance. Written documents on political violence are scarce and fragmentary, with many of these sources deliberately destroyed by government authorities. New archaeological methods must be employed to reconstruct the history of the period, helping to disclose the silenced voice of victims, relatives and society as a whole. The contributions in this important volume show the socio-political commitment of Archaeology in Latin American to shed light on the specific case of dictatorship and repression in the region. The techniques described will also provide a valuable resource for archaeologists working to understand the nature of political violence worldwide and reconstruct other historical periods without reliable written sources.",,,Contributions To Global Historical Archaeology,,"Pedro Funari, Andres Zarankin, Melissa Salerno",,2010,2010,,2010,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,20,2,,9.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046743037,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The appearance of these students provides a particular challenge in the sciences where adequate grounding is crucial. One response to this challenge has been the provision of access, foundation or “second chance programmes” which operate on different models internationally. This book provides much-needed analysis from researchers in the field, examining the ways in which disadvantaged and underprepared science students learn, as well as which pedagogical approaches have been proven to be effective. The chapters explore the issues more generally before focusing on the ways in which equal opportunities to learn have been implemented in tertiary education in Southern Africa, where models include the provision of access, foundation or ‘second chance’ programmes that have opened the door to vast numbers of new students. In South Africa, where the push for equity has been strong since the demise of apartheid, programmes have been established at all tertiary institutions, with some of the most successful of these programmes based at universities characterised by a high research output. As a result, the last decade has seen a great deal of research into the effectiveness of these programmes both at a micro and macro level. This volume provides an examination of issues related to the programmes, their structure, student selection and adjustment. Issues such as the learning of these students, their communicative ability and laboratory work come under the spotlight. Although examining the issue internationally, the book draws heavily on lessons from South Africa where there has been considerable experience of such programmes.",,,,,,,2010,2010,,2010,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Rollnick, Marissa","Rollnick, Marissa (College of Science, University of Witwatersrand, Wits, South Africa)",,"Rollnick, Marissa (University of the Witwatersrand)",7,0,,1.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021161027,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education",4 Quality Education

The notion of 'real world' metaphor research has been developed to describe this important area of investigation. This book starts by describing the nature and scope of real world metaphor research and then illustrates, through 17 detailed, mainly empirically-based studies, the different areas it can apply to, and different methodologies that can be employed. Research problems are explored in areas such as artificial intelligence, language teaching and learning, reconciliation dialogue, university lecture discourse, poetry and wine description. Methods include corpus analysis, experimentation, discourse analysis, cross-cultural analysis and genre analysis. In each case the empirical studies refer back to Gibbs's opening overview of real-world research. The result is an invaluable and cross-referenced collection of papers addressing real-world problems.",,,Human Cognitive Processing,,"Graham Low, Zazie Todd, Alice Deignan, Lynne Cameron",,2010-10-13,2010,2010-10-26,2010-10-13,26,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,52,4,,20.5,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108543176,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

The call for papers attracted an absolute record of 1,174 submissions. We describe here the selection of the accepted papers: Thirty-eight area chairs were selected coming from Europe (18), USA and Canada (16), and Asia (4). Their selection was based on the following criteria: (1) Researchers who had served at least two times as Area Chairs within the past two years at major vision conferences were excluded; (2) Researchers who served as Area Chairs at the 2010 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition were also excluded (exception: ECCV 2012 Program Chairs); (3) Minimization of overlap introduced by Area Chairs being former student and advisors; (4) 20% of the Area Chairs had never served before in a major conference; (5) The Area Chair selection process made all possible efforts to achieve a reasonable geographic distribution between countries, thematic areas and trends in computer vision. EachArea Chair was assigned by the Program Chairs between 28–32 papers. Based on paper content, the Area Chair recommended up to seven potential reviewers per paper. Such assignment was made using all reviewers in the database including the conflicting ones. The Program Chairs manually entered the missing conflict domains of approximately 300 reviewers. Based on the recommendation of the Area Chairs, three reviewers were selected per paper (with at least one being of the top three suggestions), with 99.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,,"Kostas Daniilidis, Petros Maragos, Nikos Paragios",,2010,2010,,2010,6312,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,15,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053414683,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

He deserves a biography that explores not only his persona, but the America in which he lived and worked, and how he made a difference to so many people. Michael Parrish has given us just such a book, an exceedingly fine, well-written story that will make clear to another generation not only who Joe Rauh was, but why we as a nation will always need someone like him."" ---Melvin I. Urofsky, Professor of Law and Public Policy, Virginia Commonwealth University ""Michael Parrish has captured the life of this great civil libertarian in splendid fashion. His biography of this energetic New Deal liberal weaves effortlessly between public and private, friend and foe, victory and defeat. With Parrish as a sure guide, Citizen Rauh transports the reader through an American history that begins with Sacco and Vanzetti and ends as he battles CIA skullduggery in the 1980s. This biography should be on your shelf and in your heart."" ---Nelson Lichtenstein, MacArthur Foundation Professor of History and Director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor, and Democracy, University of California, Santa Barbara ""Michael Parrish has fashioned a biography filled with Rauh's spirit, achievements, his losses, and above all, the importance of his presence. This is a wonderful account of a giant of late 20th century political and legal affairs."" ---Stanley Kutler, E. Gordon Fox Professor Emeritus of American Institutions, History, and Law, University of Wisconsin, Madison ""The causes to which Rauh committed his life retain their moral force today. This well-crafted, often powerful, biographical study will appeal to anyone with a serious interest in postwar liberalism."" ---Daniel Scroop, University of Sheffield    Citizen Rauh tells the story of American lawyer Joseph L. Rauh Jr., who kept alive the ideals of New Deal liberalism and broadened those ideals to include a commitment to civil rights. Rauh's clients included Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, A. Philip Randolph, and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. With good reason Freedom Rider John Lewis once called him ""the blackest white man I ever knew.""   No lawyer in the post-1945 era did more to protect the economic interests of working-class Americans than Rauh, who fought for the unions as they struggled for legitimacy and against them when they betrayed their own members. No lawyer stood more courageously against repressive anticommunism during the 1950s or advanced the cause of racial justice more vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s. No lawyer did more to defend the constitutional vision of the Warren Court and resist the efforts of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to undo its legacy. Throughout his life, Rauh continued to articulate a progressive vision of law and politics, ever confident that his brand of liberalism would become vital once again when the cycle of American politics took another turn.   Jacket design by Paula Newcomb   Jacket photograph: Joseph L.

Motor imagery is often used when the human body is involved, where subjects imagine the body moving or manipulating objects. The use of mental practice, including motor imagery for the rehabilitation of patients with cerebral motor impairments, is one of the most active areas in the field of motor imagery research. This book examines three main aspects of mental imagery. In the first part, the chapters address the neural basis of mental and motor imagery, the relationships between mental imagery and perception, and between motor imagery and physical execution. In the second part, the chapters focus on the evaluation of mental/motor imagery accuracy, including both central and peripheral nervous system recordings. The final chapters address the effects of mental practice on motor recovery after stroke.",,,,,"Aymeric Guillot, Christian Collet",,2010-01-14,2010,,2010-01-14,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,77,15,,6.08,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1108389809,42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

This year, we received 786 submissions, well in line with the previous two conferences in New York and London. Three program chairs and a program committee of 31 scientists, all with a recognized standing in the ?eld of the conference, were responsible for the selection of the papers. The review process was set up such that each paper was considered by the three program chairs, two program committee members, and a minimum of three external reviewers. The review process was double-blind, so the reviewers did not know the identity of the authors of the submission. After a careful evaluation procedure, in which all controversialand gray area papers were discussed individually, we arrived at a total of 251 accepted papers for MICCAI 2010, of which 45 were selected for podium presentation and 206 for poster presentation.

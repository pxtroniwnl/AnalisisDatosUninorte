To ease the distribution system impact analysis of these rapidly growing loads, this paper describes a software application developed in Matlab that integrates the attributes of Eclipse SUMO and OpenDSS to co-simulate a road transportation network and a distribution system, obtain realistic usage schedules of EV chargers, and quantify their effects on voltages and currents of medium- and low-voltage feeders. A case study presenting the distribution system impact analysis of six public EV charging stations in Barranquilla, Colombia is reported to illustrate the features of the developed tool. The results demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed application software to simulate practical charging impact scenarios with different transportation networks, charger locations, and power levels.",,,,2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference - Latin America (ISGT Latin America),,,2021-01-17,2021,,2021-01-17,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"O., J.

After a review of the literature, we implemented a program for faculty that focused on three key points: (1) exploring the types of technology available for each modality and how to successfully integrate them into the teachers’ practice; (2) clarifying the concepts around each modality and how they are implemented; and (3) supporting educational and emotional needs to help faculty and their students during this time. Feedback from faculty was positive although some professors felt overwhelmed at the beginning of the process. In addition, many professors took active roles to help their colleagues promoting emergent learning communities. Future implications show that despite having institutional professional development to meet immediate needs in crisis situations, it also could be useful to tap into the knowledge and experiences of the institution’s faculty. Furthermore, continuing professional development for online teaching and learning is essential, thus allowing sufficient time for faculty to learn, adopt, and adapt to new technological tools.",,,,Teaching in the Post COVID-19 Era,"Ismail Fayed, Jill Cummings",,2021,2021,2022-01-03,2021,,,585-592,Closed,Chapter,"Bailey, Angela C.; Corrales, Kathleen A.; Rey-Paba, Lourdes; Roasado Mendinueta, Nayibe","Bailey, Angela C.

Students in these courses face various challenges associated with their contexts and their home areas for studying – the physical conditions, quality of internet connections, and sometimes lack of electricity. Alongside these challenges, they lack literacy skills to face the demands posed by the learning tasks they encounter in their courses. The change to remote emergency teaching due to the COVID-19 crisis represented a threat for this vulnerable population as their academic literacy teachers were not used to navigating technology-mediated environments. After intensive professional development provided by the Teaching Excellence Center, faculty designed strategies to match teachers and students’ access and familiarity to technology. Teaching tasks and delivery were modified as well. Feedback from faculty recognized the complexity and difficulty of such transformations, as well as its potential for opportunities. Students were positive about the experience and recognized the role teachers played in making this transition possible.

In this sense, the digital transformation implies not only the use of technology to store data, but also a change of processes and organizational culture, allowing the entry of knowledge management into the new economy of the intangibles. This transformation has changed the game rules of socio-technical systems of organizations and their interrelationships, impacting different components of organizations. Advance in adapting the transformation in organizations has not been symmetrical in all sectors and regions of the world. Previous research shows that in education in Latin America the degree of incorporation has been less than in other economic sectors and zones of the world. That is why, the objective of study is the identification and analysis of the progress achieved by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) of the region, concerning digital transformation of their academic and management processes, besides recognizing their opportunities and challenges in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The methodology includes a qualitative approach. To collect the information, the document analysis technique is used, and the main factor is the searching through reference database and complete text. Data analysis is made in accordance with the pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, central and management, digital transformation enablers of missionary, and support processes of the HEIs. The results show that, while it is true that the HEIs in Latin America lag behind their peers in other countries, it is found that, from 2018, the progress on the digital transformation of processes of the HEIs in Latin America has been very significant. The main impact is given in the incorporation of pillars of industry 4.0 in: graduation, using blockchain; teaching, collaborative virtual reality; artificial intelligence to assist students; university management, through virtual assistants; and research supported by robotic. Improvement of cyber-physical and big data systems is not evident. It is concluded that digital transformation of the HEIs in Latin America is in the phase of early adoption, with some successful cases of the main reference HEIs, top-ranked in the academic ranking of the region, which will probably be imitated by other HEIs. The main challenges for the digital transformation of the HEIs in Latin America are related to culture, resistance to change, the hierarchical government, and the understanding that information is the key asset of the knowledge society. A new opportunity emerges for the digital transformation of HEIs in Latin America and for the researchers of the topic.",We are especially grateful to the Higher Education Institutions in Latin America that have provided accessible information and which were a fundamental input for the research.,,Lecture Notes in Educational Technology,Radical Solutions for Digital Transformation in Latin American Universities,"Daniel Burgos, John Willian Branch",,2021-07-25,2021,2021-07-25,2021,,,55-75,Closed,Chapter,"Serna Gómez, José Humberto; Díaz-Piraquive, Flor Nancy; Muriel-Perea, Yasser de Jesús; Díaz Peláez, Alejandro","Serna Gómez, José Humberto (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia); Díaz-Piraquive, Flor Nancy (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia); Muriel-Perea, Yasser de Jesús (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia); Díaz Peláez, Alejandro (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia)","Díaz-Piraquive, Flor Nancy (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia)","Serna Gómez, José Humberto (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia); Díaz-Piraquive, Flor Nancy (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia); Muriel-Perea, Yasser de Jesús (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia); Díaz Peláez, Alejandro (Fundación Universitaria Internacional de La Rioja, Calle 100 No. 19-61 Piso 8, Bogotá, Colombia)",14,8,,9.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139915243,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems; 4610 Library and Information Studies,4 Quality Education

However, the current unbalances in demand/supply has led to a sharp reduction of NRL prices, which has required the Thailand government to boost NRL prices by encouraging domestic consumption and promoting its use as an alternative material for road infrastructure applications. Aiming at selecting and optimizing a suitable percentage of natural rubber latex able to improve the rheological and rutting resistance performance characteristics of natural rubber modified bitumen (NRMB), this research assesses the application of high ammonia concentrated natural rubber latex, which incorporates 60% Dry Rubber Content (DRC) and 40% water by total weight. This NRL was used as a modifier of AC60/70 bitumen at 0, 3, 5, 8% of DRC concentrations. The experimental programme comprised two stages that assessed: (1) the rheological properties by means of the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test; and (2) the rutting performance through the Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) test. The results indicated that NR increased the complex modulus and reduced phase angle at high temperature, while also providing significant improvement in the rutting resistance. Altogether, the main laboratory results proved that NR latex containing 8% of DRC to be the optimum NR dosage that induces improvements on the rheological properties and rutting performance of NRMB blends.",Juan S.

As a consequence, various strategies for mitigating this phenomenon have been proposed, including the use of additives to improve bitumen-aggregate bonding, engineered to mitigate/counteract the moisture damage effects. Among these, the reported benefits of various lime forms, such as hydrated lime (HL), have propelled its use (mainly in the United States from the early 70s) as widely reported in scientific literature. However, very few studies have been conducted in the United Kingdom with locally available materials, specifications and testing methods suitable for that purpose. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of HL on the moisture damage resistance of stone mastic asphalt (SMA) mixtures designed, produced and tested under local UK conditions. A set of asphalt slabs with a target 4.0% air voids content and two bitumen contents (5.6 and 6.2%) using granite aggregates were manufactured using a roller ‘slab’ compactor consisting of control mixtures (0% HL) and those with 1, 2 and 3% HL by weight of total mixture. Characterisation of the mixtures was done via the saturated ageing tensile stiffness (SATS) test to account for both the effects of ageing and moisture damage. The SATS test results showed a positive effect of the addition of HL on the moisture damage resistance, however increasing HL contents only produced marginal additional improvements. The influence of the reduction in bitumen content was negligible. Furthermore, the results indicated an optimum dosage of 1% HL for enhanced moisture damage resistance.",Juan S.

However, understanding of the effects of HL on fatigue or more specifically on the fundamental fracture properties of asphalt mixtures still requires further investigation. As a result, this research study assessed the fracture toughness characteristics of stone mastic asphalt (SMA) mixtures with locally available materials and testing procedures in the UK context. SMA cores were subjected to semi-circular bending (SCB) testing. The experimental matrix comprised various factors for assessing and comparing the fracture toughness of the manufactured mixtures with 0, 1, 2, and 3% hydrated lime by weight of total mixture as well as a control without hydrated lime. These factors included the effects on the fracture of (1) testing temperatures (0, 10, and 20 °C), (2) aggregate type (granite and limestone), (3) environmental conditioning (ageing combined with moisture damage), and (4) the effects of filler type and content. From the SCB experimental results, it was found that the fracture is highly factor-dependent. 2 and 3% HL improved the fracture strength of the manufactured cores, whereas 1% exhibited relatively low or negligible effects on the fracture strength. Finally, the use of granite aggregates substantiated a superior fracture resistance with a 40% increase compared to mixtures produced with limestone.",Juan S.

The stiffening effects of HL at room temperature for some mixture types have been reported in the literature but the knowledge of the effects on Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) mixtures is still limited. Similarly, the temperature-dependency has been theorised in the literature but scarce experimental evidence is currently available. As a consequence, this research focuses on studying the effects of a wide range of temperatures on the stiffening effect of SMA mixtures with HL. Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus (ITSM) testing was used in order to assess the stiffness properties of SMA mixtures manufactured with limestone aggregates, a conventional 30/45-penetration grade bitumen, and the addition of HL as a partial replacement of limestone filler (LF). The bitumen to filler ratio was kept as 1:1 for all manufactured mixtures. The results indicated: (i) a clear temperature-dependency of the stiffening effect of HL, which is more prominent at intermediate temperatures (20 and 30 °C). (ii) The percentage of added HL and the average stiffness of the specimens had an approximately linear correlation. (iii) The stiffening effect is less prominent at the lower and higher temperatures considered. (iv) The partial replacement of LF by HL produced stiffer mixtures than those without replacement, which suggests improved mechanical response of these SMA mixtures.",Juan S.

The confinement due to the Covid19 pandemic has only made this reality even more visible. Some studies indicate that by increasing empowering women and girls in settings where they are a minority, economic and social benefits are also obtained. The W-STEM project aims to increase women’s participation in STEM disciplines. The paper presents preliminary results of a diagnosis of different STEM programs at one university in Colombia. Results show that seven STEM programs have low female enrolment. Therefore, the paper presents various activities developed to motivate young women to enroll in STEM programs. The activities were open to all interested students, showing that 47% of women participated in the activities.

The experimental work covered extensive laboratory testing of several rubberised bitumen blends. The rubberised bitumen was manufactured using four paving grade bitumens (180/240, 160/220, 70/100, 80/100), three tyre rubber types (mechanical ground, waterjet powder, ambient ground powder), and various processing conditions (shear levels, temperatures, processing times). Characterisation of the manufactured blends included rotational viscosity, softening point, and Fraass breaking point. The findings derived from the experimental programme relate to optimised processing conditions for the tyre rubber blends. Overall, this research showed that simple, relatively quick, and inexpensive test methods can be used for comprehensive characterisation of recycled tyre rubber blends. Similarly, it was found that the properties of rubberised bitumen were highly factor dependent, including effects of the: source of base bitumen (physicochemical properties), source of rubber particles, and processing conditions (shear mixing, temperature, and time). The impact of rubber pre-treatment on the performance was found to be negligible for the studied combinations. Clear bitumen-specific effects were observed from the soft and hard bitumen types considered. Furthermore, temperature and shear processing conditions had the paramount effects on the level of bitumen modification. Optimised conditions for rubberised bitumen production suggested a range of temperature of 180–210 °C, up to 180 min for high shear, and up to 30 min for ultra-high shear.",The authors greatly acknowledge the support and cooperation of the industrial partner Tyre Recycling Solutions.

We exploit the information brought by historical weather datasets to build machine-learning-based models. These models are employed to produce numerical forecasts, which can be improved by injecting additional data via data assimilation. Our approaches’ general idea is as follows: given a set of time snapshots of some dynamical system, we group the data by time across multiple days. These groups are employed to build first-order Markovian models that reproduce dynamics from time to time. Our numerical models’ precision can be improved via sequential data assimilation. Experimental tests are performed by using the National-Centers-for-Environmental-Prediction Department-of-Energy Reanalysis II dataset. The results reveal that numerical forecasts can be obtained within reasonable error magnitudes in the L2$$L_2$$ norm sense, and even more, observations can improve forecasts by order of magnitudes, in some cases.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory (AML-CS) at Universidad del Norte, BAQ, COL.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computational Science – ICCS 2021,"Maciej Paszynski, Dieter Kranzlmüller, Valeria V.

At this point, the physical layer mechanisms ACM may not adapt modulation and error correction coding in time; residual errors cause packet losses at the upper layer that can be recovered with RLNC network coding. Thanks to RLNC coding algorithms in erasure channels, redundancy can be injected into packet transport, allowing receivers to recover quickly from packet loss, avoiding the costly RTT round-trip times incurred by relying on the traditional acknowledgment-based scheme.

Worldwide measures indicate huge differences in happiness between societies. For instance, the 2019 World Happiness Report (Helliwell, Layard, & Sachs, 2019) ranks Finland, Sweden, and Norway to be the happier countries, while other countries like South Sudan and Afghanistan are at the bottom of the list. On the other hand, the 2019 Global Emotions Report shows that Latin American countries lead in the positive experiences ranking. The chapter examines a handful of perspectives that explain cultural variation in happiness. One perspective quantifies key variables like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, perceptions of corruption and generosity. Another perspective is grounded on the fulfillment of psychological needs like learning, autonomy, using one’s skills, respect, and count with others. Nevertheless, and despite the efforts to measure worldwide happiness, there is an unexplained happiness factor that is recognized by researchers and makes a difference in perception of happiness among countries with similar socioeconomic conditions. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions provide a broader cross-cultural frame to attend the unexplained factor of happiness. Members of collective society define themselves through the group they belong, in contrast, within the individualistic society the person is oriented around the self, as an independent being. This might explain why a factor like the freedom to life choices might gave a greater impact on happiness in an individualistic society and social support is more important in a collective society. Finally, the chapter explains the importance of addressing cultural variations on happiness perception in business decisions.",,,Studies in Rhythm Engineering,Consumer Happiness: Multiple Perspectives,"Tanusree Dutta, Manas Kumar Mandal",,2021-05-06,2021,2021-05-06,2021,,,23-41,Closed,Chapter,"Eternod, Vivian","Eternod, Vivian (Business School, Tecnologico de Monterrey, San Pedro Garza García, Mexico)","Eternod, Vivian (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education)","Eternod, Vivian (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education)",1,1,,1.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137769463,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",3 Good Health and Well Being
1749,pub.1145438529,10.1109/casap54985.2021.9703383,,,Mathematical modeling of ventilation in classrooms as decrease in the risk of contagion by COVID-19,"In indoor spaces, there is evidence of the importance of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by air through aerosols, especially in poorly ventilated conditions. Viruses are exhaled by infected people into respiratory particles with sizes less than 50 microns (microdroplets) that are suspended in the air (aerosols) and can be transported to distances greater than 2 meters within a closed room, such as classrooms. Therefore, in closed school environments, the conditions of occupation and ventilation are essential to determine and minimize the risk of transmission of the virus. There are various techniques to physically assess the air change rate (ACH) in an indoor space or to estimate it indirectly by measuring carbon dioxide (CO2). However, these procedures could be complex for an untrained community or in the absence of a CO2 monitor. The application of mathematical models allows alternatively to evaluate the ventilation conditions from the estimation of ACH or the concentration of CO2 in an intramural space. Some mathematical models were included as part of a guide developed for the evaluation and monitoring of ventilation in school settings. In this work, the application of mass balance models is presented, under conditions of complete mixing, in a classroom in order to estimate ACH from the volume and occupation of the room. Likewise, mathematical expressions are developed to estimate the concentration of CO2 and evaluate the risk of contagion to COVID-19 in situations with and without ventilation. From simple mathematical expressions, it is contributed to the evaluation of the ventilation conditions of classrooms to avoid possible outbreaks of contagion in face-to-face education.",,,,2021 Congreso Colombiano y Conferencia Internacional de Calidad de Aire y Salud Pública (CASAP),,,2021-11-05,2021,,2021-11-05,00,,1-4,Closed,Proceeding,"Pachón, Jorge E.; Rojas, Néstor Y.; Castañeda, Dayana Agudelo; Villamizar, Laura Rodríguez; Ramírez, Omar; Dimas, Laura Vanessa","Pachón, Jorge E.

Published studies typically take the developments of the latter and adapt them to ferronickel. However, few open publications allow for a proper understanding of the calcination and reduction of lateritic nickel minerals. This research analyzes the operation of a rotary kiln calciner of 135 m length, a diameter of 6 m, and a mass flow rate between 170 and 180 t/h of partially dry mineral. The calciner uses coal as a reducing agent and natural gas as a thermal energy source. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used in a large industrial dataset to determine the variables with a greater influence on the process performance. Also, k-means clustering is used to locate operation points favorable to calcined mineral production. Results show that the most relevant variables are mineral and gas temperatures and the mass flow rates of air, mineral, natural gas, and coal.",,,,ASME 2021 Heat Transfer Summer Conference,,,2021-06-16,2021,2021-07-28,2021-06-16,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Ardila, Antonio; Rueda, Bernardo; Sánchez, Iván; Parra, Maricel; Corredor, Lesme; González, Arturo; Romero, Johanna","Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Sánchez, Iván (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Parra, Maricel (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Arturo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Romero, Johanna (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Sánchez, Iván (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Parra, Maricel (Universidad del Norte); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte); González, Arturo (Universidad del Norte); Romero, Johanna (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140022370,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The literature focuses on cement kilns or iron and steel production applications. This work compares the influence of the approaches considered in the early phases of the design process on heat transfer and energy performance for two ferronickel rotary kilns. For this purpose, a retrospective analysis was realized identifying requirements, operating principles, and approaches applied in the definition of specification and conceptual design. This analysis was carried out, taking into account one operation year data of two rotary calcining kilns of 185 meters and 135 meters in length, both of 6 meters in diameter and similar feeding rate between 170,000 and 180000 kilograms per hour. The analysis showed that kiln 1 had a functional approach in the early phases of the design process, while kiln 2 additionally has an environmental and energy approach, which allowed to improve the heat transfer and energy performance. This was verified with software based on the AHP method. The software results showed that counter-current and cross-flow rotary kiln 2 is a better conceptual design alternative for environmental and energy requirements than counter-current rotary kiln 1.",,,,ASME 2021 Heat Transfer Summer Conference,,,2021-06-16,2021,2021-07-28,2021-06-16,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Ruiz, Janneth; Ardila, Antonio; Rueda, Bernardo; Castillo, Andy; Pardo, Yuleisy; Corredor, Lesme; Maury, Heriberto","Ruiz, Janneth (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Castillo, Andy (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pardo, Yuleisy (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Ruiz, Janneth (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Castillo, Andy (Universidad del Norte); Pardo, Yuleisy (Universidad del Norte); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte); Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140022368,33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design; 40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Because these loads are time-varying and not equally distributed among phases, there is typically an unbalance between the currents flowing through each phase. These imbalances can cause increases in losses, tripping of electrical protections, voltage imbalances and underutilization of lines, all of which contribute to a higher operational cost. To address this problem, this study proposes an iterative method to balance the loads through phase swapping. In particular, the proposed method allows identifying the suitable laterals where two or more phases can be swapped to improve load balancing in a distribution circuit. Using data from a Colombian utility and a standard IEEE test case, we show that it is possible to reduce the load unbalance with few iterations. Additionally, the method also reduces of losses and voltage unbalances, and equalizes the power factors in the phases.","The authors acknowledge support from Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium, the Fulbright- MinCiencias scholarship and the Universidad del Norte professorial scholarship.

The emissions generated depend mainly on the ship's operating mode (Hotelling, Maneuvers and Cruising) and the quality of the fuel used. In this sense, the lack of studies in the Colombian territory is worrying, even more so when it does not have control mechanisms due to null legislation on environmental emissions for these sources. Given this absence, this work seeks to generate quantitative information through the estimation of emissions of: SO2, NOx, Particulate Material (PM10, PM2.5), Hydrocarbons (HC), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), CO, CO2, CH4, and N2O, using the “Bottom up” methodology for Container, Bulk and General Cargo vessels arriving at the Barranquilla Fluvial Terminal throughout the year 2018, in order to make a preliminary diagnosis of the current situation of the port. For the study year, it was observed that a total of 651 motor ships arrived, of which they were determined as total emissions: 4583.18 tons of NOx, 1417.34 tons of SO2, 182.52 tons of PM10, 179.42 tons of PM2.5, 87.10 ton of HC, 155.84 ton of Volatile Organic Compounds other than Methane (MNVOC), 136.19 ton of CO, 105 677.85 ton of CO2, 0.77 ton of CH4 and 4.95 ton of N2O.",,,,2019 Congreso Colombiano y Conferencia Internacional de Calidad de Aire y Salud Pública (CASP),,,2021-03-08,2021,2021-03-08,,,,1-8,Closed,Proceeding,"Agudelo-Castaneda, Dayana; Prieto, David","Agudelo-Castaneda, Dayana (Universidad del Norte,Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental,Barranquilla,Colombia); Prieto, David (Universidad del Norte,Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental,Barranquilla,Colombia)",,"Agudelo-Castaneda, Dayana (Universidad del Norte); Prieto, David (Universidad del Norte)",3,3,,0.66,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136238422,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,13 Climate Action

This work focuses on the calcination and pre-reduction of laterite nickel ore to produce ferronickel. Ferronickel is an alloy containing nickel (about 30% wt.) and iron used for manufacturing stainless steel. Calcination and pre-reduction entail removing chemically bonded water from partially dried ore and removing oxygen from mineral oxides in the calcine. Here we combine a proprietary database with operation data of two rotary kilns and model predictions of Mean Residence Time, shell losses, intraparticle evaporation, and intraparticle temperature distribution. The kilns feature notable differences in length, inclination angle, excess air, but the predicted Mean Residence Times are similar. A fitted profile of experimental solids bed temperature represented particles surface temperature. The model considered slab-like mineral particles with surface-to-center distances of 13, 25, and 38 mm. Results show notable differences in the drying zone length and average surface-to-center temperature differences. Surface-to-center distances higher than 25 mm result in average surface-to-center temperature differences higher than 80°C. The following steps are improvements in the particle model and its coupling with the gas and wall temperature profiles.",,,,ASME 2021 Heat Transfer Summer Conference,,,2021-06-16,2021,2021-07-28,2021-06-16,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Ruiz, Janneth; Ardila, Antonio; Rueda, Bernardo; Echeverri, Jorge; Quintero, Daniel; Guillin, Wilson; Corredor, Lesme; Gonzalez, Arturo","Ruiz, Janneth (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Echeverri, Jorge (Cerro Matoso S.A, Barranquilla, Colombia); Quintero, Daniel (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Guillin, Wilson (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corredor, Lesme (Cerro Matoso S.A, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gonzalez, Arturo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Ruiz, Janneth (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Montelíbano, Colombia); Echeverri, Jorge (Cerro Matoso S.A, Barranquilla, Colombia); Quintero, Daniel (Universidad del Norte); Guillin, Wilson (Universidad del Norte); Corredor, Lesme (Cerro Matoso S.A, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gonzalez, Arturo (Cerro Matoso S.A, Barranquilla, Colombia)",1,0,,0.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140022372,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

In a typical rotary kiln calciner, particulate solids and combustions gases move counter currently, while solids undergo drying, pre-reduction, and partial reduction reactions. The combustion of natural gas provides the thermal energy for drying and reduction reactions. About 80 to 85% of the incoming laterite ore leaves the reactor as calcined ore, while the flue gases entrain part of the solids as dust. This work presents a theoretical analysis contrasted with experimental results to evaluate the partial reduction of laterite ores in two rotary kilns of 185 m and 135 m length. The study focused on the water formed in the process, including a comparative analysis of water consumption by two different solids recovery technologies, a gas scrubber and an electrostatic precipitator. Simulations allowed evaluating the water and greenhouse gas formation in the main streams of the process. Among the tested operation conditions, the moisture content in the pellets, consisting of agglomerated dust, strongly influenced the amount of water released in the process and the energy consumption. Furnace RK-2 needs approximately 56% more energy to evaporate the moisture content in the feedstock. Furthermore, furnace RK-2 released 55.4 m3h−1 of water into the atmosphere, which represented two times the amount released by furnace RK-1. Gas scrubber analysis showed that as the liquid water increased, more H2O in the gases was condensed; however, the destroyed exergy also increased. Electrostatic precipitators appear as an adequate technology for reducing water and energy consumption in the ferronickel industry.",,,,ASME 2021 15th International Conference on Energy Sustainability,,,2021-06-16,2021,2021-07-22,2021-06-16,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Ruiz, Janneth; Ardila, Antonio; Rueda, Bernardo; Echeverri, Jorge; Quintero, Daniel; Corredor, Lesme; González, Arturo","Ruiz, Janneth (Cerro Matoso S.A., Montería, Colombia); Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A., Montería, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A., Montería, Colombia); Echeverri, Jorge (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Quintero, Daniel (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Arturo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Ruiz, Janneth (Cerro Matoso S.A., Montería, Colombia); Ardila, Antonio (Cerro Matoso S.A., Montería, Colombia); Rueda, Bernardo (Cerro Matoso S.A., Montería, Colombia); Echeverri, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Quintero, Daniel (Universidad del Norte); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte); González, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139886002,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In Colombia, specifically in the Caribbean Region, there is the Magdalena River, a body of water that broadly borders the Colombian territory and is a tributary of various economic and public health activities. At its mouth, this river interacts with the sea directly, which generates a phenomenon called saline wedge, which is directly related to the sediments that must be continuously extracted and which threatens the proper functioning of the port from the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. Through this research, a network of sensors located in strategic places at the mouth of this river was generated, which allows predicting the behavior of the salt wedge.

Although several studies have recognized the importance of roughness on the mobilization of frictional forces, its application to the design of deep foundations in the field requires further research. This paper presents the results of static load tests performed with an instrumented model pile with three different surface roughnesses jacked in a half-cylindrical calibration chamber with digital image correlation (DIC) capabilities. The model piles were tested in tension and compression in dense and medium-dense sand samples prepared by air pluviation. The analysis of the data obtained from local sensors and the images processed with DIC indicate that an increase in the pile surface roughness results in an increase in the average unit shaft resistance and an increase in the displacements and strains in the soil next to the shaft of the pile. Values of K/K0 accounting the effect of surface roughness are provided for the estimation of the tensile and compressive limit unit shaft resistance of jacked piles in sand.",,,,IFCEE 2021,,,2021-05-06,2021,2021-05-06,2021-05-06,,,143-153,Closed,Proceeding,"Tovar-Valencia, Ruben D.; Galvis-Castro, Ayda; Prezzi, Monica; Salgado, Rodrigo","Tovar-Valencia, Ruben D.

The generated closed-chained multiskilling structures minimize the expected training and over/understaffing costs, while assigning rest days between working days to single-skilled and multiskilled employees. This research provides a suitable methodology for a wide range of industries where the main problem is to meet the demand requirements the seven days of the week, but where the employees cannot work daily. The methodology is structured in two steps. First, we develop a deterministic mixed integer linear programming model. Second, the deterministic model is reformulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization model in order to explicitly incorporate demand uncertainty. Our methodology was applied in a case study associated to a Chilean retail store. We use real data but also simulated data to represent various demand variability scenarios. Results showed that the model was able to do the days-off scheduling decisions cost-effectively for a planning horizon of two weeks. Additionally, it was found that the levels of understaffing and overstaffing can vary between weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekend. Finally, we also observed that the 2-chaining policy was cost-effective in all scenarios; however, when there are very high levels of demand variability, it can be interesting to explore k-chaining with k ≥ 2 and/or to hire more employees.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Production Research,"Daniel Alejandro Rossit, Fernando Tohmé, Gonzalo Mejía Delgadillo",,2021-05-12,2021,2021-05-12,2021,1407,,19-32,Closed,Chapter,"Fontalvo Echavez, Orianna; Fuentes Quintero, Laura; Henao, César Augusto; González, Virginia I.","Fontalvo Echavez, Orianna (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fuentes Quintero, Laura (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

The personnel assignment matter is handled using the chaining approach and it is evaluated whether a multiskilled workforce that minimizes the expected costs associated with training and under/overstaffing can be planned while taking into account demand uncertainty and using the k-chaining policy for a days-off scheduling problem. Until now, literature’s main focus has been 2-chaining policies, where every multiskilled employee is at most trained in two departments, i.e., k = 2. Hence, this research intends to determine scenarios where a k-chaining policy with k ≥ 2 offers more cost-effective multiskilling structures than a 2-chaining one. Initially, a deterministic mixed-integer linear optimization model is developed and then modified into a two-stage stochastic optimization model in order to add demand uncertainty. Such methodology is subsequently applied to a Chilean retail store where a Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate different daily demand scenarios. The results obtained suggest that with high levels of demand variability k-chaining policies seem favorable. Nonetheless, none of the employees evaluated were able to work in more than three departments, which leads to the conclusion that it does not appear to be advantageous to implement excessive flexibility levels.",,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Production Research,"Daniel Alejandro Rossit, Fernando Tohmé, Gonzalo Mejía Delgadillo",,2021-05-12,2021,2021-05-12,2021,1407,,156-170,Closed,Chapter,"Abello, María Alejandra; Ospina, Nicole Marie; De la Ossa, Julia Margarita; Henao, César Augusto; González, Virginia I.","Abello, María Alejandra (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ospina, Nicole Marie (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); De la Ossa, Julia Margarita (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

This phenomenon occurs when multiskilled employees lose productivity in those tasks they perform less frequently. The literature recommends considering this decrease in productivity in multiskilling decisions, in order to find personnel planning alternatives that improve workforce performance. The methodology proposes a mixed integer programming model that explicitly incorporates the learning and forgetting phenomenon and, also, the use of multiskilled workforce through a k-chaining approach. This formulation allows to determine how many employees should be multiskilled, in how many additional departments they will be trained, and what amount of productivity is expected in each trained department. The solution to the problem minimizes the costs of understaffing, training, and productivity loss. The case study is applied in the retail industry, in which two experiments were evaluated that faced three different levels of demand variability. The first experiment generated lower costs because it did not incorporate the productivity loss associated with the learning and forgetting phenomenon. The second experiment, which incorporated the learning and forgetting phenomenon, generated a higher total cost but its solution is better adjusted to the real operation of a retail store. Finally, given the incorporation of the learning and forgetting phenomenon, the second experiment required higher levels of multiskilling to minimize understaffing costs and, in turn, compensate for the productivity loss.",This research was supported by “Fundación para la Promoción de la Investigación y la Tecnología (FPIT)” under Grant 4.523.,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Production Research,"Daniel Alejandro Rossit, Fernando Tohmé, Gonzalo Mejía Delgadillo",,2021-05-12,2021,2021-05-12,2021,1408,,223-237,Closed,Chapter,"Vergara, Silvana; Del Villar, Jairo; Masson, James; Pérez, Natalia; Henao, César Augusto; González, Virginia I.","Vergara, Silvana (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Del Villar, Jairo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Masson, James (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pérez, Natalia (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

Various solutions have been suggested to counter the rising caseload. Examples are a reduction of the number of court applications, an increase in the number of judges, and improving the efficiency of the courts with the introduction of appropriate case and court management instruments. Court management and case management are critical components within an efficient judicial system. They depend on the court structure and arrangements within and between the courts both from a horizontal and from a vertical point of view. The structural design of a judicial system depends on multiple factors, including legal culture and policy. This contribution explores, from a comparative perspective, the theories of case management, the role of managerial judges, and the interrelations between court structure, court management and case management. It is evident that case management is dependent on the structural arrangement of courts. In particular, the availability of specialized courts, the flexible composition of the tribunal that corresponds to the complexity and the importance of the case, and the interplay between superior and inferior courts are all critical in ensuring effective case management.",,,Ius Gentium: Comparative Perspectives on Law and Justice,Civil Case Management in the Twenty-First Century: Court Structures Still Matter,"Peter C.H.

The use of a multiskilled workforce is an attractive flexibility source to minimize such mismatch. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model for structuring the multiskilling skills of a set of employees. To explicitly incorporate demand uncertainty, we develop a two-stage stochastic optimization approach. Then, using a Monte Carlo simulation we analyze the performance of the solutions for different levels of demand variability. To test the performance of the proposed stochastic approach, it is compared with the solutions of two myopic approaches: zero multiskilling and total multiskilling. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study in a Chilean retail store, using real and simulated data. Our results showed that the proposed approach reported the maximum possible benefit for all levels of variability.

It seeks to discuss the practices that shed light upon the circulation of caravans through this place and their importance for understanding the changes in interregional interaction that occurred during the Late Intermediate Period (LIP, ca. AD 950–1450), essentially after the Tiwanaku sphere of interaction and before the region’s annexation to the Inca Empire. In that period, the macro-regional connections that maintained the node of San Pedro de Atacama for the previous millennium were contested by Loa River nodes, like Chiuchiu, Lasana, Turi, Toconce, and Caspana, as shown by the discovery of cemeteries containing exogenous goods from an area extending from the Pacific Coast to the eastern jungles. I propose that this change was prompted partly from the intensification and expansion of the scope of a caravan traffic route along the upper course of the Loa River (hereafter Alto Loa) at a time of increasing inter-ethnic conflict, when traditional traffic routes could potentially be blocked.","The author&#x27;s research has been financially supported by grant 5449 from the Wenner-Gren Foundation and grant 1920011 from the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, Fondecyt, Chile.",,,Caravans in Global Perspective,,,2021-11-02,2021,2021-11-02,,,,184-201,Closed,Chapter,"Berenguer, José","Berenguer, José ()",,"Berenguer, José ()",1,1,,1.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142378933,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Particularly, at our institution, emphasis had traditionally been placed on face-to-face education; therefore, our foreign language faculty lacked conceptual and practical knowledge of online course design and delivery. To support teachers through the transition, a professional development program (PD) was implemented. Therefore, this chapter explores what a group of Colombian professors learned as they moved out of their offline comfort zone and transitioned to online teaching through the application of an informal survey at two time points. Nine categories of teacher learning emerged from the survey and were grouped into three main themes: (1) technical aspects of online teaching, (2) development of a more “humane” view of teaching and learning, and (3) learning from others and about themselves. In sum, the crisis served as a stimulus for teachers to develop themselves as people and practitioners. It is hoped that this chapter may guide the PD of faculty around the world, bearing in mind that education will likely face other challenges in the future.",,,,Emergency Remote Teaching and Beyond,Julian Chen,,2021,2021,2022-02-01,2021,,,91-110,Closed,Chapter,"Corrales, Kathleen A.; Rey-Paba, Lourdes","Corrales, Kathleen A.

Many of the continuities and discontinuities of adolescent development are associated with family processes related to macro-structural factors, such as culture, economic, health, and education policies. From an ecological-systemic perspective, poverty is considered a distal risk factor as it is associated with developmental issues of children and adolescents. Likewise, the family is a proximal factor that can play a risky or protective role to adolescent developmental trajectories and outcomes, depending on the complex interplay of the individual, family, and other ecological systems. Research in Latin America with adolescents living in adverse social and family contexts reports that many adolescents and families show good adaptation and resilience; however, a significative proportion presents mental health risk factors related to poverty and marginalization. This chapter presents the major perspectives and representative research in the field of resilience, highlighting studies with Latin American adolescents and families facing diverse situations, as well as an overview of main findings from a research project with Mexican adolescents living in family and socioeconomic adverse contexts. The implications for planning mental health actions for adolescents and families are discussed from an evidence-based preventive approach.","Thanks to PAPIIT (UNAM) for supporting the research group for many years, particularly for the current project PAPIIT IN308420.

This project seeks to identify and evaluate instruments and proposals for socialization that allow progress towards the governance of air quality in the municipalities of the Northern Sabana de Bogotá and assess the perception and information to which citizens have access. From the air quality information available in the SISAIRE system, the moving averages for the pollutants PM10, PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 were made for the municipalities of Sopó and Cajicá, and these levels were compared with the Resolution 2254 of 2017. Two particular cases were found, in which exceptional states should have been declared due to poor air quality. According to the regulations, the high concentrations of PM2.5 in Sopó and Cajicá led to levels of prevention and alert in the month of March 2020. Of these episodes there was no dissemination to the community, nor measures to protect their health. Additionally, a survey was conducted to determine the knowledge and participation that citizens in the North Sabana have regarding the air quality in their municipalities. The lack of interest, little knowledge and low participation that the community has regarding issues related to air quality was evident. For this reason, it is necessary to encourage citizen participation in the processes that are being carried out in terms of air quality. A strategy to achieve this purpose is the approach and interaction with the environment secretariats of Sopó and Cajicá that have opened to the project spaces for dialogue and training of citizens on air quality issues, addressing issues such as criteria pollutants, regulations related to quality of the air, protocols and the precautions before the exceptional states, in addition to giving instructions to access the information systems on air quality.",,,,2021 Congreso Colombiano y Conferencia Internacional de Calidad de Aire y Salud Pública (CASAP),,,2021-11-05,2021,,2021-11-05,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Peña, Sofía Ayala; Cruz, Nicolas Santiago; Bulla, David Santiago; Quinche, Jorge Eduardo Pachón; Saad, Alejandro Parra; Gutiérrez, Beatriz Elena Ortiz","Peña, Sofía Ayala (Programa de Ingeniería Ambiental y Sanitaria, Universidad de la Salle, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Cruz, Nicolas Santiago (Programa de Ingeniería Ambiental y Sanitaria, Universidad de la Salle, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Bulla, David Santiago (Programa de Ingeniería Ambiental y Sanitaria, Universidad de la Salle, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Quinche, Jorge Eduardo Pachón (Programa de Ingeniería Ambiental y Sanitaria, Universidad de la Salle, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Saad, Alejandro Parra (Programa de Ingeniería Ambiental y Sanitaria, Universidad de la Salle, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Gutiérrez, Beatriz Elena Ortiz (Programa de Ingeniería Ambiental y Sanitaria, Universidad de la Salle, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Peña, Sofía Ayala (University of La Salle)","Peña, Sofía Ayala (University of La Salle); Cruz, Nicolas Santiago (University of La Salle); Bulla, David Santiago (University of La Salle); Quinche, Jorge Eduardo Pachón (University of La Salle); Saad, Alejandro Parra (University of La Salle); Gutiérrez, Beatriz Elena Ortiz (University of La Salle)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145438522,41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

On the other hand, Colombia has been a pioneer and protagonist collaborator in creating and developing the Inter-American system of protection of human rights. Having accepted the competence of the contentious Inter-American organs, how have these made a difference in affairs regarding political rights’ violations and Colombia’s democracy? In 35 years, only three cases containing these demands have reached the maximum regional instance (the Court).

Hence, the estimation of the GHG emissions (carbon footprint - CF) is an indicator for supporting carbon efficiency and promotes environmental responsibility, as a baseline for the establishment of mitigation strategies. In this work we performed the first CF estimation exercise in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL) Sede Manizales, year base 2019, covering three main scopes: direct emissions (fuel consumption of own vehicles, stationary sources and external vehicles), indirect emissions (electricity consumption) and other indirect emissions (disposal of ordinary and special-chemical wastes). For those scopes with detailed base information, the exercise implied the adjustment of emission factors to particular conditions of Manizales city; In addition, a computational code developed in R software allowed us to systematize the analysis procedure of baseline information, coupling a calculation module to estimate the CF in a range of years selected by the user, allowing the automatic generation of figures and numerical results. The results obtained suggest that 386.2 tons of CO2-eq was the total CF estimated in 2019. The use of electricity was the largest contributor with 49% of the total GHG emission, followed by the fuel consumption of own vehicles with 30%. In this specific scope, bus transportation for students, in vehicles which use diesel as fuel, contributed with 57% of GHG emissions. We compare results with other studies at a national and international level based on the estimation of a CF per capita index. The present exercise constitutes a fundamental baseline for the environmental management at UNAL Manizales, also allowing the possibility for applying the methodology and computational tools developed to estimate the CF in other universities in the region.",,,,2021 Congreso Colombiano y Conferencia Internacional de Calidad de Aire y Salud Pública (CASAP),,,2021-11-05,2021,,2021-11-05,00,,1-4,Closed,Proceeding,"Duque, Carlos Mario González; Idarraga, Freddy Leonardo Franco","Duque, Carlos Mario González (Departamento de Ingenieria Quimica.

These, together with the figure of the television ombudsman established by law, were consolidated during the 1990s as the main media accountability instruments in Colombia. While the twenty-first century has seen the emergence of native digital media that are detached from political and economic interests, the national and regional agendas continue to be dominated by traditional media, hence the need for state intervention through media policies that favor a more pluralistic and diverse media environment.",,,,The Global Handbook of Media Accountability,,,2021-11-16,2021,2021-11-16,,,,502-511,Closed,Chapter,"Ramírez, Diego García; Téllez, María Patricia; Prato, Edgar Allan Niño","Ramírez, Diego García (); Téllez, María Patricia (); Prato, Edgar Allan Niño ()",,"Ramírez, Diego García (); Téllez, María Patricia (); Prato, Edgar Allan Niño ()",1,1,,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142611613,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This research is focused on creating a physiotherapeutic prototype through four activities: (1) structural design; (2) embedded system; (3) wireless communication; and (4) web application. Taking the data from the field survey conducted by ESPE branch Latacunga in collaboration with MIES Cotopaxi in the gerontological center “Sagrada Familia” canton La Maná, it was determined that the residents suffer mostly from osteoarthritis, arthritis and tendinitis, in addition, it was determined that the gerontological center does not have the necessary equipment to treat these diseases. The use of this prototype will help to reduce muscle aches and pains caused by stiffness in the joints of the elderly and will elevate their mood through a multimedia system that encourages them to continue with the exercises, and it will also facilitate the physiotherapist staff in the monitoring of their patients through the use of the web application via the IoT. The prototype was validated through technical tests performed in each activity of the established methodology; it was found that the structural design is functional and stable to support the weight of the patient, the embedded system controls the multimedia system effectively, allowing an adequate wireless connection and the transmission of the information (physiotherapeutic exercise of the patient) to the web application, storing those records in a database.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","Communication, Smart Technologies and Innovation for Society","Álvaro Rocha, Paulo Carlos López-López, Juan Pablo Salgado-Guerrero",,2021-09-28,2021,2021-09-28,2022,252,,491-502,Closed,Chapter,"Pogo-Ateaga, Steven; Ortiz-Araujo, Cindy; Escobar-Sánchez, Milton; Andrade-Villacís, Carlos","Pogo-Ateaga, Steven (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador); Ortiz-Araujo, Cindy (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador); Escobar-Sánchez, Milton (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador); Andrade-Villacís, Carlos (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador)","Escobar-Sánchez, Milton (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador)","Pogo-Ateaga, Steven (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador); Ortiz-Araujo, Cindy (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador); Escobar-Sánchez, Milton (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador); Andrade-Villacís, Carlos (Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Latacunga, Ecuador)",1,1,,0.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141419768,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Scattered zones of productivity led early to the movement of goods on human and camelid backs along what later became well-established caravan routes. The coincidence of transhumance, pastoralism, archipelagos of production, and their linkage by caravans, may have begun first, and been first demonstrated archaeologically in Peru, but caravanning became even more pronounced in the drier parts of northern Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina – the zone often referred to as the south-central Andes. The study of the routes was initiated in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by European geographers and anthropologists, and then by anthropologists trained in, or heavily influenced by, environmentally conscious schools of thought. From the 1970s onward, anthropologists and archaeologists in Chile have been especially prominent in the study of caravans and their routes, which have persisted into modern times, using llamas, equids, and even motor vehicles. The most efficient use of the many but scattered Andean resources still involves movements of the people themselves or transportation of the goods by caravanning participants in the system, along many of the same prehispanic routes between oases and settlements, regardless of means of transport. Tropical Andean weather patterns and close altitudinal juxtaposition of environmental zones led the first human settlers to practice seasonal transhumance, which, in the Archaic period, transformed into a pattern of controlled herding, movements of plants and animals to new habitats, and, eventually, to agro-pastoralism social systems. Until the development of agriculture and storage systems, this would be the logical and obvious adjustment to the rising population, where resource zones were closely juxtaposed in the mountainous tropics. Domestication of camelids chronologically coincides with root crop cultivation and the subsequent sedentary agriculture in the Andes. Participants were deliberately chosen so as to represent a global perspective. Today, some of a scholarship is regarded as environmental determinism, but there is no doubt that American anthropology, through Alfred Kroeber and Franz Boas, was much influenced by Germanic geography in its formative years.","I thank Persis Clarkson, Calogero Santoro, and Monica Barnes who encouraged and helped me to update and revise this “working paper” meant only to stimulate discussion and debate and provide historical context for the Andean case study.

Do you support students looking ahead to life after graduation? Are you curious about how your alumni network can benefit your life? Does the alumni strategy in your organization need inspiration? This enlightening, original book reimagines graduates’ alumni status as a gateway to immense opportunities through professional and personal networks. To discover this alumni potential, Maria L. Gallo guides you through the four key traits of the 'Alumni Way’: reflection, curiosity, passion and generosity. With a sound academic foundation, combined with practical activities and checklists, 'The Alumni Way' is the ultimate resource for inspiring savvy, active alumni citizens of the world. The Alumni Way Workbook is also available. Visit www.thealumniway.com. Reimagining the alumni-university relationship, Maria Gallo explores graduates’ alumni status as a gateway to immense professional and personal networks and opportunities. One of the biggest challenges in presenting a book with broad appeal is the cultural differences in financial giving to the university. Experiences of alumni donations vary by country and size of institution. Other factors also affect financial giving, such as if the university is publicly or privately funded, tuition paid by students (if any), debt at graduation (if any), or even if the word ‘alumni’ is commonly used at all. One common thread transcends all of this: funding dominates the discussions, policies, and decision making across higher education. From the debates on who pays for higher education, to diversifying income streams, regardless of the system or funding structure, money is on the agenda. Alumni, enter stage left. The alumni and philanthropy are intertwined, especially alumni financial donations to their alma mater. So much so that it’s ubiquitous. ‘Most universities maintain a fairly active alumni network,’ writes David Burkus in his bestselling book on networking, Friend of a Friend. Burkus continued his point with the explanation: ‘(they see it as a source of future donations)’.1 Burkus is saying what many of us are thinking: universities are engaging with us, as alumni, ultimately to solicit a donation from us in the future. The add-on ‘T’ – ties – to the common time, talent, and treasure definition of philanthropy, is not far behind. Alumni also give from their personal or professional network. The main beneficiary becomes our alma mater or fellow alumni. With an overall theme of generosity, we will examine treasure and ties from a slightly radical perspective.",,,,The Alumni Way,Maria L.

Mental health problems of women during reproductive age in LA are a serious but under-recognized public health problem, impacting maternal, infant, and child health as well as infant morbidity and mortality. Although advances have been made in the improvement of mental health of women in LA in the last decades, the modernization of systems and the integration of new resources require us to create new projects. WARMI (Woman in Quechua-Aymara), a network of professionals, arises from the need to integrate and improve communication between the people who work to promote mental health of women in LA and globally. Through a well-established structure, WARMI offers a common platform using social media as a new resource, increasing the possibility of shared projects by avoiding silos that decrease productivity. Professionals from various specialties (e.g., psychiatry, psychology, nursing, sociology, advocacy groups, and public and private institutions in LA) who advocate for the women’s lives, health, access to work, education, autonomy, reproduction, relationships, violence, and discrimination among others topics, have joined in a multidisciplinary project. Following the guidance that predecessors have delineated, WARMI is dedicated not only to the improvement of services, but to health promotion, public health, health policy, and the broad determinants of health in women. Effective multidisciplinary participation and working with women in different countries is essential to improve women’s mental health. In this chapter, we will provide the rationale for the creation of WARMI, its structure and development, and the future direction of this network of professionals dedicated to improving mental health of women in the region.",,,,Innovations in Global Mental Health,Samuel O.

The mechanism to carry out this recovery is through electrical stimulation, which requires the patient to move to rehabilitation centers. The most serious problem arises when patients cannot move to these centers, causing the delay in the recovery of the muscle, the proposal presented is a system that electrically stimulates the muscle and can monitor its recovery, as well as record the evolution of muscle activity, through a remote control and monitoring through an Internet connection, with this it is possible to recover the muscle without the physical presence of the physiotherapy staff, in the task of positioning the sensors and electrodes, you can resort to a family member who is previously trained, allowing to perform a telemedicine technique.

A quantitative, analytical study, with a primary source of information; 252 adults were selected by the Agencia para la Reincorporación y Normalización [Agency for Reintegration and Standardization] throughout the national territory. Participants were asked about their perceived quality of life, which was related to demographic, family and health characteristics. A analysis univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis was conducted in order to explore crude and adjusted prevalence ratios, using logistic regression in an explanatory model. Of the participants, 15% were not satisfied with their quality of life. Dissatisfaction was strongly associated with being a woman, being without a partner, living with non-functional families and having functional dependence. Quality of life is an individual perception that can be affected by material or objective conditions, making it necessary to reinforce and implement social policies that promote the reduction of social gaps by developing equality in the living conditions of the ex-combatants who are involved in the reintegration process.","This publication is carried out within the framework of the project “Strengthening the provision of services to ex-combatants over 50 years of age, in the process of reintegration belonging to the Agencia para la Reincorporación y Normalización (ARN), formerly the Agencia Colombiana para la Reintegración (ACR).

My analysis suggest that llama caravanners in late prehispanic Nasca society share some of the characteristics commonly associated with other caravanner groups found across environmentally similar desert zones further south in the Andes. Physical evidence from excavations at the late prehispanic settlement of Huayuri points to caravans in Nasca being organized in the lowlands. An analysis of various indicators from the excavations at Huayuri, including the presence of ceramic bells, strongly suggests involvement by some of Huayuri’s households in the organization of llama caravans. Faunal assemblages and artifacts provide further insights into the role these caravanners played in late prehispanic Nasca society. Finally, the regional distribution of similar bells suggests that caravanner groups comparable to Huayuri’s were involved in supplying cargo services from Ica, Nasca, and Acari to other Inca Road stations across the south coast of Peru.","Fieldwork at Huayuri was made possible by the financial support of the National Science Foundation (Doctoral Improvement Grant for the Social Sciences, award #0121756), the Tinker Foundation through the Center of Latin American Studies of the University of Pittsburgh awards, and the Maskay Pacha NGO.117",,,Caravans in Socio-Cultural Perspective,,,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,,,,105-121,Closed,Chapter,"Siveroni, Viviana","Siveroni, Viviana ()",,"Siveroni, Viviana ()",2,2,,2.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143413015,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

There is an important modernist legacy from Colombian architects such as Roberto Acosta Madiedo Portilla, José Rodrigo De Vivero Amador, Miguel Rafael Farah Zakzuk, among others, who are the exponents of this modern architecture, thanks to their ability to conquer the emerging social elite of the agricultural economic boom, interpret cultural legacy, and reflect on landscape, geography, and climate. This investigation is supported by a meticulous search for historical facts and files associated with a diligent architectural survey campaign, which allows to reveal the essence. The following critical lecture reveals the important effort of young architects in the 1950s and 1960s, their commitment to combine elements derived from the vernacular tradition with the new and exciting language built on modernist paradigms.

This hallmark economic, technological, social, and political mechanism encompassed a broad range of social interaction. As elsewhere, Andean caravanning was a specialized institution embedded in the pastoral lifeways and economy of highland camelid herders. The archaeological detection of caravan activity is usually seen as an expression of the primary agency of those who undertake the trips, i.e., drovers and their droves. The planning and operation of caravan movements involved social, political, and religious regulatory arrangements within the caravanners’ networks. This included non-caravanner territories, such as the lowland northern Atacama Desert (18º–19º S, Arica coast and valleys, up to 2,000 m asl), inhabited by agricultural and coastal communities whose residential and funerary contexts lack most of the caravan kit items, e.g., bells, tie toggles, and halters, while caravan features, e.g., trails, rest stops, ceremonial sites, and images (mainly on rock art) are ubiquitous. This differential distribution of caravanning materiality is consistent with the fact that these lowland populations were not caravanners, but at the same time suggests they were inserted into caravan networks playing key supporting roles.","The archaeological analysis and the ethnographic fieldwork in Visviri is the result of FONDECYT 1201687 (Valenzuela, Cases, Santoro, Urrutia, Leiva, Clarkson, and Oyaneder) and Anillo SOC1405 (Valenzuela, Santoro) grants.

This multidimensional model of peace recognizes the relevance to the analysis of peace-building efforts of psychosocial processes alongside economic, political, legal, cultural, environmental, and security processes. The chapter reviews studies that have examined the psychosocial dimension of peace in the context of the Colombian armed conflict in order to explore interrelationships among the dimensions of the model. It first outlines the need for a multidimensional model of peace and defines each of its dimensions. The chapter then reviews social and political psychology research conducted in the context of the Colombian armed conflict in order to highlight the relevance of the biopsychosocial dimension of peace in peace-building settings.

Caravan rest areas are places where long-distance caravans stop for one or more days to rest, repair travel gear, and re-organize the cargo. It is argued that rest areas offer good opportunities for exploring how ancient caravans handled logistical and territorial issues under different historical circumstances, besides providing valuable information about herders’ society and cosmology. A general description of llama caravan routes and the activity settings associated with them is presented. Rest areas are characterized ethnoarchaeologically, emphasizing their location, use, and material configuration. Building on this information, the role of rest areas in the logistics of long-distance caravans, in the territorial negotiations associated with routes, in the interaction between herders and deities, and in the reproduction of a sense of community among pastoralists from different regions is offered.",,,,Caravans in Socio-Cultural Perspective,,,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,,,,20-38,Closed,Chapter,"Nielsen, Axel E.","Nielsen, Axel E.

By the Late Intermediate Period (AD 900–1450), populations of the Atacama Desert had developed agro-pastoralism systems, villages, and social complexity. The different cultural groups inhabiting northern Chile exchanged and traded resources, as demonstrated by the presence of exotic and foreign objects in local domestic and funerary sites. Even though these exchanges have been associated with the existence of caravan systems, questions remain regarding the identity of the people moving, where they came from, their cultural identities and social conditions. Here, analyses of δ13C and δ15N were conducted on tooth enamel and bone collagen and apatite to develop our understanding of these issues with different groups within the Pica-Tarapacá Cultural Complex. Our results suggest diet was highly variable and directly related to the geographical location inhabited by the different cultural groups. We also identified isotopic outliers of different ages and sex, who we characterize as non-local individuals. This study suggest mobility was diverse and dynamic and extended to adult men and women, as well as children, who relocated to local sites from different regions in the South Central Andes. This chapter utilizes stable isotope analysis in order to understand human diet and mobility patterns in coastal and inland groups from the Atacama Desert. Stable isotope analyses were carried out on different human tissues from individuals belonging to Coastal and Inland groups associated with the Pica-Tarapacá Cultural Complex. The different cultural groups inhabiting northern Chile exchanged and traded resources, as demonstrated by the presence of exotic and foreign objects in local domestic and funerary sites. Different economic specializations were intensively developed in each of the geographical zones related to the Pica-Tarapaca Cultural Complex. The economy of Pica was principally based on agricultural activities combined with the production of pottery and textiles. Isotopic variation indicated non-local diets in some individuals compared to local averages. Some of these non-local individuals maintained their original diets even though they moved to a new place, while others changed to the local diet traditions.","The authors would like to thank projects FONDECYT Nº3180317, Nº1181829, and Nº1191452.",,,Caravans in Global Perspective,,,2021-11-02,2021,2021-11-02,,,,32-52,Closed,Chapter,"Santana-Sagredo, Francisca; Lee-Thorp, Julia; Schulting, Rick; Uribe, Mauricio; Harrod, Chris","Santana-Sagredo, Francisca (); Lee-Thorp, Julia (); Schulting, Rick (); Uribe, Mauricio (); Harrod, Chris ()",,"Santana-Sagredo, Francisca (); Lee-Thorp, Julia (); Schulting, Rick (); Uribe, Mauricio (); Harrod, Chris ()",1,1,,0.23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142377547,37 Earth Sciences; 3702 Climate Change Science; 44 Human Society,

The chapter presents a concept of a Lyapunov functional for generalized ODEs. The concept of variational stability for ordinary differential equations was introduced by H. Okamura in 1943, who called it strong stability. The chapter presents direct methods of Lyapunov for uniform stability and for uniform asymptotic stability of the trivial solution of the measure differential equations. It examines the concepts of Lyapunov stability in the framework of dynamic equations on time scales.

Colombia joined the OECD in 2018 despite great political, economic, social, and cultural differences between the country and other members of the organization. Progress has been made on a range of issues, but there remain challenges in developing strategies to strengthen the productive potential of the country generating more and better opportunities for local economic development LED. Colombia counts with a broad and diverse base of natural resources, including land, water, and biological diversity together with an emerging economyand availability of human resources. However, its economy is still very dependent on extractive industries and the primary sector. Moreover, social and economic inequalities between the 1,122 Colombian municipalities challenge the joint growth of the regions. The research analyses the possibility to create from the LED alternatives to promote bioeconomy in the frame of the TH focus in Colombia using a bottom-up problem understanding strategy. Two key questions are explored: What are the characteristics that describe TH actors in Colombia to motivate advances in bioeconomy? With the advances that exist in the production of the bioeconomy in Colombia, is it possible through bioeconomy strategies to generate LED? To answer the above, the bottom-up model will be followed, considering the local spaces as the beginning point to move towards bioeconomic impact in the local.",,,"Palgrave Studies in Democracy, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship for Growth","Science, Technology, and Higher Education","Luis Antonio Orozco, Gonzalo Ordóñez-Matamoros, Jaime Humberto Sierra-González, Javier García-Estévez, Isabel Bortagaray",,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,2021,,,115-150,Closed,Chapter,"Rojas-Jimenez, Hector Heraldo","Rojas-Jimenez, Hector Heraldo (Universidad Externado de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia)","Rojas-Jimenez, Hector Heraldo (Universidad Externado de Colombia)","Rojas-Jimenez, Hector Heraldo (Universidad Externado de Colombia)",1,1,,0.62,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142007868,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,10 Reduced Inequalities

This chapter aims to explore whether the ideological rhetoric in government discourse during the post-agreement period created frameworks for building a culture of peace that facilitates social reconciliation. Two studies were carried out based on official posts made by the presidents on Twitter. The first study compares the discourses of the two administrations. The second presents a chronological analysis of the discourse in posts made by the last presidential administration. Results revealed that cognitive and emotional frameworks were aimed at social reconciliation and forgiveness in the Santos administration (peace with reconciliation) and at security and protection in the Duque administration (peace with legality). In conclusion, despite the rhetoric expressing the desire for peace, the cognitive and emotional frameworks of the government discourse during the second presidential administration do not encourage reconciliation and the recategorization of the adversary in political arenas. In that context of delegitimization, the construction of a peace culture transcends the agreement with the FARC-EP and warns against the escalation of conflict.",The author would like to express their sincere gratitude to Laura Sofía Santamaría Uribe for assistance in data collection.

El congreso nació y creció durante la “inesperada” pandemia, la cual ha arrebatado mucho, no obstante, para las ingenieras e ingenieros, quienes siempre piensan en soluciones para todos los problemas, también se ha convertido en un reto. El I CICI es una muestra de ello; organizado completamente virtual, gracias a las maravillosas telecomunicaciones, la red de internet, los dispositivos físicos y lógicos, que hacen que el mundo esté conectado, pese a la desconexión social causada por un virus.Es posible preguntarse ¿por qué el Congreso se enfocó en Ciencia e Ingeniería? En aras de responder, debe recordarse que la etimología concede a los profesionales del área, el “ingenio en la manera de producir”. Por tanto, ellas y ellos se convierten en los científicos del progreso y las llaves que abren las puertas de todas las áreas del saber, ayudan a la humanidad a superar barreras mediante su pasión por la eficiencia.En virtud de lo anterior, después de un largo y riguroso proceso de selección, se aceptaron 67 trabajos investigativos para presentarse como ponencias durante los días del evento. Las presentaciones se realizaron en las siguientes líneas temáticas:• Ambiente y desarrollo sostenible.• Diseño construcción de obras de infraestructura para el desarrollo urbano y rural.• Gestión de procesos.• Sistemas mecatrónicos.• Ciencias de la computación e informática.• Enseñanza en ingeniería.• Ingeniería y Covid-19.Durante el evento se demostró cómo en las Facultades de Ingeniería se crean métodos y estrategias para la preservación de los recursos medio ambientales, se programa el futuro, se diseña estructuras y obras seguras, se automatizan prototipos y optimizan los procesos. Así las cosas, el libro presenta un total de 13 capítulos, producto de las ponencias mejor evaluadas por cada una de las áreas.Esta iniciativa fortalece los procesos de producción de conocimiento, investigación y generación de ciencia en la Universidad Mariana y en todos los lugares en los cuales fue recibida la invitación, que se miró evidenciada en la extensa programación del Congreso. Finalmente, se motiva a niñas, niños y adolescentes a conocer el asombroso cosmos de la Ingeniería, porque pese a todas las bondades de la profesión, Colombia y el mundo aún necesitan más estudiantes de Ingeniería e ingenieros(as) graduados.",,,,,,,2021-08-17,2021,2021-08-17,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Zuleta-Medina, Alejandra; Pantoja-Agreda, Carlos; Valencia-Enríquez, Diego; Gómez-Meneses, Fabio Camilo; Hernández-Pantoja, Giovanni Albeiro; Huertas-Delgado, Jenny Lucía; Torres-Martínez, Luz Nathalia","Zuleta-Medina, Alejandra (); Pantoja-Agreda, Carlos (); Valencia-Enríquez, Diego (); Gómez-Meneses, Fabio Camilo (); Hernández-Pantoja, Giovanni Albeiro (); Huertas-Delgado, Jenny Lucía (); Torres-Martínez, Luz Nathalia ()",,"Zuleta-Medina, Alejandra (); Pantoja-Agreda, Carlos (); Valencia-Enríquez, Diego (); Gómez-Meneses, Fabio Camilo (); Hernández-Pantoja, Giovanni Albeiro (); Huertas-Delgado, Jenny Lucía (); Torres-Martínez, Luz Nathalia ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140484809,,

Some questions need to be answered, such as: What is QLW? What criteria define it? How to measure it? The interest in QLW encouraged the wide proposition of models, as well as a high variety of practical actions with a view to its promotion. However, it appears that the interest in the theme did not resonate with the same intensity with regard to the construction of measurement instruments. Although there are scale options for measuring QLW, they vary widely in terms of quality and theoretical support. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the QLW measures in the literature, discussing their coherence with the theoretical contributions that support them and verifying their possible indications of use for specific contexts. It is expected to offer an overview of the evaluation strategies available to researchers and organizations that aim to carry out actions to improve QLW, controlling its effectiveness through reliable instruments.",,,,Assessing Organizational Behaviors,"Magno Oliveira Macambira, Helenides Mendonça, Maria das Graças Torres Paz",,2021-12-14,2021,2021-12-14,2022,,,143-171,Closed,Chapter,"Carneiro, Laila Leite; Paz, Maria das Graças Torres","Carneiro, Laila Leite (Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brazil); Paz, Maria das Graças Torres (University of Brasília, Brasília, DF, Brazil)","Carneiro, Laila Leite (Federal University of Bahia)","Carneiro, Laila Leite (Federal University of Bahia); Paz, Maria das Graças Torres (University of Brasília)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143851010,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Whitehead and Merleau-Ponty were both influenced by Bergson, and they also extend his critique and arrived at independent, but complimentary, conceptions of epochal time. In particular, Kirkpatrick argues that while Whitehead provides a metaphysical account of epochal time, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, with his revised conception of intentionality, phenomenological reduction, and being-in-the-world, provides a means of comprehending epochal time in terms of embodiment. Clarifying the “atomic” nature of epochal time, Kirkpatrick considers Whitehead’s eternal objects together with Merleau-Ponty’s adoption of Gestalt psychology, and argues that epochal time can be characterized as a “bracketed” time in particular ways.",,,Palgrave Perspectives on Process Philosophy,Process Cosmology,"Andrew M.

The chronological distribution of radiocarbon dates indicates an early colonization of the southern end of this large territory (ca. 8600 years BP), a gap of information between ca. 6000 and 5000 years BP, and a re-colonization from ca. 5000 years BP onwards. The oldest settlements in the region offer shallow records in the Early and Middle Holocene, according to the archaeological record of 4 main loci: site 1 of Casa de Piedra locality in the Mid Colorado River Basin microregion, Tapera Moreira site 1 located in the Chadileuvú-Curacó Basin microregion, El Carmel located in the Valles Transversales microregion and Cerro de los Viejos located in Bajos sin Salida microregion. The human groups settled in spaces where resources were concentrated, but circulated in landscapes with varied topographies. This situation turns to be more complex in the Late Holocene, when a demographic growth is recorded. During this stage, climatic conditions stabilize, the exploitation of local resources is emphasized, formal burial structures appear, and increase the presence of extra-regional elements such as alloctonus rocks, mineral raw materials, pottery, ornaments and foreign people as a sign of large-scale interactions. In this stage the Mid Colorado River Basin microregion is repopulated, the occupation of the Chadileuvú-Curacó microregion continues and new microregions are occupied, such as Southern Pampean Hills, Bajos sin Salida and Valles Transversales microregions.","This research was funded by grants PIP 0834 and UBACyT F-540.

Sustainable Branding considers how broader perspectives on sustainability and corporate social responsibility can be applied to the practicalities of brand management. By addressing a range of perspectives and their application to branding, the authors go beyond sustainable branding to question the role brands play in a wider sustainable society. Structured around three core parts – People, Planet, and Prosperity – contributions from experts in the field consider the human dimensions of environmental change, identity and reputation, technology and innovation, waste management, public and brand engagement, environmental ecosystems, and the circular economy. Combining theoretical insight and empirical research with practical application, each chapter includes real-life international cases and reflective questions to allow discussion, best-practice examples, and actionable suggestions on how to implement sustainable branding activities. This book is perfect for academics, postgraduate, and final-year undergraduate students in sustainable branding, sustainable business, corporate social responsibility, brand management, and communications.

It shows that caravans for long-distance trade in arid lands are present in both the Old and New Worlds. Alongside historical and archival records, ethnographic analyses of modern caravans provide theoretical frameworks for reconstructing aspects of ancient caravans such as behavior, ritual, and material culture. The volume reflects on the changing foci of caravan research and the future of caravans when memories of living caravanners are fading, and the fragile and remote nature of caravan-related sites means that they are at risk. It will be relevant to scholars from anthropology, archaeology, and history, and others with an interest in trade, travel, and nomadism. Decades of fieldwork by archaeologists, ethnographers, historians, bioanthropologists, and art historians on five continents were brought together for a long-overdue discussion about caravans in 2017, with the ensuing genesis of the two volumes Caravans in Socio-Cultural Perspective: Past and Present and Caravans in Global Perspective: Contexts and Boundaries. Caravans may be a fading nostalgia of the past in many parts of the world, but the legacies and vibrancies of lifetimes of traveling with pack animals and on foot have prompted reinterpretations about the past as well as sounding an alarm about the fading legacies of caravans that come to use through landscapes and humans alike.",,,,,,,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143413002,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Their stories intersect with regards to their Pan-African impact in Southern and West Africa, where they mobilized a transnational struggle against oppressive regimes. Stokely and Onkgopotse are two important names in the struggle against colonialism.

In this way, the implementation of modern sustainable agriculture is essential to prevent soil degradation as measures to guarantee food security, propose sustainable rural development and protect the provision of different ecosystem services associated with the soil. NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) launched September 15, 2018, offers new possibilities for the mapping of global terrain and vegetation. An additional science objective is to measure vegetation canopy height as a basis for estimating large-scale biomass and biomass change. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICESat-2 utilizes a photon-counting LIDAR and ancillary systems (GPS and star cameras) to measure the time a photon takes to travel from ATLAS to Earth and back again and to determine the photon’s geodetic latitude and longitude. ICESat-2 ATL08 (Along-Track-Level) data product is developed for vegetation mapping with algorithms for along-track elevation profile of terrain and canopy heights retrieval of the from ATLAS point clouds.

Approaches from the Global North generally deal with the issue of child labor by imposing the abolitionist stance promoted by the International Labour Organization and adopted by, for example, the Peruvian state. Abolitionism proposes that child labor must be eradicated because it limits the development of working children and adolescents. In this essay the abolitionist approach is contrasted with the value-based approach used by the Movement of Working Children and Adolescents and Children of Christian Workers. The latter approach is supported by the theory of the coloniality of power, which considers work to be an activity that dignifies and contributes to families’ economic and social well-being.",,,,The Oxford Handbook of Global South Youth Studies,"Sharlene Swartz, Adam Cooper, Clarence M.

The chapter is a chronicle of how an erstwhile pure white and outright racist town transformed into a provincial capital city in a non-racial society with a completely new identity to become possibly one of the most integrated cities of its size in the country. The chapter first provides a historical context to the colonial birth and growth of the apartheid city. The focus then turns to a review of the first attempts to undo the spatial legacy of apartheid through urban planning in the 1990s through the 1998 land development objectives which laid the foundation for the first spatial development framework (SDF) of 2007. The chapter concludes by documenting residential desegregation as the city’s most distinctive contemporary characteristic. Whereas black residents were the minorities in the past, they were expected to become the majority as socio-economic mobility takes place and more black families become middle class. By 2016 the percentage of black home-owners had increased dramatically in some suburbs where they represented more than three quarters of the residents, for example Flora Park (79%) and Penina Park (77%) whereas Ivy Park (90%) was almost completely re-segregated.",,,GeoJournal Library,South African Urban Change Three Decades After Apartheid,"Anthony Lemon, Ronnie Donaldson, Gustav Visser",,2021-06-11,2021,2021-06-11,2021,,,149-161,Closed,Chapter,"Donaldson, Ronnie","Donaldson, Ronnie (Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa)","Donaldson, Ronnie (Stellenbosch University)","Donaldson, Ronnie (Stellenbosch University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138770803,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

For example, in Peru, drinking water chlorination systems exhibit a large number of deficiencies from the dosing process to the monitoring of chlorine volumes in storage tanks. In fact, as the water tanks are often far from communities, chlorine solution levels are hardly ever properly monitored. Therefore, the system proposed in this paper will allow users to monitor the real-time chlorinated solution volume levels in drinking water systems, thus, rendering their operations effective. The design of the prototype relies on an intelligent two-way system comprising of a sender and a receiver. Both parts are Arduino-based and communicate with each other via a long-range wireless transmission protocol. In addition, the system features low energy consumption and uses cloud connectivity for storing chlorination process information.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Proceedings of the 6th Brazilian Technology Symposium (BTSym’20),"Yuzo Iano, Osamu Saotome, Guillermo Kemper, Ana Claudia Mendes de Seixas, Gabriel Gomes de Oliveira",,2021-06-15,2021,2021-06-15,2021,233,,766-773,Closed,Chapter,"Sánchez Peña, Marco Alfredo; Dobbertin Sánchez, Segundo; López Martos, Rosa","Sánchez Peña, Marco Alfredo (Environmental Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

In urban conditions, the typical rural weather files should be modified to take into account the microclimatic effects in urban areas. This chapter presents an overview of the most relevant effects to be considered: shadows, long-wave exchange, urban heat island, urban ventilation patterns, and urban greening, presenting a modelling chain procedure developed by the authors and to be used in TRNSYS tool, as well as the result of simulations done for the cases of Rome (Italy) and Antofagasta (Chile). This chapter presents the weather file morphing approach and a general strategy to include urban effects in building performance simulation, plus the results of the application to case studies in Antofagasta and Rome. While performing building energy simulations, weather data are among the most important pieces of information needed by models and tools. The weather file morphing is just one of the aspects to be considered when performing building simulation in urban environments. A very different strategy should be followed when simulating individual buildings located in a specific site. The local climate zones approach classifies neighbourhoods in categories based on types of urban morphology and land use. For urban applications, two simulation models should be coupled at least: an atmospheric model and a building energy model.

The mainstream is focussed on successful development, paying little attention to firms and regions that do not perform well and thus neglecting that the success of some may be tied to the failure of others. This chapter makes a contribution to overcoming the inclusionary bias in order to better understand the prospects of peripheral regions in GPNs. It is inspired by an increasingly vivid academic debate about ‘disarticulations’. The author applies this perspective to Bolivia’s oil and gas supply industry. He shows that the sector has shifted to a turn-key model, which accounts for the rise of foreign engineering, procurement and construction companies that now capture value at the expense of local suppliers. The latter are downgraded or outright expelled from the corresponding networks. Context factors reinforce the increasingly poor outcomes for Bolivian firms. Many never manage to plug into oil and gas GPNs because of high entry barriers, which even apply to services as generic as catering and transport. However, the chapter also indicates that the disarticulations perspective is itself somewhat biased.

Also, it is considered the third most used structural metal after aluminum and iron. Regarding its extraction mechanisms, leaching is the most crucial stage for Mg extraction, the most common lixiviants being inorganic and organic acids and ammonium salts.

Digital tools are necessary for performance and social interaction. This research study sought to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of the first year of computational systems engineering at the Universidad Privada del Norte – Cajamarca, specifically with regard to phubbing. The study was nonexperimental in nature, followed a correlate descriptive approach, and was of longitudinal design with two observations (cycles 2019-2 and 2020-1). The Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas measurement scale was used for the assessment of phubbing, which was validated in pilot testing (α = 0.8512). Academic performance was obtained from the final averages of the Programming subject, where the phubbing survey was applied with the voluntary participation of students. Correlation results determined no positive relationship between phubbing level and performance level; hence, the variable situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, which modified the academic space, was analyzed in accordance with the needs associated with this environment and the life of students. The level of phubbing in students decreased from 40.33% to 35.51%, while their performance level increased from 12.98 and 13 to 14.48 and 15 in terms of average and median, respectively. The aspects of phubbing were evaluated with a coherent perception, reaffirming the validity of the instrument. Educational policies that promote positive smartphone use are required to improve academic performance.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Proceedings of the 6th Brazilian Technology Symposium (BTSym’20),"Yuzo Iano, Osamu Saotome, Guillermo Kemper, Ana Claudia Mendes de Seixas, Gabriel Gomes de Oliveira",,2021-06-15,2021,2021-06-15,2021,233,,130-136,Closed,Chapter,"Uceda, Patricia; Bazán, Laura; López, Rosa","Uceda, Patricia (Perú Environmental Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

In this context, the objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of granulometry on the physicochemical and sensory properties of green banana peel flour-based snacks for two treatments in order to determine the acceptability of the product. 4 samples were prepared (AC-100, AC-140, A-100, A-140), with AC being the treatment of flour extraction with metabisulphite at 0.01% plus citric acid 0.5%. To the technique of extraction of flour in water, the coding of 100 and 140 are the mesh number used for standardization. The results indicate that granulometry influences both the humidity and color of the snack; the lower the granulometry, the higher the percentage of humidity, higher values of L* and b*, but lower values of a*. The sensory analysis determined that treatments with higher granulometry have a darker color and mild crispness, the most acceptable sample being that of treatment A-140.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Proceedings of the 6th Brazilian Technology Symposium (BTSym’20),"Yuzo Iano, Osamu Saotome, Guillermo Kemper, Ana Claudia Mendes de Seixas, Gabriel Gomes de Oliveira",,2021-06-15,2021,2021-06-15,2021,233,,732-739,Closed,Chapter,"Cruzado-Muñoz, Lizbeth; Valdiviezo-Quipuscoa, Deysi; Lujan, Guillermo Linares","Cruzado-Muñoz, Lizbeth (Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Perú); Valdiviezo-Quipuscoa, Deysi (Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Perú); Lujan, Guillermo Linares (National University of Trujillo, Trujillo, Perú)","Cruzado-Muñoz, Lizbeth (Private University of the North)","Cruzado-Muñoz, Lizbeth (Private University of the North); Valdiviezo-Quipuscoa, Deysi (Private University of the North); Lujan, Guillermo Linares (National University of Trujillo)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138863366,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",

Exposition to heat in some cases can lead to death, as experimented in many European countries during the heat waves of 2003, that reported a total of about 70,000 deaths. Heat stress is defined as the ratio of evaporation needed to maintain the thermal balance of the human body respect to the maximum of evaporation that could be achieved in specific environmental conditions. It depends on the air temperature, the relative humidity, the mean radiant temperature and the air speed. In indoor conditions, a severe heat stress is defined as the condition when the evaporation rate needed is in the range 40–60% of the maximum. Starting from these conditions, air-conditioning is required. So, heat stress and energy needs of buildings are strictly related. A Green Infrastructure has many benefits for inhabitants of cities. Among them, the reduction of probability of heat stress in both outdoor and indoor conditions. Recent studies underlined also the possible role of the trees in controlling the solar radiation gains of buildings through windows. In this paper we focus on the evaluation of the indoor heat stress index for the case of Santiago de Chile, and its relation with cooling needs a typical building. Then, the reduction of heat stress index and energy needs provided by a raw of trees on West building’s façade is assessed. We tested the benefit obtained by using different species, characterized by different morphology and solar permeability to solar radiation. Trees’ permeability is obtained by fish-eye image analysis done using the Gap Light Analyser software. Building simulations to obtain heat stress index and energy needs are run out using TRNSYS v. 17 software. Results confirm the capability of a GI to reduce indoor heat stress probability and energy needs in a 20–40%.",,,Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,Innovation in Urban and Regional Planning,"Daniele La Rosa, Riccardo Privitera",,2021-05-11,2021,2021-05-11,2021,146,,439-447,Closed,Chapter,"Palme, Massimo","Palme, Massimo (Universidad Católica Del Norte, Centro de Investigación Tecnológica del Agua en el Desierto, Antofagasta, Chile)","Palme, Massimo (Catholic University of the North)","Palme, Massimo (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137885873,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In this research, a systematic review was carried out in which it was based on the analysis of 30 selected scientific articles, obtained from reliable databases, such as Ebsco, scielo. Etc., for the development of the research problem following our stated objective. Therefore, the data were analyzed and the most relevant data for this research were extracted. To make a foundation, the main thing that is done in a construction site, is to carry out an adequate soil study, that is, to do tests that allow knowing the physical and chemical properties of the land where the project is going to be carried out, it also seeks to determine the appearance of chlorine, sulfates, the degree of acidity and finally its stratigraphic composition, that is, the characteristics of its deep soil strata. That is why, if this soil analysis is not carried out, it will most likely have construction failures. So, according to the results shown, it can be said that soil analysis for foundations plays a very important role in planning a construction project. This helps to improve the soil, if necessary and if the results provided in the laboratory tests show it, to increase the bearing capacity of the soil, since all the loads will be transmitted to it through the foundations or other improvements.

In this investigation, the electricity service company had information losses, some readings could not be carried out on the scheduled dates, generating delays in the other processes of the company, which ended in billing delays, affecting user satisfaction. These problems motivated the development of a web system to control the reading of electricity meters and their impact on the company. The research was of an applied type with a quasi-experimental design, where 6000 monthly records of meters were observed, distributed in control and experimental groups. Finally, in the Wilcoxon test, an Alpha= 0.007 was obtained, less than 0.05, so the web information system managed to significantly influence the results of the company's energy consumption measurement reading control. The implementation of software in data collection is the first step towards the digitization and automation of processes, thus saving time and money for any company since it has been shown that significant improvements in performance and efficiency can be achieved of the processes that have been implemented.

Consequently, universities have developed strategies that involve social isolation, thus modifying their operations during this period to transform to non-classroom courses. Two types of courses have been developed due to the need to embrace these methods quickly: the Online Learning (OL) course, which was created before the pandemic began, and Remote Teaching (RT) courses, created during this period. This research measures differences in the levels of academic acceptance and recommendations among students regarding both types of non-classroom courses. We evaluated 477 OL classes and 1,597 RT classes conducted in the School of Engineering at Universidad Privada del Norte-Peru. Results show significant differences (p < 0.05) in satisfaction between both types of courses. Our analysis shows that RT courses have a higher level of acceptance among students.",We wish to thank Universidad Privada del Norte for providing us with the resources and necessary information to carry out this research.,,,2021 IEEE World Conference on Engineering Education (EDUNINE),,,2021-03-17,2021,,2021-03-17,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Oblitas, Jimy; Jorge, Jhon","Oblitas, Jimy (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú); Jorge, Jhon (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú)",,"Oblitas, Jimy (Private University of the North); Jorge, Jhon (Private University of the North)",4,2,,3.66,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138186537,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

To prevent this pandemic, some countries placed severe resection in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others took a moderate approach, e.g., mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies for not having a sophisticated public-health infrastructure. Since the social interactions between people are primarily affected by the lockdown; psychological distress, e.g., anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in order to understand people’s interaction over the months of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) that declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. Therefore, the result demonstrate that the South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the overall psychological distress.",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Trends and Applications in Information Systems and Technologies,"Álvaro Rocha, Hojjat Adeli, Gintautas Dzemyda, Fernando Moreira, Ana Maria Ramalho Correia",,2021-03-29,2021,2021-03-29,2021,1366,,274-283,Closed,Chapter,"Chire-Saire, Josimar E.; Mahmood, Khalid; Oblitas-Cruz, Jimy; Ahmed, Tanvir","Chire-Saire, Josimar E.

For this, the descriptive and correlational cross-sectional nonexperimental basic research first sought to characterize the level of teacher self-efficacy according to gender, career in which the teacher teaches classes, age and then analyze if there was a correlation with the level of satisfaction of the students with the courses received. For this, two instruments were used, the first the university teacher self-efficacy test, which had a high level of reliability equal to 0.996 and the rubric of satisfaction level of the courses taught by the teachers, typical of the university, which also presented high levels of consistency, demonstrated by a Cronbach's Alpha equal to 0.997. After using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, it was determined that the teachers had high levels of self-efficacy, but this did not show a correlation with the level of satisfaction. Therefore, it's concluded that despite the different combinations carried out for the correlational analysis between the levels of self-efficacy and the level of student satisfaction, there is no relationship between these variables.

Validation of a short instrument of 20 items.,"The employability of recent college graduates has become a major concern globally. Studies carried out in developed countries have shown an operationalization in five dimensions of the employability construct; such as: 1) Occupational experience, 2) Anticipation and optimization, 3) Personal flexibility, 4) Corporate sense and 5) Balance. This study provides new contributions on these components by replicating [26] in a developing country, a quite different political, social and economic reality compared to other analyses. To achieve a good fit for the model, 2 items had to be eliminated, resulting in a shorter instrument consisting of only 20 items to evaluate the employability of this profile of people. The new model showed good convergent validity, however, the discriminant validity does not meet the necessary indicators for its compliance, and thus an exploratory factor analysis should be carried out, since it could be that the number of dimensions has reduced. It is also suggested to carry out more studies in order to corroborate or refute the data obtained in the present study.",,,,"The 2021 12th International Conference on E-business, Management and Economics",,,2021-07-17,2021,2021-12-02,2021-07-17,,,822-827,Closed,Proceeding,"Garcia-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Gonzalez, Marcos Enrique Flores; Morales, Evelyn Raquel Hernandez","Garcia-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Facultad de Negocios y Humanidades de la, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru); Gonzalez, Marcos Enrique Flores (UPg Ciencias Empresariales, Escuela de Posgrado, Universidad Peruana Unión, Peru); Morales, Evelyn Raquel Hernandez (UPg Ciencias Empresariales, Escuela de Posgrado, Universidad Peruana Unión, Peru)",,"Garcia-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Private University of the North); Gonzalez, Marcos Enrique Flores (Peruvian Union University); Morales, Evelyn Raquel Hernandez (Peruvian Union University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143591562,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Vaccinating the entire world population is a challenging undertaking and with demand far exceeding supply in the world, it is expected that topics surrounding vaccinations generate a wide array of discussions. Therefore, in this paper, we collect data from Twitter during the early days of the COVID-19 vaccination program and adopt a linguistic approach to better understand and appreciate peoples’ concerns and opinions with regards to the roll out of the vaccines. We begin by studying the term frequencies (i.e., unigrams and bigrams) and observe discussions around vaccination doses, receiving doses, vaccine supply, scheduling appointments and wearing masks as the vaccination efforts get underway. We then adopt a seeded topic modeling approach to automatically identify the main topics of discussion in the tweets and the main issues being discussed in each topic. We observe that our dataset has nine distinct topics. For example, we observe topics related to vaccine distribution, eligibility, scheduling and COVID variants. We then study the sentiment of the tweets with respect to each of the nine topics and observe that the overall sentiment is negative for most of the topics. We only observe a higher percentage of positive sentiment for topics related to obtaining information and schools.

The fundamental issue discussed in the introduction and throughout the book is the need to overcome current fragmentation between disciplines and knowledge on cities. A new integrated urban science could effectively support the transition of existing cities toward more sustainable environments and also change our way to envision future cities.

The obtained dielectric spectral properties can be coupled to multivariate statistical methods as ""machine learning"" when identification of attributes is wanted. However, these techniques have not been applied to andean tubers classification. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation is to evaluate the possibility of discriminating four andean tubers using dielectric spectra properties and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machine - SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors-KNN, and Linear Discriminat - LD). For this purpose, samples of Tropaeolum tuberosum (Killu isañu), Solanum tuberosa (yellow) and two varieties of Oxalis tuberosa (Puka kamusa and Lari oqa) were acquired, 30 units per tuber. The dielectric spectral profile was extracted twice for each tubers sample, in the range from 2 to 8 GHz. Then, the dielectric constant (e') were calculated, and its dimensionality was reduced using principal component analysis. Finally, models for classification were built by employing KNN, SVM and LD techniques. The results showed that three components can explain the variance at 99.6 %. Likewise, the accuracy in the discrimination values varied between 79.17 - 83.04, being SVM the best discrimination technique. Consequently, it is concluded that the technique of dielectric spectroscopy and machine learning presents potential for andean tuber discrimination.","The authors would like to thank Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Chota for funding with mining CANON funds the excecution of the research project called &quot;Desarrollo de un sistema no destructivo para la determinatión de las propiedades físicoquímicas en frutas nativas y derivados de la región Cajamarca, usando espectroscopía dieléctrica&quot; approved with resolution No 432-2018-C.O./UNACH.

To date, there is no consensus on the part of the researchers about the positive or negative effect that this variable generates in Ni and Co extractions; therefore, this research reports the results obtained by reducing a lateritic ore on a pilot plant scale, evaluating different temperature levels in the hearth 6, as the post-combustion air was fed. It was found that the injection of the post-combustion air in the reduction furnaces decreases the Ni extractions with respect to the Co extractions, the behavior is becoming more irregular by showing maximum and minimum values.

This process involves detecting and understanding clients’ and users’ needs. From this process is possible to provide clarity about the definition of the requirements to be used in the next stages of the software development. Although important, stakeholders’ collaboration in the elicitation process is scarce. In this regard, providing supporting strategies to foster collaboration in this type of process has become a motivating and challenging study area for researchers. This paper intends to define a set of gamification strategies characterized according to their contribution to stakeholders’ collaboration, communication, and participation in the requirements elicitation process.

Generate of models that represent the dynamic behavior of productive processes has the potential to contribute to understand the parameters that impact on the responses, identifying operating restrictions, distributions of the independent variables or the optimal levels of operation. This work proposes the development of regression models and ANNs models of the SAG milling process, studying the production in tons per hour, in function to 17 operational variables analyzed. The multiple regression model presents a good fit (77.45%), and the inclusion of the interactions and quadratic effects increases the coefficient of determination (89.2%), but, the neural network-based model is the one with the best fit (96.27%).",,,Advances in Sustainability Science and Technology,Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Inventive Material Science Applications,"V.

This is mainly because they are not customized methodologies and their implementation, in many cases, generates several theoretical-practical gaps and inconsistencies, which hinder their application. Therefore, we must continue to deepen our understanding of these methodologies’ application within several contexts, especially in the circumstances wherein machinery plays an important role in achieving machinery-intensive process deliverables. Accordingly, this study discusses a failure management case focusing on the machinery employed in the gold mill tailing treatment process at a gold mining process plant. This study was conducted using three of the most renowned asset management methodologies, i.e., reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), total productive maintenance (TPM), and prognostics and health management for maintenance (PHM), to produce a methodological failure management process specifically adapted to the plant situation. Through this process, the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) increased from 31% to 87%, thus contributing to broadening the practical understanding of these methodologies.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Proceedings of the 6th Brazilian Technology Symposium (BTSym’20),"Yuzo Iano, Osamu Saotome, Guillermo Kemper, Ana Claudia Mendes de Seixas, Gabriel Gomes de Oliveira",,2021-06-15,2021,2021-06-15,2021,233,,156-167,Closed,Chapter,"Vílchez-Torres, Mylena; Alejabo, Carlos Gastón Guevara; Peña, Carlos Alberto Silvera; Cacho, Roxana Elizabeth Mestanza","Vílchez-Torres, Mylena (Universidad Privada del Norte, Jr. Irene Silva 231, Cajamarca, Peru); Alejabo, Carlos Gastón Guevara (Universidad Privada del Norte, Jr. Irene Silva 231, Cajamarca, Peru); Peña, Carlos Alberto Silvera (Universidad Privada del Norte, Jr. Irene Silva 231, Cajamarca, Peru); Cacho, Roxana Elizabeth Mestanza (Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca, Av.

Since 1985 its operations have been stopped. Based on this, we determined the phytoextraction capacity of 13 heavy metals in three herbaceous species that grow in this place with the highest rate of importance value. To do this, we applied the stratified random sampling and square meter methods, where it was possible to identify 42 herbaceous species in 10 plots, of which Equisetum bogotense, Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia and Carex mandoniana were chosen. The concentration of heavy metals was analyzed from both contaminated (environmental liability) and non-contaminated (around the liability) soils of La Encañada district, as well as in herbaceous species to compare them. The highest correlation between variables was obtained from Carex mandoniana species (0.995), followed by Equisetum bogotense (0.975) and, on the other hand, Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia presented a negative inverse relationship. The Bioconcentration Factor was calculated where it turned out that the herbaceous species are exclusive; however, the Translocation Factor showed that Equisetum bogotense and Carex mandoniana are phyto-stabilizers while Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia is hyper-accumulative of heavy metals.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Proceedings of the 6th Brazilian Technology Symposium (BTSym’20),"Yuzo Iano, Osamu Saotome, Guillermo Kemper, Ana Claudia Mendes de Seixas, Gabriel Gomes de Oliveira",,2021-06-15,2021,2021-06-15,2021,233,,100-109,Closed,Chapter,"López Rodríguez, Cristina Carmela; Izquierdo Ramírez, Carlita Roxana; Lanfranco Colina, Leoncio Jaime; Ciriaco Mosqueira, Jackelin Estefani; Cervantes Peralta, Marieta Eliana; Sánchez Peña, Marco Alfredo","López Rodríguez, Cristina Carmela (Ingeniería Ambiental, Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

In this chapter the city is studied as a thermodynamic system, focusing on the properties of adaptive, complex open systems to describe the behaviour of such a structure. The general theory of complex systems is presented, and then some hypotheses are formulated to explain the evolutionary process that happens in a city as the result of two big principles operating on the system: one increasing efficiency, and the other increasing diversity. The link between thermodynamics and information theory is explored through the concept of entropy, while the city is interpreted as a negative entropy processor.

Economic growth and fiscal experiments all occur in urban contexts. Political reforms, social innovation, and protests and revolutions generate in cities. Criminal activities, terrorist actions, counterinsurgency, missile attacks (indeed, atomic bombs), and wars are centered in big cities. They are sources of global pollution as well as of environmental transformations such as urban gardening. Knowledge production, big data collection, and tech innovation all spur from intense interaction in cities. They are the meeting points between different cultures, religions, and identities. These increasingly international cities develop twinning networks and projects, share information, sign cooperation agreements, contribute to the drafting of national and international policies, provide development aid, promote assistance to refugees, and do territorial marketing through decentralized city-city or district-district cooperation. Cities do what “municipalities” used to do many centuries ago: they cooperate but also enter into intense competitive dynamics.

Two fractions of red grape skins: unfermented fresh grape skins (F) and skins from grapes after winemaking (V) were used. Extracts of both types of grape skins were prepared, and the total content of anthocyanins (by high-resolution liquid chromatography) and antioxidant capacity and color parameters (by UV‐vis spectrophotometry) were measured. Anthocyanins in extracts from grape skins dehydrated at 40 °C (F40 and V40) were more stable, with a total content of anthocyanins of 99.86 and 63.45 mg L−1, respectively. Besides, the extracts of grape skins F40 showed the highest antioxidant capacity (AC), obtaining 100% of inhibition of the radical DPPH with 1.0 g of these skins; meanwhile, the same amount of the other grape skins showed a percentage of inhibition lower than 46.01%. According to the color analysis, the extracts F40 and V40 showed the highest values of color intensity (CI of 1.21 and 0.57, respectively), as well as the highest percentage of red color (56% and 60%, respectively). In contrast, the extracts F150 and V150 showed the highest percentage of yellow color (76% and 51%, respectively), indicating a thermal degradation of anthocyanins to their colorless forms. According to the results, a greater stability at high temperatures was obtained in the fermented grape skins, which would be related to the synthesis of the most stable anthocyanin derivatives during the fermentative process.",This study was supported by the Universidad Privada del Norte (projects UPN- 20171003 and UPN-20191001).

At the same time, attitudes toward LGBT populations have changed over time, increasingly into more favorable opinions of LGBT people. However, despite this promising scenario, stigmatization, prejudice, and discrimination still persist, as well as hate crimes against LGBT people. Various studies have shown the persistence of these violence acts as a social stressor that affects the well-being and quality of life of LGBT people, who experience detrimental effects in their physical and mental health compared to non-LGBT population. The foregoing makes it essential to know the situation of each country and the region regarding this issue. Empirical LGBT research has mostly focused on Northamerican and European samples. Then, it is essential to know the situation of the Central and South regions specially Latin American countries.

The procedures of the PRISM methodology were used for the making of this paper. After an exhaustive search in scientific databases, 24 articles were selected, using as search criteria the previously mentioned period of time and terms such as “software applications”, “diagnosis”, “chronic diseases” and other related terms. As a result, we obtained that there are various approaches in the use of software applications in the diagnosis of chronic diseases and these can be organized into three categories: support for medical professionals, optimization of resources used in diagnosis and training for new doctors or practitioners. Finally, we conclude that in recent years a large amount of research has been published on the use of software applications in the diagnosis of chronic diseases, which do not try to replace medical professionals, but rather seek to complement their work to make it more efficient and accurate.",,,,2021 IEEE Engineering International Research Conference (EIRCON),,,2021-10-29,2021,,2021-10-29,00,,1-4,Closed,Proceeding,"Villanueva, Germán Villavicencio; Beltrán, Rolando Javier Berrú; García, Rómulo Rogery Vargas","Villanueva, Germán Villavicencio (Computational Systems Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú); Beltrán, Rolando Javier Berrú (Computational Systems Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú); García, Rómulo Rogery Vargas (Computational Systems Engineering, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú)",,"Villanueva, Germán Villavicencio (Private University of the North); Beltrán, Rolando Javier Berrú (Private University of the North); García, Rómulo Rogery Vargas (Private University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143537303,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this context, this article analyzes how the Covid-19 pandemic affects Ecuadorian universities in the form of a communication and marketing trial, and its influence on university actors. The Covid-19 crisis has put the processes of social structures to the test. Communication and marketing are examples of these processes that face an unprecedented and unforeseen situation. In this sense, it is intended to reflect on how the pandemic affects and will condition the practice of university communication, both internal communication and its link with society.

Deep learning has been shown as a promising methodology to address such difficult problems as food image recognition that can be considered as a fine-grained object recognition problem. We argue that, in order to continue improving performance in this task, it is necessary to better understand what the model learns instead of considering it as a black box. In this paper, we show how uncertainty analysis can help us gain a better understanding of the model in the context of the food recognition. Furthermore, we take decisions to improve its performance based on this analysis and propose a new data augmentation approach considering sample-level uncertainty. The results of our method considering the evaluation on a public food dataset are very encouraging.","This work was partially funded by TIN2018-095232-B-C21, SGR-2017 1742, Nestore ID: 769643, Validithi and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

The experience of growing up in contexts of poverty and social vulnerability is a risk factor for child and adolescent development which may produce a series of negative effects in their adulthood, including mental disorders. This is a global concern, but so far the majority of literature about the topic has focused on developed countries. This volume aims to enrich the international literature by presenting results of research carried out in developing countries, showing how children and adolescents deal with adverse and risky contexts and analyzing both negative outcomes and the development of resilience and coping strategies. The studies gathered in this volume are theoretically grounded on systemic and ecological models which analyze developmental trajectories and outcomes taking into account the interaction of different ecological systems, such as the individual, the family, the school and the wider society. Departing from this theoretical framework, the chapters in this volume analyze the risk factors posed to child and adolescent development by adverse and risky social contexts and present evidence-based interventions aimed at both preventing negative outcomes and helping children and adolescents develop coping strategies to deal with adverse situations, such as poverty and social marginalization. Child and Adolescent Development in Risky Adverse Contexts: A Latin American Perspective will be of interest to developmental, clinical, health, and educational psychologists, as well as social workers, directly working or doing research with children and adolescents in situations of social vulnerability.",,,,,"Blanca Estela Barcelata Eguiarte, Paloma Suárez Brito",,2021,2021,,2021,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,1,0,,0.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144318392,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 52 Psychology,1 No Poverty; 3 Good Health and Well Being

The flotation circuits, in charge of enriching the concentrate, generally consist of 3 stages, rougher, cleaner, and scavenger, which are made up of one or more cells, either in series or in parallel, depending on the architecture of the operational circuit. In this research, a local sensitivity analysis is developed for studying the behaviour of the stages that compose different flotation circuits. It is evaluated the concentrate grade quantifying the effect that circumstantial alteration has in the transfer rate of the concentration stages. The sensitivity analysis allows identify operation conditions that optimizing the concentrations offered by the flotation circuits. The results indicate that in simple circuits, the greatest impact on the concentration corresponds to rougher and cleaner cells, while in complex circuits (with additional cell banks), the sensitization of the rougher and cleaner cells, along with the early stages of the cleaner–scavenger cells have a greater impact on concentrate grade.",,,Advances in Sustainability Science and Technology,Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Inventive Material Science Applications,"V.

Our results show a growing military spending in the region. One possible explanation is the constant conflicts, ethnic, cultural, and religious tensions. Additionally, our findings highlight a possible link between military spending, natural resourcesNatural resources, human capitalHuman capital, and economic developmentEconomic Development. Policymakers in the MENA region have to cope with the international drop in oil prices and the slowdown in several economies. The promotion of foreign investment aimed at improving the endowment of human capital through technology transfer and the improvement of the national productive capacity could promote the achievement of the region's sustainable development objectives.",,,Perspectives on Development in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region,Economic Development in the MENA Region,Mohamed Sami Ben Ali,,2021-05-09,2021,2021-05-09,2021,,,85-99,Closed,Chapter,"Ortiz, Cristian; Alvarado, Rafael; Ben Ali, Mohamed Sami","Ortiz, Cristian (Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Carrera de Economía, Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador); Alvarado, Rafael (Carrera de Economía, Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador); Ben Ali, Mohamed Sami (College of Business and Economics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar)","Ortiz, Cristian (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Nacional de Loja)","Ortiz, Cristian (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Nacional de Loja); Alvarado, Rafael (Universidad Nacional de Loja); Ben Ali, Mohamed Sami (Qatar University)",5,3,,3.18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137859701,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

The Decline of Labour Embeddedness in Resource Peripheries,"Local development literature has generally assumed that labour force is a crucial and territorially embedded asset, the origin of social and political demands to improve the quality of life and one of the main driving forces of local change and economic development. Nowadays, this assumption is far from true, particularly in the case of resource peripheries. As it has happened with the increasing externalization of tasks to service firms located in the main urban agglomerations, a growing proportion of workers—especially those in primary industries—live far away from the resource peripheries where they produce, fostered by the increasing use of Fly-in/fly-out (FIFO) and other systems and technologies facilitating long-distance work. Furthermore, the increasing use of robotics and remote work in primary activities can turn resource peripheries into places for production, but not for social reproduction. By using some of the main elements of GPN framework, this chapter proposes an extension of resource periphery research agenda, considering this trend of declining labour territorial and social embeddedness; analyses how this trend has become a distinctive characteristic of resource peripheries; and what the consequences are for economic development in these territories.",This work has been supported by the FONDECYT Project number 1210765 “La fragmentación de la geografía del trabajo: La conmutación de larga distancia en la red de producción global de la minería en Chile” from ANID (Chile).,,Economic Geography,Resource Peripheries in the Global Economy,"Felipe Irarrázaval, Martín Arias-Loyola",,2021-10-12,2021,2021-10-12,2021,,,201-213,Closed,Chapter,"Atienza, Miguel","Atienza, Miguel (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)","Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)",5,1,,2.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141789706,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

To this end, a historical review of psychology in Peru is developed considering the different political, economic, and social turning points in two periods. The first period seeks to unveil the ideas about the psychology of the Peruvian Indian in colonial times. In the second period, the ideas about the degeneration of the Peruvian Indian at the beginning of the twentieth century are exposed. Finally, the ideas of Hipólito Unanue and Hermilio Valdizán are discussed, considering the context in which they were formulated. Both Unanue and Valdizán convey the idea of the inferiority of Peruvian Indians, which they characterize with different psychological attributes.

In this sense, we were able to develop an interdisciplinary work focused on family businesses in Chiquinquirá, a town located in the western region of Boyacá. First of all, the text introduces the conceptual references related to family businesses, corporate governance, business sustainability and innovation; fundamental concepts for a better understanding of the topics developed in the document. The second chapter presents four entrepreneurial stories concerning valuable experiences of family businesses in Chiquinquirá. These stories were conceived from a qualitative research perspective: they were constructed from the generation of descriptive and interpretative data complemented with research methodological tools such as case studies and life histories. Thus, business experiences were taken into account and, by means of an evaluation tool designed during the research process, good corporate governance practices and their impact on family businesses in the agricultural, commercial and service sectors were analyzed. As a result, the following business histories are presented: Hacienda Agrícola Casa de Lata Ltda., Distribuidora Ricaurte Ltda., Radio Furatena Rocha e Hijos S. en C. & Cía. and Central de Abarrotes DS S. A. Through this research it was possible to identify the reasons that have let these companies have a history of several decades in the regional market; an aspect that shows durability as a result of the founders and the business family's efforts, who knew how to take advantage of their competitive advantages to remain throughout the time.",,,,,,,2021-03-12,2021,2021-03-12,2021-03-12,,,,Closed,Monograph,"García, Dora Marcela Rodríguez; Aldana, Ana Patricia Díaz; Torres, Juan Carlos Ruiz","García, Dora Marcela Rodríguez (); Aldana, Ana Patricia Díaz (); Torres, Juan Carlos Ruiz ()",,"García, Dora Marcela Rodríguez (); Aldana, Ana Patricia Díaz (); Torres, Juan Carlos Ruiz ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135727807,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Most of the educational institutions were not up to this challenge. Thus, both teachers and students were navigating this challenge under uncertainty. Therefore, these institutions faced difficulties regarding information technologies and how to deliver the contents effectively to the students. One of the potential ways to overcome these difficulties is to implement innovative tools that provide certainty to students through frameworks such as Agile. Agile is a proven framework in software development that allows distributing tasks in sprints with tolerance to constant changes. Additionally, The Service-Learning methodology allows students to get a hands-on learning experience by working with real-life cases and firms. Therefore, the research question is whether implementing one of the Agile frameworks such as Scrum and the Service-Learning methodology would improve students’ content delivery. To test this research question, we evaluated the implementation of these methodologies through a case study based on one course of Engineering in Information and Management Control at the Universidad Catolica del Norte in Chile.

However, high food ambiguity, inter-class variability and intra-class similarity define a real challenge for the Deep learning and Computer Vision algorithms. In order to improve their performance, it is necessary to better understand what the model learns and, from this, to determine the type of data that should be additionally included for being the most beneficial to the training procedure. In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation strategy that estimates and uses the epistemic uncertainty to guide the model training. The method follows an active learning framework, where the new synthetic images are generated from the hard to classify real ones present in the training data based on the epistemic uncertainty. Hence, it allows the food recognition algorithm to focus on difficult images in order to learn their discriminatives features. On the other hand, avoiding data generation from images that do not contribute to the recognition makes it faster and more efficient. We show that the proposed method allows to improve food recognition and provides a better trade-off between micro- and macro-recall measures.","This work was partially funded by TIN2018-095232-B-C21, SGR-2017 1742, Nestore project of the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme (Grant N°769643), Validithi EIT Health program and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

Strongly committed to Italy's modernization and the development of a liberal-democratic culture, the practitioners of the “new” discipline found inspiration and research money on the other side of the Atlantic. Since the institutional culture of the Italian academic system prized abstract, philosophical knowledge and reasoning, would-be sociologists strived to import, translate, and comment upon the highly abstract work of Talcott Parsons and others as a mark of distinction and a way to comply with academic mores. The chapter surveys the history of the reception of Parsons’ work in Italy and shows how a niche of “Commentaries on Parsons” was originally created to give would-be sociologists an aura of philosophical respectability. In the 1970s and the 1980s, this traditional work of theoretical commentary produced interesting but isolated work, while since the 1990s, a small network of scholars interested in Parsons from both a historical and a theoretical perspective emerged in the universities of Trento, Bologna, and Padova. This chapter examines the history of the reception of Parsons’ work in Italy and shows how a niche of “Commentaries on Parsons” was originally created to give would-be sociologists an aura of philosophical respectability. The Italian academy's organizational structure coupled with the sociologists’ self-appointed role as lieutenants of Italy's postwar reconstruction worked against the wide acceptance of Parsons's ideas and writings. As the 1960s came to an end, however, the reception of Parsons's work in Italian sociology suffered a double blow that corresponded with the sharp critique, intellectual marginalization, and neglect that assailed it in the United States and other countries. In the 1980s, the number of Italian sociologists who endeavored to go beyond Parsons increased, and more than one attempt was made to develop (post)Parsonian tools for empirical research. After occupying a central role in defining sociology's mission, Parsons's theories were marginalized by the same forces it had previously defeated within specialized sub-fields.","We would like to thank Giuseppe Sciortino, Gabriele Pollini, Davide La Valle, Paolo Almondo, and Marco Santoro for their friendly help.

It has shown upbeat performance improvements, but most of the transfer learning applications are confined towards fine-tuning. Transfer learning facilitates the learnability of the networks on domains with less data. However, learning becomes a difficult task with complex domains, such as multi-label food recognition, owing to the shear number of food classes as well as to the fine-grained nature of food images. For this purpose, we propose S2ML-TL, a new transfer learning framework to leverage the knowledge learnt on a simpler single-label food recognition task onto multi-label food recognition. The framework is further enhanced using class priors to tackle the dataset bias that exists between single-label and multi-label food domains. We validate the proposed scheme with two multi-label datasets on different backbone architectures and the results show improved performance compared to the conventional transfer learning approach.","This work was partially funded by TIN2018-095232-B-C21, SGR-2017 1742, Nestore project of the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme (Grant no. 769643), Validithi EIT Health program and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

However, circumcision practices of the Northern Ndebele and other South African tribes have so far been studied without adequate nuance. This is partly why writers such as Krige and Krige (The Realm of a Rain-Queen: A Study of the Patterns of Lovedu Society. Oxford University Press, London, etc., 1943, p. 115) fail to make sense of the songs among BaLobedu initiates, to the extent of misconstruing their content as “nonsensical” and as disconnected from other social practices of the people. In this chapter, I explore evidence of sense in the orature of circumcision schools through a case study of one Ndebele initiation center, among many like it continuing the institution of male circumcision among the Northern Ndebele people of the Mokopane Kekana (Ghegana) tribe in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. Cultural lore indexed in initiation teachings of the Ndebele is a mere variable of a constant of circumcision oral lessons practiced similarly yet not identically among other African cultural groups on the continent. I assert that the addition of this other tribe among those whose initiation practices have been studied clarifies the nature of this cross-tribal practice in ways that enrich knowledge about this aspect of African cultures. This is in keeping with the premise of my study asserting that similarity of content and modes of teaching among performances of initiation across geographical and ethnic identity points to an identifiable common core worthy of characterization.

238,pub.1141789705,10.1007/978-3-030-84606-0_1,,,Introduction: Resource Peripheries in the Global Economy,"The relation between resource extraction and the places in which extraction takes place has been a long-standing issue for academic, social and political debates. The paths through which resource extraction alter developmental dynamics, the everyday life of the local population and the environmental context have called the attention of social science since its origins. Despite the long-standing dimensions, which have been in the spotlight, contemporary political, economic and social changes demand revising the way in which resource extraction connects global production with the places where extraction occurs, here referred to as resource peripheries. This introduction critically revisits the academic debate about resource peripheries, asking to move forward from an understanding of resource peripheries as local models, towards a dynamic approach that allows grasping the socio-spatial relations that make the extraction places peripheral. For doing so, this section proposes three core dimensions that must be revisited in the research about resource peripheries: (i) changes in how contemporary capitalism is organizing production through globalized value chains; (ii) the re-scalation of political dynamics, which shape the economic organization of the places of extraction; and (iii) emergent issues, such as long-distance commuting, climate change and human rights",Felipe Irarrázaval is grateful to the Centro de Estudios Sobre Conflicto y Cohesión Social (COES) (ANID/FONDAP/15130009),,Economic Geography,Resource Peripheries in the Global Economy,"Felipe Irarrázaval, Martín Arias-Loyola",,2021-10-12,2021,2021-10-12,2021,,,1-17,Closed,Chapter,"Irarrázaval, Felipe; Arias-Loyola, Martín","Irarrázaval, Felipe (Instituto de Estudios Urbanos y Territoriales, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Arias-Loyola, Martín (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia)","Irarrázaval, Felipe (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)","Irarrázaval, Felipe (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Arias-Loyola, Martín (Catholic University of the North; University of Melbourne)",2,1,,0.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141789705,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

Men and women in 15 countries (NTOTAL = 4701) completed self-report measures assessing self-esteem and the four humor styles of affiliative, aggressive, self-defeating, and self-enhancing. Each of the country samples had self-esteem averages at or above the midpoint of the scale, but did vary. The samples from Colombia and Serbia had the highest self-esteem values and Russia had the lowest. For all of the country samples, with the exception of Russia, the multiple regression results demonstrated that a greater level of the self-enhancing humor style positively predicted higher self-esteem scores. As the self-enhancing humor style involves improving one’s mood with humor, the results suggest that for the majority of the participants, self-enhancing humor styles also help to increase self-esteem. The results are discussed both within countries and across the samples. In particular, the unique finding that not a self-enhancing humor style but an aggressive humor style predicts self-esteem in the Russian sample is discussed. The chapter ends with a discussion of how humor styles correlate with mental health indicators and how the understanding of humor style profiles are related to well-being across countries adds to the global understanding of individual differences.",,,,The Palgrave Handbook of Humour Research,"Elisabeth Vanderheiden, Claude-Hélène Mayer",,2021-09-17,2021,2021-09-17,2021,,,15-39,Closed,Chapter,"Schermer, Julie Aitken; Papazova, Eva Boyanova; Kwiatkowska, Maria Magdalena; Rogoza, Radosław; Park, Joonha; Kowalski, Christopher Marcin; Branković, Marija; Doroszuk, Marta; Khanh Ha, Truong Thi; Iliško, Dzintra; Malik, Sadia; Lins, Samuel; Navarro-Carrillo, Ginés; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Torres-Marín, Jorge; Włodarczyk, Anna; de Aquino, Sibele Dias; Volkodav, Tatiana; Krammer, Georg","Schermer, Julie Aitken (Department of Management and Organizational Studies, Faculty of Social Science, The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada); Papazova, Eva Boyanova (Department of Psychology at IPHS-BAS, Sofia, Bulgaria); Kwiatkowska, Maria Magdalena (Faculty of Christian Philosophy at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University, Warsaw, Poland); Rogoza, Radosław (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University, Warsaw, Poland); Park, Joonha (NUCB Business School, Nagoya, Japan); Kowalski, Christopher Marcin (Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada); Branković, Marija (Faculty of Media and Communications, Singidunum University, Belgrade, Serbia); Doroszuk, Marta (Faculty of Philosophy, Institute of Psychology at Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland); Khanh Ha, Truong Thi (VNU University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam); Iliško, Dzintra (Daugavpils University, Institute of Humanities and Societal Sciences, Daugavpils, Latvia); Malik, Sadia (Department of Psychology, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan); Lins, Samuel (University of Porto, Porto, Portugal); Navarro-Carrillo, Ginés (Department of Psychology, University of Jaén, Jaén, Spain); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Kelvin Grove, QLD, Australia); Torres-Marín, Jorge (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain); Włodarczyk, Anna (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); de Aquino, Sibele Dias (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Volkodav, Tatiana (Department of Pedagogy and Psychology, Kuban State University in Krasnodar, Krasnodar, Russia); Krammer, Georg (University College for Teacher Education Styria, Graz, Austria)","Schermer, Julie Aitken (Western University)","Schermer, Julie Aitken (Western University); Papazova, Eva Boyanova (Department of Psychology at IPHS-BAS, Sofia, Bulgaria); Kwiatkowska, Maria Magdalena (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw); Rogoza, Radosław (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw); Park, Joonha (NUCB Business School, Nagoya, Japan); Kowalski, Christopher Marcin (Western University); Branković, Marija (Singidunum University); Doroszuk, Marta (Jagiellonian University); Khanh Ha, Truong Thi (Vietnam National University, Hanoi); Iliško, Dzintra (Daugavpils University); Malik, Sadia (University of Sargodha); Lins, Samuel (University of Porto); Navarro-Carrillo, Ginés (University of Jaén); Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q), Kelvin Grove, QLD, Australia); Torres-Marín, Jorge (University of Granada); Włodarczyk, Anna (Catholic University of the North); de Aquino, Sibele Dias (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro); Volkodav, Tatiana (Kuban State University); Krammer, Georg (University College for Teacher Education Styria, Graz, Austria)",12,8,,3.92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141164615,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

As part of a national quest to transform higher education institutions, the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) in South Africa implemented a bilingual language policy under which an African language—isiZulu—should be used alongside English as a language of learning and teaching. Utilizing an African linguistic renaissance theoretical framework, this chapter uses data from an earlier thesis by this author to explore the attitudes of UKZN staff and students towards the university’s bilingual language policy and the extent to which this may help to realize an African linguistic renaissance. The chapter mainly adopts a qualitative approach using UKZN as the case study, although it also seeks to quantify some of the data, which was collected through in-depth interviews and questionnaires. This chapter shows that the university’s bilingual language policy received support among the isiZulu-speaking staff and students, in line with their demographic representation at UKZN. It further argues that the investment made by UKZN in developing the isiZulu language for academic proficiency at university level is justified by the impacts of the policy, contradicting arguments against using African languages for teaching and learning at university level which have been made on the grounds that they are inadequate for this function. The findings pose a challenge to African intellectuals and other South African universities, who need to assist in bolstering the importance of African languages.",,,Diversity and Inclusion Research,Social Justice and Education in the 21st Century,"Willie Pearson, Vijay Reddy",,2021-04-11,2021,2021-04-11,2021,,,273-292,Closed,Chapter,"Mthombeni, Zama Mabel","Mthombeni, Zama Mabel (Human Sciences Research Council, Durban, South Africa)","Mthombeni, Zama Mabel (Human Sciences Research Council)","Mthombeni, Zama Mabel (Human Sciences Research Council)",1,1,,1.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137100452,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Food recognition is a key task in nutrition monitoring applications especially of interest for older people suffering from malnutrition and unhealthy eating. In order to ease the problem of food intake monitoring, recent health apps involve Artificial Intelligence algorithms for food image analysis. Food recognition is a highly challenging task as the dishes could be composed of mixed types, it could have a lower inter-class variance and also the number of dishes to be recognized is quite higher. In this chapter, we present an in-depth analysis and insights into the development of a nutritional monitoring system that would act as a Key Performance Indicator for the older people food intake monitoring.

Authors such as De Beer (J New Gener Sci 14:34–53, 2016) indicate that there is a general lack of qualified science and mathematics teachers in African primary and secondary schools. In addition to the challenge of integrating indigenous knowledge in African schools (Jegede in Int J Sci Educ 19:1–20, 1997; De Beer in The decolonisation of the curriculum project: the affordances of indigenous knowledge for self-directed learning, (NWU self-directed learning series, volume 2), AOSIS, Cape Town, 2019b), science education challenges can be classified as systemic (e.g. lack of resources, outdated curriculum, curricular change, policy reform and classroom-related aspects (e.g. class size, teacher pedagogical content knowledge and skills, relevant assessments) (Ogunniyi and Rollnick in J Sci Teach Educ 26:65–79, 2015; Tikly et al. in Supporting secondary school STEM education for sustainable development in Africa, University of Bristol, 2018). Literature review forms this chapter’s main research methodology. Research questions are related to the following thematic areas: communities of practice for science teachers, contextualisation and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS), and assessments. Open Science (OS), its components, benefits and general principles (openness, inclusion, fairness, equity and sharing) are used to develop a framework/model to address the issues raised. While scholars are increasingly motivated to augment the transparency of their work using the Open Science Framework (OSF) (Bezjak et al. in Open science training handbook, Zenodo, 2018; Munafò et al. in Nat Hum Behav 1:1–9, 2017; Nosek et al. in Science 348:1422–1425, 2015; Nosek et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 115:2600–2606, 2018; Stall et al. in Nature 570:27–29, 2019), it is not clear whether the uptake of OS is similar for science educators. The proposed model makes use of different aspects of the OSF to create a community of practice of teachers and students with a peer network of “critical friends”. In our conclusion, we give recommendations in view of radically improving science teacher education on the African continent and beyond. Our proposed model offers the opportunity to extend the principle of openness to science teachers and students by fostering sharing, collaboration while also focusing on self-directed learning and constructionist pedagogy.",,,Lecture Notes in Educational Technology,Radical Solutions for Education in Africa,"Daniel Burgos, Jako Olivier",,2021-08-03,2021,2021-08-03,2021,,,149-174,Closed,Chapter,"Ferreira-Meyers, Karen; Dhakulkar, Amit","Ferreira-Meyers, Karen (Institute of Distance Education, University of Eswatini, Kwaluseni, Swaziland); Dhakulkar, Amit (University of the North West, Potchefstroom, South Africa)","Ferreira-Meyers, Karen (University of Eswatini)","Ferreira-Meyers, Karen (University of Eswatini); Dhakulkar, Amit (North-West University)",1,1,,0.71,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140126366,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education

This combined approach identified three main moments of formation and occupation at Zapatero: one starting around 7000 cal yr BP, when successive centimetre-thick layers of predominantly shellfish were continuously accumulated; a second moment between 6600 and 6400 cal yr BP, when decametric layers of fish bones and shellfish remains were intermittently deposited; and a third and final moment that is characterized by the complete reworking of the shell midden, possibly by a tsunami that affected the north of Chile about 4000 years ago. Micromorphological data provided paleoclimatic information from the Middle HoloceneHolocene to the present time, with evidence of drier conditions during the first moment of formation/occupation, and more humid conditions during the second and third moments. It also revealed a larger abundance of decayed fish bones than what was indicated by faunal analysis, suggesting potential taphonomic pathways for the faunal remains.

It exists as a monomer, dimer, or tetramer and uses copper as a cofactor and molecular oxygen as a co-substrate. Laccases are a diverse group of enzymes having great biotechnological potential and high market expectative due to their broad substrate specificity in the diverse fields of industrial application such as dye decolorization, bioremediation, and biodegradation of xenobiotics such as chlorophenols, herbicides, PAH, and benzopyrene. However, one of the limitations for the large-scale application of laccase is the lack of capacity to produce large volumes of highly active enzymes at an affordable cost. Thus, laccases catalyze the transformation of a great variety of aromatic and nonaromatic compounds with the simultaneous reduction of molecular oxygen to water. This feature renders laccases as Green catalysts and hence their high interest for different biotechnological applications, such as beverage clarification, textile processing, paper pulping, dye degradation, bioremediation, biosensors, and organic synthesis.

While land remains a key resource at the core of many contemporary civil wars, the impact of high-intensity armed violence on the formation of agrarian capitalism is seldom discussed. Drawing on nearly 200 interviews, archival research, and geographical data, this book examines land grabbing and the role of violence in capital with a particular focus on one key actor in the Colombian civil war: paramilitary militias. This book demonstrates how the intricate ties between armed conflict and economy formation are obscured by the widespread belief that violence is a radical form of action, breaking with the normal course of society and disconnected from the legal economy. Under this view, dispossession is perceived as diametrically opposed to capitalist accumulation. This belief is enormously influential in precisely those bureaucratic agencies that are in charge of peacebuilding, both domestically and internationally. However, this narrow view of the relationship between armed violence and capitalism belies the close ties between plunder and lawful profit, and obscures the continuity between violent dispossession and the free market. By the same token, it legitimizes post-war inequality in the name of capitalist development. The book concludes by arguing that the promotion of radical democracy in the government of land and rural development emerges as the only reasonable path for pacifying a violent polity. The book is essential reading for students, scholars, and development aid practitioners interested in land and resource grabbing, agrarian capitalism, civil wars, and conflict resolution.",,,,,,,2021-05-01,2021,2021-05-01,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Grajales, Jacobo","Grajales, Jacobo ()",,"Grajales, Jacobo ()",18,14,,14.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137212950,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It assesses and compares the expansion and current stage of institutional development of three regional assemblies – the European Parliament, the Pan-African Parliament and the Mercosur Parliament for Latin America. Looking in particular at parliamentary agency, it aims to answer why and to what extent, these regional parliaments have developed differently in terms of their functions and legislative competences? Drawing on new and original empirical data, official documents, and secondary literature, the book focuses on the “critical junctures” in the trajectory of the three assemblies and argues that parliamentary agency has impacted the institutional development of the parliaments leading to diverse paths of regional parliamentarisation.

Du Bois","Du Bois was the founder of American scientific empirical sociology and one of the most important social theorists of the twentieth century. Today, many mainstream sociologists are willing to accept that empirical sociology in American started with Du Bois and the Atlanta school. But they are not aware that Du Bois also developed a distinct theoretical approach that understood modernity as racialized and put racism and colonialism at the center of historical capitalism. He introduced and documented the color line as a global historical social structure that affects the opportunities, experiences, and subjectivities of people around the world. His theoretical approach was global and historical in its perspective, combining the analysis of macrostructures and subjective experiences. Du Bois constructed a bottom-up sociology that interrogated the social world from the perspective of the oppressed and anchored his analysis in a subaltern standpoint connecting lived experiences and social analyses.The sociology of W.E.B. Du Bois was critically shaped by the institutional structures in which he was embedded. For Du Bois and his North American contemporaries, the surrounding structure included a rigorous form of segregation that exercised a profound influence on the evidential, analytic, and theoretical substance of scholarship on both sides of the racial divide. Racial oppression—inside and outside the academic world—led Du Bois and other Black sociologists to develop a relevant politically engaged sociology that addressed pressing issues of their era and ours. Black sociologists—and their intellectual and political allies who stood outside the White male sociological establishment—countered with an explicitly activist and emancipatory sociology that signaled a distinct direction for the young discipline. Although erased for over a century, this direction is as relevant for sociology today as it was during Du Bois’s days.",,,Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research,Handbook of Classical Sociological Theory,"Seth Abrutyn, Omar Lizardo",,2021-11-02,2021,2021-11-02,2021,,,121-143,Closed,Chapter,"Morris, Aldon; Schwartz, Michael; Itzigsohn, José","Morris, Aldon (Department of Sociology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA); Schwartz, Michael (Department of Sociology, Stony Brook, University, Stony Brook, New York, USA); Itzigsohn, José (Department of Sociology, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA)","Schwartz, Michael (Stony Brook University)","Morris, Aldon (Northwestern University); Schwartz, Michael (Stony Brook University); Itzigsohn, José (Brown University)",2,0,,1.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142320518,"44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Looking at specific countries, the work analyses the legal impact the implementation of the ECtHR and the IACtHR judgments has, with a specific focus on cases in which the regional court concerned uses the “democratic argument,” that is, an argument related to democracy and political rights. The reasoning is that, although democracy is a much wider concept, judgments concerning violations of political rights and electoral justice provide reliable indicators to assess the status and sustainability of democracy in a State. Moreover, the analysis of the violations of political rights and electoral justice allows an in-depth comparison between the two regional human rights systems. Mindful of the broader scope of the fall-out generated by the non-implementation of judgments, including in socio-economic terms, the book includes a section exploring how judgments issued by the ECtHR and the IACtHR affect voters' participation in the countries under their jurisdiction. To this end, an original dataset including the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe and the 20 countries which recognised the adjudicatory jurisdiction of the IACtHR is built.

However, it has generated environmental impacts of several kinds, wherein the largest ones correspond to mine tailings. Mine tailings occupying large areas of soil and cause severe environmental impacts, either because of its toxicity and concentration or due to its interaction with environmental factors such as oxygen and water. Environmental problems associated with tailings disposal depends, among other factors, on the local climate. In the case, arid or semiarid climates, tailings are distributed to the environment through wind dispersion and erosion processes caused by water. In arid and semiarid regions, the establishment of the plant is restricted by several physicochemical factors that include extreme temperatures and high-speed winds. Phytoremediation, a low-cost in-situ technology, has emerged as the most promising remediation method for mine tailings with multielement contamination through the introduction of tolerant plants. These set of technologies using plants to clean contaminated sites, has a minimal negative impact on the environment when treating mine tailings, reducing the dispersion and bioavailability of metals, and returning the substrate to an acceptable ecological condition. The objective of this chapter is to offer the reader the results obtained by the team working with native or endemic plant species on mine tailings located in the Antofagasta region.

Quinoa is an ancient crop native to the Andean region of South America that has recently gained international attention because its seeds are high in protein, particularly in essential amino acids. Quinoa is also highly tolerant of abiotic stresses, including drought, frost and salinity. For these reasons, quinoa has the potential to help address issues of food security – a potential that was recognized when the United Nations declared 2013 the International Year of Quinoa.

125,pub.1137620178,10.1007/978-3-030-70986-0,,,Legal Certainty and Central Bank Autonomy in Latin American Emerging Markets,"This book provides a comparative analysis of the legal frameworks of six Latin American central banks to determine whether there is legal certainty regarding central bank autonomy. Based on this, it ascertains whether the way in which legal institutions are designed – specifically those that rule the autonomy of the central bank – provides reasons to believe that central banks can keep inflation at bay even if governments face fiscal problems or pursue contradictory objectives. The analysis covers three key areas: a constitutional analysis, a detailed study of the central bank statutes and a study of a number of underexplored threats to central bank autonomy. After defining and identifying different types of legal certainty and linking them to the credibility of government promises, the author goes on to examine the grounds that the law provides for confidence that central banks operate independently of political influence. The second part of the book focuses on a granular analysis of the legal design of the central banks’ objectives and autonomy. Lastly, the third part features two case studies that represent little-known and unusual institutional threats to legal certainty relating to central bank autonomy, such as the interventions by the Constitutional Court of Colombia in the autonomy of the Colombian central bank, and the interventions of the Argentinean executive and legislative branches in the autonomy of Argentina’s central bank through stabilization plans introduced via emergency laws and decrees. In sum, the book suggests that there are serious doubts about the ability of Latin American central banks to maintain price stability over time. Although central banks were granted a degree of autonomy, authorities in Latin American countries are able to affect central bank decisions. Most importantly, a lack of clarity, inconsistencies, or generous exceptions in the law provide ways for authorities to influence central banks even without bending or disregarding the rules.",,,European Yearbook of International Economic Law,,,,2021,2021,,2021,15,,,Closed,Monograph,"Tapia-Hoffmann, Andrea Lucia","Tapia-Hoffmann, Andrea Lucia (Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany)",,"Tapia-Hoffmann, Andrea Lucia (Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg)",1,1,,2.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137620178,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The book begins its approach with a literature review, to provide an overview of current thinking on the subject and establish a theoretical framework. The following sections cover key stages during the corporate brand development process: Brand signature design, its components and impact on brand reputation; website design and how it builds customer perception of the brand; corporate architecture design and the branding of space and place; brand experience design from a sensuality perspective. International case studies from a range of industries feature in each chapter to demonstrate how the theory translates to practice, alongside case questions to cement learning and definitions of the key constructs. By combining academic theory with practical case studies and examples, readers will gain a thorough understanding of the corporate brand design process and how it influences customer identification and loyalty to the brand.

In Part Two, these insights are used to launch a substantial reinterpretation of Kant’s ethics as a system of duties, juridical and ethical, perfect and imperfect, that can incorporate what we learn from imperfect duties and do much more. The system of duties provides the structure for what I call a moral habitat: a made environment, created by and for free and equal persons living together. It is a dynamic system, with duties from the juridical and ethical spheres shaping and being affected by each other, each level further interpreting the system’s core anti-subordination value initiated in Kant’s account of innate right. The structure of an imperfect duty is exhibited in a detailed account of the duty of beneficence, including its latitude of application and demandingness. Part Three takes up some implications and applications of the moral habitat idea. Its topics range from the adjustments to the system that would come with recognizing a human right to housing to meta-ethical issues about objectivity and our responsibility for moral change. The upshot is a transformative, holistic agent- and institution-centered, account of Kantian morality.",,,,,,,2021-10-21,2021,2021-11-18,2021-10-21,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,21,16,,17.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143218608,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics; 5003 Philosophy",

                  Neoliberalism: A Very Short Introduction explores the considerable variations of neoliberalism around the world. It also discusses the origins, evolution, and core ideas of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism emerged as the world's dominant economic paradigm in the 1990s. The global financial crash of 2008 and the subsequent emergence of more nationalist ideologies have challenged both neoliberal assumptions and related financial systems—a development most spectacularly reflected in 2016's pro-Brexit referendum in the UK and the Trump election victory in the same year. This new edition asks whether changing versions of neoliberalism might succeed in drowning out the calls for a return to territorial sovereignty and national greatness.",,,,,,,2021-01-28,2021,2021-01-28,2021-01-28,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,16,8,,6.91,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134964412,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

In times of a global emergency, the aftermath of emergency remote teaching (ERT) cannot be ignored. The question of how language educators and researchers unleash creativity and employ strategies vis-à-vis ERT still remains to be answered. With practitioners in mind, it covers a broad spectrum of educational settings across continents, target languages and methodologies. Specifically, it reveals viable ways of utilizing digital technologies to bypass social distancing while highlighting the pitfalls and challenges associated with crisis teaching and research. This volume comprises two parts: Teacher Voice vicariously transports readers to practitioners’ compelling stories of how teacher resilience, identity and professional development are crystallized in adaptive pedagogy, online teaching practicum, virtual study programs and communities of practice during ERT. The second part, Researcher Corner, showcases innovative approaches for both novice and seasoned researchers to upskill their toolkits, ranging from case study research and mixed methods designs, to auto- and virtual ethnography and social media research. The array of food for thought provides a positive outlook and inspires us to rethink our current practices and future directions in the post-COVID world.

Gathering some of the most prominent authors in constitutionalism and legal theory, the chapters critically examine classical debates. These debates concern the role of judicial review in a democracy, the enforcement of socio-economic rights, the doctrine of unconstitutional amendments, the use of international and foreign precedents by national Courts, and the theory of transitional justice. The book opens a dialogue between philosophers and empirical researchers, building bridges between 'Global North' and 'Global South' approaches to constitutionalism. As such, it is an invitation to reengage with the classical debates on constitutionalism whilst also providing fresh insights into the future of this discipline.",,,,,"Alejandro Linares Cantillo, Camilo Valdivieso-León, Santiago García-Jaramillo",,2021-03-11,2021,2021-07-22,2021-03-11,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,0,,4.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140008384,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This book covers the latest approaches to energy and outdoor comfort measurement and modelling on an urban scale, and describes possible measures and strategies to mitigate the effects of the mutual interaction between urban settlements and local microclimate. Despite its relevance, only limited literature is currently devoted to appraising—from an engineering perspective—the intertwining relationships between urban geometry and fabrics, energy fluxes between buildings and their surroundings, outdoor microclimate conditions, and building energy demands in urban areas. This book fills this gap by first discussing the physical processes that govern heat and mass transfer at an urban scale, while emphasizing the role played by different spatial arrangements, manmade materials and green infrastructures on the outdoor microclimate. The first chapters also address the implications of these factors on the outdoor comfort conditions experienced by pedestrians, and on the buildings’ energy demand for space heating and cooling. Then, based upon cutting-edge experimental activities and simulation work, this book demonstrates current and forthcoming adaptation and mitigation strategies to improve the urban microclimate and its impact on the built environment, such as cool materials, thermochromic and retroreflective finishing materials, and green infrastructures applied either at a building scale or at the urban scale. The effect of these solutions is demonstrated for different cities worldwide under a range of climate conditions.

In recent years, there has been a groundswell of interest in contemplative pedagogies in higher education, with increasing attention from the environmental sciences, environmental humanities, and sustainability studies. Teachers and writers have demonstrated how mindfulness practices can be a key to anti-oppression and anti-racist efforts, both in and out of the classroom. Not all forms of contemplative pedagogy are suited for this anti-colonial and anti-oppressive resistance, however. Simply adopting mindfulness practices in the classroom is not enough to dislodge and dismantle white supremacy in higher education. Epistemic Justice, Mindfulness, and the Environmental Humanities advocates for mindfulness practices that affirm multiple epistemologies and cultural traditions. Written for educators in the environmental humanities and other related disciplines, the chapters interrogate the western uptake of mindfulness practices and suggest anti-colonial and antioppressive methods for bringing mindfulness into the classroom. The chapters also discuss what mindfulness practices have to offer to the pursuit of a culturally relevant pedagogy.

Knowledge of the world’s fungal diversity and its use is still incomplete and fragmented. There are many opportunities to accelerate the process of filling knowledge gaps in these areas. The worldwide interest of the current era is to increase the tendency to use natural substances instead of synthetic ones. The increasing urge in society for natural ingredients has compelled biotechnologists to explore novel bioresources which can be exploited in industrial sector. Fungi, due to their unique attributes and broad range of their biological activities hold great promises for their application in biotechnology and industry. Fungi are an efficient source of antioxidants, enzymes, pigments, and many other secondary metabolites. The large scale production of fungal pigments and their utility provides natural coloration without creating harmful effects on entering the environment, a safer alternative use to synthetic colorants. The fungal enzymes can be exploited in wide range of industries such as food, detergent, paper, and also for removal toxic waste. This book will serve as valuable source of information as well as will provide new directions to researchers to conduct novel research in field of mycology. Volume 2 of “Industrially Important Fungi for Sustainable Development” provides an overview to understanding bioprospecting of fungal biomolecules and their industrial application for future sustainability.

As both an anti-elitist and antiestablishment way of thinking, these chapters consider how Integrational Linguistics can be consistent with the decolonial aspirations of Southern Epistemologies. They argue that the relationship between Southern Epistemologies and Integrational Linguistics is complicated by the fact that, while Integrational Linguistics is critical of what it calls a segregationist view of language, i.e., “the language myth”, Southern Epistemologies in language policy and planning and minority language movements find the language myth helpful in order to facilitate social transformation. And yet, both Integrational Linguistics and Southern Epistemologies are critical of approaches to multilingualism that are founded on notions of “named” languages. They are also both critical of linguistics as a decontextualized, and institutionalized, extension of ordinary metalinguistic practices, which at times influence the prejudices, preconceptions, and ideologies of dominant western cultures. This book will prove to be an essential resource for scholars and students not only within the field of integrational linguistics, but also in other language and communication fields, in particular the dialogic, distributed, and ecological-enactive approaches, wherein integrational linguistics has been subjected to scrutiny and criticism.",,,,,Sinfree B.

The first volume for which the defining of iconic feminist art is the raison d’être, its contributors interpret a “Mistress-Piece” as a work that has proved influential in a particular context because of its distinctiveness and relevance. Reinterpreting iconic art by Alice Neel, Hannah Wilke and Ana Mendieta, the authors also offer important insights about works that may be less well known – those by Natalia LL, Tanja Ostojić, Swoon, Clara Menéres, Diane Victor, Usha Seejarim, Ilse Fusková, Phaptawan Suwannakudt and Tracey Moffatt, amongst others. While in some instances revealing cross influences between artists working in different frameworks, the publication simultaneously makes evident how social and political factors specific to particular countries had significant impact on the making and reception of art focused on gender. The book will be of interest to scholars working in art history, visual studies, and gender studies. Cover image: Usha Seejarim, Cow’s Head. 2012, iron and hanger.

This book first investigates the national contexts and development of education in the BRICS countries, arguing that this grouping represents a valuable but yet overlooked field for illuminating South African education issues with international perspectives. The book consists of chapters arguing for and illustrating this thesis from a variety of angles. Common to all chapters is that authors used the comparative method in education, that is comparing the national education system, in their education societal context interrelationships, of the BRICS countries.  The chapters focus on a number of critical issues in South African education, including the language of learning and teaching issue, the alignment of the world of education with the world of work, early childhood education, and the development of world-class universities. Regarding the last, for example, China has been the terrain of the most intensive national projects of establishing world-class universities, with Project 985, Project 211, and the 'Double First Class University' project.  The chapters demonstrate what South Africa, in approaching her education issues, can learn from the experience of the BRICS countries.",,,BRICS Education,Critical Issues in South African Education: Illumination from international comparative perspectives from the BRICS countries,Charl C.

This book applies sociolinguistic theory, as well as critical language awareness and translanguaging with its many facets, to various communicative scenarios, both on the continent and in South Africa, in an accessible and practical way. Africa lends itself to such sociolinguistic analysis concerning language, identity and intercultural communication. This book reflects consciously on the North–South debate and the need for us to create our own ways of interpretation emanating from the South and speaking back to the North, as well as on issues that pertain to the South, including southern Africa. Aspects such as language and power, language planning, policy and implementation, culture, prejudice, social interaction, translanguaging, intercultural communication, education, gender and autoethnography are covered. This is a valuable resource for students studying African sociolinguistics, language and identity, and applied language studies.

The book aims to contribute to the growing effort to develop a theoretical knowledge that complements the biographical perspective centered on the great figures, with a polycentric history that emphasizes the different cultural, social, economic and political phenomena that accompanied the emergence of psychology. The different chapters of this volume show the production of historians of psychology in Latin America who are part of the Ibero-American Network of Researchers in History of Psychology (RIPeHP, in the Portuguese acronym for ""Rede Iberoamericana de Pesquisadores em História da Psicologia""). They present a significant sample of the research carried out in a field that has experienced a strong development in the region in the last decades. The volume is divided into two parts. The first presentscomparative chapters that address cross-cutting issues in the different countries of the region. The second part analyzes particular aspects of the development of psychology in seven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. Throughout these chapters the reader will find how psychology made its way through dictatorial governments, phenomena of violence and internal armed conflict, among others. Dimensions that include rigorous analysis ranging from ancestral practices to current geopolitical knowledge of the Latin American region.

However, water availability varies enormously in space, as less than 1,000 m3/person are available for more than 50% of the population. The temporal and spatial distribution of water resources is driven by processes highly variables across a country with different climates explained not only by a large range of latitudes (from 17° to 56° south), but also the presence of the Pacific Ocean and the Andes with peaks up to 7000 m. This geography makes of Chile a true natural laboratory in which water is essential for the society and the economy of the country. The relevance of water resources for the country has become even more significant in the context of a mega-drought that has affected practically the entire territory in recent years, although large floods such as those in Atacama 2015 and 2017 also take place periodically. This unique book brings together the state-of-art knowledge about the hydrology of Chile and its water resources, with a particular focus on quantitative aspects. The chapters are prepared by many of the most relevant researchers and practitioners working in water resources in the country. High-quality research contributions on climate and meteorology, surface and subsurface hydrology, water quality, water monitoring, water resource and global change, among other issues, are presented in this unique book, which offers a useful guide for academicians, researchers, practitioners and managers dealing with diverse water-related issues in Chile and other regions with similar characteristics",,,World Water Resources,,"Bonifacio Fernández, Jorge Gironás",,2021,2021,,2021,8,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,18,8,,5.18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133108453,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 3707 Hydrology,

This volume brings together leading scholars working in the field of “Parsonian Studies” to explore the background of Parsons's work, the content of his oeuvre, and his subsequent influence. Thematically organized, it covers Parsons's contributions and impacts in areas including the philosophy and methodology of the social sciences; cultural sociology; personality, mental illness, and psychoanalysis; and economics and political and economic sociology. In addition, it considers his influence in different areas of the world and on particular students, and offers insights into the Parsonian tradition's practical application to contemporary social issues.

As such, society in all countries – both developing and developed – need to increase their resilience to the impacts of climate change, where resilience is the ability of a system to absorb stresses and adapt in ways that improve the overall sustainability of the system; enabling it to be better prepared for future climate change impacts. In this context, a climate resilient society is one that is: reflective (learns from experiences); robust (both people and infrastructure can withstand the impacts of extreme conditions); forward-thinking (with plans made to ensure systems function during extreme events); flexible (so systems and plans can change, evolve or adopt alternative strategies); resourceful (to respond quickly to extreme events); inclusive (so all communities including the vulnerable are involved in planning); and integrated (so people, systems, decision-making and investments are mutually supportive of common goals). The Climate Resilient Societies Major Reference Work includes chapters covering a range of themes that provide readers with an invaluable overview on how various levels of government have attempted to create climate resilient societies. In particular, each chapter, under its respective theme, will address how a government, or series of governments, at various levels in non-OECD and/or OECD countries, have implemented innovative climate resilient policies that seek synergies across strategies, choices and actions, in an attempt to build a climate resilient society. Each chapter will address one specific sub-theme out of the population of themes covered in the Major Reference Work: Water, Energy, Agriculture and Food, Built environment and Infrastructure, Transport, Human health, Society, Disaster, Business and Economy, and Financing Climate Resilience.",,,,,Robert C.

9,pub.1142328345,10.1007/978-3-030-78205-4,,,Handbook of Classical Sociological Theory,"This is the first handbook focussing on classical social theory. It offers extensive discussions of debates, arguments, and discussions in classical theory and how they have informed contemporary sociological theory. The book pushes against the conventional classical theory pedagogy, which often focused on single theorists and their contributions, and looks at isolating themes capturing the essence of the interest of classical theorists that seem to have relevance to modern research questions and theoretical traditions. This book presents new approaches to thinking about theory in relationship to sociological methods.",,,Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research,,"Seth Abrutyn, Omar Lizardo",,2021,2021,,2021,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,8,6,,5.14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142328345,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,
9,pub.1136044348,10.1007/978-3-030-55517-7,,,The Palgrave Handbook of African Oral Traditions and Folklore,"“This volume is not a displacement of the late 1990s/early 2000s publications on folklore in Africa, in which African functional aesthetics gave way to Western formal aesthetics, but is a definitive source book of 50 original essays which provide a multidisciplinary study of the undercurrents of African and African Diaspora folklore and oral traditions – indeed a tour de force work in the currency and originality of its ‘African voice and perspective.” – Pamela J. Olubunmi Smith, Professor Emerita, University of Nebraska at Omaha, USA “This is a comprehensive, well-researched, and impressive volume that offers significant insights and perspectives into the dynamics of oral traditions and folklore in Africa and the African Diaspora. Systematically and thematically arranged with an interdisciplinary approach, the volume is enlightening and riveting. The volume is a must-read for professionals, students, and lovers of culture.” – Julius O. Adekunle, Professor of History, Monmouth University, USA This handbook offers the most comprehensive, analytic, and multidisciplinary study of oral traditions and folklore in Africa and the African Diaspora to date. Preeminent scholars Akintunde Akinyemi and Toyin Falola assemble a team of leading and rising stars across African Studies research to retrieve and renew the scholarship of oral traditions and folklore in Africa and the Diaspora just as critical concerns about their survival are pushed to the forefront of the field. With five sections on the central themes within orality and folklore – including engagement ranging from popular culture to technology, methods to pedagogy – this handbook is an indispensable resource to scholars, students, and practitioners of oral traditions and folklore preservation alike. This definitive reference is the first to provide detailed, systematic discussion, and up-to-date analysis of African oral traditions and folklore. Akintunde Akinyemi is Professor and Chair in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at the University of Florida, USA. Toyin Falola is the Jacob and Frances Sanger Mossiker Chair in the Humanities and a Distinguished Teaching Professor at the University of Texas at Austin, USA.",,,,,"Akintunde Akinyemi, Toyin Falola",,2021,2021,,2021,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,3,3,,5.2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136044348,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",4 Quality Education

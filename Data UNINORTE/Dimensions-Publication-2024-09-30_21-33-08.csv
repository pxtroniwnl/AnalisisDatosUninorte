OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the water-surface sweeping method in combination with calibration factors to estimate the total number of Ae. aegypti late larval stages (L3/L4) in large water-storage containers at different temperatures at which transmission of dengue virus occurs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calibration factors were derived based on the proportion of L3/L4 recovered from a predetermined number of larvae using a net of specific dimensions and water-storage containers of different capacities and water levels in semi-field conditions and at four different altitudes (14, 358, 998 and 1,630 meters above sea level). The calibration factors obtained at 14 masl were then fully validated in a field study site at this altitude.
RESULTS: Four calibration factors were derived at 14 masl (28-30°C) that were used to estimate the total L3/L4 numbers in large water storage containers greater than 20 L (n=478) at 1/3, 2/3 and full water-levels. This methodology was accurate and robust within and between the 10 pairs of field workers who applied it. Different calibration factors were, however, derived to accurately estimate the total L3/L4 numbers at each of the study sites located at 358, 998 and 1,630 masl, where average temperatures were 19°C, 24°C, and 26°C respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The accurate estimates of L3/L4 numbers calculated using the water surface sweeping method can be useful for evaluating intervention strategies directed against the larval stages.",,,Biomédica,,,Aedes; Animals; Entomology; Larva; Pupa; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Water,2010-08-04,2010,2010-08-04,2010,30,2,268-75,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romero, Claudia M E; Llinás, Humberto; Falconar, Andrew K I","Romero, Claudia M E (Grupo de Investigaciones en Enfermedades Tropicales, Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia. clromero@uninorte.edu.co); Llinás, Humberto (); Falconar, Andrew K I ()",,"Romero, Claudia M E (Universidad del Norte); Llinás, Humberto (); Falconar, Andrew K I ()",3,0,0.12,0.33,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/190/181,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1073856861,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology",3 Good Health and Well Being

Social mobilization (SM) has been a strategic component of the PEI. Yet, a close-up analysis of SM dynamics seems to be lacking in the health communication literature. We examine critical aspects of the PEI experience in an attempt to move from dominant informational perspectives to a focus on emerging challenges in polio eradication efforts and new levels of complexity to SM. We examine available literature on communication and public health, available data on SM experiences that support polio eradication in Africa and Asia, and field work conducted by the authors where polio eradication efforts are ongoing. Our analysis suggests that (1) SM should not be casually approached as a top-down informational strategy to advance pre-established health goals; (2) centralized strategies hardly amount to SM; and (3) hybrid options that combine both activist and pragmatic SM are concrete possibilities for global health initiatives. In the context of renewed global democratization and persistent conflicts rooted in ethnicity, religion, and economics, it cannot be assumed that communities will either diligently espouse global goals or necessarily oppose them. Communication and SM strategies should rely on a clear understanding of the motives and agendas of involved actors. Resistance or opposition are important analytical dimensions as they may uncover new opportunities for effective health interventions. Further studies using these perspectives should be a priority for global health programs, including studies of the trust level, or lack thereof, among social actors.",,,Journal of Health Communication,,,"Africa; Asia; Communication; Community Networks; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Global Health; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Immunization Programs; Male; Poliomyelitis; Poliovirus Vaccines; Social Marketing",2010-05-11,2010,,2010-05-11,15,sup1,25-47,Closed,Article,"Obregón, Rafael; Waisbord, Silvio","Obregón, Rafael (School of Media Arts & Studies, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, USA; Department of Communication, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Waisbord, Silvio (School of Media and Public Affairs, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA)","Obregón, Rafael (Ohio University; Universidad del Norte)","Obregón, Rafael (Ohio University; Universidad del Norte); Waisbord, Silvio (George Washington University)",56,5,1.05,9.67,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034975740,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

HLA profile is different to all other World populations, although they have particular alleles in common with Asians, Australians and Pacific Islanders. In the present work, HLA-A, -B, -DRB1, -DQB1 alleles have been studied in Wayu Amerindians from Colombia. HLA alleles haplotypes, genetic distances and NJ dendrograms were calculated by Arlequin and DISPAN software. Only a few both class I and class II alleles have been observed. Most common extended haplotypes include: A*24-B*51-DRB1*0403-DQB1*0302, A*2-B*15-DRB1*1602-DQB1*0301, A*2-B*35-DRB1*0407-DQB1*0302, but also A*68-B*15-DRB1*0403-DQB1*0302. No trace of Caucasoid or Negroid admixture is detected. The Wayu HLA profile is typical from Amerindians and shows how languages and genes do not correlated particularly in this case (i.e., Wayu closest HLA genetic group is North Argentinian Guarani group). Results obtained in this work may be useful for future transplant programs and also for HLA linked diseases and individualized pharmacogenetics.","This work was supported in part by three grants from the Fundación Mutua Madrileña (2004, 2005, 2006), the Ministry of Health (FIS, PI05/1039 and PI080838) and the Ministry of Foreing Affairs (A/9134/07 and A/17727/08) grants.

Here we associate water storage behaviors with the rate of A. aegypti pupal production in three dengue-endemic Colombian cities with different mean temperatures. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews and pupal counts were conducted over a 7–15-day period in 235 households containing a water storage vessel infested with larvae. Emptying vessels more often than every 7 days strongly reduced pupal production in all three cities. Emptying every 7–15 days reduced production by a similar magnitude as emptying <7 days in Armenia (21.9°C), has a threefold smaller reduction as compared to <7 days in Bucaramanga (23.9°C), and did not reduce production in Barranquilla (29.0°C). Lidding vessels reduced mosquito production and was most feasible in Barranquilla because of container structure. Vessel emptying strongly correlated with usage in Barranquilla, where many households stored water in case of interruptions in piped service rather than for regular use. In the cooler cities, >90% of households regularly used stored water for washing clothes, generating a weaker correlation between emptying and usage. Emptying was less frequent in the households surveyed in the dry season in all three cities. These results show that A. aegypti production and human behaviors are coupled in a temperature-dependent manner. In addition to biological effects on aquatic stages, climate change may impact A. aegypti production through human behavioral adaptations. Vector control programs should account for geographic variation in temperature and water usage behaviors in designing targeted interventions.","We are grateful to the residents that permitted our visits; Ben Bolker and Michael Reiskind for helpful comments; Marcelo Torres and Jorge de la Salas for help in field work; Jorge Rey for providing temperature sensors; and the municipal health departments of Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Floridablanca, and Armenia, and the Secretary of Health of Santander for logistical support.

METHODS: A total of 2305 infants were eligible for follow-up evaluation; 2104 infants (1069 in the prenatal corticosteroid therapy group and 1035 in the placebo group) were monitored. The primary outcome was death or neurologic impairment, defined as either cerebral palsy or cognitive delay, at 18 to 24 months of age. The secondary outcomes were measurements of growth (height, weight, and head circumference).
RESULTS: Children exposed to multiple courses of prenatal corticosteroid therapy had similar rates of death or neurologic impairment, compared with children exposed to placebo (148 children [13.8%] vs 142 children [13.7%]; odds ratio: 1.001[95% confidence interval: 0.75-1.30]; P = .95). They had a mean weight of 11.94 kg, compared with 12.14 kg in the placebo group (P = .04), a mean height of 85.51 cm, compared with 85.46 cm (P = .87), and a mean head circumference of 48.18 cm, compared with 48.25 cm (P = .45).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple courses of prenatal corticosteroid therapy, given every 14 days, did not increase or decrease the risk of death or neurologic impairment at 18 to 24 months of age, compared with a single course of prenatal corticosteroid therapy. Continued follow-up monitoring of these children is necessary to assess neurobehavioral function, school performance, and possible susceptibility to disease.","The MACS, including the follow-up phase, was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant 38142), which had no role in study design, management, data collection, analysis, or data interpretation.

A 32-year-old pregnant patient was diagnosed with NMO. First symptoms were headache and sudden visual loss in her right eye (RE). Eighteen months ago, she reported other neurologic symptoms such as paresthesia. Based on her visual field, fundoscopy and Ishihara test, she was diagnosed with retrobulbar neuritis of the RE. After delivery, new neurologic symptoms resembling transverse myelitis appeared. She was treated with methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis, which improved her visual acuity; however, a sudden bilateral INO appeared, with adduction defect and nystagmus with abduction in both eyes. No improvement was obtained after treatment with azathioprine and rituximab. Paresis of the legs and the right arm persisted, but double vision and OIN gradually disappeared. At the end, the patient had a residual exophoria in the RE and nystagmus with abduction in the left eye. Prevalence of NMO is lower than one case per one million inhabitants, and it is not likely to affect the encephalic trunk; furthermore, bilateral INO in NMO is rare. Two major criteria and at least two of the three minor ones are required to confirm a NMO diagnosis, and our patient fulfilled these diagnosis criteria.",,,Case Reports in Neurology,,,,2010-11-12,2010,2010-11-12,,2,3,139-144,All OA; Gold,Article,"Garcia-Martin, E.; Pinilla, I.; Pueyo, V.; Gil, L.; Martinez-Morales, J.; Fernandez, J.","Garcia-Martin, E.

A Markov decision model was built to assess the health outcomes from birth to 24 months of age for three hypothetical cohorts: one unvaccinated, one vaccinated with 2 doses of Rotarix and the third, with 3 doses of Rotateq. Without vaccination, the annual number of medical visits by diarrhea in children under 2 years would be 1,293,159 cases, with 105,378 medical visits and 470 deaths (IC95% 295-560) related to rotavirus. Without vaccination, rotavirus disease would cost around USD$8 millions including direct and indirect costs. Assuming a cost per dose of USD$7.5, average cost-effectiveness ratio would be USD$663/DALY with Rotarix and USD$1391 with Rotateq. When price per dose falls below USD$7 both vaccines yield a similar average cost-effectiveness ratio (USD$1063/DALY). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Rotateq versus Rotarix was USD$7787/DALY. Cost-effectiveness ratio was influenced mainly by vaccine cost and cost per case hospitalized. Other programmatic aspects such as number of doses to be applied, likelihood of completing vaccination schedule with shorter versus longer schedules, and storage space within the chain cold should be considered to make decisions on which vaccine should be introduced. In conclusion, vaccinating against rotavirus in Colombia with either vaccine would be very cost effective. If cost per vaccinated children falls below USD$3 per dose vaccination would be cost saving.","AcknowledgementsThis study was funded by the Ministry of Health through a contract with the School of Medicine of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Recently, Brazilian syncretic churches have helped spread the ritual use of ayahuasca abroad. This trend has raised concerns that regular use of this N,N-dimethyltryptamine-containing tea may lead to the medical and psychosocial problems typically associated with drugs of abuse. Here we assess potential drug abuse-related problems in regular ayahuasca users. Addiction severity was assessed using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and history of alcohol and illicit drug use was recorded. In Study 1, jungle-based ayahuasca users (n=56) were compared vs. rural controls (n=56). In Study 2, urban-based ayahuasca users (n=71) were compared vs. urban controls (n=59). Follow-up studies were conducted 1 year later. In both studies, ayahuasca users showed significantly lower scores than controls on the ASI Alcohol Use, and Psychiatric Status subscales. The jungle-based ayahuasca users showed a significantly higher frequency of previous illicit drug use but this had ceased at the time of examination, except for cannabis. At follow-up, abstinence from illicit drug use was maintained in both groups except for cannabis in Study 1. However, differences on ASI scores were still significant in the jungle-based group but not in the urban group. Despite continuing ayahuasca use, a time-dependent worsening was only observed in one subscale (Family/Social relationships) in Study 2. Overall, the ritual use of ayahuasca, as assessed with the ASI in currently active users, does not appear to be associated with the deleterious psychosocial effects typically caused by other drugs of abuse.",The authors thank all volunteers for their participation.,"Funding for this study was provided by IDEAA, Instituto de Etnopsicología Amazónica Aplicada, Barcelona (Spain)/Prato Raso (Brasil).",Drug and Alcohol Dependence,,,"Adult; Banisteriopsis; Behavior, Addictive; Brazil; Ceremonial Behavior; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Male; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult",2010-06-15,2010,2010-06-15,2010-10,111,3,257-261,Closed,Article,"Fábregas, Josep Maria; González, Débora; Fondevila, Sabela; Cutchet, Marta; Fernández, Xavier; Barbosa, Paulo César Ribeiro; Alcázar-Córcoles, Miguel Ángel; Barbanoj, Manel J.; Riba, Jordi; Bouso, José Carlos","Fábregas, Josep Maria (Instituto de Etnopsicología Amazónica Aplicada (IDEAA), 08037 Barcelona, Spain); González, Débora (Instituto de Etnopsicología Amazónica Aplicada (IDEAA), 08037 Barcelona, Spain); Fondevila, Sabela (Centro UCM-ISCIII para la Evolución del Cerebro y Comportamiento Humanos, Sección de Neurociencia Cognitiva, 5, 28029 Madrid, Spain); Cutchet, Marta (Instituto de Etnopsicología Amazónica Aplicada (IDEAA), 08037 Barcelona, Spain); Fernández, Xavier (Independent Researcher, 08005 Barcelona, Spain); Barbosa, Paulo César Ribeiro (Departamento de Filosofia e Ciências Humanas, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), Ilhéus, 45662 Bahia, Brazil); Alcázar-Córcoles, Miguel Ángel (Departamento de Psicología Biológica y de la Salud, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain); Barbanoj, Manel J.

METHODS: A total of 25 Rheumatologists from 19 countries of the American Continent participated in a consensus-based interactive process (Delphi method) using 2 consecutive electronic questionnaires. The first questionnaire included the following: the relevance of organizing courses to teach MSKUS to Rheumatologists, the determination of the most effective educational course models, the trainee levels, the educational objectives, the requirements for passing the course(s), the course venues, the number of course participants per instructor, and the percentage of time spent in hands-on sessions. The second questionnaire consisted of questions that did not achieve consensus (>65%) in the first questionnaire, topics, and pathologies to be covered at each course MSKUS level.
RESULTS: General consensus was obtained for MSKUS courses to be divided into 3 educational levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced. These courses should be taught using a theoretical-didactic and hands-on model. In addition, the group established the minimum requirements for attending and passing each MSKUS course level, the ideal number of course participants per instructor (4 participants/instructor), and the specific topics and musculoskeletal pathologies to be covered. In the same manner, the group concluded that 60% to 70% of course time should be focused on hands-on sessions.
CONCLUSION: A multinational group of MSKUS sonographers using a consensus-based questionnaire (Delphi method) established the first recommendations and guidelines for MSKUS course training in the Americas. Pan-American League of Associations for Rheumatology urges that these guidelines and recommendations be adopted in the future by both national and regional institutions in the American continent involved in the training of Rheumatologists for the performance of MSKUS.",,,JCR Journal of Clinical Rheumatology,,,"Americas; Delphi Technique; Education, Medical, Continuing; Humans; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Rheumatology; Ultrasonography",2010-04,2010,,2010-04,16,3,113-118,Closed,Article,"Pineda, Carlos; Reginato, Anthony M; Flores, Víctor; Aliste, Marta; Alva, Magaly; Aragón-Laínez, Raúl Antonio; González, Araceli Bernal; Bouffard, José Antonio; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo Vinicio; Chávez-López, Mario; Chávez-Pérez, Nilmo Noel; Collado, Paz; Díaz-Coto, José Francisco; Duarte, Margarita; Filippucci, Emilio; Galarza-Maldonado, Claudio; García-Kutzbach, Abraham; Godoy, Francisco Javier; González-Sevillano, Edgardo; Da Silveira, Inês Guimarães; Gutiérrez, Marwin; Hernández-Díaz, Cristina; Hernández, Jaime; Lamuño-Encorrada, Montserrat; Marcos, Juan Carlos; Marín-Arriaga, Norma; Mendonça, José Alexandre; Michaud, Johan; Moya, Carlos; Muñoz-Louis, Roberto; Neubarth, Fernando; Quintero, Maritza; Reyes, Benjamín; Ruta, Santiago; Rodríguez-Henríquez, Pedro J; Solano, Carla; Ventura-Ríos, Lucio; Möller, Ingrid; Naredo, Esperanza","Pineda, Carlos (Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación, Mexico City, Mexico, DF, Mexico. carpineda@yahoo.com); Reginato, Anthony M (); Flores, Víctor (); Aliste, Marta (); Alva, Magaly (); Aragón-Laínez, Raúl Antonio (); González, Araceli Bernal (); Bouffard, José Antonio (); Caballero-Uribe, Carlo Vinicio (); Chávez-López, Mario (); Chávez-Pérez, Nilmo Noel (); Collado, Paz (); Díaz-Coto, José Francisco (); Duarte, Margarita (); Filippucci, Emilio (); Galarza-Maldonado, Claudio (); García-Kutzbach, Abraham (); Godoy, Francisco Javier (); González-Sevillano, Edgardo (); Da Silveira, Inês Guimarães (); Gutiérrez, Marwin (); Hernández-Díaz, Cristina (); Hernández, Jaime (); Lamuño-Encorrada, Montserrat (); Marcos, Juan Carlos (); Marín-Arriaga, Norma (); Mendonça, José Alexandre (); Michaud, Johan (); Moya, Carlos (); Muñoz-Louis, Roberto (); Neubarth, Fernando (); Quintero, Maritza (); Reyes, Benjamín (); Ruta, Santiago (); Rodríguez-Henríquez, Pedro J (); Solano, Carla (); Ventura-Ríos, Lucio (); Möller, Ingrid (); Naredo, Esperanza ()",,"Pineda, Carlos (Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación); Reginato, Anthony M (); Flores, Víctor (); Aliste, Marta (); Alva, Magaly (); Aragón-Laínez, Raúl Antonio (); González, Araceli Bernal (); Bouffard, José Antonio (); Caballero-Uribe, Carlo Vinicio (); Chávez-López, Mario (); Chávez-Pérez, Nilmo Noel (); Collado, Paz (); Díaz-Coto, José Francisco (); Duarte, Margarita (); Filippucci, Emilio (); Galarza-Maldonado, Claudio (); García-Kutzbach, Abraham (); Godoy, Francisco Javier (); González-Sevillano, Edgardo (); Da Silveira, Inês Guimarães (); Gutiérrez, Marwin (); Hernández-Díaz, Cristina (); Hernández, Jaime (); Lamuño-Encorrada, Montserrat (); Marcos, Juan Carlos (); Marín-Arriaga, Norma (); Mendonça, José Alexandre (); Michaud, Johan (); Moya, Carlos (); Muñoz-Louis, Roberto (); Neubarth, Fernando (); Quintero, Maritza (); Reyes, Benjamín (); Ruta, Santiago (); Rodríguez-Henríquez, Pedro J (); Solano, Carla (); Ventura-Ríos, Lucio (); Möller, Ingrid (); Naredo, Esperanza ()",35,6,0.97,6.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041149525,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

METHODS: Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, classification criteria, laboratory findings, and treatment variables were examined in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the Grupo Latino Americano de Estudio del Lupus Eritematoso (GLADEL) cohort. The diagnosis of SLE, according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, was assessed within 2 years of cohort entry. Cause of death was classified as active disease, infection, cardiovascular complications, thrombosis, malignancy, or other cause. Patients were subdivided by antimalarial use, grouped according to those who had received antimalarial drugs for at least 6 consecutive months (user) and those who had received antimalarial drugs for <6 consecutive months or who had never received antimalarial drugs (nonuser).
RESULTS: Of the 1,480 patients included in the GLADEL cohort, 1,141 (77%) were considered antimalarial users, with a mean duration of drug exposure of 48.5 months (range 6-98 months). Death occurred in 89 patients (6.0%). A lower mortality rate was observed in antimalarial users compared with nonusers (4.4% versus 11.5%; P< 0.001). Seventy patients (6.1%) had received antimalarial drugs for 6-11 months, 146 (12.8%) for 1-2 years, and 925 (81.1%) for >2 years. Mortality rates among users by duration of antimalarial treatment (per 1,000 person-months of followup) were 3.85 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.41-8.37), 2.7 (95% CI 1.41-4.76), and 0.54 (95% CI 0.37-0.77), respectively, while for nonusers, the mortality rate was 3.07 (95% CI 2.18-4.20) (P for trend < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders in a Cox regression model, antimalarial use was associated with a 38% reduction in the mortality rate (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.99).
CONCLUSION: Antimalarial drugs were shown to have a protective effect, possibly in a time-dependent manner, on SLE survival. These results suggest that the use of antimalarial treatment should be recommended for patients with lupus.",We are grateful to Daniel Villalba and Leonardo Grasso for providing expert assistance with the ARTHROS (version 6.0) software.,,Arthritis & Rheumatism,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antimalarials; Cause of Death; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Latin America; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors",2010-02-25,2010,2010-02-25,2010-03,62,3,855-862,Closed,Article,"Shinjo, Samuel K.; Bonfá, Eloísa; Wojdyla, Daniel; Borba, Eduardo F.; Ramirez, Luis A.; Scherbarth, Hugo R.; Brenol, João C.

To date, the etiology of RA is unknown. However, the existence of genetically susceptible individuals was considered. Many studies have been performed worldwide, for example, in Poland, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, among others, regarding the influence between HLA-DR alleles and disease, but not in Ecuador.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of Class I and II HLA alleles in patients with RA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in 30 adult patients with RA previously diagnosed, according to the classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR, 1987) and 28 controls. For Class I and II HLA typing, we adopted the PCR-SSP, and statistical significances were evaluated by Chi-Square.
RESULTS: HLA-DR4 is present in 76.7% of patients, with an allele frequency of 45%, while only 21% of control subjects presented it. The chi-square confirms that HLA-DR4 and RA variables are highly bound (X2 = 11.38, P = 0.00074).
CONCLUSION: There is increased frequency of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR14. The results are similar to those found in other studies. But it would be desirable to increase the sample size in order to find a greater number of genetic profiles and alleles involved.",,,Advances in Rheumatology,,,"Adult; Alleles; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Ecuador; Female; Genes, MHC Class I; Genes, MHC Class II; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Rheumatic Diseases",2010-08,2010,2010-08,2010,50,4,423-427,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arias, María Verónica Aguirre; Domingues, Emilia Vázquez; Lozano, Rodrigo Barquera; Flores, Carlos Vallejo; Peralta, Marilú Mestanza; Salinas, Camilo Zurita","Arias, María Verónica Aguirre (Zurita & Zurita Laboratórios); Domingues, Emilia Vázquez (Zurita & Zurita Laboratórios); Lozano, Rodrigo Barquera (México DF, UNAM, Escola Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Laboratório de Genética Molecular, México); Flores, Carlos Vallejo (); Peralta, Marilú Mestanza (); Salinas, Camilo Zurita (Zurita & Zurita Laboratórios)",,"Arias, María Verónica Aguirre (Zurita & Zurita Laboratórios); Domingues, Emilia Vázquez (Zurita & Zurita Laboratórios); Lozano, Rodrigo Barquera (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Flores, Carlos Vallejo (); Peralta, Marilú Mestanza (); Salinas, Camilo Zurita (Zurita & Zurita Laboratórios)",12,0,0.27,2.17,https://www.scielo.br/j/rbr/a/5Mz9DJsxBL5ZFGrcWM67zhF/?lang=pt&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005297468,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

La investigación revisa y recopila losdocumentales realizados que tienen por tema las fi estas populares, tratando de reconstruir una historia del patrimonio audiovisual sobre las carnestolendas. Parte de textos y publicaciones de prensa, hace un recorrido por algunos de los documentales realizados —proponiendo, por lo que se sabe hasta ahora, que la producción fílmica sobre los carnavales de Barranquilla comenzó en 1914 con el primer documental producido en Colombia— y continúa su inventario crítico hasta llegar al trabajo presentado ante la UNESCO para ilustrar su candidatura como “Obra maestra del patrimonio oral e inmaterial de la humanidad”.Abstract. The Carnival of Barranquilla, traditional festival in the Colombian Caribbean, has become a source of inspiration for artists, fi lm makers, writers, and musicians, as well as the subject of numerous studies by anthropologists, historians, journalists, and sociologists. This research reviews andcompiles fi lm documentaries that feature this carnival with the specifi c goal of reconstructing a history of the audiovisual heritage regarding the celebrants. The study starts with press releases and publications, and examines some of the documentaries —suggesting, based on the information available, that the film record of the Carnival of Barranquilla began in 1914 with the fi rst documentary produced in Colombia—and continues compiling its critical inventory up to the work presented to become part of the World InmaterialHeritage List of Cultural Resources declared by UNESCO in 2003.",,,Boletín de Antropología,,,,2010-09-09,2010,2010-09-09,,21,38,357-380,All OA; Green,Article,"Angarita, Martha Lizcano; Cueto, Danny González","Angarita, Martha Lizcano (); Cueto, Danny González ()",,"Angarita, Martha Lizcano (); Cueto, Danny González ()",0,0,,,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/557/55703817.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154370784,,
3166,pub.1035763772,10.1093/icb/icq099,21558216,,Frequency of Injury and the Ecology of Regeneration in Marine Benthic Invertebrates,"Many marine invertebrates are able to regenerate lost tissue following injury, but regeneration can come at a cost to individuals in terms of reproduction, behavior and physiological condition, and can have effects that reach beyond the individual to impact populations, communities, and ecosystems. For example, removal and subsequent regeneration of clams' siphons, polychaetes' segments, and brittlestars' arms can represent significant energetic input to higher trophic levels. In marine soft-sediment habitats, injury changes infaunal bioturbation rates and thus secondarily influences sediment-mediated competition, adult-larval interactions, and recruitment success. The importance of injury and regeneration as factors affecting the ecology of marine invertebrate communities depends on the frequency of injury, as well as on individual capacity for, and speed of, regeneration. A key question to answer is: ""How frequently are marine benthic invertebrates injured?"" Here, I review the sources and the frequencies of injury in a variety of marine invertebrates from different benthic habitats, discuss challenges, and approaches for accurately determining injury rates in the field, consider evidence for species-specific, temporal and geographic variation in injury rates, and present examples of indirect effects of injury on marine invertebrates to illustrate how injury and regeneration can modify larger-scale ecological patterns and processes.","This review benefitted from discussions with Will Ambrose Jr, Alexa Bely, Sarah Berke, Beth Campbell, Scott Lidgard, Jennifer Page, Paul Rawson, and Sally Woodin.

METHOD: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 91 child and 97 adult patient caregivers in three hospitals located in Cartagena, Colombia. Ferrell et al.'s psychometric test was used for ascertaining social well-being. Student's t-test was used for testing the effect of care-giving on physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being.
RESULTS: Females aged 18 to 59 predominated as caregivers in both groups. The percentage of child caregivers who had not completed primary school was higher than that of those looking after adults. Psychological and social welfare was most affected in stroke care-givers (48.7 cf 50.5 (T<0.05) and 21.8 cf 19.2 (T <0.05), respectively). Child caregivers were significantly more affected than adult caregivers regarding spiritual welfare (23.7 cf 22.6 (T<0.05)). There was no significant difference regarding physical wellbeing (10.5 cf 11.1 (T>0.05)).
CONCLUSIONS: The experience of care-giving significantly modified people's perception of others' quality of life.

However, although there are well-defined diagnostic criteria, these can occur scattered throughout the course of the disease or simulate different pathologies leading to delayed diagnosis and increased risk of a heart condition. The purpose of this study is to recognize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Kawasaki disease in children admitted to five medical centers in Barranquilla from 2002 to 2008.Patients and MethodsThis is a retrospective study based on the medical records of patients less than 14 years old hospitalized in five medical centers in the city of Barranquilla, Atlántico, (Pediatric Hospital, Hospital Niño Jesús, Clinics: Caribbean, Assumption and La Merced) and diagnosed with Kawasaki disease from February 1, 2002 to May 31, 2008. Descriptive statistical parameters and non-parametric tests (sign test) have been estimated.ResultsForty percent of the cases occurred in infants less than one year old. Sixty percent (65%) of the patients were male children from the urban area. Fever was the main reason for consulting in 65% of the cases, and 95% of the patients were classified as having the typical disease. Ultrasonographic cardiac abnormalities were documented in 30% of the instances. The test measures for determining the effectiveness of treatment were based on changes in the platelet count, the sedimentation rate, and the C-reactive protein (CRP).ConclusionsKawasaki disease in our environment shows clinical and epidemiological features similar to those described in other latitudes. There are variations in the sedimentation rate (ESR), platelet count, and CRP in those subjects who received intravenous immunoglobulin.

The authors propose the use of a meta-heuristic procedure inspired from bacterial phototaxis. This procedure, called Global Bacteria Optimization (GBO), emulates the reaction of some organisms (bacteria) to light stimulation. Computational experiments are performed using well-known instances from literature. Results show that the algorithm equals and even outperforms previous state-of-the-art procedures in terms of quality of solution and requires very short computational time.",,,International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems,,,,2010-10-01,2010,,2010-10-01,1,4,47-58,Closed,Article,"Montoya-Torres, Jairo R.; Gómez-Vizcaíno, Libardo S.; Solano-Charris, Elyn L.; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.","Montoya-Torres, Jairo R.

It was found that V atoms preferentially adsorb at the T4 sites at low and high coverages (from 1/4 up to 1 monolayer). In addition, calculating the relative surface energy of several configurations and various V concentrations, we constructed a phase diagram showing the energetically most stable surfaces as a function of the Ga chemical potential. Based on these results, we found that incorporation of V adatoms in the Ga-substitutional site is energetically more favorable compared with the adsorption on the top layers. Our calculations show that the vanadium incorporation is most favorable under a nitrogen environment, in agreement with recent experimental results.","The calculations reported in this paper were performed using computing facilities of the HIPERLAB-cluster of Universidad del Norte, and the DGSCA-UNAM supercomputing center.

Agardh from Northern-Central Chile.,"Many small arthropod herbivores from terrestrial and marine environments construct tubicolous nest-like domiciles on their host plants or algae by rolling up selected portions of the leaf or blade. Nests serve as both shelter and food, which results in conflicting needs for the grazers because feeding activity continuously destroys parts of the nests. While the nesting habit of ampithoid amphipods and other peracarid crustaceans is widely known, very little is known about the nest dynamics and how the conflict between shelter and food requirements is resolved. Herein we examined the nest-building behavior and nest occupancy of the kelp-dwelling amphipod Peramphithoe femorata on the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Domiciles on the distal-most part of the blades were occupied by amphipods and were steadily advanced toward the blade base. Since the blades grow from a basal growth meristem, blades and nests develop in opposite directions. Thus, the amphipods exploit the kelp growth pattern to maintain their nests in the medium-distal part of the blades. During a 2-week-long experiment, we observed that blade elongation equaled nest advancement during the first 8 days after nest construction. Thereafter, blade growth slowed down and was surpassed by nest advancement rates, possibly forcing amphipods to seek out new blades. Nest occupancy was generally short (1-4 days), but some amphipods resided longer (>4 days) in their nests. The sophisticated nest-building behavior of P. femorata and other ampithoids maximizes nest persistence, offers optimal protection against predators, and promotes feeding on nutritive or, alternatively, on less defended tissues.",,,Biological Bulletin,,,Amphipoda; Animals; Chile; Female; Macrocystis; Nesting Behavior,2010-06,2010,,2010-06,218,3,248-58,Closed,Article,"Cerda, Osvaldo; Hinojosa, Iván A; Thiel, Martin","Cerda, Osvaldo (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Hinojosa, Iván A (); Thiel, Martin ()",,"Cerda, Osvaldo (Catholic University of the North); Hinojosa, Iván A (); Thiel, Martin ()",27,3,0.23,2.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058871834,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

The infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by mother-to-child transmission leads to impaired cellular immune responses, a situation that poses a great challenge regarding the universal use of BCG vaccine. World Health Organization recommends that children who are known to be HIV-infected, even if asymptomatic, should no longer be immunized with BCG. Many of the complications of BCG vaccination occur in severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected children and are related to late institution of antiretroviral and antimycobacterial therapy. We report two cases of BCG-itis in HIV-infected infants, who fulfilled clinical criteria of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: axillary adenitis, one with suppuration, and both temporally associated with precocious restoration of immunity elicited by the use of antiretroviral therapy.

The aims of the present study were determine some nutritional and functional properties as well as genotoxicity of flour obtained from Prosopis ripe pods that were submitted to different processing. Sucrose constituted the main sugar for flours obtained from Prosopis alba and Prosopis nigra. Decoctions and macerations showed around 2.9% and 1.4% of soluble proteins, respectively. The highest free phenolics, flavonoids and condensed tannins contents were observed in aqueous extractions with heating. None of the samples presented phytic acid levels high enough to constitute a nutritional problem. Antioxidant activity (AA) was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS and β-carotene bleaching assays. Results showed that the antioxidant potential was significantly higher in flour obtained from P. nigra pods than in that from P. alba pods, and it was also higher in aqueous extracts than in alcoholic ones. Data obtained suggests that compounds responsible for AA are thermostable; therefore, Prosopis flour might be capable of retaining a significant amount of antioxidant capacity after heating. Prosopis extracts did not show any mutagenic effect with and without metabolic activation. Prosopis flour proved to be a non conventional, novel and rich source of antioxidant compounds that could help to prevent pathologies associated with oxidative stress.","AcknowledgmentsThis research was partially supported by Grants from the Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino, Tucumán (UNSTA); Consejo de Investigación de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (CIUNT, Tucumán, Argentina) and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET; Buenos Aires, Argentina).",,Food Research International,,,,2010-06,2010,,2010-06,43,5,1505-1510,Closed,Article,"Cardozo, María Luz; Ordoñez, Roxana Mabel; Zampini, Iris Catiana; Cuello, Ana Soledad; Dibenedetto, Graciela; Isla, María Inés","Cardozo, María Luz (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Bioquímica, Química y Farmacia, UNT, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Ordoñez, Roxana Mabel (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Bioquímica, Química y Farmacia, UNT, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo, UNT, Miguel Lillo 205, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Zampini, Iris Catiana (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Bioquímica, Química y Farmacia, UNT, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo, UNT, Miguel Lillo 205, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Cuello, Ana Soledad (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Dibenedetto, Graciela (Universidad Nacional de Tucumán es parte de c, Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino 9 de Julio 165, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Isla, María Inés (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Bioquímica, Química y Farmacia, UNT, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo, UNT, Miguel Lillo 205, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina)","Isla, María Inés (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; National University of Tucumán; National University of Tucumán)","Cardozo, María Luz (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; National University of Tucumán); Ordoñez, Roxana Mabel (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; National University of Tucumán; National University of Tucumán); Zampini, Iris Catiana (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; National University of Tucumán; National University of Tucumán); Cuello, Ana Soledad (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Dibenedetto, Graciela (National University of Tucumán); Isla, María Inés (Instituto de Química del NOA, INQUINOA-CONICET, Ayacucho 471, C.P. 4000, S.M. de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina; National University of Tucumán; National University of Tucumán)",60,6,,5.25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005643836,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",

Here we use official Chilean landing reports and non-conventional indicators, such as fishers' perceptions and spearfishing competition results, to provide evidence of reef fishes depletions caused by unregulated spearfishing. Results show that the three largest and most emblematic reef fishes targeted mainly by spearfishers (> 98% of landings) [Graus nigra (vieja negra), Semicossyphus darwini (sheephead or pejeperro), and Medialuna ancietae (acha)] show signs of depletion in terms of abundance and size and that overall the catches of reef fishes have shifted from large carnivore species toward smaller-sized omnivore and herbivore species. Information from two snorkeling speargun world championships (1971 and 2004, Iquique, Chile) and from fishers' perceptions shows the mean size of reef fish to be declining. Although the ecological consequences of reef fish depletion are not fully understood in Chile, evidence of spearfishing depleting temperate reef fishes must be explicitly included in policy debates. This would involve bans or strong restrictions on the use of SCUBA and hookah diving gear for spearfishing, and minimum size limits. It may also involve academic and policy discussions regarding conservation and fisheries management synergies within networks of no-take and territorial user-rights fisheries areas, as a strategy for the sustainable management of temperate and tropical reef fisheries.","We thank the small‐scale and recreational divers who took part in this study for their patience and support.

The ND-PANI nanocomposite films were characterized by UV−vis, FTIR, electrochemistry, impedance, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and electrical conductivity techniques. Current−voltage characteristics of ND-PANI nanocomposite show the ohmic junction. The electrochemical investigation on ND-PANI revealed the wider potential values with independent redox characteristics of PANI and ND. There is an interaction of the free electron pairs of the nitrogen atoms of the PANI with a charged molecule on the surface of ND with PANI. The concept of using an active electronic barrier ND-PANI barrier built-in electric field is created at the metal surface.

Therefore, in a good design respondents may often find themselves close to indifference and thus perception thresholds may be an issue. We propose a discrete choice model to examine the behaviour of individuals with indifference thresholds, i.e. that would make them perceive two or more alternatives as almost identical in stated choice (SC) experiments. Such thresholds may be stochastic, differ among the population and even be a function of socio-economic characteristics and choice conditions. Two estimate this model we need SC data including an “indifference option”, so that respondents are not forced to choose when finding that the two alternatives are equally attractive. Our formulation allows estimating the parameters of a threshold probability distribution using information about choices. As an illustration, the model is applied both to synthetic and real data; results clearly show that when indifference thresholds exist, using models without them can lead to errors in estimation and prediction.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Colciencias and the Colombian Transport Ministry for having supported this research through Contract 440 07.

The occupational sequence covers a period of 11,000 years of prehistory, in which distinct patterns of resource use are examined such as hunting, fishing and gathering techniques, animal domestication, agriculture, animal husbandry, mining, commerce and trade. The study also incorporales innovations based on industrial scale mining developments in colonial times, the 19th century industrial period and the present day (extractive mega projects). A variety of cultural, technological and productive developments are discussed in relation to continuity and shifts in human occupations and their impact on the spatial distribution of the population in different locations from the Andes to the Pacific. A marked imbalance can be observed between traditional natural resource production and extractive mining activities that lead to extreme ecological fragility due to the indiscriminate use of water resources. The paper suggests that sustainable development is being jeopardised by the lack of research and alternative models, coupled with a lack of coherence among political, scientific and ethical discourses. Se presenta una secuencia cronolgica de las ocupaciones humanas del Desierto de Atacama y los distintos patrones de explotacin de recursos desde fines del Pleistoceno hasta la actualidad, en uno de los territorios ms estriles del Nuevo Mundo. Esta secuencia ocupacional comprende un lapso temporal de 11.000 aos, en la cual se examinan las distintas modalidades del manejo de recursos naturales a travs de prcticas de caza, pesca, recoleccin, domesticacin de animales, actividades agrarias, pecuarias, mineras, intercambio y comercio. Adems, se incorporan las innovaciones basadas en la explotacin minera a escala industrial durante el periodo colonial e industrial del siglo XIX hasta la actualidad (megaproyectos extractivos).

Organic polymer-based electronic devices have the potential to be lower in cost and more flexible in the manner in which they are manufactured. However, they need significant improvement in both efficiency and long-term stability. Therefore, we made an attempt to synthesize zinc oxide (ZnO)–polyaniline (PANI) using chemical and emulsion polymerization techniques. The properties of ZnO–PANI films were then systematically characterized with several physical techniques. Electrochemical investigations revealed that the individual redox properties of ZnO and PANI can be maintained in a nanocomposite ZnO–PANI system. Furthermore, our results indicated that ZnO–PANI films can exhibit a wide redox potential window. Moreover, we observed the formation of a single-layer nano-Schottky junction in ZnO–PANI films, and interesting positive temperature coefficient properties in ZnO–PANI-embedded polystyrene films.",,,Polymer Journal,,,,2010-10-20,2010,2010-10-20,2010-12,42,12,935-940,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Alvi, Farah; Ram, Manoj K; Gomez, Humberto; Joshi, Rakesh K; Kumar, Ashok","Alvi, Farah (Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA); Ram, Manoj K (Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA); Gomez, Humberto (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Departamento de Ingenieria Mecanica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Joshi, Rakesh K (Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA); Kumar, Ashok (Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA)","Alvi, Farah (University of South Florida; University of South Florida)","Alvi, Farah (University of South Florida; University of South Florida); Ram, Manoj K (University of South Florida); Gomez, Humberto (University of South Florida; Universidad del Norte); Joshi, Rakesh K (University of South Florida; University of South Florida); Kumar, Ashok (University of South Florida; University of South Florida)",28,4,,3.22,https://www.nature.com/articles/pj201089.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030809674,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

The sediment scour process in these storm-water structures differs from the unidirectional scour and sediment transport process that occurs in pipes and channels. The hydrodynamics is affected by the particular characteristics of the hydraulic structure. The study of sediment scour in these devices requires incorporation of all the factors involved in the scour phenomenon and is best supported through computational fluid dynamic modeling (CFD) verified experimentally. Scour can be documented in the effluent as suspended sediment or total suspended solids concentration, a parameter of critical importance in storm-water quality management. This paper presents two simplified models for estimating effluent suspended sediment concentration attributable to scour of previously captured sediment. These models are based on results obtained from full-scale physical experimentation and calibrated and validated CFD modeling over a wide range of operating conditions where different particles sizes would be scoured. This paper also shows the effects of the armoring layer and of homogeneous and heterogeneous sediment sizes on the effluent concentration patterns.",,,Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering,,,,2010-09-10,2010,2010-09-10,2011-03,137,3,114-120,Closed,Article,"Avila, Humberto; Pitt, Robert; Clark, Shirley E.","Avila, Humberto (Professor, of Water Resources Engineering, and Chair, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, .

However, many interesting human activities are characterized by a complex temporal composition of simple actions. Automatic recognition of such complex actions can benefit from a good understanding of the temporal structures. We present in this paper a framework for modeling motion by exploiting the temporal structure of the human activities. In our framework, we represent activities as temporal compositions of motion segments. We train a discriminative model that encodes a temporal decomposition of video sequences, and appearance models for each motion segment. In recognition, a query video is matched to the model according to the learned appearances and motion segment decomposition. Classification is made based on the quality of matching between the motion segment classifiers and the temporal segments in the query sequence. To validate our approach, we introduce a new dataset of complex Olympic Sports activities. We show that our algorithm performs better than other state of the art methods.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computer Vision – ECCV 2010,"Kostas Daniilidis, Petros Maragos, Nikos Paragios",,2010,2010,,2010,6312,,392-405,All OA; Hybrid,Chapter,"Niebles, Juan Carlos; Chen, Chih-Wei; Fei-Fei, Li","Niebles, Juan Carlos (Stanford University, 94305, Stanford, CA, USA; Princeton University, 08544, Princeton, NJ, USA; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Chen, Chih-Wei (Stanford University, 94305, Stanford, CA, USA); Fei-Fei, Li (Stanford University, 94305, Stanford, CA, USA)",,"Niebles, Juan Carlos (Stanford University; Princeton University; Universidad del Norte); Chen, Chih-Wei (Stanford University); Fei-Fei, Li (Stanford University)",563,41,,140.16,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-15552-9_29.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032055412,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

Murra y a la que todava no se le ha podido dar una respuesta satisfactoria. Con esto no pretendemos resolver el desafo legado por Murra, sino dar una diferente lectura a la informacin arqueolgica existente y con ello formular una hiptesis que pueda orientar el debate y la bsqueda de respuestas bajo un panorama de mayor amplitud. Nuestro enfoque se centra en el segmento de la vertiente occidental andina correspondiente al norte del actual territorio chileno, planteando que en esta franja el modelo de verticalidad archipielgica, tal como definido por Murra, se consolid solamente en el Perodo Intermedio Tardo. Con anterioridad (perodo Medio), la necesidad de complementariedad vertical habra sido resuelta a travs del macrosistema orquestado por Tiwanaku, entidad que perfeccion el ""sistema de interaccin reticular"" (Llagostera 2006), de data anterior, por lo que no necesariamente tuvo que recurrir a colonias. En el Intermedio Tardo se conjugaron acontecimientos sociopolticos y eventos medioambientales que motivaron una reestructuracin sin precedentes en las tierras altoandinas y en los Valles Occidentales. En estos ltimos, las poblaciones vallunas que haban alcanzado su apogeo sociocultural se habran reestructurado bajo mecanismos que podran asimilarse a los sistemas de ""dualidad"". En tanto, las poblaciones del altiplano, que estaban siendo flageladas por una intensa sequa, habran iniciado un clima de agresin y de violencia hacia las poblaciones de las cabeceras de los valles occidentales para apoderarse de la produccin hortcola y de sus tierras. Finalmente, los reductos de estas poblaciones precordilleranas (que originalmente hacan parte de la dualidad valluna) habran cado en poder de las poblaciones altiplnicas, convirtindose en colonias (""islas"") de estas ltimas, consolidando la estructura de ""archipilago vertical"", con cabecera en el altiplano. De esta manera se habra dado forma a los archipilagos tnicos Caranga, Quillaca y Lipes, que seran los ms meridionales del mundo andino. The present work returns to the problem of the limits and limitations of the 'vertical archipelago', raised three decades ago by John V. Murra, and which still remains without a satisfactory solution. Rather than resolve the challenge left by Murra, / here offer a different approach to the archaeological information, which leads me to formulate a hypothesis that may guide the debate and search for answers within a wider context. Concentrating on the Western slopes of the Andes in the North of Chile, I propose that the model of the vertical archipelago, as defined by Murra, was consolidated only in the Late Intermediate Period. During the Middle Horizon, the need for vertical complementarity could have been resolved through the macro-system organized by Tiwanaku, a civilization that perfected the older ""system of reticulated interaction "" (Llagostera 2006), and did not depend on colonies for access to distant resources. But in the Late Intermediate Period, sociopolitical and environmental events combined to bring about a new form of organization in the Andean highlands and in the Western Valleys of the Pacific. In the latter, populations that had reached their sociocultural upper limit would have been restructured under mechanisms assimilable to those of 'duality'. Meanwhile the highland populations, afflicted by an intense drought, would have unleashed violent attacks against those living in the head-waters of the Western Valleys to get hold of their agricultural lands. Finally, the remnants of these pre-Andean populations (originally part of the valley dual organization) would have fallen into the hands of the altiplanic populations, becoming colonies ('islands') which consolidated a 'vertical archipelago structure' whose nuclei lay on the Altiplano. In this way were formed the southernmost archipelagoes of the Andean world: Caranga, Quillaca and Lipes.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2010-06,2010,2010-06,,42,1,283-295,All OA; Gold,Article,"Llagostera, Agustn","Llagostera, Agustn (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)",,"Llagostera, Agustn (Catholic University of the North)",13,1,,1.06,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v42n1/art36.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010853582,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 44 Human Society,

En este trabajo se pretenden abordar algunas de esas nuevas alternativas. La primera de ellas es la creacin de bases de datos genticas civiles que ha permitido el desarrollo de dos programas de identificacin de personas: programa FNIX de identificacin de cadveres y restos humanos desaparecidos y la iniciativa DNA-PROKIDS que lucha contra el trfico de seres humanos y pretende reunir a las vctimas con sus familias.

Scientific and technological progress in the tools used in forensic genetics has permitted new implementations of this field to others. In this paper, some of the newest alternatives will be tackled. Firstly, the creation of a civil genetic database has allowed the development of programs for human identification. FENIX, program, to identify corpses and missing human remains and DNA-PROKIDS that fights against human trafficking and hopes to reunite victims with their families. In the last decade, it is becoming more common to encounter DNA analysis in history projects, paleontology and so on. It is in such cases that we find ancient samples. So, another application is the work with aDNA of which we will show some examples. Thanks to these new techniques some historical remains of important personages have been identified, Zar Nicols II of Rusia, Cristobal Colombus and his relatives, Blanca of Navarra, the Prince of Viana and the general Miranda; as well as the recovery of some species in danger of extinction and the characterization of some historical elements.

There were used two processes in order to figure out the limits as following as: “The condition of no extinction” and “The condition of extinction in the near future”.

For the case where $i := di\tau$, the Esty’s comparison lemma 2.3 is used to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the joint probability generating function F$F(s_1,...,\tau_k)$, for $t\longrightarrow \infty $; for the case  $i := \tau + di$ is not used. For this last case is founded another comparison lemma (lemma 4.3), that is the base to demonstrate the theorems limits if $i := \tau ± di$.",,,Revista de Matemática Teoría y Aplicaciones,,,,2010-08-01,2010,2010-08-01,,17,2,103-120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Solano, Humberto Llinás","Solano, Humberto Llinás (Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística)",,"Solano, Humberto Llinás (Universidad del Norte, Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/matematica/article/download/2123/2086,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067859201,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4905 Statistics,

The performance of the cycle for a range of boiler pressures, ammonia concentrations and isentropic turbine efficiencies are studied to find out the sensitivities of net work, amount of cooling and effective efficiencies. The roles of rectifier and superheater on the cycle performance are investigated. The cycle heat source temperature is varied between 90-170 °C and the maximum effective first law and exergy efficiencies for an absorber temperature of 30 °C are calculated as 20% and 72%, respectively.

However, the monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) has not been associated with chronic periodontitis. Chronic periodontitis is an infection showing episodic supporting tissue destruction. The aim of this study is to determine the levels and expression of MCP-3 in periodontal sites characterized by active periodontal connective tissue destruction.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 15 patients with a progression of periodontitis (15 of 56 patients), 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and 10 healthy subjects without periodontal disease. As determined by the tolerance method, the 15 patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis showed a progression of periodontitis over a 4-month period. Periodontitis was characterized by at least six sites with a probing depth >or=5 mm, clinical attachment level >or=3 mm, and radiographic bone loss. Gingival crevicular fluid was collected using a paper strip. The total protein concentration was determined. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine the total amount of MCP-3, and an immunoWestern blot was conducted to assess molecular MCP-3 forms. To determine the MCP-3 expression by immunohistochemistry, gingival biopsies were obtained from patients with chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects during third-molar extraction surgery. Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software. Data were expressed as subject means +/- SD, using the chi(2) and Student t tests.
RESULTS: The total amount and concentration of chemokine MCP-3 were significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy subjects (8.25 pg versus 0.53 pg, P = 0.006 and 2.95 pg/microl versus 0.45 pg/microl, P = 0.04, respectively). Active sites showed a significantly higher total amount and concentration of MCP-3 than inactive sites (11.12 versus 2.88 pg, P value = 0.005 and 3.95 versus 1.02, P value = 0.005, respectively). Western blot and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of MCP-3 in periodontal disease, with observable differences between patients with chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: MCP-3 was highly expressed in patients with chronic periodontitis, particularly in those with progressive periodontal lesions. MCP-3 could be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells toward periodontal tissues during the progression of the disease.",,,Journal of Periodontology,,,Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Chemokine CCL7; Chi-Square Distribution; Chronic Periodontitis; Disease Progression; Female; Gingiva; Gingival Crevicular Fluid; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values,2010-02,2010,2010-02,2010-02,81,2,267-276,Closed,Article,"Dezerega, Andrea; Pozo, Patricia; Hernández, Marcela; Oyarzún, Alejandro; Rivera, Oriana; Dutzan, Nicolás; Gutiérrez‐Fernández, Ana; Overall, Christopher M.; Garrido, Mauricio; Alcota, Marcela; Ortiz, Emilio; Gamonal, Jorge","Dezerega, Andrea (Periodontal Biology Laboratory, Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.); Pozo, Patricia (Department of Chemistry and Pharmaceuticals, Medicine School, Catholic University of the North, Antofagasta, Chile.); Hernández, Marcela (Periodontal Biology Laboratory, Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.); Oyarzún, Alejandro (Oral Biology Area, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Finis Terrae, Santiago, Chile.); Rivera, Oriana (Periodontal Biology Laboratory, Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.); Dutzan, Nicolás (Periodontal Biology Laboratory, Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.); Gutiérrez‐Fernández, Ana (Biochemistry and Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.); Overall, Christopher M.

After questioning some of the criticisms directed to Heidegger due to his emphasis on the ontological scope, the sense of the concept of acknowledgment concept and its nexus with the notion of nearness is approached, to end up with the identification of nearness with language. This identfication will give to the experience of acknowledgment its ontic-ontological character that will allow the understanding of its ""essence"". The question on the condition of possibility of acknowledgment will lead to the concept of ""Vorausahnung"", not treated by Heidegger but made possible by his philosophizing.

In the former case atoms on end faces are displaced axially but are free to move laterally, and in the latter case atoms on end faces are restrained from moving laterally during their axial displacement. It is found that the stress distribution in the unloaded reference configuration is non-uniform, and it satisfies the local and the global equilibrium equations. Large values of the von Mises stress and the maximum shear stress occur on atoms located at the third layer beneath the traction free surfaces forming different patterns for specimens loaded in tension and compression. The specimen is assumed to yield when its total strain energy drops noticeably. Maximum values of the von Mises stress and the maximum shear stress at yielding are essentially independent of specimen’s length for specimens deformed in tension. For specimens deformed in compression, wave-like patterns of stresses along the axial centroidal axis are observed when the specimen yields.","AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by the ONR Grant N00014-06-1-0567 to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with Dr. Y.D.S.

1382,pub.1071046073,10.3141/2155-15,,,Evaluation of the Speed Constant and Its Effect on the Calibration of Friction-Measuring Devices,"The speed constant (S p ) parameter dictates the speed variation of the wet friction measurements taken on a given pavement surface. Although ample evidence exists in the literature associating the S p parameter only to the macrotexture characteristics of pavement surfaces, stronger correlations were obtained when the S p parameters were related to the pavement macrotexture in device-specific fashion. The results of the current investigation suggest the revision of the procedure for computation of the S p parameter to incorporate device-specific properties in it as well. The necessity for revision is supported further by the fact that the speed gradient of friction on any interface must depend on the characteristics of both contact surfaces, which, in this case, are the pavement and the evaluation devices. The incorporation of vehicle characteristics in the S p parameter computations might address a well-known deficiency of the international friction index (IFI), which is the inconsistent FR60 (predicted friction at 60 km/h) obtained from the friction values measured at two different slip speeds on the same surface. Because of this inconsistency, the device calibration parameters A and B used in the computation of the IFI parameters are sensitive to the slip speed of the measuring device. This study also showed that the modification of the S p parameter reduces significantly the slip speed dependency of the device calibration parameters A and B.",,,Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2010-01-01,2010,2010-01-01,2010-01,2155,1,134-144,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, Luis G.; Gunaratne, Manjriker","Fuentes, Luis G.

This cycle, also known as the Goswami Cycle, can be used as a bottoming cycle using waste heat from a conventional power cycle or as an independent cycle using low‐temperature sources such as geothermal and solar energy. Optimum operating conditions were found for a range of ammonia concentration in the basic solution, isentropic turbine efficiency and boiler pressure. It is shown that the cycle can be optimized for net work, cooling output, effective first law and exergy efficiencies. The effect of rectification cooling source (external and internal) on the cycle output was investigated, and it was found that an internal rectification cooling source always produces higher efficiencies.

1357,pub.1032187396,10.1057/ejdr.2010.47,,,Gender and Corruption: Lessons from Laboratory Corruption Experiments,"Reliable microdata on corrupt behavior are hard to obtain in the field, and available field data are hard to interpret. Laboratory corruption experiments have therefore recently gained in popularity, and those that shed light on gender effects are surveyed in this article. The tentative main result is this: if women are involved in a potentially corrupt transaction, it is more likely to fail. The reason is not that women are intrinsically more honest, but that they are more opportunistic when they have the chance to break an implicitly corrupt contract and less engaged in retaliating nonperformance. The survey closes with tentative implications for development policy.Les micro-données fiables sur les comportements de corruption sont difficiles à recueillir sur le terrain, et les données de terrain disponibles sont difficilement interprétables. Les expériences en laboratoire sur la corruption gagnent donc, depuis quelques temps, en popularité. Celles qui mettent en lumière les effets de genre sont examinées dans cet article. Un premier constat provisoire est celui ci: Si des femmes sont impliquées dans une transaction potentiellement frauduleuse, la probabilité d’échec de cette dernière est plus élevée. La raison n’en n’est pas que les femmes sont intrinsèquement plus honnêtes, mais plutôt qu’elles sont plus opportunistes lorsqu’il s’agit de rompre un contrat teinté de corruption et moins enclines à réagir face à des performances insatisfaisantes.

Results showed that boys generally engage in more physical than relational aggression, whereas girls engage in more relational than physical aggression. Among boys, the association between aggression and victimization was significant only for the measure of relational aggression, whereas, for girls, victimization was significantly correlated only with physical aggression. This latter association was found to be significantly stronger for girls from the all-girl schools than for the girls from the mixed-sex schools.

Para ello centramos la atencin en el sector chaupiyunga, etnocategora geogrfica de alta valorizacin en el sistema vertical de pisos ecolgicos entre la costa y el altiplano. Se caracteriz la situacin cultural en esta cuenca ubicada en la subrea Valles Occidentales del Centro Sur Andino y se compar con la situacin del valle de Chilln, Andes Centrales. El panorama arqueolgico en ambas zonas integra una amplia variedad de componentes culturales que, en el caso del Lluta, comprende una mezcla de elementos de tierras bajas, sierra, altiplano e Inka, mientras que en el Chilln confluyen rasgos costeros, chaupiyunga y altoandinos. En el caso del Lluta, se agregan rasgos funerarios y de arte rupestre. Para ambas zonas, pero con distintos niveles de especificidad las fuentes etnohistricas tambin sealan la concurrencia de varias entidades sociales. Lo importarte es que este heterogneo escenario del chaupiyunga se repite en otras zonas chaupiyunga del sur de Per y contrasta con los sectores bajos de los valles que tienden a ser culturalmente ms homogneos. El estado actual del conocimiento arqueolgico no permite sealar con precisin el o los mecanismos concretos de interaccin o complementariedad que expliquen la variabilidad observada en el registro arqueolgico. Primeramente, ste no se corresponde con la idea de islas multitnicas diferenciadas entre s por conjuntos de rasgos propios. Por el contrario, los restos materiales de los diferentes componentes o referentes culturales aparecen mezclados en cada uno de los sitios, por lo que pueden representar varios mecanismos de interaccin social que funcionaron paralela y secuencialmente. Se concluye que el chaupiyunga fue un espacio multitnico, cohabitado, visitado y/o liderado por grupos sociales de distinto origen, que se hicieron presente en este ambiente productivo bajo distintos mecanismos de complementariedad o de interaccin, que pudo incluir entre otros verticalidad (con sus modalidades de verticalidad costera, microverticalidad descentralizada, archipilago vertical centralizado), horizontalidad, simples operaciones de intercambio de productos, proteccin militar y alianzas matrimoniales a travs del intercambio de esposas o esposos. Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and hioanthropological data from Late Intermediate and Late Periods (ca. A.D. 1,000-1,530) was cross-examined to evaluate whether people of the Lluta Valley organized their economy under the Third Case of John Murra model ofVerticality. To do this, we focused on the chaupiyunga sector a geographic ethnocategory of high valuation in the system of the ecological tiers between the coast and highlands, for its productive qualities and geographic connectivity. The cultural composition of this basin located in the western valleys sub area, of the South Central Andes was compared of what has been observed in the Chilln valleys, in the Central Andes. The archaeological arrangement in both zones combines a variety of cultural ceramic style components. While the Lluta valley shows a mixture of items from the lowlands, sierra, altiplano and Inka, the Chilln basin integrates coastal, chaupiyunga and high-Andean elements. For the Lluta case funerary and rock ark features. XVI and XVII century ethnohistorical sources, of different level of specificity, coincide for both regions the interrelation of several social entities. It is important to note that the heterogeneous scenario of the chaupiyunga is observed in similar ecological zones in Southern Peru, which contrasts with the homogeneity of the lower sections of the valleys. The state of the art does not allow to precise the mechanisms of interaction and complementarity to explain the variability of the archaeological records. First there is not correspondence with the idea of multiethnic ""islands "" differentiated by particular set features among themselves. On the contrary, the material is mixed in each of the studied sites, which seem to mean that several mechanisms of interaction were simultaneously or sequentially functioning. We conclude that chaupiyunga was a multiethnic ecological space co-habited, visited and or lead by social groups of diverse origin that access to this productive zone under different mechanisms of complementarity and interaction, which may have included verticality (with is modalities of coastal verticality, decentralized micro verticality, centralized vertical archipelago), horizontality simple exchange operations, military protection, married alliances through the exchange of spouses.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2010-06,2010,2010-06,,42,1,325-340,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santoro, Calogero M; Dillehay, Tom D; Hidalgo, Jorge; R, Daniela Valenzuela; G, lvaro L Romero; Rothhammer, Francisco; Standen, Vivien G","Santoro, Calogero M (Universidad de Tarapac Instituto Alta Investigacin, Arica, Chile; Universidad de Tarapac Departamento de Antropologa, Arica, Chile; Universidad de Tarapac Centro de Investigaciones del Hombre en el Desierto, Arica, Chile); Dillehay, Tom D (Vanderbilt University Department of Anthropology, USA; Universidad Austral de Chile Instituto de Ciencias Sociales, Valdivia, Chile); Hidalgo, Jorge (Universidad de Chile Facultad de Filosofa y Humanidades Departamento de Ciencias Histricas, Santiago, Chile); R, Daniela Valenzuela (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo Programa de Doctorado en Antropologa, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); G, lvaro L Romero (Comisin Asesora de Monumentos Nacionales de Arica y Parinacota, Arica, Chile); Rothhammer, Francisco (Universidad de Tarapac Instituto Alta Investigacin, Arica, Chile; Universidad de Tarapac Centro de Investigaciones del Hombre en el Desierto, Arica, Chile; Universidad de Chile Facultad de Medicina ICBM, Chile); Standen, Vivien G (Universidad de Tarapac Departamento de Antropologa, Arica, Chile)",,"Santoro, Calogero M (Universidad de Tarapac Instituto Alta Investigacin, Arica, Chile; University of Tarapacá; Universidad de Tarapac Centro de Investigaciones del Hombre en el Desierto, Arica, Chile); Dillehay, Tom D (Vanderbilt University; Austral University of Chile); Hidalgo, Jorge (University of Chile); R, Daniela Valenzuela (Catholic University of the North); G, lvaro L Romero (Comisin Asesora de Monumentos Nacionales de Arica y Parinacota, Arica, Chile); Rothhammer, Francisco (Universidad de Tarapac Instituto Alta Investigacin, Arica, Chile; Universidad de Tarapac Centro de Investigaciones del Hombre en el Desierto, Arica, Chile; University of Chile); Standen, Vivien G (University of Tarapacá)",27,4,,5.8,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v42n1/art38.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028877447,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society,

Three types of biomass fuels (grapevine pruning and sawdust wastes, and marc of grape) and a fossil fuel (a coal–coke blend) have been tested. The results obtained show that a reduction in the fuel particle size leads to a significant improvement in the gasification parameters. The thermochemical characterisation of the resulting char–ash residue shows a sharp increase in the fuel conversion for particles below 1mm diameter, which could be adequate to be used in conventional entrained flow gasifiers. Significant differences in the thermochemical behaviour of the biomass fuels and the coal–coke blend have been found, especially in the evolution of the H2/CO ratio with the space time, mainly due to the catalytic effect of the coal–coke ash. The reaction temperature and the space time have a significant effect on the H2/CO ratio (the relative importance of each of these parameters depending on the temperature), this value being independent of the fuel particle size.","AcknowledgementsThe Ministry of Education and Science of the Government of Castilla-La Mancha is gratefully acknowledged for their financial support through the GACOMBIO Research Project (reference PCI08-0063).

METHODS: A study of the instruments was conducted with the tutors (n = 612) and teachers (n = 82) of a controlled sample of 640 children 6-11 years of age, who were students attending public schools (n = 228, 35.6% of total), subsidized schools (n = 200, 31.3%), or private schools (n = 212, 33.1%) in Antofagasta, Chile. The convergent validity of the ADHD rating instruments was determined using Stroop and Wechsler tests.
RESULTS: All three scales studied had satisfactory levels of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.88-0.97 for the scales; 0.76-0.97 for the items) and a factor structure that was theoretically-aligned for most of the assessment areas, although only the Spa-ADHD-IV with tutors and teachers and the ADHD-IV with teachers had comparative and relative fit indices greater than 0.90. Significant differences were found by age, gender, and type of evaluator (tutor or teacher).
CONCLUSIONS: The ADHD-IV and Spa-ADHD-IV met all reliability and validity criteria; so both may be applied for screening and diagnosis in the Chilean population.

OBJECTIVE: Analysis of mortality data from the Dikgale Health and Demographic Surveillance System, in rural South Africa, over the period 1996-2007, to identify local clustering of mortality among the eight villages in the observed population.
DESIGN: Mortality data and person-time of observation were collected annually in an open-cohort population of approximately 8,000 people over 12 years. Poisson regression modelling and space-time clustering analyses were used to identify possible clustering of mortality.
RESULTS: Similar patterns of mortality clustering emerged from Poisson regression and space-time clustering analyses after allowing for age and sex. There was no appreciable clustering of mortality among children under 15 years of age nor in adults 50 years and over. For adults aged 15-49 years, there were substantial clustering effects both in time and in space, with mortality increasing during the period observed and particularly so in some locations, which were nearer to local conurbations. Mortality was relatively lower in the vicinity of the local health centre.
CONCLUSIONS: Although cause-specific mortality data were not available, the rise in mortality in the 15-49-year age group over time and in areas closer to conurbations strongly suggests that the clustering observed was due to the development of HIV/AIDS-related mortality, as seen similarly elsewhere in South Africa. The HIV/AIDS services offered by the local health centre may have contributed to lower relative mortality around that location.","We would like to thank the local village field workers and the members of the Dikgale community for their sustained support of this project.

1281,pub.1057643677,10.1061/(asce)te.1943-5436.0000118,,,Evaluation of the Effect of Pavement Roughness on Skid Resistance,"Roughness of a pavement surface is commonly correlated to its serviceability. On the other hand, on many occasions, investigators have attributed pavement roughness to inadequate skid resistance (friction) as well. However, current pavement friction evaluation and standardization models have yet to incorporate effects of pavement roughness. Hence a study was conducted to investigate and quantify the effects of pavement roughness on the skid number (SN) (or 100 coefficient of friction). First, an experimental program was executed to evaluate SN measured from a locked wheel tester (LWT) on pavement sections with similar micro- and macrotexture conditions but different levels of roughness. The measured average SN was seen to be significantly lower on relatively rougher pavement sections. To explain the above observations, a second set of experiments was conducted to study the effect of the normal load on the LWT tire on SN. Statistical analysis including regression and ANOVA was used to validate the nonlinear reciprocal relationship found between SN and the normal load which contradicts the general perception of constant SN with respect to the normal load. Then, a one-dimensional two-degrees-of-freedom vibration model was formulated to incorporate the significant dynamic fluctuations of the normal load of the LWT induced by pavement roughness and the vehicle speed. The variation of the normal load and its nonlinear relation to SN was used to explain lower SN values measured on relatively rougher surfaces. The feasibility of using the international roughness index and the dynamic load coefficient as predictors of the reduction in SN due to pavement roughness was also investigated. Assurance of adequate skid resistance is a vital factor considered in allocating pavement rehabilitation funds at the network level. Since excessively rough pavements also create skid hazards, it is concluded that roughness effects must be considered in pavement management systems not only for serviceability purposes, but also in safety evaluations.",,,Journal of Transportation Engineering Part A Systems,,,,2010-01-22,2010,2010-01-22,2010-07,136,7,640-653,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, Luis; Gunaratne, Manjriker; Hess, Daniel","Fuentes, Luis (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia (corresponding author).); Gunaratne, Manjriker (Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL.); Hess, Daniel (Professor, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL.)",,"Fuentes, Luis (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia (corresponding author).); Gunaratne, Manjriker (University of South Florida); Hess, Daniel (University of South Florida)",27,2,,6.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1057643677,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The proposed implementation is supported in a new set of linear equations, which allows calculating the approximation of the logarithm and antilogarithm binary functions and leads to a maximum relative error of 1×10-3% and 5×10-3%, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of the logarithmic number system on FPGA for implementing hardware modules to execute multiplication, division, and square root arithmetic operations is also presented and analyzed. In this regards, the analysis takes into account physical resources available on the FPGA, number of clock cycles per arithmetic operation and maximum clock frequency. Experimental results show that using the proposed architecture implemented on the FPGA allows computing multiplication, division and square root operations in only 2 cycles and up to 290.87MHz, obtaining a maximum relative error of 0.015%, 0.018%, and 0.008%, respectively for each one of these arithmetic operations.",,,IEEE Latin America Transactions,,,,2010-12,2010,,,8,6,605-617,Closed,Article,"Carrillo, S; Carrillo, H; Viveros, F","Carrillo, S (Univ. de Ulster, Londonderry, UK); Carrillo, H (Univ. de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain); Viveros, F (Pontificia Univ.

The experiments were performed specifically for the three adopted SiC polytypes, namely 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC, and the results were compared to those obtained for Si crystals. Cell proliferation and adhesion quality were studied using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assays and fluorescent microscopy. For the neural cells studied AFM was also used to quantify the filopodia and lamellipodia extensions on the surface of the tested materials. Fluorescent microscopy was also used to assess platelet adhesion to the semiconductor surfaces where significantly lower values of platelet adhesion to 3C-SiC was observed compared to Si. The reported results show that SiC is indeed a more biocompatible substrate than Si. While there were some differences among the degree of biocompatibility of the various SiC polytypes tested, SiC appears to be a highly biocompatible material in vitro that is also somewhat hemocompatible. This extremely intriguing result appears to put SiC into a unique class of materials that is both bio- and hemo-compatible and is, to the best of our knowledge, the only semiconductor with this property.",,,MRS Advances,,,,2010,2010,2011-02-01,2010,1246,,1246-b08-08,Closed,Article,"Saddow, Stephen E.; Coletti, Camilla; Frewin, Christopher; Schettini, Norelli Castro; Oliveros, Alexandra; Jaroszeski, Mark","Saddow, Stephen E.

Rotational fission of larger bodies has been hypothesized as a mechanism for their formation, an idea that gains support with some new observations. Theory predicts that the mass ratios of two asteroids in a pair will be than about 0.2 and that as the mass ratio approaches this upper limit, the spin period of the larger body is extended. Accordingly, photometric observations of 35 asteroid pairs reveal none with mass ratios greater than 0.2, and as mass ratios approach 0.2, primary periods grow longer. This suggests that asteroid pairs form by rotational fusion of a parent asteroid into a short-lived proto-binary system.","Research at Ondřejov was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.

There has been extensive interest in the analysis of diffusion properties measured along fiber tracts as a function of age, diagnostic status, and gender, while controlling for other clinical variables. However, the existing methods have several limitations including the independent analysis of diffusion properties, a lack of method for accounting for multiple covariates, and a lack of formal statistical inference, such as estimation theory and hypothesis testing. This paper presents a statistical framework, called VCMTS, to specifically address these limitations. The VCMTS framework consists of four integrated components: a varying coefficient model for characterizing the association between fiber bundle diffusion properties and a set of covariates, the local polynomial kernel method for estimating smoothed multiple diffusion properties along individual fiber bundles, global and local test statistics for testing hypotheses of interest along fiber tracts, and a resampling method for approximating the p-value of the global test statistic. The proposed methodology is applied to characterizing the development of four diffusion properties along the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum tract in a study of neurodevelopment in healthy rhesus monkeys. Significant time effects on the four diffusion properties were found.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2010,"Tianzi Jiang, Nassir Navab, Josien P.

When testing an object for set membership, a Bloom filter may give a false positive. The analysis of the false positive rate is a key to understanding the Bloom filter and applications that use it. We show experimentally that the classic analysis for false positive rate is wrong. We formally derive a correct formula using a balls-and-bins model and show how to numerically compute the new, correct formula in a stable manner. We also prove that the new formula always results in a predicted greater false positive rate than the classic formula. This correct formula is numerically compared to the classic formula for relative error – for a small Bloom filter the prediction of false positive rate will be in error when the classic formula is used.",,,Information Processing Letters,,,,2010-10,2010,,2010-10,110,21,944-949,Closed,Article,"Christensen, Ken; Roginsky, Allen; Jimeno, Miguel","Christensen, Ken (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL 33620, USA); Roginsky, Allen (Computer Security Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA); Jimeno, Miguel (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, ENB 118, Tampa, FL 33620, USA)","Christensen, Ken (University of South Florida)","Christensen, Ken (University of South Florida); Roginsky, Allen (National Institute of Standards and Technology); Jimeno, Miguel (University of South Florida)",85,14,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007341148,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Some limiting cases as high and low temperatures are discussed. From the present reasoning, it is suggested that the formulation in two dimensions is sufficient unto itself to explain the problem whenever the length of the cylindrical geometry of the system is large enough.

Cytisine and its derivatives generally show a strong preference for heteromeric alpha4beta2* nAChRs over the homomeric alpha7 subtype, and the structural modifications studied do not cause large changes in their nAChR subtype selectivity. In the present work we docked cytisine, N-methylcytisine, and several pyridone ring-substituted cytisinoids into the crystallographic structure of the Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) co-crystallized with nicotine (1UW6). The graphical analysis of the best poses showed that cytisinoids have weak interactions with the side chains of the non-conserved amino acids in the complementary subunit justifying the use of PDB 1UWB as a surrogate for nAChR. Furthermore, we found a high correlation (R(2)=0.96) between the experimental pIC(50) values at alpha4beta2* nAChR and docking energy (S) of the best cytisinoid poses within the AChBP. Due to the quality of the correlation we suggest that this equation might be used as a predictive model to propose new cytisine-derived nAChRs ligands. Our docking results also suggest that further structural modifications of these cytisinoids will not greatly alter their alpha4beta2*/alpha7 selectivity.","AcknowledgementsThis study was partially supported by Wellcome Trust Collaborative Initiative Grant 073295/Z/03/Z, Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Básicas (PEDECIBA) and Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación (ANII)—Fondo Clemente Estable (FCE 2007_421).",,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters,,,"Alkaloids; Animals; Azocines; Carrier Proteins; Computer Simulation; Crystallization; Lymnaea; Molecular Structure; Nicotine; Protein Binding; Pyridones; Quinolizines; Receptors, Nicotinic; X-Ray Diffraction",2010-05-06,2010,2010-05-06,2010-06,20,12,3683-3687,Closed,Article,"Abin-Carriquiry, Juan Andrés; Zunini, Margot Paulino; Cassels, Bruce K.; Wonnacott, Susan; Dajas, Federico","Abin-Carriquiry, Juan Andrés (Department of Neurochemistry, Instituto de Investigaciones Biológicas Clemente Estable, Av.

Extract Could Be Used to Treat Neuropathic Pain and Implication of Mangiferin,"It has been accepted that neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and glial activation are involved in the central sensitization underlying neuropathic pain. Vimang is an aqueous extract of Mangifera indica L. traditionally used in Cuba for its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. Several formulations are available, and also for mangiferin, its major component. Preclinical studies demonstrated that these products prevented tumor necrosis factor α -induced IκB degradation and the binding of nuclear factor κB to DNA, which induces the transcription of genes implicated in the expression of some mediators and enzymes involved in inflammation, pain, oxidative stress and synaptic plasticity. In this paper we propose its potential utility in the neuropathic pain treatment. This hypothesis is supported in the cumulus of preclinical and clinical evidence around the extract and mangiferin, its major component, and speculates about the possible mechanism of action according to recent advances in the physiopathology of neuropathic pain.",,,Molecules,,,Animals; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Mangifera; NF-kappa B; Neuralgia; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Xanthones,2010-12-09,2010,2010-12-09,,15,12,9035-9045,All OA; Gold,Article,"Garrido-Suárez, Bárbara B.; Garrido, Gabino; Delgado, Rene; Bosch, Fe; del C.

In Buenaventura, a city on Colombia’s Pacific coast, where 92% of the population is Afro-Colombian, there are few published attempts to identify these disorders. Affected individuals require more health care due to higher morbidity and mortality. Early identification of these newborns followed by comprehensive care is important to reduce co-morbidities. Objective: To study newborns and establish the numbers at risk with a bloodspot screening method. This information will demonstrate to Public Health Authorities the need to provide care  for  this  population. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study of a sample of 399 newborns (95% CI) where there is an expected prevalence of 10% of abnormal hemoglobins. Mothers in at least the 36th week of gestation, living in  the urban area of Buenaventura, were used. Umbilical cord blood was drawn and specimens fixed on filter paper and stored at 4°C. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis assays were used to separate the hemoglobins. The results were reported according to the identified hemoglobin as F, A, S, C, D, and G. Results: We processed 399 samples, 353 (88.5%) were normal (hemoglobin FA), 23 (5.8%) were heterozygous for hemoglobin C (FAC), 19 (4.8%) were heterozygous for hemoglobin S (FAS), 2 (0.5%) were heterozygous for hemoglobin G (FAG), 1 was heterozygous for hemoglobin D (FAD) and 1 was heterozygous combined S and C (FSC). Conclusion: Hemoglobins S, C, D, and G are common among infants born in Buenaventura. Hemoglobin C occurred more frequently than in other reported studies.

Many studies in the field of early attachment interventions have promoted a secure attachment bond between mother and infant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an early pilot intervention programme designed to promote a secure attachment bond in mother-infant dyads belonging to a population seeking regular treatment at urban health centres in Santiago, Chile.
METHODS: Primipara mothers were randomly assigned to two intervention conditions: a secure attachment promotion programme (experimental group = 43) or an educational talk (control group = 29). The Strange Situation Assessment was used to collect data on the attachment patterns of babies.
RESULTS: The results show that after the intervention, there were more babies with secure attachment in the experimental group than in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent a preliminary step towards evaluating interventions aimed at promoting secure attachment in Chilean mother-child dyads. While the effect of the intervention is not significant, the effect size obtained is respectable and consistent with other meta-analytic findings.",This study was supported by FONDECYT Research Project N°1040760.,,Child Care Health and Development,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Behavior Therapy; Female; Health Education; Health Promotion; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers; Object Attachment; Parenting; Pilot Projects; Young Adult",2010-11-18,2010,2010-11-18,2011-03,37,2,203-210,Closed,Article,"Santelices, M.

The morphological and life history differences between the pelagic and benthic forms could be explained either by genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity. In the latter case it would correspond to a heterochronic phenotypic plasticity that is fixed in different environments (phenotype fixation). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the two forms are genetically differentiated or not; and thus to infer the underlying basis-heritable or plastic-of the existence of the two forms. Based on barcoding data of mitochondrial DNA (the COI gene), we show that haplotypes from individuals of the pelagic and benthic forms comprise a single genetic unit without genetic differentiation. Moreover, the data suggest that all studied individuals share a common demographic history of recent and sudden population expansion. These results strongly suggest that the differences between the two forms are due to phenotypic plasticity.","This work was partially funded through grants FIP N° 2004‐11 (EA and PAH) and by the Projects P05‐002 ICM and PFB 023 (EP and PS).

Linear classification techniques have an important role to play in this context, given their simplicity and low computational requirements. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in gender classification, giving special attention to linear techniques and their relations. It discusses why linear techniques are not achieving competitive results and shows how to obtain state-of-the-art performances. Our work confirms previous results reporting very close classification accuracies for Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and boosting algorithms on single-database experiments. We have proven that Linear Discriminant Analysis on a linearly selected set of features also achieves similar accuracies. We perform cross-database experiments and prove that single database experiments were optimistically biased. If enough training data and computational resources are available, SVM's gender classifiers are superior to the rest. When computational resources are scarce but there is enough data, boosting or linear approaches are adequate. Finally, if training data and computational resources are very scarce, then the linear approach is the best choice.","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación under contracts TIN2008-06815-C02-02 and TIN2010-19654 and the Consolider Ingenio program contract CSD2007-00018.

The sample was selected on the basis of three criteria and classified into three groups: professors, students and administrators. Each group was surveyed and individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. A qualitative analysis of the instruments was done, based on frequency and range of response. The key findings indicate that one of the factors most associated with good academic performance in the faculties under study is the outstanding academic and teaching credentials of the faculty members, which are reflected in the way they conduct their classes, most of which involve lectures and analysis of jurisprudence. One of the unrelated factors, among others, is the size of the faculty and the number of student who took the ECAES exam.",,,Educación y Educadores,,,,2010-08-01,2010,2010-08-01,2010-08-01,13,2,185-197,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flórez-Peña, Teresa; Rojas-Cristancho, José Miguel","Flórez-Peña, Teresa (Universidad de La Sabana); Rojas-Cristancho, José Miguel ()",,"Flórez-Peña, Teresa (University of La Sabana); Rojas-Cristancho, José Miguel ()",1,0,,0.25,https://doi.org/10.5294/edu.2010.13.2.1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072741602,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

En las zonas rurales es menor del 2%. El mestizaje, el envejecimiento y los factores asociados a la urbanización son los principales determinantes de la epidemia de diabetes que se observa en la región. Entre estos últimos destaca la alta frecuencia de sobrepeso (más del 30%) y de síndrome metabólico (entre 20 y 35%). La intolerancia a la glucosa es casi tan frecuente como la diabetes. Esta enfermedad se encuentra entre las primeras cinco causas de muerte en Colombia y su morbilidad también es considerable. El sistema integrado de seguridad social ha permitido que la mayoría de los colombianos tengan acceso a una atención diabetológica aceptable en cuanto al alcance de metas, aunque todavía existen importantes limitaciones. El gasto en salud es 7 veces más bajo que el de España. La incidencia de diabetes mellitus tipo 1 en Colombia es relativamente baja (de 3-4 por 1 00.000 niños menores de 15 años) y la prevalencia se estima en un 0,07%.AbstractPrevalence of type 2 diabetes in Colombia varies between 4 and 8% depending on the age range of the studied population. In the rural area it is less tan 2%. Ethnic admixture, ageing process and risk factors associated with urbanization are the main determinants of the diabetes epidemic observed in our region. Among the latter, the high frequency of overweight (more than 30%) and metabolic syndrome (20-35%) are the most important. Impaired glucose tolerance is almost as frequent as diabetes. This disease ranks among the first five causes of death in Colombia and its morbidity is also high. Thanks to the integrated health care system, most Colombian citizens have access to an acceptable diabetes care in terms of reaching goals, but there are still important limitations. Health care expenditure is 7 times lower than in Spain.

Recent evidence from these diverse fields is found to support different colonization scenarios. The currently available genetic evidence suggests a ""single migration"" model, in which both early and later Native American groups derive from one expansion event into the continent. In contrast, the pronounced anatomical differences between early and late Native American populations have led others to propose more complex scenarios, involving separate colonization events of the New World and a distinct origin for these groups.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: USING LARGE SAMPLES OF EARLY AMERICAN CRANIA, WE: 1) calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under three different time divergence assumptions, and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions in each case; and 2) further tested three dispersal scenarios for the colonization of the New World by comparing the morphological distances among early and late Amerindians, East Asians, Australo-Melanesians and early modern humans from Asia to geographical distances associated with each dispersion model. Results indicate that the assumption of a last shared common ancestor outside the continent better explains the observed morphological differences between early and late American groups. This result is corroborated by our finding that a model comprising two Asian waves of migration coming through Bering into the Americas fits the cranial anatomical evidence best, especially when the effects of diversifying selection to climate are taken into account.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the morphological diversity documented through time in the New World is best accounted for by a model postulating two waves of human expansion into the continent originating in East Asia and entering through Beringia.",,"Funding: This work has been supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT 11070091), Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP 04/01253-0), Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq 301126-04.6), the Max Planck Gesellschaft and the EVAN Marie Curie Research Training Network MRTN-CT-019564.

Surface microtopography of the shell periostracum has been shown to have antifouling properties for mytilid mussels, and the topography shows regional differences. This article examines whether an optimal shell design exists and evaluates the degree to which shell microstructure is matched with the properties of the local fouling community. Biomimics of four mytilid species from different regional provenances were exposed at eight different sites in both northern and southern hemispheres. Tendencies of the microtopography to both inhibit and facilitate fouling were detected after 3 and 6 weeks of immersion. However, on a global scale, all microtopographies failed to prevent fouling in a consistent manner when exposed to various fouling communities and when decoupled from other shell properties. It is therefore suggested that the recently discovered chemical anti-microfouling properties of the periostracum complement the anti-macrofouling defence offered by shell microtopography.","The authors are grateful to Peter Petraitis (University of Pennsylvania) for providing the experimental data for the US site, Ms Erika Carlson Rhile and Tiago F.

In this study, mango (Mangifera indica L.) stem bark extract (MSBE), its main polyphenol mangiferin and the mangiferin aglycone derivative norathyriol, as well as catechin, gallic acid and quercetin, were investigated for their potential ability to influence ABCB1 gene and P-gp expression in HK-2 cells, a proximal tubule line constitutively expressing this transporter. Western blot analysis demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in P-gp in cells cultured in the presence of MSBE for 72 h. Gallic acid and quercetin also decreased the levels of P-gp at all studied concentrations, whereas catechin was almost ineffective. However, in cells exposed to mangiferin (10-200 microM), the P-gp amount showed a concentration- and time-dependent increase, being 2-fold higher than the controls after 72 h. Norathyriol (5 microM) induced P-gp, but the effect decreased at higher concentrations. The changes in the P-gp protein amount were correlated with relative changes in the ABCB1 mRNA content and with the efflux activity of the transporter. The transcriptional inhibitor 1-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) contrasted the increased expression of ABCB1 by mangiferin, suggesting that the increase could be due to transcriptional up-regulation of ABCB1 mRNA. Mangiferin-treated cells overexpressing the transporter were protected against the cytotoxicity of the known P-gp substrate cyclosporine A. However, the opposite effect was not observed in cells pretreated with MSBE. These results demonstrate that MSBE and mango polyphenols, already shown in our previous studies to influence P-gp activity, may also interact with ABCB1/P-gp at the expression level. In particular, we show for the first time that the main mango polyphenol mangiferin up-regulates this multidrug transporter. The molecular mechanisms and the consequences of these effects, including the possibility of interactions with conventional drugs or other herbal constituents, remain to be elucidated.","AcknowledgementThe authors wish to thank Dr. Chun-Nan Lin (Kaohsiunm, Taiwan) for supplying us with norathyriol.",,Chemico-Biological Interactions,,,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Flavonoids; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mangifera; Phenols; Plant Bark; Plant Extracts; Polyphenols",2010-06-01,2010,2010-06-01,2010-08,186,3,287-294,Closed,Article,"Chieli, Elisabetta; Romiti, Nadia; Rodeiro, Idania; Garrido, Gabino","Chieli, Elisabetta (Dipartimento di Patologia Sperimentale e Biotecnologie Mediche, Facoltà di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università degli Studi di Pisa, via Roma 55, 56126 Pisa, Italy); Romiti, Nadia (Dipartimento di Patologia Sperimentale e Biotecnologie Mediche, Facoltà di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università degli Studi di Pisa, via Roma 55, 56126 Pisa, Italy); Rodeiro, Idania (Laboratorio de Farmacología, Centro de Química Farmacéutica, 200 y 21, Atabey, Playa, Ciudad de La Habana, Cuba); Garrido, Gabino (Departamento de Química y Farmacia, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Chieli, Elisabetta (University of Pisa)","Chieli, Elisabetta (University of Pisa); Romiti, Nadia (University of Pisa); Rodeiro, Idania (Laboratorio de Farmacología, Centro de Química Farmacéutica, 200 y 21, Atabey, Playa, Ciudad de La Habana, Cuba); Garrido, Gabino (Catholic University of the North)",38,1,1.24,3.15,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051723494,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,

Objective: To determine the amount of caregiver burden and related factors on informal caregivers. Methods: A descriptive, correlational study was conducted using a convenience sample of informal caregivers of patients assigned to the prostrate health program in the Municipality of Concepcin, Chile. Sociodemographic variables were recorded and related to the activity of caregiving, as well as caregiver stress, using the Zarit Burden Scale. Latent dimensions were explored using the Burden Scale to determine the multidimensionality of the phenomenon. Data were recorded in a database and entered into SPSS Statistical Program Version 15.0 and descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Results: The results are consistent with most studies on the characteristics of the informal caregiver. The profile is a female between ages 54 and 65 who is a daughter, wife and/or mother who cares for her sick family member for more than 8 hours daily, has carried out this work for over 6 years, has not received caregiver training and presents with moderate levels of stress. Conclusions: It is possible to predict caregiver burden in cases where social networks are poor, where health status in the caregiver is worse than one year earlier, and where the caregiver has some physical ailments. It should be a priority in our health system that informal caregiver burden be given attention and that the informal caregiver role not seen simply as adjunctive or collaborative to the formal health system.",,,Ciencia y enfermería,,,,2010-12,2010,2010-12,,16,3,111-120,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Aravena, Viviane Jofr; Alvarado, Olivia Sanhueza","Aravena, Viviane Jofr (Universidad de Concepcin Depto.

The central aim was to value and construct on-going and future processes of accompaniment and reparations. Given the intervening nature of the process, we simultaneously designed and evaluated various ways of jointly defining, framing, and building conversational processes and strategies as well as the encounters between participants. The process was important for the psychosocial teams, whose presence in the country in terms of providing attention to victims is rather recent, as well as for victims and actors from the legal community, who found ways of collaboratively presenting, participating, and defining the available psychosocial-legal needs, opportunities, and resources in order to encourage the processes of accompaniment and reparation. This learning process was critical to the organization of a national meeting of governmental and non-governmental organizations, victims, and academics that widened perspectives on and enriched our understanding of the context in which victims are attended. The process generated a series of reflections that we gather in this article under the heading lineamentos (guidelines) and in which we privilege the experience and understanding developed by team itself.

El propósito se centró en valorar y construir procesos de acompañamiento y reparación en marcha y por adelantarse. Para ello se crearon espacios reflexivos de conversación entre los diversos actores, particularizando la indagación con los equipos psicosociales y los actores jurídicos. Dado el carácter interventivo del proceso, simultáneamente se diseñaron y evaluaron diversas formas de definir, encuadrar y construir conjuntamente los procesos y estrategias conversacionales y los encuentros entre los actores. El proceso exhibió un valor importante para los equipos psicosociales, cuya presencia en el país en el ámbito de la atención a víctimas es más bien reciente, así como para los actores jurídicos y las víctimas, quienes encontraron formas de presentar, participar y configurar colaborativamente las necesidades, oportunidades y recursos psicosociojurídicos de que disponían para animar los procesos de acompañamiento y reparación. Estos aprendizajes se dinamizaron en un encuentro nacional donde se convocó a organizaciones gubernamentales, no gubernamentales, de víctimas y a la academia, lo que amplió la perspectiva y enriqueció la lectura del contexto de atención a víctimas.

We find the right generalization of this result to the case of non-split alternating tangles. More specifically: the Jones polynomial of tangles is valued in a certain skein module; we describe an alternating condition on elements of this skein module, show that it is satisfied by the Jones invariant of the single crossing tangles (⤲) and (⤲), and prove that it is preserved by appropriately ""alternating"" planar algebra compositions. Hence, this condition is satisfied by the Jones polynomial of all alternating tangles.

The obsidian at this site occurs in flows or sheets of deflated black or reddish to brown pebbles, redeposited on the shores of a lake. Blocks of obsidian are only found around the caldera rim. Here we analyze the shape of the obsidian pebbles and their geochemistry, comparing them with previously published data. The results indicate that the geochemical composition of the samples strongly matches previous analyses of obsidian from cultural contexts.

Southern bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) has a broad distribution along much of the Chilean coast. This species represents an ideal model taxon for studies of coastal marine connectivity and of palaeoclimatic effects, as it grows only on exposed rocky coasts and is absent from beaches and ice-affected shores. We expected that, along the central Chilean coast, D. antarctica would show considerable phylogeographic structure as a consequence of the isolating effects of distance and habitat discontinuities. In contrast, we hypothesised that further south - throughout the region affected by the Patagonian Ice Sheet at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) - D. antarctica would show relatively little genetic structure, reflecting postglacial recolonisation.ResultsMitochondrial (COI) and chloroplast (rbcL) DNA analyses of D. antarctica from 24 Chilean localities (164 individuals) revealed two deeply divergent (4.5 - 6.1% for COI, 1.4% for rbcL) clades from the centre and south of the country, with contrasting levels and patterns of genetic structure. Among populations from central Chile (32° - 44°S), substantial phylogeographic structure was evident across small spatial scales, and a significant isolation-by-distance effect was observed. Genetic disjunctions in this region appear to correspond to the presence of long beaches. In contrast to the genetic structure found among central Chilean populations, samples from the southern Chilean Patagonian region (49° - 56°S) were genetically homogeneous and identical to a haplotype recently found throughout the subantarctic region.ConclusionsSouthern (Patagonian) Chile has been recolonised by D. antarctica relatively recently, probably since the LGM. The inferred trans-oceanic ancestry of these Patagonian populations supports the notion that D. antarctica is capable of long-distance dispersal via rafting. In contrast, further north in central Chile, the correspondence of genetic disjunctions in D. antarctica with long beaches indicates that habitat discontinuity drives genetic isolation among established kelp populations. We conclude that rafting facilitates colonisation of unoccupied shores, but has limited potential to enhance gene-flow among established populations. Broadly, this study demonstrates that some taxa may be considered to have either high or low dispersal potential across different temporal and geographic scales.","We are extremely grateful to all who assisted with this research.

OBJECTIVE: To compare initial fibrosis and fibrosis after IT in patients with AIH.
METHODS: A total of 54 patients were admitted with positive ANA or AML antibodies, or both, elevated IgG immunoglobulins and who met international criteria for a diagnosis of AIH. The mean age was 39 years (range 13-65) and there were 47 women (87%). Two liver biopsies were taken: one at diagnosis and another at a mean of 28±8 months after initiation of IT with prednisone and azathioprine. The degree of inflammation (0-18) and fibrosis (0-6) according to Ishak score was compared between the initial and the follow-up biopsy.
RESULTS: Fibrosis decreased from 2.9±0.3 to 2.2±0.3 (p=0.005) and histological activity index from 6.8±0.45 to 2.6±0.2 (P<.001). In subgroups, fibrosis decreased from 3.6±0.4 to 1.4±0.3 (P<.001) in 22 patients (41%), was unchanged in 27 (50%) and increased in five (9%). There were seven patients with histological cirrhosis at IT initiation. After IT, four showed a reduction in Ishak score (achieving scores of 0-3). Transaminase values were not associated with histological improvement.
CONCLUSION: Fibrosis in patients with AIH significantly improved with IT, emphasizing the importance of studying the prognostic factors associated with this favorable response.",,,Gastroenterología y Hepatología,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Azathioprine; Female; Hepatitis, Autoimmune; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Prednisone; Prospective Studies; Remission Induction; Young Adult",2010-12-30,2010,2010-12-30,2011-01,34,1,10-15,Closed,Article,"Valera, José Miguel; Smok, Gladys; Márquez, Sylvia; Poniachik, Jaime; Brahm, Javier","Valera, José Miguel (Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital San Juan de La Serena y Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro al que pertenecían mientras hacían el trabajo: Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Smok, Gladys (Anatomía Patológica, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Márquez, Sylvia (Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital Barros Luco, Santiago de Chile, Chile; Centro al que pertenecían mientras hacían el trabajo: Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Poniachik, Jaime (Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Brahm, Javier (Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile)","Brahm, Javier (Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile)","Valera, José Miguel (Catholic University of the North; Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile); Smok, Gladys (Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile); Márquez, Sylvia (Sección de Gastroenterología, Hospital Barros Luco, Santiago de Chile, Chile; Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile); Poniachik, Jaime (Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile); Brahm, Javier (Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile)",5,0,0.16,0.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049113887,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Prior investigations throughout northwestern Mexico's littoral have reported highly variable growth rates; furthermore, no studies are available of the environment on growth and gametogenesis in this species under culture conditions. This investigation assesses the effect of food availability and temperature on the growth and gametogenesis of N. subnodosus in a suspended culture system at Guerrero Negro lagoon, Mexico. After 1 year of cultivation, N. subnodosus reached 69.13 mm in shell height (SH) (0.196 mm day−1, 14 months old). Two significant growth spurts were observed: over the two first months of culture (August and September 2001, mean growth rate 0.4 mm day−1) and in September 2002 (0.3 mm day−1), both related to high temperatures and chlorophyll a concentrations. The onset of gametogenesis occurred in April 2002, with an increase in temperature (10‐month‐old scallops, 54.5 mm SH). The first spawning occurred in October and November (86.2 and 93 mm SH), with peak temperatures. These results, together with the analysis of previous reports, indicate that N. subnodosus has a higher preference for temperate areas; therefore, the Guerrero Negro lagoon appears to be a suitable site to culture this species.","This research was funded by projects SEMARNAT‐2002‐C01‐0277, CGPI 2004‐0861, CGPI 2003‐8005 and CGPI 2004‐0906.

On the other hand, nowadays label‐based forwarding is also considered in the context of carrier class Ethernet architectures. Given that these architectures may use different label scopes (domain‐wide vs . local) and size spaces (depending on their encoding), there is a need to analyse and compare the properties of their respective label spaces, particularly in terms of scalability. In this paper, the impact of topology characteristics on label space consumption is studied. The dependency on factors such as the number of nodes, the topology node degree and the network structure is determined (both analytically and via experimentation), allowing a detailed comparison between the properties of the evaluated label spaces. Proposed techniques that can be applied to improve label space usage for label‐based Ethernet forwarding architectures are considered. The proposed methodology and results can serve as guidelines for the design of future label based forwarding architectures.

These sequences were distantly related (83-96% sequence identity) to a limited number of other clone sequences and revealed no identity to cultured Archaea. The abundance of Archaea and Bacteria was estimated using qPCR and community composition was examined through the construction of clone libraries of archaeal 16S rRNA gene. Archaea were found to be dominant over Bacteria in sediments from two saline sites (sites H4: 6.31 x 10(4) and site H6: 1.37 x 10(4) microS cm(-1)) and in one of the water samples (freshwater from site H0: 607 muS cm(-1)). Euryarchaeotal sequences were more abundant than crenarchaeotal sequences. Many of the clone sequences (52%) were similar to uncultured archaeal groups found in marine ecosystems having identity values between 99% and 97%. A major fraction of the sequences (40%) were members of Methanobacteria, while others were included in the Marine Benthic Groups B and D, the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group, the Terrestrial Miscellaneous Euryarchaeotal Group, Marine Group I and Halobacteria. The presence of uncultured archaeal groups in Salar de Huasco extends their known distribution in inland waters, providing new clues about their possible function in the environment.","We thank Carolina Vargas for help with sample collection.

Although the origin of the diachronic morphological diversity seen on the continents is still debated, the distinct morphology of early Americans is well documented and widely dispersed. This morphology has been described extensively for South America, where larger samples are available. Here we test the hypotheses that the morphology of Early Americans results from retention of the morphological pattern of Late Pleistocene modern humans and that the occupation of the New World precedes the morphological differentiation that gave rise to recent Eurasian and American morphology. We compare Early American samples with European Upper Paleolithic skulls, the East Asian Zhoukoudian Upper Cave specimens and a series of 20 modern human reference crania. Canonical Analysis and Minimum Spanning Tree were used to assess the morphological affinities among the series, while Mantel and Dow-Cheverud tests based on Mahalanobis Squared Distances were used to test different evolutionary scenarios. Our results show strong morphological affinities among the early series irrespective of geographical origin, which together with the matrix analyses results favor the scenario of a late morphological differentiation of modern humans. We conclude that the geographic differentiation of modern human morphology is a late phenomenon that occurred after the initial settlement of the Americas.",The authors are grateful to André Strauss for allowing the usage of his VB code and to Phillip Gunz for helping with the transformation of the 3D landmarks into linear measurements.

Mating systems theory predicts that monogamy is advantageous in environments where refuges are discrete, scarce, relatively small, and when predation risk is high outside of these refuges. These predictions were tested with the Caribbean shrimp Lysmata pederseni, a simultaneous hermaphrodite which has an early male phase and lives inside tubes of the sponge Callyspongia vaginalis. This host sponge is a scarce resource that, together with the high predation risk typical of tropical environments, should favor monogamy in the shrimp. Field observations demonstrated that shrimps were frequently encountered as pairs within these tube sponges. Pairs were equally likely to comprise two hermaphrodites or one hermaphrodite and one male. Several of these pairs were observed for long periods of time in the field. Experiments demonstrated that hermaphrodites tolerated other hermaphrodites but not males in their host sponge. These results suggest that pairs of hermaphroditic L. pederseni are socially monogamous; they share the same host individual and might reproduce exclusively with their host partners for long periods of time. Nevertheless, males appeared less likely to establish long-term associations with hermaphrodites as indicated by the rate of their disappearance from their hosts (greater than that of hermaphrodites). Sex allocation was female biased in monogamous hermaphrodites. On average, hermaphrodites invested 34 times more to female than to male reproductive structures. Monogamy and female-biased sex allocation seem to be evolutionary consequences of adopting a symbiotic lifestyle in simultaneous hermaphrodites.","Many thanks to Sherry Reed and Carla Piantoni for their great help during sampling and to Mike Carpenter for his patience with the scheduling of trips to Carrie Bow, Belize.

However, the genes that influence this response are largely unknown. Non-HDL (V+LDL) cholesterol levels vary dramatically among gray, short-tailed opossums fed an atherogenic diet, and we previously reported that two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influenced V+LDL cholesterol on two diets. We used hypothesis-free, genome-wide linkage analyses on data from 325 pedigreed opossums and located one QTL for V+LDL cholesterol on the basal diet on opossum chromosome 1q [logarithm of the odds (LOD) = 3.11, genomic P = 0.019] and another QTL for V+LDL on the atherogenic diet (i.e., high levels of cholesterol and fat) on chromosome 8 (LOD = 9.88, genomic P = 5 x 10(-9)). We then employed a novel strategy involving combined analyses of genomic resources, expression analysis, sequencing, and genotyping to identify candidate genes for the chromosome 8 QTL. A polymorphism in ABCB4 was strongly associated (P = 9 x 10(-14)) with the plasma V+LDL cholesterol concentrations on the high-cholesterol, high-fat diet. The results of this study indicate that genetic variation in ABCB4, or closely linked genes, is responsible for the dramatic differences among opossums in their V+LDL cholesterol response to an atherogenic diet.","The authors thank Susan Mahaney and Kevin Dehoff for assistance with DNA extraction procedures, Jane F.

855,pub.1031296569,10.1242/jeb.038463,20190124,,Organismal climatology: analyzing environmental variability at scales relevant to physiological stress,"Predicting when, where and with what magnitude climate change is likely to affect the fitness, abundance and distribution of organisms and the functioning of ecosystems has emerged as a high priority for scientists and resource managers. However, even in cases where we have detailed knowledge of current species' range boundaries, we often do not understand what, if any, aspects of weather and climate act to set these limits. This shortcoming significantly curtails our capacity to predict potential future range shifts in response to climate change, especially since the factors that set range boundaries under those novel conditions may be different from those that set limits today. We quantitatively examine a nine-year time series of temperature records relevant to the body temperatures of intertidal mussels as measured using biomimetic sensors. Specifically, we explore how a 'climatology' of body temperatures, as opposed to long-term records of habitat-level parameters such as air and water temperatures, can be used to extrapolate meaningful spatial and temporal patterns of physiological stress. Using different metrics that correspond to various aspects of physiological stress (seasonal means, cumulative temperature and the return time of extremes) we show that these potential environmental stressors do not always occur in synchrony with one another. Our analysis also shows that patterns of animal temperature are not well correlated with simple, commonly used metrics such as air temperature. Detailed physiological studies can provide guidance to predicting the effects of global climate change on natural ecosystems but only if we concomitantly record, archive and model environmental signals at appropriate scales.","References We wish to thank all of the people who helped with instrument deployment at Hopkins Marine Station and at Boiler Bay, in particular Chris Harley, Michael O&#x27;Donnell, Lauren Szathmary, Laura Petes and the PISCO-OSU crew.

Based on national surveys, current use of cannabis ranged among adolescents from 2% to 9% and among adults it was 2%, cocaine/crack (0.3%), mandrax/sedatives (0.3%), club drugs/amphetamine-type stimulants (0.2%), opiates (0.1%), and hallucinogens (0.1%). The use of primary illicit substance at admission to South African drug user treatment centers was cannabis 16.9%, methamphetamine (tik) 12.8%, crack/cocaine 9.6%, cannabis and mandrax 3.4%, heroin/opiates 9.2%, and prescription and OTC drugs 2.6%. An increase in substance user treatment admissions has increased.

These countries can look to successes and missteps on other continents to help choose their own individual paths to ensuring reliable and clean supplies of ground water. In the large view, sub-Saharan Africa can define specific levels of acceptable risk in water quality that drive cleanup efforts and are amenable to acceptance across national and geographic boundaries. Ground water quality databases must be expanded, and data must be available in an electronic form that is flexible, expandable, and uniform, and that can be used over wide geographic areas. Guidance from other continents is available on well construction, sampling and monitoring, interim remediation, technical impracticability, monitored natural attenuation, and many specific issues such as how to deal with small waste generators and septic contamination of water supply wells. It is important to establish a common African view on the appropriateness of other nations' ground water quality guidance for African issues, economic conditions, and community circumstances. Establishing numerical, concentration-based, water quality action levels for pollutants in ground water, which many neighboring African nations could hold comparable, would set the stage for risk-based remediation of contaminated sites. Efforts to gain public, grass-roots understanding and support for stable and balanced enforcement of standards are also key. Finally, effective capacity building in the region could be an eventual solution to ground water quality problems; with increased numbers of trained environmental professionals, ground water throughout the region can be protected and contaminated sites cleaned up.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the thoughtful comments of Jennifer A.

To gain further insight into these changes in the cerebral cortex, rats were treated with fluoxetine (flx) for 4 weeks. These animals showed decreased anxiety and learned helplessness. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit levels (NR1, NR2A, NR2B, GluR1 and GluR2) were analysed in the forebrain by both western blot of homogenates and immunohistochemistry. Both methods demonstrated an upregulation of NR2A, GluR1 and GluR2 that was especially significant in the retrosplenial granular b cortex (RSGb). However, when analysing subunit content in postsynaptic densities and synaptic membranes, we found increases of NR2A and GluR2 but not GluR1. Instead, GluR1 was augmented in a microsomal fraction containing intracellular membranes. NR1 and GluR2 were co-immunoprecipitated from postsynaptic densities and synaptic membranes. In the immunoprecipitates, NR2A was increased while GluR1 was decreased supporting a change in receptor stoichiometry. The changes of subunit levels were associated with an upregulation of dendritic spine density and of large, mushroom-type spines. These molecular and structural adaptations might be involved in neuronal network stabilization following long-term flx treatment.",This work was supported by Proyecto Anillo ACT09-06 (U Wyneken).

As a unit of work, the gang was the result of the labour tradition of the region, the pressure from the authorities and employers, and the workers’ own efforts to regulate the supply, recruitment and organization of work. When freight transport grew and stabilized, the relations between workers and firms were mediated by the contractor, who came from the core of the gangs. By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, the workers demanded the abolition of the contractor for a direct relationship with the companies. This relationship was reached by the end of the 1920s, but it was now mediated by mutual organizations and unions converted into labour providers using the system for gangs.  Resumen:En este artículo estudio los trabajadores cargueros o braceros de los puertos del Caribe colombiano, con énfasis en la cuadrilla como forma de organización laboral para la movilización de la carga.

In this difficult moments the adolescents are under a lot of pressure, which, in turn, it is manifested in loneliness, a life without a cause and a growth of oneself which is not supported by any members of an adolescent's surrounding (parents, friends). A wish of loneliness and helplessness might be created within oneself. In this particular period of life, the means of communication strive to take a special place.

The hypotheses that guided the study were: elements of the Brazilian culture are present in the local culture represented by the boi-bumbá context; the native Amazonian culture gives signification to the elements that allow the construction of the bois-bumbás; the boi-bumbá is becoming a merchandise submitted to the capital's demands. The analytical framework was based mostly in the concepts of SLD, capitalist production system and culture. The investigation adopted a quantitative method.

The influence of the vegetation cover on the shallow geothermal system was observed in the sites studied. There were variations of monthly average values of temperature between the places with and without vegetation cover. During the ""dry"" period, this variation was up to 6.01ºC at the depth of 0.02 m, and 2.84ºC at the depth of 1.0 m. During the ""rainy"" period, however, the variation was up to 2.94ºC, at the depth of 0.02 m, and 2.51ºC at the depth of 1.0 m. The difference of the daily extreme values of temperature between sites with and without vegetation cover were 3.97ºC during the ""rainy"" period and 9.63ºC during the ""dry"" period, at the depth of 0.02 m. It was noticed that at 06:00 PM the magnitude of the temperature remained high compared to other times on the day studied. The values of the thermal conductivity were 0.54 W/mºC during the ""dry"" period, and 1.23 W/mºC during the ""rainy"" period. The values of the shallow geothermal flows at depths of 0.5 m and 1.0 m, were 2.51 W/m² and 0.64 W/m², respectively. These values are 10³ larger than the terrestrial heat flow in the region. The thermal variations at0.5 m to 1.0 m depth are influenced by external sources that reach the surface and cannot be neglected. The thermal variations recorded in this work are important and fundamental to better understanding the shallow geothermal structure in the southern, part of Amazonas state, and they also contribute as input to models that allow the mitigation or elimination of the effects caused by anthropogenic actions.",,,Brazilian Journal of Geophysics,,,,2010-12,2010,2010-12,,28,4,563-578,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pimentel, Elizabeth Tavares; de Araujo, Rutenio Luiz Castro; Monteiro, Ierecê Barbosa; da Silva, Roberto Matias","Pimentel, Elizabeth Tavares (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, IEAA, Brasil, bethfisica@on.br); de Araujo, Rutenio Luiz Castro (Manaus, Amazonas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Brazil, ruie@ufam.edu.br); Monteiro, Ierecê Barbosa (Manaus, Amazonas, Universidade do Estado do Amazonas, Brazil); da Silva, Roberto Matias (Rio Branco, AC, Fundação de Tecnologia do Estado do Acre, Brasil)",,"Pimentel, Elizabeth Tavares (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, IEAA, Brasil, bethfisica@on.br); de Araujo, Rutenio Luiz Castro (Federal University of Amazonas); Monteiro, Ierecê Barbosa (University of the State of Amazonas); da Silva, Roberto Matias (Fundação de Tecnologia do Estado do Acre)",2,0,,0.16,https://www.scielo.br/j/rbg/a/ZK6k3Bv3X4HFgV6JHv9MCpz/?lang=pt&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021319616,37 Earth Sciences; 3706 Geophysics,

No entanto, as mudanças recentes produzidas pelos processos de desterritorialização e reterritorialização nas sociedades complexas impõem novos tipos de atores, conflitos e mediações, sendo as redes uma forma social exemplar dessas mudanças. Mas as redes não se impõem automaticamente como um novo marco interpretativo. É importante explicar que elas são objeto de embate no campo intelectual e que podem conhecer leituras diversas, tanto utilitaristas como antiutilitaristas. PALAVRAS-CHAVE: redes sociais, movimentos sociais, utilitarismo, teoria sociológica. SOCIAL NETWORKS AS NEW INTERPRETATIVE MARKERS OF CONTEMPORARY COLLECTIVE MOBILIZATIONS Paulo Henrique Martins The direction of social movements and social and cultural mobilizations in contemporaneity point out the weakening of the old theoretical positivist markers who subordinated the constitution of identity practices to certain reductionist criteria, such as economic utilitarianism and progress ideology. However, recent changes produced by the processes of disterritorialization and reterritorialization in complex societies require new types of actors, conflicts and mediation, and networks are an examplary social form of such changes. But the networks are not automatically imposed as a new interpretative marker. It is important to explain that they are the object of struggle in the intellectual field and can meet various readings, both utilitarian and anti-utilitarian.

Toutefois, les récents changements dus au processus de déterritorialisation et de reterritorialisation dans les sociétés complexes imposent de nouveaux types d’acteurs, de conflits et de médiations, les réseaux constituant un exemple social de ces changements.

762,pub.1039063616,10.7183/1045-6635.21.4.399,,,Inka Sacrifice and the Mummy of Salinas Grandes,"Abstract  In the last 25 years, materials from some human sacrifices that the Inkas carried out on high mountains (e.g., Aconcagua and Llullaillaco) have been thoroughly analyzed and adequately interpreted. Remains from immolations that took place in other contexts, however, which tend to be poorly preserved and incompletely studied, are not as well understood. In this article, I begin to remedy this imbalance in our knowledge by discussing the sacrifice from Salinas Grandes, which is a salt flat situated in northwestern Argentina. I describe the body of the victim—who was very likely a qhapaq hucha , a specially chosen child—and his clothing, accouterments, and hairstyle. I offer hypotheses on where he came from and on the reasons behind his ritual dispatch. I demonstrate how the different items that were buried with him all contributed to the meaning of his immolation. I also show how the lords of Cuzco may have employed the sacrifice to tie the region where the salt flat is located to the empire. 
 En los últimos veinticinco años diversos materiales procedentes de algunos sacrificios humanos que los incas llevaron a cabo en las altas montañas (por ejemplo, Aconcagua y Llullaillaco) han sido rigurosamente estudiados y adecuadamente interpretados. Sin embargo, los restos de inmolaciones que tuvieron lugar en otros contextos, que tienden a estar pobremente preservados y a haber sido estudiados de manera incompleta, no son tan bien comprendidos. En este artículo comienzo a reparar este desequilibrio en nuestro conocimiento a través de discutir el sacrificio de Salinas Grandes, un salar situado en el noroeste de Argentina. Para ello describo el cuerpo de la víctima—probablemente un qhapaq hucha , o niño elegido especialmente—y sus vestiduras, ajuar, y peinado. Propongo varias hipótesis acerca de su procedencia y acerca de las razones detrás de su sacrificio ritual. Demuestro cómo los diferentes elementos que fueron enterrados junto a él contribuyeron a dar sentido a su inmolación y también muestro cómo los señores del Cuzco podrían haber empleado este sacrificio para vincular a su imperio la región en que se localiza el salar.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2010-12,2010,2017-01-20,2010-12,21,4,399-422,Closed,Article,"Besom, Thomas","Besom, Thomas (Department of Anthropology, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY 13902)",,"Besom, Thomas (Binghamton University)",8,0,,2.42,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039063616,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",

Apparently, this economic surplus based on foodstuffs was later distributed to nearby and far-away populations (e.g. in the altiplano). In addition, although Camata Tambo was in a ‘marginal’ locale of the empire, the site had important political economic functions in the area such as providing valley products to the emerging and more powerful altiplano elites. Further, data collected from excavations conducted at Camata Pueblo, a local community adjacent to the tambo (less than 100 meters), indicate that this community was greatly transformed by the close interactions with imperial infrastructure and bureaucracy that developed through Camata Tambo. The data presented indicate that waystations were institutions that not only provided food and lodging to imperial travelers, but which also had important political economic and administrative imperial roles. Finally, excavations suggest that the operation of these Inca institutions in marginal zones was more ambiguous and ‘open’ than in regions more directly controlled by the empire.",,,Arqueología y Sociedad,,,,2010-07-15,2010,2010-07-15,,,21,145-170,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Cortez, Sofía Chacaltana","Cortez, Sofía Chacaltana (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú.

Analysis of the contents published by Chilean anthropologists during that period allowed for the ability to distinguish and compare their paradigms and audiences, their areas of thematic interest, and their methodological and theoretical frameworks. Results show a large thematic dispersion, major paradigmatic inconsistencies and weaknesses in theoretical and methodological designs, without clear tendencies towards the creation of an applied anthropology or outlining a proximate configuration of otherness.

This paper presents the simulation of discreet events as a tool for the planning and the analysis of construction projects based on a case study of the constructive process of a reinforced con-crete structure that includes the foundation, pedestals, beams, a slab and columns. Initially a field work was carried out to register duration, resources and delays for each activity. Based on this information a simulation model in the software Arena was developed. The sequence of the activities, probability distribution functions defined for the processes and the resources used were included for each activity. The model works through an interface with Microsoft Excel and macros developed in Visual BASIC, through which the user can easily introduce the input data. The simulation controls the duration of activities, use of resources and consumption of materials. This integration of tools allows simulating different project scenarios permitting to analyze improvement opportunities assigning different attributes to the variables that affect the project such as activities begin date, availability of resources and materials, among others.",,,Revista Ingeniería de Construcción,,,,2010-04,2010,2010-04,,25,1,121-141,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabrera, Adriana Gmez","Cabrera, Adriana Gmez (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, COLOMBIA)",,"Cabrera, Adriana Gmez (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",3,1,,0.78,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/ric/v25n1/art06.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045552211,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Knowledge transfer goes beyond transfer between enterprises, involves appropriating and adapting to organizational environment and characteristics, using resources of its own resources and form strategic allied. Beyond a simple organizational benchmarking, knowledge transfer will strengthen existing knowledge and generate new knowledge within organization partnerships, complementing learning in organizations. This paper presents a guide to transfer knowledge between private education institutions and its application to transfer a teaching programming methodology, the CUPI2 project, between Universidad de los Andes –UNIANDES and Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios –UNIMINUTO, both located in Bogota, Colombia.

Murra -un modelo dinmico de las cambiantes relaciones histricas entre las sociedades andinas, las ecologas complementarias que habitan y las formaciones ""estatales"" emergentes- con las teoras transformacionalistas desarrolladas para los pueblos del Amazonas. Basado en trabajo etnogrfico realizado con un ""archipilago"" de larga duracin en los valles del Ayllu Macha (Norte de Potos, Bolivia), este texto muestra la experiencia conflictiva de algunas ""islas"" vallunas, que deben invertir su pertenencia de parcialidad (""mitad"", o saya) para poder persistir entre los grupos mayores que dominan su vecindad. La confusin entre los niveles de segmentacin y la formacin de las ""islas"" exigen otros patrones de alianza de las que se dan en la puna (tierras altas), a la vez que ambas regiones comparten un mismo horizonte de ideas con respecto a la violencia. La guerra andina se caracteriza por la misma ""inestabilidad ontolgica"" en la frontera borrosa entre animales y seres humanos que ha sido encontrada en otros grupos amerindios, como tambin en otras partes del mundo. Se muestra que los diversos tipos de transformacin y la reformulacin de las fronteras entre animales y humanos deben ser relacionados con diferentes contextos sociales e histricos. The article relates John Murra's theory of the ""vertical archipelago"" -a dynamic model of the changing historical relations between Andean societies, the complementary ecologies they inhabit, and emergent ""State""-formations to transformationalist theories developed particularly among Amazonian peoples. Drawing on field-work with a longlived ""archipelago"" in the valleys of the Macha Ayllu (Northern Potos, Bolivia), the author shows the conflictive experience of valley ""islands"", which must invert their moiety (saya) affiliations to survive pressures from the larger groups in which they are implanted. The confusion of levels of segmentation and the ""island"" formation produces different valley alliances from those sought on the puna, while presupposing a shared horizon of ideas concerning violence. Andean warfare is characterized by the same ontological instability "" at the blurred frontier between humans and animals that is found among other Amerindian groups, and elsewhere in the world. Different kinds of shapeshifting during fiestas and warfare, and the reformulation of animal-human frontiers, are seen to be related to different social and historical contexts.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2010-06,2010,2010-06,,42,1,297-324,All OA; Gold,Article,"Platt, Tristan","Platt, Tristan (University of St. Andrews School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies, St. Andrews, Scotland)",,"Platt, Tristan (University of St Andrews)",15,3,,6.67,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v42n1/art37.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002660541,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

This general policy was confirmed in SASO's response to white student protests in 1968 and 1970, as well as in a series of discussion documents and General Council resolutions proposed in 1970 and 1971. This policy was, however, challenged by the events that took place at the University of the North following the expulsion of Onkgopotse Tiro in 1972. A wave of seemingly spontaneous student protest forced SASO's leaders to reconsider their apparent suspicion of public, confrontational forms of protest and reluctantly to accept the necessity of committing the organisation to such protests. I argue that this reluctant embrace was the product of contingent circumstances and pressures from below, rather than the result of an ideological or theoretical shift on the part of SASO leadership. This in turn suggests an alternate approach to the history of SASO, an approach that focuses less on a process of ideological development and more on the contingent details of its institutional history.",,,South African Historical Journal,,,,2010-12,2010,,2010-12,62,4,716-734,Closed,Article,"Brown, Julian","Brown, Julian (University of the Witwatersrand)","Brown, Julian (University of the Witwatersrand)","Brown, Julian (University of the Witwatersrand)",4,0,,5.15,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007196831,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

In 121 stomachs of A. nigra and 312 of B. canescens preys were found. Individuals were collected as by-catch from the deep-sea crustacean fishery, between 2520'S and 3543'S; from January 1997 to July 2000 off the northern-central Chilean coast. The most important prey by index of relative importance and by frequency of occurrence in A. nigra was the benthic deep-sea shrimp Heterocarpus reedi; while by number the euphausiid Euphausia mucronata and by weight the common hake Merluccius gayi were the most important. The deep-sea shrimp H. reedi was also the most important prey of B. canescens, for all feeding indices used. Significant differences were found in the habitat where these predators consume their prey, A. nigra eating more on pelagic prey; whereas B. canescens feeds more on benthic prey. A. nigra showed a higher trophic niche breadth, because they predate more on benthic, pelagic and mesopelagic resources; whereas B. canescens feeds primarily on benthic prey.

However, early ontogenetic stages are more likely to be affected by physical processes associated with ENSO (e.g. increased temperature, upwelling), potentially reflected in differences in recruitment intensity. We evaluated recruitment and abundance of juveniles and adults of the major benthic community-structuring groups (kelps, sea urchins, sea stars, crabs and rockfish) during a period affected by La Niña followed by a period of neutral conditions. Recruitment was several times higher during neutral conditions for sea urchins and sea stars. Lower recruitment during La Niña was probably caused by offshore larval transport caused by increased upwelling. Recruitment of crabs tended to be higher during neutral conditions, but this varied among sites. In contrast to invertebrates, kelp abundance seemed to be controlled by post-settlement processes, as reflected by fewer kelp juveniles after La Niña when the abundance of herbivore fishes strongly increased. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the effects of ENSO at early ontogenetic stages rather than on adult populations, which are less likely to be affected in an upwelling-dominated system.","We are grateful to J.

426,pub.1026099497,10.1016/j.jembe.2010.08.019,,,Does primary colonization or community structure determine the succession of fouling communities?,"Predicting the relevance of initial colonization and subsequent species interactions for succession in marine sessile communities is difficult because the effects of both factors depend on highly variable environmental processes (e.g. currents, topography, upwelling and others). Depending on the successional stage at which a new species arrives, it can either rapidly colonize in large numbers or its colonization success might be suppressed by resident species. In order to assess the roles of (i) initial colonization and (ii) subsequent species interactions on community development, we examined the succession of fouling assemblages that established on artificial substrata during two different seasonal periods, i.e. austral winter/spring and spring/summer. At 16weeks of age communities that were initiated in different seasons varied significantly in composition and diversity. During each period (winter/spring and spring/summer), multispecies fouling consortia of different ages (hereafter termed “old” and “young”) were reciprocally transplanted between two neighbouring study sites and their succession was documented. After 8weeks of transplantation communities of different ages maintained their differences in diversity even in the face of environmental change. However, during winter/spring the spreading of the dominant species P. chilensis caused more rapid convergence between all communities at both sites. During the spring/summer period, the high initial abundances of the weak competitor Bugula neritina led to the maintenance of differences between resident and transplanted assemblages within each site. Later colonizers, including the dominant competitor P. chilensis, however, could recruit onto B. neritina and started to spread in the communities. These results suggest that the early and intermediate succession of fouling communities in highly productive marine environments such as the Humboldt Current System is driven by the temporal and spatial variability of propagule supply, while the long-term stability of these communities depends on the identity of colonizers and their competitiveness.","We wish to thank P.

The aim of the project is to decrease the stigma around HIV/AIDS and to start an open dialogue in local communities about the disease.   Design/methodology/approach This is an exploratory study using a qualitative approach, which was carried out in 2005/2006, that focused on perceptions of participants from the audience of the project and health practitioners.   Findings The research findings emphasize the importance of involvement of a storyteller who can play an influential role in local rural communities by breaking the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS and providing people with little or no education with simple but effective messages about the disease. Stories are embedded in local traditions and make use of metaphors, like dialogues between animals. Beside, stories are a form of “edutainment”: education enriched with entertainment.   Research limitations/implications Owing to budgetary and time constraints insight into the impact of the project on the way the members of the audience protect themselves and deal with the essential issues of sexuality and relationships in their daily life as a result of storytelling was not gained.   Originality/value Owing to its personal approach a project around storytelling in rural areas in South Africa is vital, because it seems to suit the local context better than nationwide health educational programmes which are normally disseminated through mass education.",,,Health Education,,,,2010-08-31,2010,,2010-08-31,110,5,382-398,Closed,Article,"Zeelen, Jacques; Wijbenga, Hieke; Vintges, Marga; de Jong, Gideon","Zeelen, Jacques (Department of Lifelong Learning, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands); Wijbenga, Hieke (Department of Lifelong Learning, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands); Vintges, Marga (PHRU/ ANOVA Health Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa); de Jong, Gideon (Department of Lifelong Learning, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands)",,"Zeelen, Jacques (University of Groningen); Wijbenga, Hieke (University of Groningen); Vintges, Marga (Anova Health Institute); de Jong, Gideon (University of Groningen)",23,3,,3.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001855956,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

It begins by outlining the types of responses to the need to provide second chance programmes in science in different countries throughout the world, in particular the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and southern Africa. Reference is also made to Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the rest of Europe. The result of a survey of 95 programmes in southern Africa and developed countries is then provided. The surveyed programmes are characterised by a model adapted from Osborne (2003, European Journal of Education, 38, 5–24) which classifies programmes as inreach, outreach and flexible with academic, internal and cultural dimensions. Half the programmes in developed countries could be classified as outreach, with the vast majority being predominantly academic in nature. On the other hand, the South African programmes were predominantly inreach (in house) and could be classified as academic. The chapter ends with three case studies of access programmes from South Africa, United States and Scotland.",,,,Identifying Potential for Equitable Access to Tertiary Level Science,,,2010-06-09,2010,2010-06-09,2010,,,39-65,Closed,Chapter,"Rollnick, Marissa","Rollnick, Marissa (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa)","Rollnick, Marissa (University of the Witwatersrand)","Rollnick, Marissa (University of the Witwatersrand)",1,0,,0.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039533086,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,

Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a descriptive research design based on survey. Relevant documents, including gift and donation files, acquisition records and library accession registers, were examined and analysed to provide answers to questions relating to study objectives.   Findings The usefulness of gifts to university library resource development is underscored by the quality and currency of the 2,462 volumes of materials received during the study period. Furthermore, the impact that collaborative donor efforts could make towards supporting university library resource development in the information age is highlighted. Associated problems included deficiency in subject coverage, foreign language materials, irregular giving patterns as well as an increasing tendency towards electronic resources acquisition where manual procedures are available.   Practical implications Acquisition librarians should intensify efforts at soliciting for and directing corporate giving endeavours towards providing for infrastructural support required for university library development in Nigeria. The deficiency in subject coverage highlighted in the study can be addressed if donor agencies are encouraged to adopt relevant library profiles or assign grants to core areas of university academic programs. There is also need for the inclusion or revision of gift statements in collection development policies.

Through a “modified deposition–precipitation” (mDP) method, whereby ethylenediamine served as both a base and complexing agent for the Au(III) species, Au nanoparticles have been prepared exclusively inside the pore channels of Si-MCM-41 materials. The method exploits Coulombic interactions between the occluded cationic surfactant template and the anionic [AuCl4]− to yield a controlled distribution and in-pore generation of AuNPs, i.e., DP of the Au precursor was aided by electrostatics. This method is simple and yields well-dispersed gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The nanoparticles inside the matrix were seen to aggregate and migrate to the surface upon calcination at 500 °C, but showed a narrow Au particle size distribution. The nanocomposite materials synthesized in this study exhibited catalytic activity for the CO oxidation reaction, with CO conversion of <100% even at temperatures as high as 500 °C.

Questions on demographics of practitioners, equipment, clinical practice andbusiness profile were included in the questionnaire. Also, issues that have the potential to impact on optometric practices were contained in the questionnaire and these include medical aid, advertising, continuous professional development (CPD) and emigration. Of the 117 completed questionnaires, 55% were from females and 45% were from male practitioners. The respondents included 55% Indians, 27% Whites, 17% Blacks and 1% Coloureds. The majority of practices were located in urban areas (90%) and rural areas (10%), and were mostly independent (67%) and franchises (33%). Only a minority of the practices had major diagnostic equipment such as visual field analysers (33%) and corneal topographers (7%). A significant proportion of the practitioners reported not routinely performing non-contact tonometry (45%) and slit lamp examination (41%) respectively. The majority (95%) rated patient’s needs as a very important factor in their decision to prescribe an optical device. A significant proportion (38%) of the practices had annual patient bases of above 33 000, with 35% having an average of 51-100 new patients per month. A few (5%) practices reported gross monthly turnovers of above R400 000, and 27% reported turnovers of less than R60 000. Many (89%) derived 41% and above of their total revenue from spectacle lens sales and 11% derived 41% and above from contact lens sales. The majority (92%) of practices were contracted to over 60% of the medical aid schemes. Many (68%) reported that they were not negatively affected by medical aid fraud committed by their colleagues, however, a significant proportion (32%) reported the converse.

The sexual system of the semi‐terrestrial shrimp Merguia rhizophorae is described, along with natural history observations on this unusual caridean. Individuals of M. rhizophorae in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama, were found occupying fossilized coral terraces in the upper and mid‐intertidal zones, inhabiting caves and crevices, in and out of water. These fossilized coral terraces represent a new habitat for this species, which was previously reported only from mangrove swamps. Males, which made up 65% of the studied population, were smaller than females on average. No small juvenile females were observed, but transitional individuals having the characteristics of both males (gonopores) and females (ovaries) were observed in the population. These data suggest that individuals of M. rhizophorae are protandric hermaphrodites. Logistic regression indicated that the carapace length at which 50% of the individuals change sex is 4.89 mm. The abundance of shrimps at the study site was low. Shrimps were usually solitary, but occasionally observed in groups of ≤5 individuals. Shrimps were commonly observed walking while out of water, and in some cases, emerged shrimps jumped vigorously, presumably to avoid capture by the researcher or by predatory crabs. Additional studies on the reproductive biology and the behavioral ecology of members of this genus and of members of the closely related families Barbouridae and Lysmatidae will aid in understanding the evolutionary origin and the adaptive value of gender expression patterns in shrimps.","Acknowledgments.

Particular attention is given to the trends and the challenges faced by academic psycho-biographers in South Africa. Over the past decade psychobiography has evolved into an established research genre and has become a methodology used by various academics and post-graduate research scholars at South African universities. Psychobiography entails the study of historically significant and extraordinary individuals over their entire life spans with the aim to uncover and reconstruct their lives psychologically. These longitudinal case studies include the psychological study of personalities in diverse occupational fields such as architecture, arts and literature, business and entrepreneur-ship, politics, religion and spirituality, sport, science, as well as the popular biographies of celebrities. Psycho-biographical studies in South Africa have been nurtured in the departments of psychology at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Rhodes University, the University of Johannesburg, and the University of the Free State. Most of these biographical studies have been completed as postgraduate r research endeavours in master's and doctoral degree programmes in psychology where academic staff have initiated and grown psychobiography as a strategic research focus area within their faculties. Psycho-biographical research has considerable logistical and administrative value for postgraduate research and the supervision process, and is also of academic benefit to the theoretical development of South African psychology. In South Africa an array of exemplary personalities constitute a ‘hall of fame’. Their legendary lives are ideal case studies which may be used to develop and/or refute aspects of psychological theory and its applicability to human development over the span of an individual's life.",,,South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2010-12-01,2010,2010-12-01,2010-12,40,4,495-507,Closed,Article,"Fouché, Paul; van Niekerk, Roelf","Fouché, Paul (Department of Psychology, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa); van Niekerk, Roelf (Department of Psychology, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein)","Fouché, Paul (University of the Free State); van Niekerk, Roelf (University of the Free State)","Fouché, Paul (University of the Free State); van Niekerk, Roelf (University of the Free State)",68,17,,8.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052570435,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

In Goiabeiras, a district of the state capital Vitória, the traditional production of these pans is the source of income for many families. The technique used in these ceramic pans is of indigenous origin, characterized by manual molding, outdoor burning and application of tannin dye. The clay pans are distributed to several Brazilian states and are nowadays conquering the external market. For producing these pans, two types of, yellow and gray, clays are used. The actual source of raw material comes from the deposit of the Mulembá valley, where a concern on the possibility of exhaustion exists. The objective of this study was then to characterize these two types of clays and so contribute to the continuity of traditional clay pan production by knowing the characteristics of the local clays in case of an eventual need for their replacement. Chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, plasticity and thermal analysis of the clays were performed.

The continuum threshold s0, as in other hadronic channels, decreases with increasing temperature until the PQCD threshold s0=4mQ2 is reached at T≃1.22Tc (mQ is the charm quark mass) and the J/ψ mass is essentially constant in a wide range of temperatures. The other hadronic parameters behave in a very different way from those of light-light and heavy-light quark systems. The total width grows with temperature up to T≃1.04Tc beyond which it decreases sharply with increasing T. The resonance coupling is also initially constant beginning to increase monotonically around T≃Tc. This behavior strongly suggests that the J/ψ resonance might survive beyond the critical temperature for deconfinement, in agreement with lattice QCD results.",,,Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings,,,,2010-10,2010,,2010-10,207,,273-276,All OA; Green,Article,"Dominguez, C.A.; Loewe, M.; Rojas, J.C.; Zhang, Y.","Dominguez, C.A.

An idiom or a proverb possesses one basic meaning, i.e. the meaning to which the idiom or proverb is basically meant to refer, but each idiom or proverb is made up of several lexical items. Each of these lexical items has its own meaning, which usually differs from the figurative sense of the idiom or proverb. Even though the meaning of the words in an idiomatic or proverbial expression seems to differ from the sense of the idiom or proverb, there is to a certain extent a relationship. It is this relationship which lexicographers can assist to explain in their definitions in order to clarify both the literal and the figurative meanings of words in Sesotho sa Leboa. This article aims to stress the importance of having specialized dictionaries which will give users detailed etymological explanations of the meaning of idiomatic and proverbial expressions as used in Sesotho sa Leboa.

Analysis of development is restricted to spheres described by available indicators used by several international and non-governmental organizations such as income distribution, education, health, poverty, human development and security, satisfaction, cost of living, income per capita, GDP per capita, employment, productive activity, added value and its distribution. Correlation between some of these variables is estimated as well as the gap between these indicators and those of developed countries.The region has advanced towards development since the 1990s, especially on what concerns economic indicators such as income per capita and income distribution where it ranks ahead from the rest of Chile and close to some developed countries. However, it is still far behind in some of the key social indicators such as quality of education and health, access to health services, life expectancy and large differences in the quality of life within the region.The hypothesis proposed in this paper is that the coexistence of high income levels and inequalities in the region is not a result of insufficient resources but of a lack of commitment to development by the main regional stakeholders.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by the Program of Mineral Economics of the Mining Center of Catholic University of Chile which receives funding from several government agencies, from Codelco, Minera Escondida, Anglo American and Freeport McMoran.

316,pub.1034688633,10.4314/lex.v11i1.51301,,,The compilation of bilingual dictionaries between African languages in south Africa: the case of northern Sotho and Tshivenda,"Bilingual dictionaries between South African languages have existed for more than three centuries (Smit 1996: 232). These dictionaries have English or Afrikaans as the source language and an African language as the target language. There has never been a case of the opposite except for bi-directional bilingual dictionaries. Still more, there seems to be no record of an attempt ever made to date to compile bilingual dictionaries between African languages. This scenario illustrates the trend and history of lexicographic practice in South Africa. It isevident from most lexicographic research and products such as the existing kinds of dictionaries that Africans were never considered to be the first target group of users or prospective beneficiaries of such lexicographic products. The absence of bilingual dictionaries between African languages again provides evidence of who the lexicographers were and which population groups they represented. To fill this void, a model called the hub-and-spoke is proposed in this paper for the compilation of such kind of dictionaries. The model has been chosen for its purported economy of use. Northern Sotho and Tshivenda are the African languages that will be used as examples in the application of the model. A purposive sampling technique will be used to select lexemes that will constitute the entry words which form the central list of the proposed dictionary.

However, by means of a unitary-reduction process, it could be modified. Here we study in detail the problem of mapping two known pure states onto two other states in such a way that the overlap between the outcome states is different from the one of the initial states. We show that the modulus of the overlap can be reduced only probabilistically, whereas it can be increased deterministically.

We used a 640-basepair region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (Cox1) from the amphidromous river shrimp Cryphiops caementarius from five rivers in northern-central Chile to test whether large distances between estuaries (up to 700 km) limit gene flow between populations and result in genetic differentiation among populations. The results revealed high haplotype diversity with no significant geographical structuring, suggesting that gene flow occurs regularly over several hundreds of kilometres, also connecting populations north and south of the Atacama Desert. Seemingly, the terrestrial barrier is overcome by planktonic larval dispersal through the sea, suggesting wide dispersal rather than “stepping-stone” dispersal between estuaries. The population from the southern limit of the geographic distribution of C. caementarius (Río Limari) revealed some weak differentiation in pairwise WST comparisons, but larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm this. Additional studies are needed for a better understanding of factors that promote different life histories, like marine planktonic dispersal, larval retention in estuaries, or an amphidromous-freshwater transition towards a purely freshwater life cycle.",,,Journal of Crustacean Biology,,,,2010-11-01,2010,2016-11-09,2010-11-01,30,4,762-766,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Dennenmoser, Stefan; Schubart, Christoph D.; Thiel, Martin","Dennenmoser, Stefan (SD) Biologie I, Universität Regensburg, 93040 Regensburg, Germany; SD) Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, Canada); Schubart, Christoph D.

We report on evidence of the inhomogeneity (multiplicity) of the stellar population in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) NGC 3201, which is irregularly reddened across its face. Methods. We carried out a more detailed and careful analysis of our recently published new multi-color photometry in a wide field of the cluster with particular emphasis on the U band. Results. Using the photometric data corrected for differential reddening, we found for the first time two key signs of the inhomogeneity in the cluster's stellar population and of its radial variation in the GC. These are (1) an obvious trend in the color-position diagram, based on the (U-B) color-index, of red giant branch (RGB) stars, which shows that the farther from the cluster's center, the bluer on average the (U-B) color of the stars is; and (2) the dependence of the radial distribution of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in the cluster on their U magnitude, where brighter stars are less centrally concentrated than their fainter counterparts at a confidence level varying between 99.2% and 99.9% depending on the color-index used to select the stars. The same effects were recently found by us in the GC NGC 1261. However, contrary to NGC 1261, we are not able to unambiguously suggest which of the sub-populations of SGB/RGB stars can be the progenitor of blue and red horizontal branch stars of the cluster. Apart from M4, NGC 3201 is another GC very probably with an inhomogeneous stellar population, which has essentially lower mass than the most massive Galactic GCs where multiple stellar populations were unambiguously detected for the first time.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2010-03-23,2010,2010-03-23,2010-03,512,,l6,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Kravtsov, V.; Alcaíno, G.; Marconi, G.; Alvarado, F.","Kravtsov, V.

Comparison of the thermal stability and FT-IR spectra of the films with those of the pure components indicates the formation of macromolecular aggregates with peculiar properties, different from those of their components. Scanning electron micrographies of the films revealed an organized microscopic pattern suggesting the existence of systematic interactions among their components.","Research partially funded by FONDECYT (Contracts 1090282, 1070195), Basal Financing Program CONICYT, FB0807 (CEDENNA), Millenium Science Nucleus P06-022-F.",,Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals,,,,2010-05-25,2010,,2010-05-25,523,1,11/[583]-20/[592],Closed,Article,"Fuentes, S.; Ayala, M.

Here we report on the seasonal in vitro germination of carpospores and tetraspores from four populations distributed from 27 to 41° S on the Chilean coast. Our results show that both types of spores exhibited a different physiological behavior related to the geographic origin of the specimens. Germination occurred throughout the year for both spore types in the four populations. However, for the northern locations (Calderilla, La Herradura and Puerto Aldea) germination was higher in spring, while for the southern location (Lechagua), germination was higher in summer. The growth rate of carposporelings and tetrasporelings varied seasonally in all locations studied, with higher growth in spring. Among all, carposporelings from Lechagua specimens reached the highest growth rates (9.3±0.2% d−1). However, spores from Herradura and P.

Von Bertalanffy growth curves (VBGF) using age and length experimental data under five different temperature regimes gathered in Iceland was obtained. Using these VBGC an inverse relationship between culture temperature and average maximum length (L∞) was established. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between L∞ and Brody coefficient (K) was evident. Then, using L∞, K and the growth performance index (Φ') a general VBGF was fitted, which it does L∞ temperature _ dependent, while K is dependent from L∞ values.

We study the formation of substellar objects (exoplanets and brown dwarfs) that are companions to young nearby stars. Methods. With high-contrast AO imaging obtained with NACO at ESO VLT, we search for faint companion candidates around our targets, whose companionship can be confirmed with astrometry. Results. We identified a faint substellar companion to the nearby pre-main sequence star PZ Tel, a member of the β Pic moving group. The companion is 5–6 mag fainter than its host star in JHK and is located at a separation of only 0.3 arcsec (or 15 AU of projected separation) northeast of PZ Tel. Within three NACO observing epochs, we can confirm the common proper motion (>39σ) and detected orbital motion of PZ Tel B around its primary (>37σ). The photometry of the newly found companion is consistent with a brown dwarf with a mass between 24 and 40MJup, at the distance (50 pc) and age (8−20 Myr) of PZ Tel. The effective temperature of the companion, derived from its photometry, ranges between 2500 and 2700 K, which corresponds to a spectral type between M6 and M8. After β Pic b, PZ Tel B is the second closest substellar companion imaged directly around a young star.","We would like to thank the technical staff and all support astronomers at Paranal Observatory.

The results of XRD and Raman spectroscopy were contradictory with respect to the nature of the formed phase for the barium titanate nanocrystals. The first indicated the formation of a cubic phase and the second indicated that was tetragonal. Thus, we use a combination of experiments, especially Raman spectroscopy supported by density functional theory calculations and measurement of the ferroelectric behavior, which showed the formation of a tetragonal phase. In addition, from theoretical calculations suggested that the ferroelectric nature, present only in the tetragonal phase, can arise from a small displacement of the titanium atom along the Z-axis from ⩾0.5pm, leaving from a cube phase to obtain pseudo cubic or slightly tetragonal phases.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been partially financed by FONDECYT Grant under contract No. 1080401.

Lexicographers, terminologists, subject specialists and linguists face a challenging task of supplying term equivalents for foreign international languages. The lack of a sufficient technical vocabulary in the African languages poses challenges to lexicographers and terminologists when supplying technical equivalents. They often regard transliteration as the quickest lexicographical and terminological procedure without taking the practical demands of users into account. This impedes the optimal retrieval of semantic information by the target users of dictionaries. This article discusses possible reasons why transliteration should not be regarded as the first but the last resort in lexicography and terminology. It proposes different lexicographical and terminological procedures lexicographers and terminologists can use to supply accurate and appropriate translation equivalents without making excessive use
 of transliteration. In this way a scientific language will develop which could assist users to communicate successfully in the mother tongue.

The traditional method of teaching, used before 1984, encouraged rote learning and teacher-centred lessons. This did not foster the use of dictionaries and, if they were used, the lack of a dictionary culture made their use ineffective. Teachers should be well versed in the functional approach, introduced in 1984, to ensure a smooth transition to Outcomes Based Eductation (OBE). Although its inception since 1994 offers a greater scope for using dictionaries, teachers are still unsure about how the syllabi should be implemented. This, together with the lack of a dictionary culture, results in an inadequate and ineffective dictionary use. Some suggestions are made how this situation could be rectified.

The KnCum bimetallic system is important to understand the promotion effects of the alkali atoms on the copper surface. The inclusion of potassium atoms on a bare copper cluster tends to break the Cu–Cu bond when n⩾m favors the formation of polar K–Cu bonds.

First, it is shown that this scenario can be found when a producer is involved in extremely high level of assembly transportation cost or in enormous size of market area. In this case, producers tend to pursue their cost minimization behavior than that of revenue maximization, which allows the presence of spatial consumer exclusion. Secondly, it is argued that the existence of unutilized area attracts potential new entrants to join the market competition, which may have benefit of reduction or elimination of the problem of consumer exclusion. Together with this alternative spatial formation approach, the analysis further attempts to evaluate the impact of decision-making of producers on welfare level of consumers.",,,Letters in Spatial and Resource Sciences,,,,2010-05-26,2010,2010-05-26,2010-10,3,3,101-110,Closed,Article,"Nakamura, Daisuke","Nakamura, Daisuke (Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional (IDEAR), Departamento de Economía, Universidad Católica del Norte, 0610, Avenida Angamos, Antofagasta, Chile; Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL), University of Illinois, 607 S.

The emphasis in the ISN was on the concept of user-friendliness. The article establishes that defining formats in the ISN are a judicious mixture mainly of the defining formats of the Collins Birmingham University International Language Database (COBUILD) and of what has been referred to as traditional formats. The first part of this article is an analysis of the decisions taken by the ISN editors in formulating their defining formats. It assesses the COBUILD defining principle vis-à-vis its application in defining headwords in the ISN and the impact of this principle on the userfriendliness of the dictionary. It further discusses other formats, including the decision to retain traditional defining formats for defining headwords. One of the traditional defining styles agreed upon was that the editors were to give the hypernym in the case of semantic sets, and then to identify the concept being defined by specifying aspects that distinguish it from others of its type. The second part of the article evaluates the importance and use of the corpus in providing both definitions and examples for the ISN. However, it is further argued that since a corpus has to be ""representative"" in terms of size in order to be appropriately used as basis for such corpus-based dictionaries, the ISN editors whose corpus was relatively small, could not avoid relying on intuitive knowledge in constructing some examples.

This study aims to describe and measure the reproductive structures of both sexes in the crab C. setosus . Females have a pair of ovaries in an H-type conformation; the anterior lobes are 2.4 times longer than the posterior lobes. The spermathecae has walls that are not extensible and a ventral-type connection with the oviduct, which indicates internal fertilization for this species. Sixty-four percent (64%) of the studied females presented a couple of spermatic blockages. In males, the first pair of pleopods is tubular, with the distal tips pointed and/or open, forming a fold. The second pair of pleopods ends in a funnel structure with 12 side extensions.

In this article, an attempt to farm Macrocystis pyrifera by zoospores in northern Chile is described; initially under laboratory conditions and subsequently by cultivation in the sea. The experiments were executed during 1 year and two different cultivation methodologies were used: a direct and an indirect method. A maximum frond length of 175 cm was reached and 22 kg m−1of rope was produced after 120 to 150 days of cultivation in the sea. The algae grew under both methodologies, and no differences in algal length and biomass were detected between the two cultivation systems.

310,pub.1028702623,10.4314/lex.v12i1.51364,,,The cause of urban slang and its effect on the development of the northern Sotho lexicon,"Urban slang terminology is extensively used today by most indigenous communities when speaking various South African indigenous languages. This is usually the case with informal conversations where the type of language used is also regarded to be informal. There are many instances where slang terms are used, consciously or unconsciously, in the form of code-switching with the indigenous languages in formal speech or informal conversations. These urban slang terms are regarded by most of the South African indigenous communities as prestige terms, especially by the young generation. Just as English and Afrikaans terminologies which had tremendous influence on the vocabularies of the indigenous languages, urban slang terminology has great influence on the daily usage of the South African indigenous languages. Despite this pressure, Northern Sotho and other South African indigenous languages do not have officially recognized adoptives which are derived from slang terminology. This is due to the fact that most language uthorities do not want to associate their standard languages with urban slang because of various reasons which include, inter alia, the conservative idea of associating urban slang with crime and juvenile delinquency. Despite the negative attitudes of most of the conservative language authorities who regard the loan words of urban slang origin to be ""contaminating"" the South African indigenous languages (such as Northern Sotho), this slang terminology is every day becoming more popular and seems to have come to stay rather than be removed from the language of the
 people. A considerable fraction of the vocabulary of Northern Sotho, for instance, is made up of words which can be regarded as ""loan words"" derived from urban slang, even though formally we are still refusing to accept them as part of the lexicon of official Northern Sotho.

The effect of solution potential,"A study of the dissolution of several copper concentrates under controlled potential conditions in chloride solutions has demonstrated that the rate of dissolution of chalcopyrite is strongly dependent on the potential of the solution. Linear rates were obtained for the dissolution of chalcopyrite in solutions containing 0.2M HCl and 0.5gL−1 Cu(II) at 35°C. The rate is enhanced within a range of potentials of 550 to 620mV (versus SHE) and the presence of dissolved oxygen is essential for enhanced rates within this potential window. Even though dissolved oxygen is important in order to achieve acceptable rates of dissolution, excessive oxidation can increase the potential into a region in which passivation is possible.Reduction of the potential into the optimum region results in restoration of enhanced rates of dissolution. On the other hand, dissolution at low potentials (<540mV) results in reduced rates of copper dissolution which increase significantly when the potential is subsequently increased to above 580mV. Mineralogical studies have shown that chalcopyrite remains un-leached and small amounts of covellite appear to be formed on the surface of the chalcopyrite at low potentials. All concentrates appear to dissolve at roughly the same rate under the same conditions, despite differences in the composition and mineralogy of the samples.","AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from BHP Billiton, Universidad Católica del Norte and the Parker Centre.

Percentages of motility, fertilization and injured spermatozoa were quantified by optic microscopy and scanned electron microscopy. These parameters were evaluated in sperm without treatment (CTR), spermatozoa incubated in cryoprotective solution but not freezed (ICS) and freezed-thawed spermatozoa (FTS). Spermatozoa of ICS treatment remained motile longer than those of CTR, whereas those of FTS treatment were lowest. Morphology of the spermatozoa was affected in several ways by the freeze-thawing treatment; some had their head deformed or swollen, others had their cell membrane folded or broken; acrosome reaction; anomalous positions or absence of mitochondria as well as broken, stiff or loss of lineal structure of tail. CTR and ICS treatments had higher percentages of undamaged sperm (87.7% and 79.0% respectively), while FTS samples had 14.2% of undamaged sperm. The tail was the spermatic structure most commonly injured in FTS (77.0%), the percentage of sperm with head injury was 55.1% and with acrosome reaction was 28.7%, whereas middle piece was affected in 23.9% of sperm. Percentages of fertilization were 68.3%, 67.9% and 58.2% for CTR, ICS and FTS respectively, which were not significantly different. There was a higher correlation between injuries and motility than between injuries and fertilization success. Correlation between motility and fertilization was low (0.605 and 0.668 with motility at 5 and 30 min, respectively).",,,Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research,,,,2010-03-10,2010,2010-03-10,,38,1,121-128,All OA; Gold,Article,"Espinoza, Carlos; Valdivia, Martha; Dupré, Enrique","Espinoza, Carlos (Instituto del Mar del Perú); Valdivia, Martha (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos); Dupré, Enrique (Universidad Católica del Norte)",,"Espinoza, Carlos (Instituto del Mar del Peru); Valdivia, Martha (National University of San Marcos); Dupré, Enrique (Catholic University of the North)",18,0,,1.39,http://www.lajar.cl/index.php/rlajar/article/download/vol38-issue1-fulltext-11/87,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1071483584,37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography,

Based on the results of these experiments, this paper reports on an extensive study of the kinetics of the dissolution of several chalcopyrite concentrates in chloride solutions under various conditions in especially designed reactors.It will be demonstrated that the rates of dissolution at constant potential in the range of 580–600mV by control of the oxygen supplied to the reactor are approximately constant for up to 80% dissolution for sized fractions of the concentrates. The rate of dissolution of chalcopyrite under these conditions is largely independent of the pulp density, iron and copper ion concentrations which could be expected in a heap leach operation, the acidity and the chloride ion concentration. Variation of the temperature in the range 25 to 75°C under otherwise constant conditions resulted in an activation energy for dissolution of two different concentrates of 72kJmol−1.",AcknowledgementsThe authors of this paper would like to acknowledge the financial support from BHP Billiton and the Parker Centre.

No possible bands of these molecules were found in high signal‐to‐noise ratio spectra of HD 147889, HD 204827, HD 207538 and HD 281259 – these objects represent both weaker and stronger interstellar molecular features and diffuse bands than Cernis 52. The idea that possible naphthalene and anthracene feature detection has a connection to the anomalous microwave emission reported in the direction of Cernis 52 has been examined using high‐quality spectra of HD 278942 and HD 281159 observed in the same area as Cernis 52. Despite the high microwave flux density in the direction of HD 281159 (∼four times higher at 60 μm than in the direction to Cernis 52), no expected features were detected. Accordingly, we consider these PAH discoveries as premature. Using the spectrum of HD 281159 we estimate the column density of interstellar naphthalene and anthracene normalized to E(B−V) = 1.0 as less than 2.16 × 1012 and 1.4 × 1012 respectively.",MK and JK acknowledge the financial support of the Polish State during the period 2007–2010 (grant N203 012 32/1550).

Water samples were collected from the local wastewater- and water-treatment plants, the Modimola Dam and homes in the area, and then analysed for the presence of E. coli, using standard methods. Presumptive isolates obtained were confirmed by the analytical profile index test. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion method. Of the 230 E. coli isolates tested, marked antibiotic resistances (over 70%) were observed for erythromycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and norfloxacin. Multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were also compiled. Overall, the phenotype T-Ap-E was frequent for E. coli isolated from the local wastewater and water-treatment plants, Modimola Dam and tap water. Cluster analysis performed showed a unique antibiotic resistance pattern which suggested a link between isolates from all sampling points. The findings indicated that improper wastewater treatment may have a potential impact on the dissemination and survival of E. coli, as well as other pathogenic bacteria in water for human and animal consumption. This may result in water- and food-borne disease outbreaks with a negative effect on antibiotic therapy.",,,South African Journal of Science,,,,2010-03-17,2010,2010-03-17,,106,1/2,44-49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kinge, Constance Wose; Ateba, Njie.; Kawadza, Tonderai","Kinge, Constance Wose (North-West University); Ateba, Njie.

In particular, these challenges relate to institutional and cultural barriers which restrict their access to education, land, credit and official support services. Despite this prevailing situation, some women are acknowledged as being successful in addressing the food and nutrition situation of their families and communities, often achieving this under extremely difficult circumstances. This article profiles the success stories of three rural South African women whose experiences provide us with some interesting lessons about achieving food security. Firstly, it does not require vast expense, but can be achieved under harsh conditions using simple technologies and innovations. Secondly, the usual food crops are not the only ones that can make a positive contribution to food security, and therefore alternative sources of food and nutrition need to be used. Thirdly, they all emphasise that food security is a collaborative undertaking and one which cannot be done by a single individual or organisation in isolation. Fourthly, the ways in which they address food security have a significant impact on both the physical, social and psychological well being of the people involved.",,,Agenda,,,,2010-01-01,2010,,2010-01-01,24,86,111-120,Closed,Article,"Hart, Tim","Hart, Tim (Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria, E-mail:, thart@hsrc.ac.za; Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, Stellenbosch University, South Africa, E-mail:, thart@hsrc.ac.za)",,"Hart, Tim (Human Sciences Research Council; Stellenbosch University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151302583,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,2 Zero Hunger

The objective of the present study was to establish a Redox Index of C Stability (RICS) and to correlate it with some properties of the humic acids extracted from different modal soils in Brazil (distinct weathering stages or management) to facilitate system comparison. The RICS was efficient for soil comparison and variations were comparable to those of the chemical and spectroscopic methods used for humic acid characterization. The values of soil pH, point of zero salt effect, sum of bases, exchangeable Ca content, weathering index, as well as the humic acid O/C ratio, quinone and semiquinone free radical contents, aromatic C and fluorescence intensity were closely related with the RICS. The RICS was higher in less weathered soils, with more active clays and higher fertility.

Participation in the programme did not guarantee access to faculty. Of the 1533 SFP students, 1101 subsequently registered for tertiary study at UKZN and 479 students graduated. Of these, 317 students completed a science degree, 25 completed engineering, 28 completed medicine and 109 completed a degree in the humanities or commerce. Numbers of students were still in progress for the respective degrees. In addition, a number have continued with postgraduate study.

We obtain analytical expressions for the transmission and the density of states, and we calculate numerically the current at zero temperature. We show that the system exhibits Fano resonances, total suppression of transmission, and bound states in the continuum. In equilibrium we find a magnetic flux-dependent effective level attraction and lines of perfect transmission when the intramolecular coupling is weak. This feature has strong consequences in the non-equilibrium regime, where the I–V characteristics displays a region of negative differential conductance induced by the magnetic flux. The current suffers an abrupt rise for small bias voltages as consequence of an effective level attraction of the hybridized levels produced by the flux. The decrease of current is result of the destruction of this effect when the bias is increased.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge financial support from FONDECYT, under Grant 1080660.

It is intended to reflect as much as possible the Ndebele language as spoken in Zimbabwe. The Ndebele language corpus was built in order to provide much-needed material for the study of the Ndebele language with a special focus on dictionarymaking and research. Like most corpora, the Ndebele language corpus may in future be used for other purposes not thought of at the time of its inception. It has been designed to meet generally acceptable standards so that it can be adaptable to various possible uses by various researchers. The article wants to outline the building process of the Ndebele language corpus with special emphasis on the challenges that faced compilers, and possible solutions. It is assumed that some of these challenges might not be peculiar to Ndebele alone but could also affect related African languages in a more or less similar situation. The main focus of the discussion will be the composition of the Ndebele language corpus, i.e. the type of texts that constitute the corpus. The corpus is composed of published texts, unpublished texts and oral material gathered from Ndebele-speaking districts of Zimbabwe. It will be argued that the use of the corpus and its reliability for research depends among other factors on its contents. It will also be shown that the contents of a corpus depend on a number of factors, some of which include sociolinguistic, political and economic considerations. These considerations have implications on both the content and quality of published
 and oral texts that constitute the Ndebele language corpus.

287,pub.1056914281,10.1051/0004-6361/200913917,,,Orbital motion of the young brown dwarf companion TWA 5 B*,"Context. It is difficult to determine masses and test formation models for brown dwarfs, because they are always above the main sequence, so that there is a degeneracy between mass and age. However, for brown dwarf companions to normal stars, such determinations may be possible, because one can know the distance and age of the primary star. As a result, brown dwarf companions are well-suited to testing formation theories and atmosphere models. Aims. With more adaptive optics images available, we aim at detecting orbital motion for the first time in the system TWA 5 A+B. Methods. We measured separation and position angle between TWA 5 A and B in each high-resolution image available and followed their change in time, because B should orbit around A. The astrometric measurement precision is about one milli arcsec. Results. With ten year difference in epoch, we can clearly detect orbital motion of B around A, a decrease in separation by ~0.0054” per year and a decrease in position angle by ~0.26° per year. Conclusions. TWA 5 B is a brown dwarf with ~25 Jupiter masses (Neuhäuser et al. 2000), but having large error bars (4 to 145 Jupiter masses, Neuhäuser et al. 2009). Given its large projected separation from the primary star, ~86 AU, and its young age (~10 Myr), it has probably formed star-like, and would then be a brown dwarf companion. Given the relatively large changes in separation and position angle between TWA 5 A and B, we can conclude that they orbit around each other on an eccentric orbit. Some evidence is found for a curvature in the orbital motion of B around A – most consistent with an elliptic (e = 0.45) orbit. Residuals around the best-fit ellipse are detected and show a small-amplitude (~18 mas) periodic sinusoid with ~5.7 yr period, i.e., fully consistent with the orbit of the inner close pair TWA 5 Aa+b. Measuring these residuals caused by the photocenter wobble – even in unresolved images – can yield the total mass of the inner pair, so can test theoretical pre-main sequence models.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2010-06,2010,2010-07-22,2010-06,516,,a112,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Neuhäuser, R.; Schmidt, T.

The main phases of the dusts are magnetite, cuprospinel, chalcocyanite, zincosite, dolerophanite, and claudetite. As minor phases, tenorite, arsenolite, delafossite and enargite were detected. In the sample studied, particles were mainly spherical and less than 60μm. The leaching of flue dust sample with water dissolved copper sulfates and zinc sulfates and, partially, arsenic oxides, in an exothermic process. The leaching of the residue after water leaching in several acid media increased the dissolution of copper and arsenic oxides and small amounts of zinc. A preliminary study by hydrocyclone classification was carried out with the objective of to obtain two fractions: a coarse fraction rich in copper and a fine fraction rich in arsenic. However, results obtained in this sample were not very successful. In the stabilization study, the residue obtained after leaching the copper flash smelter flue dust with sulfuric acid was mixed with sludge from a paper factory (co-inertization process). The smaller size fraction (>12μm) obtained in the hydrocyclone was also mixed with this sludge. Results obtained derived of the application of a standard leaching test over these residues indicate that they were stabilized. Thus, the resulting mixtures should be dumped without generating major environmental problems.",AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to the “Serveis Cientificotècnics de la Universitat de Barcelona” for their assistance in the characterization studies developed in this work.

Two of Khumalo's works, as well as a number of scores of composers who preceded him are discussed. Open-question interviews were conducted to obtain Mzilikazi Khumalo's views. A number of other choral musicians such as choir conductors, choristers and choral music adjudicators were also interviewed. The research on which this article is based has established that most of the composers that came before Khumalo tended to combine indigenous African and Western idioms. It was only in 1980, after he had completed Izibongo zikaShaka, that Khumalo developed very interesting melodies, rhythms and structures that were typically African. Whilst his compositions are not African in all respects, they incorporate most of the well-known traditional Zulu indigenous musical styles. This article provides information that should encourage and influence future composers to continue devising strategies to promote the establishment of a truly South African indigenous choral music identity, one that will contribute to the depth and richness of the rainbow nation.",,,Muziki,,,,2010-07,2010,,2010-07,7,1,60-75,Closed,Article,"Mugovhani, Ndwamato George","Mugovhani, Ndwamato George (Tshwane University of Technology)","Mugovhani, Ndwamato George (Tshwane University of Technology)","Mugovhani, Ndwamato George (Tshwane University of Technology)",1,0,,0.61,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050099076,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3603 Music,

We have determined the interstellar column densities and excitation temperatures of C2 for nine Galactic lines. For seven of these, C2 has never been observed before, so in this case the still small sample of interstellar clouds (26 lines of sight), where a detailed analysis of C2 excitation has been made, has increased significantly. This paper is a continuation of previous works where interstellar molecules (C2 and diffuse interstellar bands) have been analysed. Because the sample of interstellar clouds with C2 has increased, we can show that the width and shape of the profiles of some diffuse interstellar bands (6196 and 5797 Å) apparently depend on the gas kinetic and rotational temperatures of C2; the profiles are broader because of the higher values of the gas kinetic and rotational temperatures of C2. There are also diffuse interstellar bands (4964 and 5850 Å) for which this effect does not exist.","This work was supported by the Science and High Education Ministry of Poland, grants N203 012 32/1550 and N203 39/3334, and by the UE PhD Scholarship Programme (ZPORR).",,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,,,,2010-08-17,2010,2010-08-17,2010-11-01,408,3,1590-1597,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Kaźmierczak, M.; Schmidt, M.

Molybdenum is distributed extensively in the two deposits, and high molybdenum concentrations (>500 ppm) are recognized particularly in the chlorite‐sericite transitional zone between the potassic and sericitic zones. Two modes of occurrence of molybdenite are observed in the Escondida deposit: aggregates with Cu‐Fe‐sulfide minerals in fine veinlets (sulfide‐veinlet type), and monomineralic microveinlets associated with NE‐trending faults. The former and the latter yielded ages of 36.1 ± 0.2 Ma and 35.2 ± 0.2 Ma, respectively. Re‐Os dating of Escondida Norte molybdenites also show two distinct episodes, at 37.7 ± 0.3 Ma and a younger episode at 36.6 ± 0.2 Ma. These data indicate that the Escondida Norte is older than the main Escondida deposit. The Re‐Os age data combined with those of the porphyry emplacement suggest that the molybdenite mineralization in the Escondida district occurred as several short episodic pulses during the late‐magmatic to hydrothermal transition, and that the Cu‐Mo deposits were formed in a variable overall period spanning 1 to 5 m.y.","We thank Omar Cortés and Guillermo Vergara of Minera Escondida for their helpful support.

The continuum threshold s0, which signals the end of the resonance region and the onset of perturbative QCD, behaves as in all other hadronic channels, i.e. it decreases with increasing temperature until it reaches the perturbative QCD threshold s0=4mQ2, with mQ the charm quark mass, at T≃1.22Tc. The rest of the hadronic parameters behave very differently from those of light-light and heavy-light quark systems. The J/ψ mass is essentially constant in a wide range of temperatures, while the total width grows with temperature up to T≃1.04Tc beyond which it decreases sharply with increasing T. The resonance coupling is also initially constant and then begins to increase monotonically around T≃Tc. This behavior of the total width and of the leptonic decay constant provides a strong indication that the J/ψ resonance might survive beyond the critical temperature for deconfinement.","This work is supported in part by FONDECYT 1060653, 1095217, and 7080120 (Chile), Centro de Estudios Subatomicos (Chile), and NRF (South Africa).",,Physical Review D,,,,2010-01-01,2010,2010-01-13,2010-01-01,81,1,014007,All OA; Green,Article,"Dominguez, C.

The larvae distribution is related with the capture daytime and the tide conditions and which could interfere with the vertical or ontogenic migrations described for the meroplankton. From the identified species, the Neotrypaea uncinata larvae were the most abundant. Their vertical distribution was inverse to the one described by the circadian migration of the zooplankton, without detecting significant differences among the abundances in both sampled strata. The abundance of Cancridae and Pinnotheridae larvae were the only ones that had significant differences in the two strata, although they were inverse to the pattern of circadian vertical distribution.

Both DRC and DGC are monolingual Shona dictionaries compiled by a team of researchers under the African Languages Lexical (ALLEX) Project, now the African Languages Research Institute (ALRI). During the compilation process, DRC was known as the General Shona Dictionary and DGC as the Advanced Shona Dictionary. A simple analysis of these titles shows that the dictionaries are similar in some ways and also different in others. The writer tries to show the ways in which DGC is regarded as a more advanced dictionary when compared to DRC. Although the argument of the article is mainly built on those differences which make DGC the more advanced, attention is also paid to the similarities between the dictionaries.

Metalexicography as the theoretical component of lexicography requires that sublexical and multilexical items be lemmatized and treated as inde-pendent lemmata in the macrostructure of dictionaries. One of the greater challenges for compiling a better and user-oriented Northern Sotho monolingual dictionary is to treat sublexical and multi-lexical items as macrostructural elements. Treating these items, the lexicographer faces quite a number of challenges. This article proposes possible ways in which sublexical and multilexical elements could be successfully treated in a Northern Sotho monolingual dictionary. Taking stock of these challenges, the writer comes with suggestions that would assist lexicographers in the compi-lation of a user-friendly, lexicon-based monolingual dictionary that would lead users to successful information retrieval.

Another dimension has with increasing intension moved into the foreground, namely the need to Africanise South African higher education. The imperatives of these two dimensions are often portrayed as polarised positions and it is thus perceived that the one negates the benefits of the other. This article argues that compatibility exists between internationalisation and Africanisation of higher education in South Africa. To substantiate this argument, the conceptualisation of internationalisation and the Africanising of South African higher education, from selected literature, is presented. Subsequently, it is shown why these two conceptualisations could be perceived as contradictory to each other, and hence some touch points for finding compatibility between them are identified.

Method: TAPQOL questionnaires were utilized to evaluate parents or guardians of 483 children who attenden private, semiprivate and public kindergardens. Average age of the children was 51.7 months, 47% were girls. Results: QOL was found to be disturbed through anxiety and behavior problems. Some differences were found along the dimensions of gender, type of institution, and presence of illness. Conclusions: Our results allow us to focus on those preschoolers whose parents report a worse QOL, to develop intervention plans. Those are children who have suffered a disease, the youngest, or those who attend public preschools. Positive behavioral signs, anxiety and communication are special areas of interest for medical intervention.

They provide the subject matter of learning and instruction in sport and physical education. Research on safety in sport has been conducted in the USA, Britain, Canada, Australia and other developed countries since the 1950s. There is a paucity of empirical, evidence-based information on safety and security of learners participating in sport activities in South Africa. The purpose of this study was to identify the key safety dimensions of school sport, and to assess the risk management practices implemented by coaches and administrators at high schools. The aim was also to highlight the chief problems associated with safety in sport and to develop strategies to protect learners. The findings could raise awareness of coaches, administrators and relevant role players concerning their legal duties. A previously validated and pilot tested instrument was used to gather data. Purposive sampling was done in three provinces. Several dimensions and individual safety factors were not adequately addressed by relevant personnel, and certain basic minimum requirements were not met at a fair number of schools. These findings support previous reports by researchers that coaches and administrators are not adequately aware of, or do not fully appreciate the implications of their legal liability relative to sports activities at schools. Recommendations and guidelines have been offered to enable coaches and educators manage potential risks so that athletes and other learners experience a non-threatening environment where they gain optimally from sports activities.Key words: Safety; Learners; Coaches; Administrators; Liability; Risk management",,,South African Journal for Research in Sport Physical Education and Recreation,,,,2010-04-30,2010,2010-04-30,,32,1,107-120,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Singh, C; Surujlal, J","Singh, C (); Surujlal, J ()",,"Singh, C (); Surujlal, J ()",3,0,,0.56,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sajrs/article/download/54104/42638,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072497826,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 4207 Sports Science and Exercise,4 Quality Education

The analysis of the compiled information permits an understanding of changes in microbial substrates availability, chemical and physical conditions. A data mining technique, called decision trees was used to analyze the information and to establish rules that represent patterns in the data. The bacterial succession in bioheap leaching solutions allowed the leaching cycle stages to be described as: i) Acid conditioning and soluble copper releasing, ii) Chalcocite Bacterial leaching (ferrous oxidation); iii) Chalcocite Bacterial leaching (ferrous and reduced sulfur compounds — RISC oxidation); iv) Bacterial leaching of sulfide minerals with higher rest potentials (pyrite and covellite), and v) Bacterial oxidation of remnant sulfide minerals and RISC.

It looks at what the research team at ALRI has achieved, first in initiating serious research on the Zimbabwean lan-guages and the progress it has made towards achieving its goal, developing and raising the status of these languages. It also considers what ALRI has planned for the future of the different catego-ries or levels into which the various Zimbabwean languages have been classified. Part of the as-sessment focuses on measures ALRI has put in place to ensure the initiated research programme is sustainable and will continue in future. The article furthermore discusses the importance of the research work being done at ALRI, especially with regard to language development as a means towards self-realisation and -actualisation, national advancement and the sustenance of the lan-guages involved. ALRI's agenda is also analysed to see how well it agrees with popular thinking in Zimbabwe concerning the development and promotion of all of the indigenous languages.

Marine mollusks, as other animals, show a wide range of between- and within-individual variation of physiological traits. However, in this group, almost nothing is known about the relative influence of genetic factors on that variation. Repeatability (R) is a measure of the consistency of the variation of a trait, which includes its genetic variance and represents the maximum potential value of its heritability (h2). Traits that show high inter-individual variation and high repeatability levels could potentially evolve through selection (natural or artificial). We estimated the repeatability [using intra-class (τ) and Pearson-moment (r) correlation coefficients] of several physiological traits related to energy acquisition and allocation in juvenile Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai, maintained under controlled environment growing systems. In order to estimate the range of the R values and the effect of the time elapsed between measurements on these estimates, we measured these traits monthly during 6 months for each individual. Among the physiological traits, those related to energy allocation like oxygen consumption (standard metabolic rate, SMR) and ammonium excretion rates, and oxygen/nitrogen ratio (O/N), showed intermediate levels of repeatability (0.48, 0.55 and 0.39, respectively), when this was estimated by τ coefficient. However, the r estimation showed that SMR and O/N repeatability were significant and high (0.6–0.7 and 0.5–0.7, respectively) during the first 5 consecutive measurements, decreasing strongly (0.3 and 0.2, respectively) during the last measurement. For ammonia excretion, although repeatability (r) decreased from 0.8 to 0.5 during the 6 consecutive measurements, they remain significant during the experimental period. Therefore, our results indicate that for H. discus hannai juveniles, physiological traits like SMR, ammonia excretion and O/N are significantly repeatable (i.e. good predictors of future measurements) during a period of 4–5 months. These significant repeatability values suggest an important genetic control upon the phenotypic variation of these physiological traits, and could potentially respond to natural or artificial selection, and be used in genetic improvement programs. By contrast, those traits related to energy acquisition (i.e. ingestion, absorption and assimilation) and physiological efficiencies (i.e. net growth and scope for growth) showed very low levels of repeatability (0–0.07). This indicates that the phenotypic variation of these traits would be more influenced by environment rather than by genetic factors.","We are grateful to the Centro de Producción de Abalón de la Universidad Católica del Norte (CPA-UCN) for their invaluable contribution in providing all the necessary facilities required to undertake this study under controlled conditions.

In this work, we extend our previous results for an equilibrium situation with several control parameters to account for the existence of states with anomalous values in other response functions. Our analysis leads to the derivation of three different equilibrium fluctuation theorems: the fundamental and the complementary fluctuation theorems, which represent the generalization of two fluctuation identities already obtained in previous works, and the associated fluctuation theorem, a result that has no counterpart in the framework of Boltzmann–Gibbs distributions.

261,pub.1031469992,10.1651/09-3272.1,,,Male Morphotypes and Mating Behavior of the Dancing Shrimp Rhynchocinetes Brucei (Decapoda: Caridea),"In crustaceans, the presence of large males with highly developed prehensile appendages (chelipeds or gnathopods) generally is suggestive of female monopolization during her receptive period. While mate guarding is common among some malacostracan crustaceans (brachyuran crabs and some amphipod families) it is relatively rare in caridean shrimp. Here we explored sexual dimorphism and the presence of morphotypic differences among males of the dancing shrimp Rhynchocinetes brucei. We furthermore quantified the behavioral events during mating interactions to examine whether mate guarding extends over the entire period of female receptivity. Males and females had similar body sizes, but males developed increasingly larger third maxillipeds and first chelipeds during ontogeny. Large males with hyperdeveloped maxillipeds and very large chelipeds featured a high degree of broken appendages and eyes, which probably results from intrasexual agonistic interactions. About 30% of the non-competitive male-female interactions with post-ovigerous females resulted in successful matings. Males usually initiated body contact with the female shortly after the female's parturial molt, and they frequently touched the female's genital region with their anterior body parts. The first (and in most cases only) spermatophore transfer event occurred at variable times (0.2-7 h) after the female’s molt. Following spermatophore transfer some males guarded the female in the cage state (between their pereiopods) until the female had finished spawning and was ovigerous. Post-copulatory mate guarding could last up to 70 min, but not all males guarded the female after the copulation. We suggest that male guarding of the receptive female throughout the mating process reduces the risk of sperm competition.",,,Journal of Crustacean Biology,,,,2010-11-01,2010,2016-11-09,2010-11-01,30,4,580-588,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Thiel, Martin; Chak, Solomon T.

Using a psychosocial approach, the author assessed sexual initiation experiences of heterosexual men and women ages 18 to 69. Interviews showed that Chilean men constructed themselves as desiring subjects and women as without desire, reproducing cultural images of male and female sexuality. Women gave more importance to affection as a precondition for sex, although the number of women whose sexual initiation was motivated by curiosity has increased. The author found age synchronization of young Chilean men’s and women’s age at sexual initiation but, in contrast to trends in other Western countries, no greater early initiation in younger generations.

Species that are endemic to particular currents or regions of the world’s oceans have the potential to be at higher risk due to localized overfishing, pollution, or locally severe impacts of climate change such as more intense, or longer, El Niño Southern Oscillation events. Understanding patterns of population differentiation in endemic marine organisms may be particularly important for their conservation and persistence. Peruvian Boobies (Sula variegata) are endemic to the Humboldt Current upwelling system and have experienced population fluctuations throughout their evolutionary history due to both dramatic reduction of food supplies, and anthropogenic influence over the last ~150 years. Recent research on other members of the Sulidae indicates that populations of these primarily tropical seabirds show a high degree of genetic differentiation; however, the sister species of the Peruvian Booby, the Blue-footed Booby (S. nebouxii), exhibits only weak range-wide population genetic structure. We characterized population genetic differentiation and diversity in 153 Peruvian Boobies using sequence variation of 540 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region and seven microsatellite loci. Although we found evidence of panmixia, a signature of isolation by distance appears to exist between the five sampled colonies. We also found unexpectedly high genetic diversity given this species’ recent population decline. Our results are similar to those for the Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti), another endemic of the Humboldt Current upwelling system.","We are grateful to the wardens of the Peruvian islands, especially to R.J.

Se ha demostrado que el nmero de coautores de un artculo y la frecuencia de autocitas del investigador pueden afectar los ndices de productividad cientfica. En este estudio proponemos un nuevo indicador del impacto de la productividad cientfica, el ndice-I, el cual se basa en el ndice-h, corrigindolo por el nmero de coautores de cada artculo y la proporcin de alo-citas del investigador. Adicionalmente, presentamos la estandarizacin del ndice por la edad cientfica (tiempo en aos desde la primera publicacin) (ndice-Is). Evaluamos la variacin del ndice-I con la edad cronolgica (clases etarias), la ubicacin geogrfica (Santiago vs. Regiones) y el gnero de los investigadores. Evaluamos tambin cmo varan estos patrones si solo se consideran los diez primeros de cada clase etaria, y si se usa el ndice-Is. El universo muestral fue de 120 investigadores en ciencias ecolgicas (sensu lato). Los resultados muestran que investigadores ms longevos presentan valores de ndice-I significativamente mayores y que esta diferencia se hace ms evidente al considerar los diez primeros de cada clase etaria. Los investigadores de Santiago poseen valores de ndice-I significativamente mayores que aquellos de regiones; sin embargo, esta tendencia se invierte al considerar los investigadores altamente productivos ms jvenes. No hay diferencias entre hombres y mujeres al considerar la totalidad de los investigadores; sin embargo, al considerar solo los diez primeros, los hombres presentan valores de ndice-I significativamente mayores. La estandarizacin por la edad cientfica produce un cambio en el ranking de los investigadores ms productivos. El ndice propuesto tiene la ventaja de ser un estimador que: i) refleja mejor el aporte individual de un investigador, ii) no es manipulable con autocitas, iii) no es un nmero entero, lo cual permite discriminar con mayor precisin, y iv) en su versin estandarizada permite comparar el impacto de la productividad cientfica de investigadores de diferentes edades. Proponemos incluir el ndice-I en las evaluaciones para contrataciones, promociones y premios acadmicos. Hirsch proposed in 2005 the h-index, which integrates in a single number the impact of scientific output of a researcher, considering both the quantity of published articles and the citations received. It has been demonstrated that the number of coauthors in an article and the frequency of self-citations of the researcher may affect the scientific indices. In this study we propose a new indicator of the impact of scientific output: the I-index, which is based on the h-index, correcting for the number of coauthors of each article and the proportion of allo-citations of the researcher. In addition, we introduce the index's standardization by scientific age (time in years since the first publication, Is-index). We evaluated the variation of I-index with chronological age (age classes), geographical location (Santiago vs. Regions) and gender of researchers. We also evaluated how these patterns vary if only the top ten of each age class are considered, and if the Is-index is used. The sample group consisted of 120 researchers in ecological sciences (sensu lato). Results show that older researchers have significantly higher I-index values and that this difference is greater when the top ten group is considered. Researchers from Santiago have higher I-index values than those from regions. However, the opposite trend is found when the top ten young researchers are considered. Although no difference between male and female researchers was detected when the whole data set is considered, the top ten male researchers have greater I-index values. Standardization of the I-index for scientific age changes the upper ranking of scientific output. The proposed index has the advantage of being an indicator that: i) better reflects the individual contribution of a researcher, ii) it is not feasible to manipulate it via self-citations, iii) it is not an integer number, hence allowing a more precise discrimination, and iv) the standardized version allows the comparison of the research output impact of scientists of different ages.

Due to the enormous demand for healthcare, many governments have opted for home-based care systems. Caregivers are mainly older women and their financial survival is critically important. We found that as the patient’s illness progressed: 1) the cultural norm ubuntu led the caregiver to increase spending on the patient and a decreased spending on themselves and 2) the social pressure of stigma led to a very dramatic drop in direct interpersonal assistance to the patient and an increase in spending on themselves.

253,pub.1049418225,10.1080/14767721003779662,,,Current internationalisation: the case of France,"This paper argues that higher education has a long history of globalising, though the form of these processes has been different. Two are identified; first, a normative order based on common frameworks; second, the expansion of formal exchanges of inputs and outputs from higher education. Different countries, however, are positioned differently in this. Through an analysis of France’s higher education sector, the paper argues that unlike most English speaking and South Asian countries in the recent past, France seems much less interested in increasing its share of the international market of HE teaching services than in developing a competitive R‐D university–industry sector. This implies the de‐construction of the inherited system, and a reallocation of resources toward a new top‐tier of public establishments strongly linked with private economic interests. For that purpose a radical reform of the HE sector was needed. To implement such a reform, one that is strongly opposed by a large part of the academic community, the government has relied on the external resources of international norms and rules of governance. In this field, France appears both as a norm‐maker and a norm‐taker.",,,Globalisation Societies and Education,,,,2010-06-22,2010,2010-06-22,2010-06,8,2,205-217,Closed,Article,"Vinokur, Annie","Vinokur, Annie (UMR EconomiX, Université de Paris X, Paris, France)","Vinokur, Annie (University Paris Nanterre)","Vinokur, Annie (University Paris Nanterre)",8,1,,1.94,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049418225,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",

Therefore, institutions should create efficient and effective ways of providing relevant information to prospective students during their process of selecting an institution. The major communication channels that prospective students consult during their selection process, and the usefulness thereof for students, are important knowledge imperatives for higher education institutions. In this study, 12 different channels of communication, considered by students during a typical higher education institution selection process, were investigated. A non-probability convenience sample of 1 241 first-year students from six higher education institutions in South Africa was drawn. Findings suggest that female students attach a significantly higher value to nine of the 12 communication channels, compared to their male counterparts. There were also differences between the ethnic groups in terms of the usefulness of events on campus, high school teachers, open days and campus visits, as well as university publications.

This work studies in more detail the stellar population, including its photometric properties and characteristics, in the rarely studied southern Galactic globular cluster NGC 1261. We focus on the brighter sequences of the cluster's color–magnitude diagram (CMD). Like in our previous works, we rely upon photometry in several passbands to achieve more reliable results and conclusions. Methods. We carried out and analyzed new multi-color photometry of NGC 1261 in UBVI reaching below the turnoff point in all passbands in a fairly extended cluster field, about 14' × 14'. Results. We found several signs of the inhomogeneity (“multiplicity”) in the stellar population. The most prominent of them are: (1) the dependence of the radial distribution of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in the cluster on their U magnitude, with brighter stars less centrally concentrated at the 99.9% level than their fainter counterparts; (2) the dependence of the location of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the U-(U-B) CMD on their radial distance from the cluster center, with the portion of stars bluer in the (U-B) color increasing towards the cluster outskirts. Additionally, the radial variation of the RGB luminosity function in the bump region is suspected. We assume that both the SGB stars brighter in the U and the RGB stars bluer in the (U-B) color are probably associated with blue horizontal branch stars, because of a similarity in their radial distribution in the cluster. We estimated the metalicity of NGC 1261 from the slope of the RGB in U-based CMDs and the location of the RGB bump on the branch. These metallicity indicators give [Fe/H]ZW = -1.34 ± 0.16 dex and [Fe/H]ZW = -1.41 ± 0.10 dex, respectively. We isolated 18 probable blue straggler candidates. They are more centrally concentrated than the lower red giants of comparable brightness at the 97.9% level. Their photometric characteristics imply that their majority is not consistent with the collisional origin. We also reliably isolated the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) clump and estimated the parameter = 1.01 ± 0.06, that is the difference between the V-levels of the zero age HB and the clump.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2010-06-18,2010,2010-06-18,2010-06,516,,a23,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Kravtsov, V.; Alcaíno, G.; Marconi, G.; Alvarado, F.","Kravtsov, V.

The issue of witchcraft gained prominence during the latter years of apartheid when youths called ‘Comrades’ sought to cleanse rural villages in the north‐eastern provinces of witches. However, after apartheid witchcraft has only made a few brief incursions into the South African public sphere. I suggest that the absence of witchcraft in formal political discussions is not only due to censorship by a modernist government. It is also a product of the popular status of witchcraft as ‘deep knowledge’ or as a ‘subtext’ to social interaction in village and township settings. Accusations of witchcraft occur largely in private domestic spaces. Moreover, the ontological status of witchcraft as a mystical reality that transcends ordinary perception implies that it cannot meet standards of proof demanded by courts of law.",,,Social Dynamics,,,,2010-03,2010,,2010-03,36,1,65-77,Closed,Article,"Niehaus, Isak","Niehaus, Isak (Brunel University, London, UK)","Niehaus, Isak (Brunel University London)","Niehaus, Isak (Brunel University London)",11,1,,14.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003630250,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Dentro de estas condiciones climticas destacan las bajas temperaturas del aire y del sustrato, la alta radiacin lumnica y el dfcit hdrico. Se ha documentado que la alta radiacin lumnica y las bajas temperaturas tpicas de la alta-montaa seran propicias para la fotoinhibicin. No obstante, existen muchas plantas que pueden distribuirse de manera exitosa sobre gradientes altitudinales, sugiriendo la presencia de estrategias para lidiar con las condiciones climticas adversas. En el presente estudio se evaluaron diferentes estrategias fotoprotectoras tanto morfolgicas como fsiolgicas que poseen las especies Taraxacum offcinale G.Weber ex F.H.Wigg. (Asteraceae) y Phacelia secunda F. J.Gmel. (Hydrophyllaceae) creciendo en dos poblaciones. Se midieron los atributos morfolgicos y fisiolgicos en individuos de ambas especies creciendo a los 2.600 y 3.600 m, en Los Andes de Chile central. Los resultados muestran que en T. offcinale variaron cuatro de los seis atributos morfolgicos medidos entre las dos altitudes, no obstante P. secunda present variacin con la altitud en todos sus atributos morfolgicos. Por otro lado, los individuos de T. offcinale que crecen a mayor altitud presentaron signifcativamente una mayor concentracin de pigmentos implicados en el ciclo de las xantflas, mientras que P. secunda no present diferencias, sugiriendo que T. offcinale tiene una mayor capacidad para disipar la energa solar como calor. En ambas especies, el estado de desepoxidacin fue mayor en aquellos individuos provenientes de la poblacin de mayor altitud. Los resultados sugieren que mientras T. offcinale posee una estrategia principalmente fsiolgica para lidiar con las condiciones fotoinhibitorias de la alta-montaa, P. secunda posee una estrategia principalmente morfolgica. No obstante estas estrategias ms que ser excluyentes parecen ser complementarias. De esta manera, la presencia de una determinada especie en la zona de la alta-montaa depender en gran medida de las estrategias particulares que posea cada una de ellas para evitar la fotoinhibicin por alta radiacin y bajas temperaturas tpica de las zonas de la alta-montaa de Chile central. High-mountain environments are characterized by stressful climatic conditions for the development of plants. Some of these conditions are low temperatures of air and soil, high radiation, and water shortage. It has been documented that high radiation and low temperatures are favorable conditions for inducing photoinhibition. Nevertheless, there are plant species that successfully live on extended altitudinal gradients, suggesting the presence of strategies to cope with stressful climatic conditions. In this study we assessed the different photoprotective strategies, both morphological and physiological in Taraxacum offcinale G.Weber ex F.H.Wigg. (Asteraceae) and Phacelia secunda F. J.Gmel. (Hydrophyllaceae) growing in two populations. Physiological and morphological traits were recorded in both species growing at 2,600 y 3,600 m, in Los Andes of Central Chile. Overall, results indicate that T. offcinale showed variations in four of the six morphological traits recorded between altitudes; however, P. secunda showed high morphological variations among populations in all of its traits. On the other hand, T. offcinale individuals growing in the upper population signifcantly showed a higher amount of pigments involved in xanthophyll cycle, while P. secunda showed no differences, suggesting that T. offcinale has most capacity for dissipation of the solar energy as heat. In both species, the desepoxidation status was signifcantly higher in those individuals from upper populations. Results suggest that while T. offcinale has mainly a physiological strategy to cope with the photoinhibitory conditions in the high-mountain, P. secunda has a strategy mainly based in morphological variations. Therefore, the presence of specifc plant species in the high-mountain habitats should be related with the different strategies for avoiding fotoinhibition by high radiation and low temperature, which are typical from the high-mountain habitats of Central Chile.",,,Gayana Botánica,,,,2010,2010,2010,,67,1,1-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Molina-Montenegro, Marco A; Cavieres, Lohengrin A","Molina-Montenegro, Marco A (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas ridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Universidad de Concepcin Departamento de Botnica, Concepcin, Chile; Universidad de Chile Instituto de Ecologa y Biodiversidad (IEB), Santiago, Chile); Cavieres, Lohengrin A (Universidad de Concepcin Departamento de Botnica, Concepcin, Chile; Universidad de Chile Instituto de Ecologa y Biodiversidad (IEB), Santiago, Chile)",,"Molina-Montenegro, Marco A (Catholic University of the North; University of Concepción; University of Chile); Cavieres, Lohengrin A (University of Concepción; University of Chile)",18,1,,1.46,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/gbot/v67n1/art01.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037883866,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

Relatively small refuges are expected to harbor single or pairs of conspecifics because defense against intruders is energetically inexpensive. Relatively large shelters should harbor aggregations because guarding behaviors turn energetically expensive. Here, we used the intertidal shrimp Betaeus lilianae to test the hypothesis that species inhabiting large refuges live in aggregations and not solitarily or in pairs. Also, we provided information on the lifestyle of this species, specifically regarding a newly discovered partnership with the crab Platyxanthus crenulatus. In agreement with theoretical expectations, Betaeus lilianae was found living in aggregations in rock pools, characterized by their large size. Shrimp aggregations featured female-biased sex ratios more frequently than expected by chance alone and had no particular complex social structure. There was no effect of pool size and shrimp group size on sex ratio and no significant relationship between the difference in body size of the largest and second largest male and shrimp group size was observed. Relative growth analyses showed that the major claw had positive allometry in males and females but relative claw growth was greater in males. The information above permitted rejecting several alternative hypotheses on the mating system of B. lilianae: it is neither socially monogamous nor features a promiscuous pure-search mating system. Additional studies are needed to reveal the mating behavior of the studied species. Field observations and laboratory experiments demonstrated that B. lilianae associate preferentially with the crab P. crenulatus.","AcknowledgmentsJAB is grateful for the support from a Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Smithsonian Marine Station (SMS) Postdoctoral Fellowship.

This is the starting point of the argument in this chapter, en route to presenting new ways of thinking about diversity, social justice, difference and solidarity in the context of teacher education. It takes issue with the ghettoized construction of equality, amidst empirical evidence that indicates that South African society’s deeply embedded prejudices are antithetical to social justice. We thus take the approach that it is more sustainable and desirable to interpret and anchor social justice within a conceptual frame that logically links difference and diversity with the political notion of solidarity, so human agency can be advanced. Derrida’s reworked notions of hospitality, diversity and difference are rearticulated with the political purposes of social justice and solidarity. Applying these constructs to re-examine findings on teacher education, we conclude that teacher education/training should not simply be aimed at managing the expressed or demonstrated diversity in the classroom, but rather at how to engage with diversity as an operative notion for social justice, and solidarity with humanity, and human suffering.",,,,"Values, Religions and Education in Changing Societies","Karin Sporre, Jan Mannberg",,2010-08-26,2010,2010-08-26,2011,,,75-91,Closed,Chapter,"Zinn, Denise; Keet, André","Zinn, Denise (Faculty of Education, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Port Elizabeth, South Africa); Keet, André (Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa)","Zinn, Denise (Nelson Mandela University)","Zinn, Denise (Nelson Mandela University); Keet, André (University of Pretoria)",1,0,,0.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049115175,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education",10 Reduced Inequalities; 4 Quality Education

However, theoretical studies predicting sex ratios in species with unusual sexual systems, such as protandric simultaneous (PS) hermaphroditism, are rare. In PS hermaphrodites, juveniles first develop into functional males that mature into simultaneous hermaphrodites later in life. Here, we report on the sex ratio (males/males + hermaphrodites) in the PS hermaphroditic shrimp Exhippolysmata oplophoroides. A 2-year study demonstrated that hermaphrodites dominated the population in two different bays. This skewed sex ratio may be explained by limited encounter rates among conspecifics. In agreement with this idea, the density of shrimps was extremely low (≤1 shrimp km−2) at the two study sites. Size at sex phase change and sex ratios remained relatively stable through time at the two bays. The stability of these parameters might be explained by the rather steady population structure of this species during the study period. A review of sex ratios in PS hermaphroditic shrimps (Lysmata and Exhippolysmata) revealed considerable variation; some species have male- and others hermaphrodite-skewed sex ratios. The conditions explaining inter- and intra-specific sex ratio variation in protandric simultaneous hermaphroditic species remain to be addressed.","AF and MLNF thank FAPESP for funding of infrastructure, field trips, and laboratory work (projects #94/4848-4 and #98/3234-6).

Gaertn. f and Rhizophora mangle L. was analyzed in the mangrove forest of the estuary of São Mateus River, Espírito Santo, Brazil. In leaves, the nutrients followed the sequence: N> Ca> K> Mg> S> P> Fe> Mn> Zn> Cu, and there were significant differences between species and sites studied. In general, the levels of K were higher in the dry season compared to the rainy season for both species analyzed while Ca and Cu showed higher concentrations in the rainy season for Laguncularia racemosa. In the sediment, the nutrients followed the sequence: Mg> Ca> Fe> K> Mn> P> Zn> Cu, in general, with lower concentrations at the site where the sediment was sandier. We observed a significant variation of nutrient concentrations in the sediment between the periods analyzed, but the seasonal pattern was not clear for all nutrients. Nutrient concentration profile found in leaves of both plant species was not correlated with concentrations found in the respective sediments. The concentration factor was less than 1.0 for Fe and between 1.0 and 3.7 for Mn, Zn and Cu.

245,pub.1028663494,10.1016/j.minpro.2010.02.001,,,Tracking velocity of multiple bubbles in a swarm,"This communication describes a new technique to identify and track individual bubbles moving in a bubble swarm covering bubble diameters from 0.2 to 5mm and gas hold-up from 2% to 30%, conditions relevant to mineral flotation systems. The technique employs a 2D column, slot-type spargers, a digital high-speed camera and image analysis software developed for tracking multiple moving objects. The camera collects sequences of images recorded at 2ms intervals at 1280×1024pixel size. The software allows bubble geometric properties to be measured in the image sequence and compiled into a data structure. To track each bubble, a shape and proximity criterion is applied on consecutive pictures to identify each bubble. The bubble trajectory is reconstructed from the data structure; up to 60,000 matching bubbles can be tracked per test. The bubble tracking measurements revealed a velocity–size relationship with some of the following features: faster moving bubbles speed up slower moving ones whether larger or smaller; a large population of slow moving fine bubbles slows all bubbles; surfactant type affects velocity, equivalent size bubbles in Polyglycol moving slower than in n-Pentanol. Practical implications in flotation are discussed.","AcknowledgementsFunding for this work was from a) the Chair in Mineral Processing (renewal III) sponsored by Vale Inco, Teck Resources, Xstrata Process Support, Agnico-Eagle, Barrick Gold, Shell Canada, SGS Lakefield Research, COREM and Flottec under the Collaborative Research and Development (CRD) program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); and b) the Amira International P9 project also under the NSERC CRD program.",,International Journal of Mineral Processing,,,,2010-04,2010,,2010-04,94,3-4,147-158,Closed,Article,"Acuña, C.A.; Finch, J.A.","Acuña, C.A.

Both males and females participated in focus groups that were conducted at Itsoseng Clinic on the Mamelodi Campus of the University of Pretoria. Discussion questions addressed participants' perceptions of psychologists and psychotherapy, barriers to seeking treatment and recommendations for improved service delivery. The focus group responses indicated that reasons for seeking treatment included HIV&AIDS, problems related to the participants' socioeconomic situation, relationship issues and educational problems (learning problems, career guidance and educational stress among tertiary learners). Key barriers to service utilisation included the stigma of mental illness, lack of knowledge, affordability of treatment, lack of trust, impersonal service and lack of cultural sensitivity. Participants discussed the issue of the psychologist's race, as they felt that many white psychologists lack sensitivity toward and knowledge of black communities. Participants further stated that black psychologists were not much better due to the acculturation that occurs during the training of black psychologists. Recommendations for more culturally sensitive services are suggested.

245,pub.1041037870,10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00605.x,,,Molecular systematics of peppermint and cleaner shrimps: phylogeny and taxonomy of the genera Lysmata and Exhippolysmata (Crustacea: Caridea: Hippolytidae),"Shrimps from the ecologically diverse genera Lysmata and Exhippolysmata are rare among marine invertebrates because they are protandric simultaneous hermaphrodites: shrimps initially mature and reproduce solely as males, and later in life become functional simultaneous hermaphrodites. Considerable progress on the reproductive ecology of members from these two genera has been achieved during the last decade. However, several outstanding issues of systematic nature remain to be addressed. Here, a molecular phylogeny of these two genera was used to examine the overall evolutionary relationship within and between species and genera, and to answer various questions related to the systematic status of several species. The present phylogenetic analysis, including 53 sequences and 26 species of Lysmata and Exhippolysmata, indicates that semiterrestrial shrimps from the genus Merguia represent the sister group to a second natural clade composed by shrimps from the genera Lysmata and Exhippolysmata. Also, the phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the genus Lysmata is paraphyletic, and includes the genus Exhippolysmata, as noted in a preliminary study. The tree partially supports the separation of species with or without a developed accessory branch into two different genera or subgenera (i.e. Lysmata and Hippolysmata having a well-developed accessory branch, or not, respectively). The genetic distance between the cleaner shrimps Lysmata amboinensis and Lysmata grabhami was smaller than has been observed between other sister species. On the other hand, the topology of the tree indicates that these two entities are reciprocally monophyletic. Thus, this latter result, together with minor but constant differences in the colour pattern reported for these two entities, indicates that there is no reason to stop treating them as different valid species. This study enabled the long overdue resolution of standing taxonomic questions in shrimps from the genera Lysmata and Exhippolysmata. In the future, this phylogeny will help to reveal the conditions favouring the origins of several behavioural and morphological novelties in these unique shrimps.","Many thanks to Bill Hoffman from the Smithsonian Marine Ecosystems Exhibit (SMEE), Valerie Paul, Raphael Ritson-Williams, and Julie Piraino from the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce (SMSFP), Narissa Bax from New Zealand, Luis Ignacio Vilchis and William A.

S) have been dated by the 40Ar/39Ar method and analyzed for stable isotopes. These data support published geomorphologic and sedimentologic evidence suggesting that the Precordillera in the Southern Atacama Desert had been uplifted as early as the late Eocene and, thus, significantly prior to the Altiplano which attained its high elevation only in the late Miocene. The oldest supergene alunite from the Damiana exotic deposit at El Salvador was dated at 35.8±1Ma and yielded a δD (VSMOW) value of −74‰ which indicates elevations of the Precordillera near El Salvador of at least 3000m in the Late Eocene. In contrast, Miocene supergene alunite from El Salvador, El Hueso, and Coya have less negative δD signatures reaching values as high as −23 to −25‰ at El Hueso and El Salvador between about 8.2 and 14Ma. Late Miocene to Holocene supergene alunite, jarosite and natroalunite ages are restricted to El Hueso and Coya located near 4000m above sea level in the Precordillera, roughly 1000m higher than the present elevation of El Salvador. The δD values of samples younger than ~5Ma vary between −57 and −97‰. The complex evolution of the δD signatures suggests that meteoric waters recorded in supergene alunite group minerals were variably affected by evaporation and provides evidence for climate desiccation and onset of hyper arid conditions in the Central Depression of the southern Atacama Desert after 15Ma, which agrees well with published constraints from the Atacama Desert at 23–24° Lat. S. Our data also suggest that wetter climatic conditions than at present prevailed in the latest Miocene and early Pliocene in the Precordillera. The new and previously published age constraints for El Salvador indicate that supergene mineralization at the Damiana exotic Cu deposit occurred periodically over 23Ma in a locally exceptionally stable paleohydrologic and geomorphologic configuration.",This study has been funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico de Chile (Fondecyt) grant # 11060516.

A field experiment was conducted aiming (1) to describe the successional development in a subtidal soft-bottom community over a two-year period, (2) to estimate the time necessary for the developing community to resemble the surrounding natural community, and (3) to evaluate the effect of seasonal onset on the colonization over a one-year period of development. Containers filled with fine sediment without any previous biological conditioning were installed in subtidal soft bottoms off Playa Colorado, Bahía Antofagasta, Chile (Humboldt Current System). The experiment was initiated in June 2006. For 24months three replicate containers together with 4 reference samples from the surrounding natural community were sampled every three months. Succession was detected but did not show a sequential replacement from early to late colonizers, thus did not follow distinguishable seral stages. These results support the tolerance succession model, which states that species dominating later successional stages colonize at the same time as species mainly associated with initial successional stages. Resemblance to the reference community was first recorded after eighteen months. In order to test for seasonal effects of colonization, three containers were installed in each of the four seasons, and the community was allowed to develop for a one-year period. Seasonality had no evident effect, as all establishing communities converged to a similar structure after one year, regardless of the season, when the containers had been installed. This study highlights the strong resilience of northern Chilean sublittoral soft-bottom communities to environmental variations during the cold conditions of the El Niño Southern Oscillation.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to T.

The concern is with exploring the discipline/punishment/power nexus in education in both countries; with how reductionist versions of discipline as authoritarianism interweave with views about the aims and perceived need for punishment in schools, and how this is driven by perceptions of a need to maintain control or power over young people, often viewed as a ‘generation of suspects’. The authors argue that a restorative approach can be used to build more inclusive school communities where staff and students negotiate new meanings of discipline and power. Some of the key challenges associated with a restorative approach are then explored in detail and the notion of ubuntu – ‘A person is a person because of others' – strongly associated with the new South Africa and its reassertion of traditional principles and values, is suggested as a useful compass for future development in both countries. In very different contexts, but facing many of the same challenges, the authors ask: What can the United Kingdom learn from South Africa and what can South Africa learn from the United Kingdom?",,,Power and Education,,,,2010-01-01,2010,2010-01-01,2010-03,2,1,18-30,Closed,Article,"McCluskey, Gillean; Lephalala, Mirriam","McCluskey, Gillean (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom); Lephalala, Mirriam (University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa)","McCluskey, Gillean (University of Edinburgh); Lephalala, Mirriam (University of South Africa)","McCluskey, Gillean (University of Edinburgh); Lephalala, Mirriam (University of South Africa)",5,0,,0.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069364397,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,

The Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 279 was observed by XMM-Newton in November 2005 on three consecutive orbits, showing significant short-scale variability (average soft band variation in flux ~20%). The source is known to host a two-component warm absorber with distinct ionisation states from a previous Chandra observation. Aims. We study the warm absorber in Mrk 279 and investigate any possible response to the short-term variations in the ionising flux and assess whether it has varied on a long-term timescale with respect to the Chandra observation. Methods. The XMM-Newton-RGS spectra of Mrk 279 were analysed in both the high- and low-flux states using the SPEX fitting package. Results. We find no significant changes in the warm absorber on either short timescales (~2 days) or longer ones (two and a half years), as the variations in the ionic column densities of the most relevant elements are below the 90% confidence level. The variations could still be present but are statistically undetected given the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. Starting from reasonable standard assumptions, we estimate the location of the absorbing gas, which is likely to be associated with the putative dusty torus rather than with the broad line region if the outflowing gas is moving at the escape velocity or greater.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2010-09-27,2010,2010-09-27,2010-09,520,,a36,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Ebrero, J.; Costantini, E.; Kaastra, J.

Settling of larvae, parent–offspring communication, mate finding, mate choice, aggressive contests, and dominance hierarchies are all mediated by chemical signals. Enormous advances have been made on understanding the function of chemical signals in crustaceans and we are on the doorstep of major advances in chemical characterization of pheromones. In many species urine is the carrier of chemical signals. Crustaceans control release and transfer direction of urine, but it is unknown whether crustacean senders can manipulate the composition of urineborne pheromones. Chemicals contained in the urine effectively convey information about conspecific properties such as sex, sexual receptivity, species identity, health status, motivation to fight, dominance, individual identity, and molt stage. In larger species (shrimp, crabs, lobsters, crayfish) signal delivery is often aided by self-generated fanning currents that flush chemicals towards receivers, which themselves might actively pull water towards their sensory structures. Antennal flicking also supports molecule exchange at the receptor level. Contact pheromones play a role in sex recognition in several crustacean taxa and in settlement of barnacles. Large crustacean species show little or no sexual dimorphism in receptor structures, but in smaller taxa, e.g. peracarids and copepods, males often have larger antennae than females. Whether differences in sexual roles have also resulted in sex-specific brain centers is not known at present. While pheromones play an important role in mate finding and species recognition, there are numerous examples from peracarids and copepods where males pursue or even form precopulatory pairs with females of closely related congeners. Differentiation of chemicals often appears to be insufficient to guarantee reproductive isolation. In many freshwater and coastal habitats, pollutants may also disrupt chemical communication in crustaceans, but the specific mechanisms of interference are not well understood. The chemical characterization of crustacean pheromones is viewed as a major step in improving our understanding of chemical communication. Knowing the chemical nature of pheromones in freshwater species will boost research on aquatic crustaceans. Interdisciplinary work between chemists (metabolomics), behavioral ecologists (bioassays), neurobiologists (chemoreception), and molecular biologists (genomics) promises to produce significant advances in our understanding of crustacean chemical communication during the coming decade.",We thank Iván A.

238,pub.1005156377,10.1007/s10152-010-0205-4,,,Species richness and diversity across rocky intertidal elevation gradients in Helgoland: testing predictions from an environmental stress model,"Environmental stress affects species richness and diversity in communities, but the precise form of the relationship is unclear. We tested an environmental stress model (ESM) that predicts a unimodal pattern for total richness and diversity in local communities across the full stress gradient where a regional biota can occur. In 2008, we measured richness and diversity (considering all macrobenthic species) across the entire intertidal range on three rocky shores on Helgoland Island, Germany. Intertidal elevation is known to be positively related to abiotic stress. Since Helgoland is between the northern and southern biogeographic boundaries for the cold-temperate NE Atlantic intertidal biota, it exhibits low stress levels for this biota at low elevations and high stress at high elevations because of long (>6 h) emersion times. Thus, we predicted a unimodal trend for richness and diversity across elevation. On all three shores, richness increased from high to middle elevations, but remained similar between middle and low elevations. Diversity followed the same trend on one shore and different trends (although also non-unimodal) on the other two. Evenness explained the trend differences between richness and diversity. Overall, our study yielded little support for the ESM. Reasons for richness and diversity not decreasing at low elevations may be related to influences of mostly subtidal species, Helgoland’s intertidal range, or sampling resolution. Our study also suggests that the ESM must be developed further to differentiate between richness and diversity. We offer recommendations to improve future ESM research using intertidal systems.","We thank Barry R. Taylor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on this study.

This framework is also used extensively in South Africa to provide a structure for educators and researchers that are interested in the relationships between bi- and/or multilingualism and academic success in schools. Cummins consistently describes the context (types of learners, educational and political system, language landscape) within which his theoretical framework is operational and is careful not to extrapolate findings and implications to other contexts. Despite this sensitive approach to context, the framework is extended to the higher-education context in South Africa regularly. The extension of this framework beyond its original context to the higher-education context in South Africa attests to the engagement of higher-education practitioners to understand the relationship between language (specifically medium of instruction) and academic success in South Africa, as well as to the ‘face validity’ of the framework. In this article, the appropriateness of applying the Cummins theoretical framework to the highereducation context in South Africa is evaluated.

237,pub.1029036568,10.1002/casp.1034,,,Researching the reintegration of formerly abducted children in northern Uganda through action research: Experiences and reflections,"Abstract This paper presents experiences and reflections on the use of a participatory research methodology under the difficult conditions of a war situation in northern Uganda. We draw from two complimentary approaches in action research to explain our methodology while doing research on the reintegration of formerly abducted children. First, the experience oriented approach, which emphasizes the need to articulate experience as a basis for learning and knowledge. Second, the exemplary participatory approach which highlights the importance of enhancing empowerment and the need to find solutions for social problems. We find these two approaches useful for doing action research in a conflict area because of their emphasis on experience and empowerment respectively. In our research, experience is important because of the children's encounter with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels that both needs to be understood and justifies reintegration. On the otherhand, empowerment is important for our assumption that the children's experience and encounter with the LRA has disempowering effects on them. We demonstrate the use of the approaches in our research by enhancing participation, balancing power relations and being aware of ethical issues while at the same time attempting to make the research valid inspite of the challenges.

236,pub.1040335576,10.1007/978-0-387-77101-4_10,,,Chemical Communication in Peracarid Crustaceans,"Chemical communication plays an important role during the life of peracarid crustaceans, where the two main taxa, the amphipods and isopods, have representatives in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. As in other crustaceans, the antennae bear the most important chemosensory structures, which are used for food-finding, predator detection and intraspecific interactions. The chemical nature of peracarid pheromones is unknown, but numerous experimental studies confirm that chemical signals can be soluble/volatile or contact pheromones. Waterborne chemicals mediate mate finding while contact pheromones are mainly involved in mate assessment. Males of some species appear capable to determine the reproductive status of females (closeness to the reproductive molt), which is possibly mediated by chemical compounds. Contrasting with this fine-tuned chemoreception in male–female interactions are other examples that suggest that reproductive isolation between closely related congeneric species is incomplete. The fact that males form precopulatory associations with heterospecific females indicates that chemicals mediating these interactions are not sufficiently specific to permit species discrimination. Gregarious behavior in many species is also guided by chemical cues that lead to aggregation on shared food sources or in communal shelters. Studies on kin recognition in mother–offspring groups have produced ambiguous results – in some species females appear unable to discriminate between their own and unrelated offspring, while females of other species recognize their own juveniles. The best example for kin recognition comes from desert isopods where family-specific chemical signatures allow parents to recognize their offspring. In summary, there is abundant experimental and observational evidence that numerous intra- and interspecific interactions in peracarids are mediated via chemical stimuli, but knowledge about the chemical structure of these compounds is still very limited. Given that all species have direct development and that many species can be easily cultured in the laboratory, peracarid crustaceans are proposed as ideal model organisms for studies aiming at the identification of the compounds used in chemical communication.","I am grateful to Iván A.

Mechanisms,"In Parts 1 and 2 of this series, which describe the results of a study of the dissolution of chalcopyrite under conditions that could be expected in a heap leaching process for primary copper minerals, it was shown that enhanced leaching of chalcopyrite from several copper concentrates in dilute acidic chloride solutions can be achieved by controlling the potential in a “window” of 560–600mV (SHE) in the presence of dissolved oxygen. It was also found that the rate is linear and essentially independent of the initial concentration of chloride and cupric ions under these conditions. Furthermore, the rate appears to be largely independent of the source of the mineral and is strongly dependent on the temperature (activation energy=72kJmol−1).In this part, additional kinetic data on the effects of fine pyrite on the rate complemented by detailed mineralogical analysis of the residues will be used to demonstrate that sulfur forms a soluble intermediate such as H2S in the dissolution reaction. A summary of the results of a detailed study of the kinetics of the copper ion catalysed oxidation of H2S by dissolved oxygen is presented which provides further support for a mechanism for the dissolution of chalcopyrite under heap leach conditions which involves an initial step involving non-oxidative dissolution to form H2S and either cupric ions or a covellite-like surface as the initial products.",AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from BHP Billiton and the Parker Centre.

236,pub.1051066532,10.1016/j.epsl.2010.06.020,,,Renewed uplift of the Central Andes Forearc revealed by coastal evolution during the Quaternary,"Most of the Pacific coast of the Central Andes, between 15°S and 30°S, display a wide (a couple of kilometres) planar feature, gently dipping oceanwards and backed by a cliff. This morphology, usually of marine origin, is called rasa, and argues for a recent and spatially continuous uplift of the margin over the 1500-km-long coastal region we describe. The cliff foot is found at a similar elevation (∼110m amsl) all over the studied area, with the exception of peninsulas such as the Mejillones Peninsula. The compilation of published chronological data and the extrapolation of re-appraised uplift rates provide evidence for a common cliff foot age of around 400ka (i.e., Marine Isotopic Stage MIS 11). This, together with other geological constraints, indicates a Quaternary renewal of uplift in the Central Andes Forearc after a late Pliocene quiescence or subsidence.","C.

We show that the econometric specification takes the form of an unconstrained spatial Durbin model, and we investigate whether the results depend on some methodological issues, such as the choice of the time span and the inclusion of fixed effects. To estimate the fixed effects spatial Solow–Swan model, we adjust the Arrelano and Bond (1991) generalized method‐of‐moments (GMM) estimator to deal with endogeneity not only arising from the initial income level, as in the basic model, but also from the initial income levels and economic growth rates observed in neighboring economies. 
El objetivo de este artículo es poner a prueba cuatro hipótesis particulares que abordan la cuestión de la importancia de la ubicación relativa de una economía y su efecto en el crecimiento y bienestar económico mediante el uso de una ampliación del modelo neoclásico de crecimiento de Solow‐Swan que incorpora dinámicas espacio‐temporales. El artículo muestra que la especificación econométrica toma la forma de un modelo Durbin espacial sin restricciones. Asimismo, los autores evalúan los resultados en términos del impacto de algunas cuestiones metodológicas, tales como la elección del lapso de tiempo y la inclusión de efectos fijos. Para estimar el modelo de efectos fijos espaciales Solow‐Swan, el método propuesto aquí ajusta el estimador de Arellano y Bond (1991) basado el método generalizado de momentos‐(GMM) para hacer frente a la endogeneidad provocada por el nivel de ingresos inicial (como lo hace modelo estándar), pero además para encarar la endogeneidad de los niveles iniciales de ingreso y tasas de crecimiento económico observados en las economías vecinas.

In order to evaluate the importance of floating macroalgae for population connectivity in southern Chile we analysed their spatial and temporal distributions. We estimated the abundance of floating kelp in the Interior Sea of Chiloé and the Los Chonos Archipelago via ship surveys conducted during austral spring (November) and winter (July) of the years 2002–2005. Highest densities of floating kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera and Durvillaea antarctica) were found during spring. Generally, the density of floating kelp was relatively low in areas with high supply of freshwater, and highest abundances were found in large channels opening to the open ocean. We suggest that this pattern is caused by the scarcity of natural kelp beds combined with rapid degradation of floating kelp in the interior fjords and by seaward surface outflow. The maximum densities of floating kelps were found in an area known to be an extensive convergence zone (i.e. estuarine front), which appears to act as a retention zone. In accordance with this distribution pattern, we propose that connectivity between local populations via floating kelp is higher in the outer channels with oceanic influence than in the inner fjords with high freshwater influx.","AcknowledgementsWe thank the crews and colleagues who accompanied us during the research cruises on board RV “AGOR Vidal Gormáz”.

Location The Pacific coast of South America, along the Chilean coast between 18° S and 56° S. Methods The LGR was evaluated using a dataset including 320 marine peracarid species reported for the coasts of Chile. Five ecological hypotheses invoking a relationship between species richness and present‐day conditions were tested: species–energy, species–area, Rapoport rescue effect, mid‐domain geometric constraint and niche breadth. Historical/evolutionary hypotheses (i.e. biogeographic conservatism, and diversification rates) were indirectly tested by analysing the latitudinal variation in the taxonomic distinctness, the taxonomic conservatism of the midpoint of the latitudinal range and the degree of nestedness at different taxonomic levels. Results Richness increased poleward, varying approximately eightfold, following an inverse LGR coupled with an increase in bathymetric distribution. Overall this inverse LGR seems robust to uncertainties in the completeness of the species inventory. We found support for only two of the five ecological hypotheses tested: species–area and Rapoport rescue effect. Historical/evolutionary hypotheses seemed important in structuring the richness pattern, as indicated by the higher taxonomic distinctness in the southern region, the strong taxonomic inertia in the mean range size and the high degree of nestedness of assemblages at different taxonomic levels. Conclusions When combined, these results underscore the importance of long‐term processes and historical/evolutionary explanations for the inverse LGR, conceptualized in what we term the ‘out of the deep south’ hypothesis that involves the effects of both biogeographic niche conservatism and evolutionary rates. We propose that the southern region may be a source of evolutionary novelties and/or exhibit higher diversification rates (i.e. higher speciation/lower extinction rates). Furthermore, phylogenetic conservatism of latitudinal range may limit the geographic expansion of these new taxa towards the depauperated northern region.","Information on chlorophyll‐a was kindly provided by Bernardo Broitman.

This transdisciplinary collaboration parallels the underpinning principle of Lave and Wenger's Legitimate Peripheral Participation (Lave & Wenger, 1990) to South Africa's post-colonial legitimation of alternative sites and enskilment canons. Central to both is legitimation of knowledge acquisition from communities of practice or sites and ‘knowers’ (Mphahlele, 1992) ‘outside formal institutions’ of teaching/learning. Considered and termed ‘informal’ and by deduction, less legitimate for meritorious enskilment, the South African Qualifications Authority (1995, 2002) decrees a transformative paradigm and method of validating these sites and their skills production. SAQA highlights the fact that the pedagogical approach of such sites is context- and learner-centred with demonstrable socially valuable skills. This post-colonial mandate thus centres the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) as an acknowledgement of multiple foci of skills production, decreeing their overdue certification, as in our case study of the Van Wyk situation. The approach confronts and deconstructs the colonial marginalisation of human capital from outside ‘formal’/official institutions. It is part of the ideological framework of redressing the race and class exclusion mechanisms of artisans and others from the landscape of skills possession. It subscribes therefore to the canon of different ‘ways of knowing’ (Mosala, 1998). Van Wyk's narrative exemplify the merits of ‘outside-institutions’ learning and enskilment to various levels of complexity. The objective of such legitimation is that certification provides credibility and legitimacy, thereby widening the marketability of apprentices' skills. The social recognition and accorded certification thereof carries uncontested confirmation of expertise.",,,Teaching and Teacher Education,,,,2010-01,2010,,2010-01,26,1,45-52,Closed,Article,"Alexander, G.; Van Wyk, M.M.; Bereng, T.; November, I.","Alexander, G.

In these systems, succession is predicted to be fast due to high growth rate of the later dominant colonizers. Using artificial hard substrata a field experiment was conducted in a rocky subtidal area off Northern Chile (Humboldt Current System) and monitored at 3‐month intervals to test the following hypotheses: (i) epibenthic succession may proceed through consecutive replacement of species, (ii) there is a fast convergence rate towards natural communities, and (iii) different seasonal starting points for the colonization will produce different community structure over a 1‐year period of exposure. Panels were installed on a vertical wall at 17 m water depth. Three replicate panels were sampled every 3 months over a period of 27 months. As a reference, six haphazardly selected plots from the surrounding natural community were surveyed at each sampling date. To evaluate how seasonally varying substratum availability affects community development, further panels were exposed for a 12‐month period, starting in four different seasons (n = 3 replicates per season). Community succession was slow and occurred through progressive changes, between early encrusting red corallines, middle Balanus flosculus and late Lagenicella variabilis. After 27 months, the community composition, but not its structure, was similar between experimental and reference communities on surrounding rocky bottoms. Seasonality had no effects and after 1 year of exposure the experimental communities converged towards a common structure.

Here we examine the applicability of the ACH in a marine system by testing whether physiological predictions are reflected in large‐scale variations of life‐history traits.   Location  The Chilean coast (18°–42° S), encompassing more than 2500 km along the Pacific coast of South America.   Methods  Five porcelain crab species ( Petrolisthes granulosus , Petrolisthes laevigatus, Petrolisthes tuberculatus , Petrolisthes violaceus and Allopetrolisthes angulosus ) were sampled on intertidal boulder beaches at 13 sampling sites. For each species and site we evaluated: (1) relative abundance (density), (2) maximum size, (3) size at maturity, (4) sex ratio, (5) proportion of ovigerous females, and (6) presence of recruits. The shape of the spatial distribution of each trait was evaluated statistically against the prediction of four hypothetical models (normal, ramped‐south, ramped‐north and abundant‐edge).   Results  The relative abundance and life‐history traits showed different spatial patterns among species. Relative abundance (across sites) was fitted by a normal model in only two species. No model fitted the spatial variation in body size and size at first maturity, which showed a slight but monotonic poleward increase in all species. Sex ratio showed a prominent hump‐shaped pattern, with females prevailing in the centre of the ranges and males dominating towards the range boundaries; this pattern was statistically significant in three of the five studied species. The proportion of ovigerous females showed no clear latitudinal trends, and mature individuals were observed across most of the geographical range of the species. However, recruits tended to be absent towards the southern (poleward) boundaries of the distribution.   Main conclusions  The ACH does not apply to all species equally. The link between abundance and life‐history traits is complex and variable among the porcelain crab species studied. Overall, the observed patterns were consistent with the idea that equatorward boundaries might be controlled by physiological restrictions mainly affecting adult survival, whereas poleward boundaries might be shaped by limitations in reproductive output and larval survival. Our results underline the importance of incorporating ecological, physiological and life‐history studies in future tests of the ACH.","We appreciate the logistical help provided by Catalina Correa during some of the field samplings, and the constructive comments from Bernardo Broitman, Esteban Emparanza and two anonymous referees.

Although this provision was not accorded a binding force, it reveals that genocide occurs within a wider political context in which states can take action to stop it or not. When the Rwandan genocide took place in 1994 the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was the supreme African body made up of more than 50 states. However, the OAU did not mobilise its members to send troops to stop the Rwandan genocide. This raises questions about the legality of the OAU then, and the inefficacy of its legal mechanism or instrument with which the Organisation could have used to enforce its decisions. The aim of this article is to critically investigate whether or not the OAU legal mechanism was best suited to help the OAU intervene in the Rwandan genocide. The article poses serious questions about the legal mechanism or instrument that the African Union (AU), which succeeded the OAU, has created to enforce its decisions especially in war-zone contexts. The article then ends by suggesting proposals and recommendations that the AU can adopt to strengthen its legal mechanism or create a new legal instrument that can be enforced by the African Court of Justice and the Peace and Security Council of the AU in anticipation of potential genocide occurring in other African states, other than that of Darfur in Sudan.",,,African Identities,,,,2010-11,2010,,2010-11,8,4,409-424,Closed,Article,"Budeli, Mpfariseni; Vambe, Beauty","Budeli, Mpfariseni (Department of Mercantile Law, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa); Vambe, Beauty (Department of Mercantile Law, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa)","Budeli, Mpfariseni (University of South Africa)","Budeli, Mpfariseni (University of South Africa); Vambe, Beauty (University of South Africa)",2,0,,1.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028091087,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The electronic Dicke effect, resulting from quasiresonant states of two side-coupled noninteracting quantum dots, is found to produce important effects on the Kondo resonance of the interacting dot. We study in detail the Kondo regime of the system by applying a numerical renormalization-group analysis to a finite-U multi-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian model. We find an extreme narrowing of the Kondo resonance, as the single-particle levels of the side dots are tuned toward the Fermi level and “squeeze” the Kondo resonance, accompanied by a strong drop in the Kondo temperature, due to the presence of a supertunneling state. Further, we show that the Kondo temperature vanishes in the limit of the Dicke effect of the structure. By analyzing the magnetic moment and entropy of the three-dot cluster versus temperature, we identify a different local singlet that competes with the Kondo state, resulting in the eventual suppression of the Kondo temperature and strongly affecting the spin correlations of the structure. We further show that system asymmetries in couplings, level structure or due to Coulomb interactions, result in interesting changes in the spectral function near the Fermi level. These strongly affect the Kondo temperature and the linear conductance of the system.","We thank helpful discussions with N. Sandler and G. B.

Determining the hydrologic characteristics of these flows is important for understanding the effects of rare yet significant storms in the region. Flow reconstruction, runoff analysis, and comparison with climatological data yield surface activation recurrence intervals of ∼1–20years for three small fans and their associated catchments proximal to Iquique and Antofagasta, Chile. Modeled discharges provide minimum constraints on the precipitation rates required to resurface fans in the hyper-arid region and suggest that relatively short-lived and intense precipitation events (1–3h, >4mmh−1) are capable of producing surface flows that mobilize and transport the largest grains found in channelized portions of the fan surface. The results of this study provide an indication of the ability of a particular storm event, i.e., precipitation rate, to activate a geomorphic surface and contribute to our understanding of the controls on surface evolution in hyper-arid environments.","AcknowledgementsFunding for field research was provided in part by the National Science Foundation and BP.

Several factors, such as the presence of different water masses, including the oxygen‐deficient Equatorial Sub‐surface Waters (ESSW) at the continental shelf and upper slope, and the Antarctic Intermediate Waters (AIW) at mid slope depths appear to control the bathymetric distribution of benthic communities. The presence of methane seeps and an extended oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) add complexity to the benthic distribution patterns observed. All these factors generate environmental heterogeneity, which is predicted to affect the diversity patterns both along and across the Chilean continental margin. The response to these factors differs among different faunal size groups: meio‐, macro‐, and megafauna. Physiological adaptations to oxygen deficiency and constraints related to body size of each group seem to explain the larger‐scale patterns observed, while sediment/habitat heterogeneity ( e.g. at water mass boundaries, hardgrounds, biogeochemical patchiness, sediment organic content, grain size) may influence the local fauna diversity patterns.","We thank the Census of Marine Life and affiliated field project COMARGE, in particular Drs Lisa Levin, Myriam Sibuet, Lenaick Menot, Craig Smith, Ann Vanreusel and Andrew Gooday, who organized the workshop ‘Roles of Habitat Heterogeneity in generating and maintaining Continental Margin Biodiversity’, held at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, CA, USA.

Here we analyze the food-web structure of a subtropical-temperate coastal lagoon using two approaches: stable isotopic techniques and mass-balance modelling, exploring also the correspondence between the outputs of both methods. We compared trophic positions (TPs) derived by these two approaches for 14 consumers in Laguna de Rocha (LR). TPs based on stable isotopes were taken from a recent study. ECOPATH trophic levels were estimated by a model presented here constructed based on field data for the period 2003–2006 and literature data. The model incorporated over 50 species in 27 trophic groups, including primary producers, invertebrate and vertebrate consumers. The origin and quality of data (pedigree routine) indicated that 68% of the information was locally bound, although several unknowns were detected. Birds and mammals represented the highest trophic levels (4.2 and 3.98, respectively). Network analysis estimated a size of the system (fluxes and biomasses) of 451twetweightkm−2 year−1, while transfer efficiency, primary production/respiration and production/biomass ratios, and several ecological indexes characterized LR as an underdeveloped system. TPs derived from isotopic analysis were highly correlated with trophic levels estimated by ECOPATH according to a linear regression model through the origin (r 2 =0.82, n =14, p ≪0.01). The slope of the linear model (0.88±0.019, estimate±SD) indicated that TPs derived from isotopic analyses were slightly higher (∼13.5% on average) than those derived from the mass-balance model. Current results support the overall consistency of the use of both stable isotopes and mass-balance modelling approaches as descriptors of this aquatic food-web.","Thanks to many colleagues and technicians that assisted in the field and during laboratory work, especially to F.

The EUROpean Near Earth Asteroid Research (EURONEAR) is a network which envisions to bring some European contributions into the general context traced by the Spaceguard Foundation which was carried out during the last 15 years mainly by the US with some modest European and amateur contributions. Aims. The number of known near Earth asteroids (NEAs) and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) has increased tremendously, mainly thanks to five major surveys all focused on the discovery of new bodies. But also other facilities are required to follow-up and improvement the orbital parameters and to study the physical properties of the known bodies. These goals are better achieved by a co-ordinated network such as EURONEAR. Methods. Astrometry is mandatory in order to acquire the positional information necessary to define and improve orbits of NEAs and PHAs and to study their trajectories through the solar system, especially in the vicinity of Earth. Photometry is required to derive some physical information about NEAs and PHAs. In order to achieve these objectives, the main method of research of the EURONEAR is the follow-up programme of objects selected by a few criteria, carried out mostly at 1 m-class telescopes endowed with medium and large field cameras. Results. 162 NEAs summing more than 1500 individual positions were observed for a total time of 55 nights in both visiting mode and regular runs using nine telescopes located in four countries. The observations were reduced promptly and reported to the Minor Planet Centre (MPC) which validated and included them in the MPC and NEODyS databases following the improvement of their orbital elements. For one binary NEA we acquired photometry and were able to determine its orbital and rotational periods. Complementary to the follow-up work, as many as 500 unknown moving objects consistent with new Main Belt asteroids and one possible NEA were discovered in the analyzed fields. Conclusions. Our positions present 1 precision with an accuracy of 0.2–0.4, sufficient for achieving our immediate main goals. The observations and data reduction were conducted by our network members, which included some students and amateurs supervised by professional astronomers. In most cases, we increased the observational arcs decreasing the uncertainties in the orbits, while in some cases the new positions allowed us to recover some bodies endangered to be lost, defining their orbits.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2010-02,2010,2010-03-04,2010-02,511,,a40,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Birlan, M.; Vaduvescu, O.; Tudorica, A.; Sonka, A.; Nedelcu, A.; Galad, A.; Colas, F.; N., F.

The behavior of variables at a local level was analysed, and some of them were found to present significant spatial variability. This represents an improvement on the understanding offered by global analysis as, rather than producing an average coefficient for the entire territory, the technique yields an estimated coefficient for each location analysed; in other words, the type of relationship that exists in each portion of the territory is ascertained, and not only a general overview. This method reveals aspects of the relationships which do not emerge when using traditional global specifications, such as sign change in some of the parameter estimates.","AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the Dirección General de Investigación de Ordenamiento Ecológico y Conservación de los Ecosistemas del Instituto Nacional de Ecología de México (INE) for providing the digitalized cartographic information on which the present study is based.

The resulting framework appears to be a suitable generalization of the methodology associated with the so-called dynamical ensemble, which is applied to the extension of two well-known Monte Carlo methods: the Metropolis importance sampling and the Swendsen–Wang cluster algorithm. These Monte Carlo algorithms are employed to study the anomalous thermodynamic behavior of the Potts models with many spin states q defined on a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions, which successfully reduce the exponential divergence of the decorrelation time τ with increase of the system size N to a weak power-law divergence with α≈0.2 for the particular case of the 2D ten-state Potts model.",,,Journal of Statistical Mechanics Theory and Experiment,,,,2010-02-01,2010,2010-02-05,2010-02-01,2010,02,p02002,All OA; Green,Article,"Velazquez, L; Curilef, S","Velazquez, L (Departamento de Física, Universidad de Pinar del Río, Martí 270, Esq. 27 de Noviembre, Pinar del Río, Cuba; Departamento de Física, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

It is argued that multilingualism in India, as in other South Asian countries, is hierarchical in nature, characterized by a double divide — one between the elitist language of power and the major regional languages (vernaculars) and, the other, between the regional languages and the dominated ones. The nature and implications of this double divide are analyzed in respect of the relative positions of English, Hindi, regional majority languages and other indigenous/minority languages. The paper shows that, at the same time as hierarchical multilingualism has led to a general loss of linguistic diversity, the progressive domain shrinkage and the marginalization of the surviving indigenous and minority languages affect the dynamics of the relationship between languages and linguistic groups in contact and negotiation of linguistic identities. The chasm between policy and practice affecting the place of languages in society, it is argued, leads to educational failure, capability deprivation and poverty in the minority linguistic groups, particularly the tribal mother tongue speakers. Programs of multilingual education are briefly discussed in the context of recent attempts to deal with classroom language disadvantage of tribal children in India.",,,International Journal of the Sociology of Language,,,,2010-09-01,2010,2010-10-05,2010-09-01,2010,205,131-154,Closed,Article,"Mohanty, Ajit K.","Mohanty, Ajit K.

We find that some of the positive correlation found in empirical studies is due to the fact that oil is in the consumption basket; however, this accounts only for a minor part of it. There exist other important sources of correlation related to monetary shocks and output shocks. In particular, we find that the correlation is extremely sensitive to the reaction of the central bank to output shocks, while the reaction to inflation changes is less significant. We estimate our model using maximum likelihood with the following data sets: crude oil futures prices, nominal interest rates, inflation rates and money supply growth rates. Our estimates suggest that the monetary authority overreacts to output shocks by increasing the money supply in a more than necessary amount, generating a significant source of positive correlation. From a practical perspective, We find that it is a good strategy to use as a hedge, the futures whose maturity is closer to the hedging horizon. This is particularly true for short-term hedging.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank Gonzalo Cortazar, Raimundo Soto and an anonymous referee for their helpful comments.

This loss was accompanied by the dissipation of the magnetic field and rapid climate change as evidenced by the geological record. Assuming life evolved in aquatic niches such as lakes and ponds during the early part of the Martian history, the Noachian/Hesperian transition was a period of increased environmental stress that ended with the loss of surface liquid water. Their physical environment included high-daily amplitude, low average temperatures, thin atmosphere, high solar irradiance, ice, reduced yearly precipitation, enhanced evaporation, and volcanic and hydrothermal environment. The monitoring of the Licancabur lake used a synergetic approach including geophysical, climatologic, limnologic, and biological techniques. The environment was investigated with survey stations, including meteorological dataloggers and UV dosimeters. HLP maintained two main stations: one on the shore of the lake at 5916 m and one at the base of the volcano (4340 m) to characterize the influence of altitude on environmental factors. With discrepancies inherent to the study of terrestrial analogs, i.e., the presence of zooplankton, the overall environmental analogy of Licancabur with Mars at the Noachian/Hesperian transition period makes this Andean lake a unique analog to early Martian lakes and a window into the likely transformation they experienced during the transition period from a wetter to a drier Mars. From a climate standpoint, the demonstrated interannual variability in water input, related water level fluctuations, and the resulting changes in physicochemical properties of the water column of the lake show that the decline was unlikely to be monotonical over time on Mars, and therefore probably challenging for putative life to adapt to.","AcknowledgmentThe authors thank SERNAP and the Direction and Park Rangers of the Reserva Eduardo Avaroa in Bolivia, the Universidad Catolica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile, and NASA Ames EERRB for their support to this project.

While afloat, these algae are potentially exposed to full solar radiation, including UVA and UVB, which can have profound effects on their physiological and growth performance. Latitudinal variations in UV-radiation (UVR) are hypothesized to affect floating algae differently with higher impacts at low latitudes than at high latitudes. In addition, UVR together with grazing might accelerate the demise of floating kelps. This hypothesis was tested with outdoor laboratory experiments in which sporophytes of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh were exposed to a combination of different UVR regimes (PAR only, PAR + UV) and grazing at three sites along the Chilean coast (20°S, 30°S, and 40°S). A latitudinal trend in irradiance was detected with increasing values from 40°S to 20°S. Surprisingly, floating M. pyrifera responded with a high acclimation potential within this latitudinal UVR gradient. At 20°S, floating kelps were slightly sensitive to UVR, which was reflected in reduced blade growth. At 30°S, physiological responses were hardly affected by the prevailing irradiance but sporophyte growth and thus persistence mainly depended on the presence or absence of amphipod grazers. At high latitudes, grazing had only minor impacts on algal biomass and blade growth, and kelps thrived well under all tested environmental conditions. Overall, our results reveal that floating M. pyrifera was only slightly affected by UVR and that sporophytes can efficiently acclimate over a latitudinal UVR gradient that spans from 20°S to 40°S. Given this high acclimation potential, we suggest that these (and possibly other) positively buoyant algae are important dispersal agents over a wide range of temperate latitude conditions.","Financial support for this research was provided by FONDECYT 1060127 to MT, FT and IG.

202,pub.1000589500,10.1016/j.cose.2010.03.004,,,A framework for security assurance of access control enforcement code,"Modeling of access control policies, along with their implementation in code, must be an integral part of the software development process, to ensure that the proper level of security in an application is attained. Previous work of the authors in this area yielded a framework that incorporates access control at the design and code levels, through a set of new extensions to UML and a set of approaches to enfoce access control in an application (Pavlich-Mariscal et al., 2010). An essential property of the code that has not been addressed by that framework is security assurance, which, in the context of this research, is to insure that the application code behaves consistently with the access control policy. This paper proposes a security assurance mechanism that formalizes the application behavior using labeled transition systems and structural operational semantics (Plotkin, 1981). Simulation relations (Milner, 1971) are used to demonstrate the correctness of the access control code with respect to the design. To validate the approach, this paper proves correctness of two access control enforcement mechanisms that are part of our case study: a basic approach to implement access control in code and an aspect-oriented approach.",,,Computers & Security,,,,2010-10,2010,,2010-10,29,7,770-784,Closed,Article,"Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.; Demurjian, Steven A.; Michel, Laurent D.","Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.

The galaxy images were obtained at five different facilities between 2004 and 2006. The image reductions and surface photometry have been performed using methods specifically designed for isolating faint galaxies from the high and varying near-infrared sky level. Fifty-four of the 80 dIs have surface brightness profiles which could be fit to a hyperbolic-secant (sech) function, while the remaining profiles could be fit to the sum of a sech and a Gaussian function. From these fits, we have measured central surface brightnesses, scale lengths, and integrated magnitudes. This survey is part of a larger study of the connection between large-scale structure and the global properties of dIs, the hypothesized building-blocks of more massive galaxies.","R.L.F. and M.L.M. gratefully acknowledge the continuing support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

201,pub.1011734223,10.1029/2008jg000836,,,Prokaryotic diversity pattern in high‐altitude ecosystems of the Chilean Altiplano,"The Chilean Altiplano is the westernmost part of a large volcanic‐sedimentary plateau in the central Andes. High solar irradiance and rapid increase of temperature have contributed to make it a hot spot of global climatic change. In this study, we describe microbial diversity in the summit lake of the Simba volcano (5,870 m) and the evaporitic basins of Salar de Aguas Calientes (4,200 m) and Laguna Lejía (4,325 m) using both culture and culture‐independent methods. The results obtained were analyzed together with available information from related environments to describe the traits of the microbial community driven by main environmental factors. Isolated cultures exhibit high resistance to all three types of UV radiation, further supporting the adaptation of microorganisms to the high altitude environment. The microbial community structures at Salar de Aguas Calientes and Laguna Lejía are similar to those from other saline systems and cold environments where Bacteroidetes is the major bacterial group. The abundance of sequences related to alphaproteobacteria and methanogenic populations likely reflects the importance of aerobic anoxigenic phothosynthesis and the cycling of one‐carbon compounds in the high altitude lake ecosystems. Geochemistry and microbial communities at Simba as well as those reported in the Licancabur summit lake provide evidence for sulfur‐rich environments but under different conditions. Those differences between neighboring mountain lake ecosystems highlight the effect of volcanic activity on microbial communities. The hypothetical ecosystem model described in this work provides a clue to follow the microbial community responses to geophysical environment coupled with rapid climate change.","This work was supported by the grant NNA04CC05A through the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI/SETI), by the project ESO‐AUI 1632 to Cecilia Demergasso and by the grant Programa Bicentenario de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONICYT, IPC‐81 to Daniela Meneses.

The amount of molecular gas is a key to understanding the future star formation in a galaxy. Because H2 is difficult to observe directly in dense and cold clouds, tracers such as the CO molecule are used. However, at low metallicities especially, CO only traces the shielded interiors of the clouds. In this context, millimeter dust emission can be used as a tracer to unveil the total dense gas masses. However, the comparison of masses deduced from the continuum SIMBA 1.2 mm emission and virial masses (understood to trace the entire potential of the clouds) in a sample of giant molecular clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by previous studies found a discrepancy between these two quantities that requires explanation. Aims. We attempt to more accurately assess possible uncertainties in the dust emission observed in the sample of giant molecular clouds from the SMC. We focus on the mass comparison in the densest parts of the giant molecular clouds where CO is detected to confirm the mass discrepancy previously observed. Methods. New observations of the southwest region of the SMC were obtained with the LABOCA camera on the APEX telescope. All the giant molecular clouds previously observed in CO are detected and their emission at 870 μm is compared to ancillary data. The different contributions to the sub-millimeter emission are estimated, as well as dust properties (temperatures, emissivities), to determine molecular cloud masses precisely. Results. The (sub-)millimeter emission observed in the giant molecular clouds in the southwest region of the SMC is dominated by dust emission, and masses are deduced for the part of each cloud where CO is detected and compared to the virial masses. The mass discrepancy between both methods is confirmed at 870 μm using the LABOCA observations: the virial masses are on average 4 times lower than the masses of dense gas inferred from dust emission, in contrast to what is observed for equivalent clouds in our Galaxy. Conclusions. At present, the origin of this mass discrepancy in the SMC remains unknown. The direct interpretation of this effect is that the CO linewidth used to compute virial masses do not measure the full velocity distribution of the gas. Geometrical effects and uncertainties in the dust properties are also discussed.","M.R. wishes to acknowledge support from FONDECYT grant No. 1080335.

201,pub.1025154718,10.1080/02589001.2010.512739,,,Between elite protectionism and popular resistance: The political economy of Nigeria's fractured state since juridical independence,"This piece attempts a new reading of the political economy of the Nigerian state within the context of the epoch-making British colonialism, the spin-off effects of structural imperialism and the stranglehold of an increasingly desperate transnational capital. The principal argument is that whilst these structures do not explain everything – to the extent that the Nigerian ruling elite has played a key agential role in the country's underdevelopment – they tend to create the conditions for the largely amoral and anti-people politics and policy of the fractious ruling elite. Programmed to implode by colonialism with all the booby traps of a lopsided federal system and a mono-cultural economy (that a largely venal and rickety oil economy has all but entrenched) and the scenarios of failure constituted by primordial cleavages, the resultant elite protectionism in its multiple manifestations hides the saliency of class struggle. In addition, the artificial postcolonial state – with no cultural resonance on the ground, but representing, with political power, the primary means of class relations and reproduction – has been cynically exploited by the ruling elite and transnational capital. Popular resistance to the current gridlock will succeed only insofar as the dominated classes radicalise the struggle for popular democracy and for the construction of an autochthonous Nigerian state through class struggle.",,,Journal of Contemporary African Studies,,,,2010-10,2010,,2010-10,28,4,423-442,Closed,Article,"Amuwo, Adekunle","Amuwo, Adekunle (School of Politics, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa)","Amuwo, Adekunle (University of KwaZulu-Natal)","Amuwo, Adekunle (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",6,2,,7.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025154718,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

The region between Antofagasta and Arica is characterized by four types of Late Cenozoic structures: EW-striking reverse faults; ~NS-striking normal faults; sparse WNW and NNW-striking right-lateral strike–slip faults; and unimodal and bimodal populations of surface cracks. The EW reverse faults occur only between 19° and 21°40' S latitude and have been active since at least 6 Ma to present. A March 2007 earthquake demonstrates that this deformation can occur during the interseismic phase of the plate boundary seismic cycle. The NS-normal faults are most abundant near Antofagasta and Mejillones and diminish in significance northward. Several of these faults, in both the Antofagasta and the Salar Grande area, have been reactivated as reverse faults causing minor topographic inversion. We suggest that normal faults move during both interseismic and coseismic deformation and are fundamentally very weak. Surface cracks are ubiquitous throughout the region and form by both non-tectonic and tectonic mechanisms. A significant proportion forms during coseismic deformation and thus may be used to identify long-lived rupture segments on the plate boundary. Overall, forearc deformation is very slow, with permanent strain rates of 1–5 nstrain/year and fault slip rates less than 0.5 mm/year.","AcknowledgmentsWe are indebted to numerous colleagues and students who, over the last decade, have shared their knowledge of the Coastal Cordillera, as well as, more often then not, their good humor in the field.

An important goal within the quest for detecting an Earth-like extrasolar planet, will be to identify atmospheric gaseous bio-signatures. Aims. Observations of the light transmitted through the Earth’s atmosphere, as for an extrasolar planet, will be the first important step for future comparisons. We have completed observations of the Earth during a lunar eclipse, a unique situation similar to that of a transiting planet. We aim at showing what species could be detected in its atmosphere at optical wavelengths, where a lot of photons are available in the masked stellar light. Methods. We present observations of the 2008 August 16 Moon eclipse performed with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France). Locating the spectrograph’s fibers in the penumbra of the eclipse, the Moon irradiance is then a mix of direct, unabsorbed Sun light and solar light that has passed through the Earth’s atmosphere. This mixture essentially reproduces what is recorded during the transit of an extrasolar planet. Results. We report here the clear detection of several Earth atmospheric compounds in the transmission spectra, such as ozone, molecular oxygen, and neutral sodium as well as molecular nitrogen and oxygen through the Rayleigh signature. Moreover, we present a method that allows us to derive the thickness of the atmosphere versus the wavelength for penumbra eclipse observations. We quantitatively evaluate the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes transparent for important species like molecular oxygen and ozone, two species thought to be tightly linked to the presence of life. Conclusions. The molecular detections presented here are an encouraging first attempt, necessary to better prepare for the future of extremely-large telescopes and transiting Earth-like planets. Instruments like SOPHIE will be mandatory when characterizing the atmospheres of transiting Earth-like planets from the ground and searching for bio-marker signatures.","The authors thank the staff of Haute-Provence Observatory for their contribution to the success of the SOPHIE project and their support at the 1.93-m telescope.

194,pub.1026011633,10.1029/2009tc002465,,,Normal and reverse faulting driven by the subduction zone earthquake cycle in the northern Chilean fore arc,"Despite its location in a convergent tectonic setting, the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile between 21°S and 25°S is dominated by structures demonstrating extension in the direction of plate convergence. In some locations, however, normal faults have been reactivated as reverse faults, complicating the interpretation of long‐term strain. In order to place these new observations in a tectonic context, we model stress changes induced on these faults by the subduction earthquake cycle. Our simulations predict that interseismic locking on the plate boundary encourages normal slip on fore‐arc faults, which may result from elastic rebound due to interplate earthquakes or from seismic or aseismic motion that takes place within the interseismic period. Conversely, stress generated by strong subduction zone earthquakes, such as the 1995 Mw = 8.1 Antofagasta event, provides a mechanism for the reverse reactivation we document here. Upper plate fault slip in response to the low‐magnitude stress changes induced by the subduction earthquake cycle suggests that the absolute level of stress on these faults is very low. Furthermore, seismic hazard analysis for northern Chile requires consideration of not only the plate boundary earthquake cycle but also the cycle on fore‐arc faults that may or may not coincide with the interplate pattern. Though the relationships between permanent strain and deformation calculated using elastic models remain unclear, the compatibility of modeled stress fields with the distribution of fore‐arc faulting suggests that interseismic strain accumulation and coseismic deformation on the subduction megathrust both play significant roles in shaping structural behavior in the upper plate.","We thank associate editor Paul Kapp, Michele Cooke, and an anonymous referee for detailed, thoughtful reviews that improved the manuscript.

The present paper gives a summary of all 14 chiton species reported from Chilean deep (bathyal to abyssal) waters, including some records that might be considered as doubtful. Leptochiton laurae n. sp. is formally established; it was formerly misidentified as L. americanus Kaas & Van Belle, 1985, but differs in the shape of the tail valve, less coarse sculpturing, in the girdle elements and radula armature. Two additional new species, Leptochiton sp. and Placiphorella sp., are discussed. For Leptochiton medinae Plate, 1899, a lectotype is designated. Tripoplax balaenophila (Schwabe & Sellanes, 2004) n. comb. is transferred from Lepidozona Pilsbry, 1892, due to coarse sculpturing in the central areas and multi-slit insertion plates. Leptochiton belknapi Dall, 1878 and Tripoplax cowani Clark, 2008 are reported from the study region for the first time. The majority of the Chilean deep-water polyplacophorans are associated with hard substrates (authigenic carbonates) near methane seeps. The present report raises the global number of chiton species inhabiting chemosynthetic environments from 10 to 18, including some overlooked literature records from other regions.","The authors are deeply indebted to the captains and crews of R/Vs Kay Kay, Sonne and Vidal Górmaz, as well as to scientific staff participating in these expeditions, for their support at sea.

Nanocomposite gels are poised to revolutionize this field in both improved handling characteristics and improved separations. Gel morphology and charge effects have traditionally been manipulated by varying the copolymer composition, but recent reports show that novel morphological changes can also be induced in the gel using templating methods and nanoparticle addition. To aid realization of the potential for novel electrically driven separations arising from such novel morphologies, we review here advances in materials development alongside a review of the directions in biomolecule/hydrogel electrophoretic transport modeling. Models for polyelectrolyte transport that are potentially useful for understanding novel behaviors caused by gel morphology are analyzed first. With the perspective of theoretical guidance, we then survey nanocomposite hydrogel morphologies keyed by the nanoparticle and matrix. Finally, we survey as well reports of dramatic improvements in the mechanical properties that may be the key to the early adoption of these new materials in biomolecular separation applications. For modeling, we have identified the different scales involved in biomolecular transport in these materials and provided a taxonomy of transport models that emphasize the role of gel morphology in determining both polyelectrolyte mobility and diffusion. Three aspects for future work unique to nanocomposite gel materials are described: (a) descriptions of the distribution of nanoparticles within the gels; (b) descriptions of the motion of the buffer solution that may include electroosmotic effects for nanoparticles with surface charges; (c) descriptions of the motion of the polyelectrolyte molecule inside the new gel material for a given application. These aspects will help to uncover further quantitative details about the ability of these gels to be tunable for differential mass transport of a given type of molecule. Standard gels, currently, lack a broad flexibility to increase the separation of biomolecules and, in general, are not tunable.","We are grateful for numerous discussions with doctoral students Jennifer A.

The distinction between theology and the history of religion became increasingly vague. The article focuses on the contribution of Rainier Albertz in his two-volume Religionsgeschichte Israels in alttestamentlicher Zeit ( History of Israelite religion in the Old Testament period ), 1992. Albertz proposed that the history of religion should be restored to serve as the ‘more sensible discipline for abridging the Old Testament’. This article points out several advantages to this approach, namely a different kind of Old Testament theology, starting from current theological problems and searching through the thematic segments of Israel’s religious history and that of early Christianity for analogous insights relevant to the problems in question. This article develops the argument that Albertz’s suggestions open up possibilities for establishing a vibrant theological environment in South Africa, where theologians from a diverse society can start from different perspectives on current problems, consider the Bible as part of a uniquely defined set of relevant factors and present a kaleidoscope of cross-balancing ‘African’ theological perspectives. The aim of this approach is to enhance the possibilities of Albertz’s suggestions by relating them, in context, to insights from ethical theology in the hope of reviving the debate regarding repositioning the history of religion in a different kind of theological approach. This debate is long in coming: it may already have lost close to 20 years in deserved attention.",,,HTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies,,,,2010-02-19,2010,2010-02-19,,66,1,12,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vorster, Jan H.","Vorster, Jan H.

169,pub.1003284895,10.1111/j.1439-0485.2009.00348.x,,,Habitat heterogeneity and its influence on benthic biodiversity in oxygen minimum zones,"Abstract  Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs; midwater regions with O 2 concentrations <0.5 ml l −1 ) are mid‐water features that intercept continental margins at bathyal depths (100–1000 m). They are particularly well developed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Based on analyses of data from these regions, we consider (i) how benthic habitat heterogeneity is manifested within OMZs, (ii) which aspects of this heterogeneity exert the greatest influence on alpha and beta diversity within particular OMZs and (iii) how heterogeneity associated with OMZs influences regional (gamma) diversity on continental margins. Sources of sea‐floor habitat heterogeneity within OMZs include bottom‐water oxygen and sulphide gradients, substratum characteristics, bacterial mats, and variations in the organic matter content of the sediment and pH. On some margins, hard grounds, formed of phosphorites, carbonates or biotic substrata, represent distinct subhabitats colonized by encrusting faunas. Most of the heterogeneity associated with OMZs, however, is created by strong sea‐floor oxygen gradients, reinforced by changes in sediment characteristics and organic matter content. For the Pakistan margin, combining these parameters revealed clear environmental and faunal differences between the OMZ core and the upper and lower boundary regions. In all Pacific and Arabian Sea OMZs examined, oxygen appears to be the master driver of alpha and beta diversity in all benthic faunal groups for which data exist, as well as macrofaunal assemblage composition, particularly in the OMZ core. However, other factors, notably organic matter quantity and quality and sediment characteristics, come into play as oxygen concentrations begin to rise. The influence of OMZs on meiofaunal, macrofaunal and megafaunal regional (gamma) diversity is difficult to assess. Hypoxia is associated with a reduction in species richness in all benthic faunal groups, but there is also evidence for endemism in OMZ settings. We conclude that, on balance, OMZs probably enhance regional diversity, particularly in taxa such as Foraminifera, which are more tolerant of hypoxia than others. Over evolutionary timescales, they may promote speciation by creating strong gradients in selective pressures and barriers to gene flow.","We are grateful to Drs Gordon Paterson, Kate Larkin, Sarah Murty, Stefanie Schumacher and Peter Lamont for making their raw data from the NE Atlantic and Arabian Sea available for analysis.

The chemical facies of the thermal discharges vary from Na+–Cl− (El Tatio, Puchuldiza-Tuja and part of Surire where SO42−-rich waters also occur) to Na+(Ca2+)–Cl−(SO42−) (Pampa Lirima), Ca2+–SO42−(HCO3−) (Torta de Tocorpuri) and Ca2+–SO42− (Pampa Apacheta). The gas seeps are characterized by the dominance of CO2, H2S and CH4 with N2/Ar ratios that occasionally are up to 450. Significant amounts of SO2 and HCl are present at Pampa Apacheta. Water and gas geothermometry suggests that El Tatio and Puchuldiza-Tuja fluid reservoirs have relatively high reservoir equilibrium temperature (up to 270°C). Gases from Pampa Apacheta apparently equilibrated at unusually high temperature for hydrothermal fluids (up to 350°C), being likely related to an active magmatic system, as testified by the presence of highly acidic gas compounds such as SO2 and HCl. On the contrary, low equilibrium temperatures were calculated for the Surire fluids (<200°C), suggesting interactions of deep-originated fluids with meteoric water at shallow depth. Shallow, low temperature aquifers mask any signal of deep fluids in the Pampa Lirima and Torta de Tocorcupi thermal discharges. Despite the variations in temperatures, He isotopic compositions and redox conditions of the fluid reservoirs consistently indicate a significant contribution from magmatic degassing. Although geophysical studies are necessary to better constrain the geothermal potential of northern Chile, the geothermometric estimations carried out in the present study indicate that El Tatio, Pampa Apacheta, Surire and Puchuldiza-Tuja can be regarded as the most promising areas and deserve more detailed geological investigations.","AcknowledgementsThis research was partially financed by Dirección General de Investigación y Postgrado (UCN-Chile) and by D-21050592 and 23080036 CONICYT grant (Government of Chile) and the Laboratories of Fluid and Rock Geochemistry of the Department of Earth Sciences and CNR-IGG of Florence (Resp.

We detect a large (∼250 s) departure from linearity in the eclipse times of QS Vir which Applegate's mechanism fails to reproduce by an order of magnitude. The only mechanism able to drive this period change is a third body in a highly elliptical orbit. However, the planetary/sub‐stellar companion previously suggested to exist in this system is ruled out by our data. Our eclipse times show that the period decrease detected in NN Ser is continuing, with magnetic braking or a third body the only mechanisms able to explain this change. The planetary/sub‐stellar companion previously suggested to exist in NN Ser is also ruled out by our data. Our precise eclipse times also lead to improved ephemerides for DE CVn and GK Vir. The width of a primary eclipse is directly related to the size of the secondary star and variations in the size of this star could be an indication of Applegate's mechanism or Wilson (starspot) depressions which can cause jitter in the O−C curves. We measure the width of primary eclipses for the systems NN Ser and GK Vir over several years but find no definitive variations in the radii of the secondary stars. However, our data are precise enough (ΔRsec/Rsec < 10−5) to show the effects of Applegate's mechanism in the future. We find no evidence of Wilson depressions in either system. We also find tentative indications that flaring rates of the secondary stars depend on their mass rather than rotation rates.","TRM, CMC and BTG acknowledge support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) grant number ST/F002599/1.

El objetivo central de este estudio es establecer los controles tectnico-climticos en la configuracin del relieve del borde costero del norte de Chile. La metodologa utilizada consiste bsicamente en un estudio detallado del relieve mediante ndices geomorfolgicos cuantitativos tales como grado de incisin, curvas e integrales hipsomtricas, perfiles de thalweg e ndice de sinuosidad. Estos ndices se aplicaron a modelos de elevacin digitales e imgenes satelitales. Los resultados ms relevantes muestran que el relieve de la vertiente occidental de la Cordillera de la Costa exhibe creciente incremento de la intensidad de la erosin al aumentar la latitud. Este incremento no es uniforme; procesos relacionados con la tectnica como subsidencia/alzamiento litoral y actividad de fallas, y por otra parte la erosin de la paleotopografa de la Cordillera de la Costa debido a los procesos ligados a la construccin del Acantilado Costero y el aumento de la precipitacin, afectan la morfologa del relieve del borde costero del norte de Chile. La existencia y excelente preservacin del Acantilado Costero resulta de un marcado desequilibrio entre las tasas de alzamiento y las tasas de erosin, cuya diferencia es de una a dos rdenes de magnitud, controlada por el marco climtico de hiperaridez extrema del Desierto de Atacama que se ha mantenido por lo menos desde los ltimos 2 Ma. Las variaciones en la intensidad de la erosin desde el norte hacia el sur se interpretan como resultado del incremento en la tasa de precipitacin en un orden de magnitud en esa misma direccin. This work analyzes the morphological features of the western margin of the northern Chile Coastal Cordillera, character-ized by the presence of a major Coastal Cliff The main purpose of this research is to better understand the tectonic and climatic controls on the topography. The methodology used consists basically of a detailed study of the topography with quantitative geomorphic indexes such as incisin grade, hypsometric curves and integris, thalweg profiles and sinuosity index. These are applied to digital elevation models and satellite images. The main results show that the topography of the western margin of the Coastal Cordillera, exhibits an increasing intensity of the erosin with latitude. This increment is non uniform. The tectonic processes that produced coastal subsidence/uplift and fault activity, and the erosin of the paleotopography of Coastal Cordillera due to processes related with the construction of the Coastal Cliff and increasing rainfall, modify the morphology of the coastal border of northern Chile. The existence and conservation of the Coastal Cliff results from the existance of non-equilibrium between the uplift and erosin rates. Both rates have one-two order magnitude difference, controlled by the extreme hyperarid climate of the Atacama Desert. These conditions prevailed at least for the last 2 m.yrs. The variations in the intensity of the erosin from north to south are interpreted as the result of the southward increase in precipitacin by one order of magnitude.",,,Andean Geology,,,,2010-01,2010,2010-01,,37,1,78-109,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quezada, Jorge; Cerda, Jos Luis; Jensen, Arturo","Quezada, Jorge (Universidad de Concepcin Departamento de Ciencias de la Tierra, Concepcin, Chile; Universidad Catlica del Norte Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias, mencin Geologa, Antofagasta, Chile); Cerda, Jos Luis (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Ciencias Geolgicas, Antofagasta, Chile); Jensen, Arturo (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Ciencias Geolgicas, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Quezada, Jorge (University of Concepción; Catholic University of the North); Cerda, Jos Luis (Catholic University of the North); Jensen, Arturo (Catholic University of the North)",14,2,,1.51,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/andgeol/v37n1/art04.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072197838,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology,

Among all of the security concerns (e.g. authentication, auditing, access control, confidentiality, etc.), this paper addresses the incorporation of access control into software. The approach is to separate access control concerns from the rest of the design. To assist designers to visualize access control policies separated from non-security concerns, this paper proposes a set of access control diagrams, i.e., extensions to the UML to represent three main access control models: role-based access control (RBAC), mandatory access control (MAC), and discretionary access control (DAC). To better adapt to changing requirements, and assist designers to customize access control policies, this paper proposes a set of access control features, i.e., small components that realize specific capabilities of access control models. Designers can select the features they require, and compose them to yield different access control policies. When transitioning into code, the main focus is to preserve separation of access control concerns. This paper describes an approach to realize access control diagrams and features in code through structure-preserving mappings, describes three different approaches to enforce access control in code, and evaluates the way each of them separate access control from other concerns.",,,Computers & Security,,,,2010-05,2010,,2010-05,29,3,350-379,Closed,Article,"Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.; Demurjian, Steven A.; Michel, Laurent D.","Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.

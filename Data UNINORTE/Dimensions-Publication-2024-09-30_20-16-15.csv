The JRA subsets were distinguished on the basis of criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology. Two alleles were associated with protection, HLA-DRB1*1501 (p = 0.002) and HLA-DRB1*1402 (p = 0.01). HLA-DRB1*1602 (p = 0.0000002) was associated with susceptibility for systemic JRA and HLA-DRB1*1104 (p = 0.0002) for pauciarticular JRA. Amino acid sequences at residues 70-74 of DRB1 chain shared by HLA-DRB1 alleles (shared epitomes) were also informative. The polyarticular JRA subset revealed association with (70)QRRAA(74), which includes HLA-DRB1*04, 01, and (70)DRRAA(74), which includes DRB1*1601, 1602, 1101, and 1104. Two new findings of interest were the association of the haplotypes DRB1*1104, DQB1*0301(p = 0.0002) with pauciarticular JRA and DRB1*1602, DQB1*0301 (p = 0.0000002) association with systemic JRA. The DRB1 alleles of these two haplotypes share the epitope (70)DRRAA(74)and were associated with both the pauciarticular and the systemic subset of JRA. Our results suggest that studies of disease susceptibility in populations of admixed genetic background should take into account the contribution of different ethnic groups or nationalities in the recruitment of controls and patients studied in order to rule out genetic stratification.","AcknowledgementsWe thank the staff of the Immunology and Molecular Biology Laboratory for technical support.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis symptoms in 6 cities in Colombia; to measure patient expenses and school days and workdays lost; to describe disease severity; and to determine levels of total and specific IgE in asthmatic subjects.
METHODS: A multistage stratified random sample selection of schools with subjects aged 5 to 18 years in each city was used. Guardian subjects selected were contacted, and home visits were arranged. Subjects aged 1 to 4 years and older than 19 years were also selected randomly by systematic sampling based on the addresses of the subjects aged 5 to 18 years. Subjects with asthma symptoms were invited to provide a blood sample.
RESULTS: Information was obtained from 6,507 subjects. The prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis symptoms in the past 12 months was 10.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.7%-11.1%), 22.6% (95% CI, 21.6%-23.6%), and 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4%-4.4%), respectively. Thirty-eight percent of asthmatic subjects had visited the emergency department or have been hospitalized, and 50% reported lost school days and workdays. Seventy-six percent of sampled asthmatic patients were considered to be atopic.

The subsequent back pain is severe and often requires medications, bed rest and hospitalization to control pain and improve mobilization. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the effects of calcitonin versus placebo for the treatment of acute pain in patients sustaining stable, recent, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. MEDLINE (1966–2003), EMBASE (1980–2003), Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry (2003, volume 3), other databases, and conference proceedings were searched for relevant research. Primary study authors and the pharmaceutical manufacturer were contacted, and bibliographies of relevant papers were hand-searched. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials comparing calcitonin versus placebo for the acute pain of recent osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were included. Two reviewers extracted data, performed numeric calculations and extrapolated graphical data independently. The combined results from five randomized controlled trials, involving 246 patients, determined that calcitonin significantly reduced the severity of pain using a visual analogue scale following diagnosis. Pain at rest was reduced as early as 1 week into treatment (weighted mean difference [WMD] =3.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.64, 3.52) and this effect continued weekly to 4 weeks (WMD =4.03; 95% CI: 3.70, 4.35). A similar pattern was seen for pain scores associated with sitting, standing, and walking. Side effects were gastrointestinal, minor and often self-limited. Calcitonin appears to be effective in the management of acute pain associated with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures by shortening time to mobilization.","The authors would like to thank Ellen Crumley for her help with the electronic literature-search strategy, Natasha Wiebe for assisting with the statistical analysis, and Dr. Jose de Laranieto for his help in translation",,Osteoporosis International,,,"Acute Disease; Aged; Analgesics; Back Pain; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Calcitonin; Female; Fractures, Compression; Humans; Male; Osteoporosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Spinal Fractures",2004-12-22,2004,2004-12-22,2005-10,16,10,1281-1290,Closed,Article,"Knopp, Jennifer A.; Diner, Barry M.; Blitz, Maurice; Lyritis, George P.; Rowe, Brian H.","Knopp, Jennifer A.

A prospective multinational inception cohort should prove useful in identifying the influence of ethnicity on the clinical characteristics of SLE. We therefore analyzed clinical, laboratory, and prognostic variables in Latin American SLE patients with disease of recent onset who were entered into a prospective cohort, and compared these variables in the cohort's 3 major ethnic groups. Thirty-four centers from 9 Latin American countries participated by randomly incorporating SLE patients within 2 years of diagnosis into a standardized database. Participating centers were selected for their expertise in diagnosing and managing SLE. We were then able to evaluate prospectively socioeconomic variables, ethnicity, type of medical care, clinical and laboratory features, disease activity, damage, and mortality at each site. A coordinating center controlled the quality of the information submitted. Of the 1,214 SLE patients included in the cohort, 537 were mestizos, 507 were white, and 152 were African-Latin American (ALA). (There were also small numbers of pure Amerindian and oriental individuals.) Significant differences were found between them in socioeconomic characteristics, type of care, and level of education favoring whites. Mestizos and ALA were younger at onset. Delay to diagnosis and disease duration was shorter in ALA. Fever was more frequent in whites; discoid lesions in ALA; renal disease and lymphopenia in mestizos and ALA. Although we found differences in background variables between ethnic groups from different countries, mestizos from 2 distant countries (Argentina and Mexico) were clinically akin and showed similar differences to whites. Mortality was associated with lower education, poor medical coverage, and shorter follow-up. In an exploratory model nonwhite ethnicity was associated with renal disease and lymphopenia, damage, and cumulative American College of Rheumatology criteria. These differences in clinical, prognostic, socioeconomic, educational, and access to medical care features in Latin American lupus patients of 3 major ethnic groups from 9 different countries may have an impact on the patients' disease.

Considering that these infections are often asymptomatic and cause major complications like acute pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility or infant pneumonia, the estimated costs for diagnosis and treatment in the USA amounts to 2.2 million US dollars for each 500 cases. Therefore, there is a high need for correct, quick and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment of this urogenital tract infection. New innovative therapies provide good results with regard to efficacy and patients' compliance. The success rates of treatments are at least 95%. However, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance should not be ignored and new treatment schemes must be developed. The state-of-the-art of diagnosis and treatment of chlamydial infections as well as the pathophysiology is discussed in this review. In conclusion, infections with C. trachomatis is an important public health problem, especially in third world and developing countries, and more socio-economic studies linking secondary prevention of chlamydial infections, infertility and adverse pregnancy outcome are needed to understand more of its aetiology. In addition, diagnosis and treatment should be improved. Data in men revealed that past infections but not present infections are more related to male infertility. There is still controversial results. In future studies, function of the seminal vesicles and evaluation of the antioxidant capacity should be taken into account when role of C. trachomatis infection on male fertility is assessed.",The authors wish to thank Ms S.

Components of social cognitive theory and the theory of reasoned action and planned behaviour were integrated with those of the Health Belief Model to predict future intention to use condoms with a new partner. Logistic regression analyses of selected risky sexual behaviours on the intention to use condoms showed that, among males, attitudes towards using condoms and the Health Belief Model component of perceived barriers predicted the intention to use condoms. The Health Belief Model component of perceived benefits could not be interpreted. Attitudes, subjective norms and perceived self-efficacy were associated with female students' intention to use condoms.

Adult Contracaecum spp. were found in the gastrointestinal tract (prevalence 100 % in P. africanus, P. carbo and A. melanogaster; 25 % in A. cinerea). Parasite intensity was 11-24 (mean 19) in P. africanus, 4-10 (mean 7) in P. carbo, 4-56 (mean 30) in A. melanogaster and 2 (mean 0.5) in A. cinerea. The cormorants fed mainly on cichlid fishes and carp; the darters and the grey herons on cichlids. All these fishes are intermediate hosts of Contracaecum spp. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that Contracaecum rudolphii infected both cormorant species and darters; C. carlislei infected only the cormorants while C. tricuspis and C. microcephalum infected only the darters.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries in children aged 3 and 5 years of age in the city of Cambira - State of Parana. All children that participated in the national vaccination campaign against poliomyelitis in 2002 at the two basic health units of the city were examined. The campaign covered 99.5% of the population aged 1 to 5 years. Two previously trained and calibrated dentists performed the clinical examinations after the children brushed their teeth and recorded their caries experience by means of the dmf index. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of the disease between the male and female genders and between the rural and urban zones. At the age of 3, 68.50% of the children were caries-free, compared to 31.10% at the age of 5. In the total population, 11.19% of the children accounted for 50.86% of the teeth affected by dental caries. The dmf index at 3 and 5 years in the study population was 2.10 and 3.51, respectively. These data showed that the city has not yet reached the goals proposed by the WHO for the year 2000, what indicates the need for greater investment in programs aimed to prevention and control of the disease.",,,Journal of Applied Oral Science,,,,2004-03,2004,2004-06-30,2004-03,12,1,34-38,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ueda, Eunice Mitiko Ogido; Dezan, Cássia Cilene; Frossard, Wanda Terezinha Garbelini; Salomão, Fernanda; Morita, Maria Celeste","Ueda, Eunice Mitiko Ogido (Paraná, Universidade Norte do Paraná, Brazil); Dezan, Cássia Cilene (Paraná, Universidade Norte do Paraná, Brazil; State University of Londrina); Frossard, Wanda Terezinha Garbelini (State University of Londrina); Salomão, Fernanda (Paraná, Universidade Norte do Paraná, Brazil); Morita, Maria Celeste (Paraná, Universidade Norte do Paraná, Brazil; State University of Londrina)",,"Ueda, Eunice Mitiko Ogido (Universidade Norte do Paraná); Dezan, Cássia Cilene (Universidade Norte do Paraná; Londrina State University); Frossard, Wanda Terezinha Garbelini (Londrina State University); Salomão, Fernanda (Universidade Norte do Paraná); Morita, Maria Celeste (Universidade Norte do Paraná; Londrina State University)",7,0,0.17,1.6,https://www.scielo.br/j/jaos/a/tL9FrTgNX8synQQxtXM8VmG/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004073260,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,3 Good Health and Well Being
1881,pub.1093582529,10.1109/iscc.2004.1358674,,,Multi-Objective Optimization Scheme for Dynamic Multicast Groups,"In this paper, we propose a multi-objective traffic engineering scheme using different distribution trees to dynamic multicast groups (in which egress nodes can change during the connection's lifetime). If a multicast tree is recomputed front scratch, it may consume a considerable amount of CPU time and all communication using the multicast tree will be temporarily interrupted. To alleviate these drawbacks we propose a dynamic optimization model that makes use of a previously computed multicast tree (static model) in order to add new egress nodes. Using these two models, our aim is to combine into a single aggregated metric, the following weighting objectives: maximum link utilization, hop count, total bandwidth consumption and total end-to-end delay. Moreover, our proposal solves the traffic split ratio for multiple trees. We compare the dynamic and static multicast routing models using SNOPT solver.

Different adsorption sites have been observed for these organic molecules. Two types of tetracene adsorption are indicated by filled state images but three types can be distinguished in empty state images. Molecules aligned both along and perpendicular to the silicon dimer rows can be observed. Measurements of the length of this molecule in all configurations indicate that the molecule stays intact during the adsorption process. High resolution of STM images reveal that the perylene molecules bond to the substrate in a vertical orientation and forming packs of perylene aligned perpendicular to the silicon dimmer rows.

Herein we examined the role of chemical and visual communication during mate searching and assessment in the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus. Adult male rock shrimp experience major ontogenetic changes. The terminal molt stages (named ""robustus"") are dominant and capable of monopolizing females during the mating process. Previous studies had shown that most females preferably mate with robustus males, but how these dominant males and receptive females find each other is uncertain, and is the question we examined herein. In a Y-maze designed to test for the importance of waterborne chemical cues, we observed that females approached the robustus male significantly more often than the typus male. Robustus males, however, were unable to locate receptive females via chemical signals. Using an experimental set-up that allowed testing for the importance of visual cues, we demonstrated that receptive females do not use visual cues to select robustus males, but robustus males use visual cues to find receptive females. Visual cues used by the robustus males were the tumults created by agitated aggregations of subordinate typus males around the receptive females. These results indicate a strong link between sexual communication and the mating system of rock shrimp in which dominant males monopolize receptive females. We found that females and males use different (sex-specific) communicational cues during mate searching and assessment, and that the sexual communication of rock shrimp is similar to that of the American lobster, where females are first attracted to the dominant males by chemical cues emitted by these males. A brief comparison between these two species shows that female behaviors during sexual communication contribute strongly to the outcome of mate searching and assessment.",,,Biological Bulletin,,,"Analysis of Variance; Animal Communication; Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Chile; Cues; Decapoda; Female; Male; Seawater; Sex Attractants; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Visual Perception",2004-06,2004,,2004-06,206,3,134-43,Closed,Article,"Díaz, Eliecer R; Thiel, Martin","Díaz, Eliecer R (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Thiel, Martin ()",,"Díaz, Eliecer R (Catholic University of the North); Thiel, Martin ()",77,2,0.59,5.92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069533571,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3109 Zoology,

DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: This was a community based study of Epworth informal settlement.
SUBJECTS: A total of 308 households were interviewed. Participating households were randomly selected from the three communities of Epworth. Secondary medical archival data on diarrhoeal disease prevalence was collected from local clinics and district health offices in the study areas.
RESULTS: Only 7% of households were connected to the sewer system. The study revealed that in Zinyengere extension 13% had no toilet facilities, 48% had simple pits and 37% had Blair VIP latrines. In Overspill 2% had no toilet facilities, 28% had simple latrines and 36% had Blair VIP latrines while in New Gada 20% had no toilet facilities, 24% had simple pits and 23% had Blair VIP latrines. Although a significant percentage had latrines (83.2%), over 50% of the population were not satisfied with the toilet facilities they were using. All the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with their domestic waste disposal practices with 46.6% admitting to have indiscriminately dumped waste. According to the community, diarrhoeal diseases were the most prevalent diseases (50%) related to poor sanitation. Health statistics also indicated that diarrhoea was a major problem in this community.
CONCLUSION: It is recommended that households and the local authorities concentrate on improving the provision of toilets, water and waste disposal facilities as a way of improving the health state of the community.",,,East African Medical Journal,,,"Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Diarrhea; Educational Status; Environmental Health; Family Characteristics; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Surveys; Housing; Humans; Incidence; Income; Needs Assessment; Poverty; Prevalence; Public Health; Residence Characteristics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Toilet Facilities; Urban Health; Waste Management; Water Supply; Zimbabwe",2004-08,2004,2004-11-02,2004-08,81,8,422-426,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Makoni, FS; Ndamba, J; Mbati, PA; Manase, G","Makoni, FS (Institute of Water and Sanitation Development, P.O.

Participants (138 drivers and 141 passengers) who had been involved in a road traffic accident were approached and interviewed in public places. In both groups the median age group was between 25 years and 34 years. In 34 accidents (12.2%) a family member was killed, in 68 accidents (24.4%) a non-family member was killed in the accident. In 272 accidents 197 (72.4%) persons (both drivers and passengers) were injured and 168 (61.7%) were hospitalized. Eighty-seven drivers (63%) did not perceive themselves at fault and 51 (37%) did. Following the road traffic accident both drivers and passengers showed a significant decline of their well-being. Drivers who perceived themselves to be at fault did not cope better than those not perceiving themselves at fault. Passengers related to the drivers showed more decline in their well-being than those not related. Path analysis for drivers found that holding oneself responsible had a direct, and mediated by self-blame, guilt and family distress, negative effect on personal well-being. In the passengers group, holding the driver or others responsible led, mediated by increased self-blame, feelings of guilt, and family distress, to lower psychological well-being (PWB). Findings have relevant implications for the development of coping strategies to aid victims of road traffic accidents in dealing with their trauma in this African context, which may differ to those in Western societies.",AcknowledgementsThe financial assistance of the University of the North towards this research is hereby acknowledged.

The numerical model was developed considering both solid and fluid regions and solved as a conjugate problem. Equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved in the liquid region taking into account the transport processes at the inlet and exit boundaries as well as at the solid-liquid and liquid-gas interfaces. In the solid region, only heat conduction equation was solved. The shape and location of the free surface (liquid-gas interface) was determined iteratively as a part of the solution process by satisfying the kinematic condition as well as the balance of normal and shear forces at this interface. The number of elements in the fluid and solid regions were determined from a systematic grid-independence study. A non-uniform grid distribution was used to adequately capture large variations near the solid-fluid interface. Computed results included the local and average heat transfer coefficients at the solid-fluid interface. Computations were carried out to investigate the influence of different operating parameters such as jet velocity and plate material. It was found that the average heat transfer coefficient is maximum at early stages of the transient process and decreases gradually with time to the final steady state condition.Copyright © 2004 by ASME",,,,Advanced Energy Systems,,,2004-01-01,2004,2008-03-24,2004-01-01,,,35-42,Closed,Proceeding,"Bula, Antonio J.; Rahman, Muhammad M.","Bula, Antonio J.

If a multicast tree is recomputed from scratch, it may consume a considerable amount of CPU time and all communication using the multicast tree will be temporarily interrupted. To alleviate these drawbacks we propose an optimization model (dynamic model MHDB-D) that makes use of a previously computed multicast tree (static model MHDB-S) in order to add new egress nodes. Using these two models, our aim is to combine into a single aggregated metric, the following weighting objectives: maximum link utilization, hop count, total bandwidth consumption and total end-to-end delay. Moreover, our proposal solves the traffic split ratio for multiple trees. The problem is NP-hard, therefore, a novel multicast multiobjective dynamic routing algorithm is proposed for optimizing the different objectives.

Giemsa-stained blood smears were negative for blood parasites. A total of 94% of the cattle were sero-positive for Babesia bigemina by indirect fluorescent antibody test while 87% were sero-positive for Anaplasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The observation of negative blood smears but high incidence of positive serological results for Anaplasma and Babesia for the same group of cattle indicates that this area is endemic for these diseases but with a stable disease situation. All the animals were sero-negative for B. bovis and this is probably because the tick vector (Boophilus microplus) which transmits the disease is not present in the Free State Province. Two tick species belonging to the family ixodidae were found on cattle, namely Boophilus decoloratus and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi. In the present study significant differences in seasonal burdens of B. decoloratus occurred, with the highest infestations recorded from February to June.

The aim is to combine into a single aggregated metric, the following weighting objectives: the maximum link utilization, the hop count, the total bandwidth consumption, and the total end-to-end delay. Moreover, our proposal solves the traffic split ratio for multiple trees. We formulate this multi-objective function as one with Non Linear programming with discontinuous derivatives (DNLP). Results obtained using SNOPT solver show that several weighting objectives are decreased and the maximum link utilization is minimized. The problem is NP-hard, therefore, a novel SPT algorithm is proposed for optimizing the different objectives. The behavior we get using this algorithm is similar to what we get with SNOPT solver. The proposed approach can be applied in MPLS networks by allowing the establishment of explicit routes in multicast events. The main contributions of this paper are the optimization model and the formulation of the multi-objective function; and that the algorithm proposed shows polynomial complexity.",,,Telecommunication Systems,,,,2004-10,2004,,2004-10,27,2-4,229-251,Closed,Article,"Donoso, Yezid; Fabregat, Ramon; Marzo, Jose L.","Donoso, Yezid (Computer Science Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fabregat, Ramon (Institut d'Informàtica i Aplicacions, Universitat de Girona, Girona, Spain); Marzo, Jose L.

A cross-sectional study of 60 workers was performed near the Malaria Control Center (MCC) in Tzaneen, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Tests included a questionnaire (sexual function, fertility, and job history), a physical examination of the reproductive system, and semen analysis (produced via coitus interruptus or masturbation). Sperm count, density, and motility using the World Health Organization criteria and morphology using the strict Tygerberg criteria were determined. Serum o'p' and p'p' isomers of DDE, DDT, and DDD were measured. Forty-eight (81.0%) participants produced a semen sample, while all completed the questionnaires and physical examination. The mean sperm count was 93.8+/-130.3 million, and sperm density was 74.6+/-85.1 million/mL. The mean normal morphology score was 2.5+/-1.8% of subjects. Eighty-four percent of morphology scores were below either the WHO or the Tygerberg criteria, with the highest individual score being 6%. Self-perceived current problems with sexual function ranged between 10% and 20%. The most prevalent genital abnormality was abnormal testis disposition at 71%. There were few significant associations between DDT exposure measures (measured as years worked at MCC and serum DDT) and reproductive outcomes. p'p'-DDT was negatively associated with semen count (beta=-3.7+/-1.7; P=0.04; R2=0.05 adjusted for age, abstinence, physical abnormality, and fever in last 2 months). While the semen quality in the study was less than normal, no strong evidence for a DDT effect was found.","AcknowledgementsThe following individuals and organizations are thanked for their role in the study: The South African Medical Research Council, the Faculty of Health Sciences Research Committee and The University of Michigan/US National Institutes of Health/Forgarty International Centre–Southern African Programme in Environmental and Occupational Health for their financial support; The Michigan State University, which performed the blood DDT analysis; The Department of Health in Tzaneen, Limpopo, for providing the venue, staff, resources, and assistance during the pilot and main studies; The National Centre for Occupational Health, Department of Health, Johannesburg, for providing staff and resources; The Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at UCT, for providing the staff and resources for semen analyses; The Faculty of Health, University of the North, for providing students to assist in the study and Grace Mogoshoa, P.J.

METHODS: A follow-up study on a cohort of term infants born to 276 mothers recruited during their third trimester of pregnancy was undertaken. The mothers were recruited by the nursing staff at nine randomly selected clinics. From this sample, 219 women gave birth at the local hospital and the infants were followed from birth to 12 mo. Data collected included infant feeding practices and anthropometry at regular intervals (1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 mo). The anthropometric measurements taken were body weight, length, and head circumference.
RESULTS: At birth 8.8% of infants had a low birth weight, 9.6% were stunted, 48.9% were underweight, and 7.3% were wasted. Mothers in this study breastfed their infants for long periods with more than 80% still breastfeeding by the ninth month. However, exclusive breastfeeding during the first 3 mo was uncommon as mothers tended to introduce supplementary feeds at an early age, with 56% of the infants receiving some form of supplement by the end of the first month. The most common supplementary foods were maize meal porridge and mabella (sorghum). Stunting became increasingly apparent in the early months with 30% of infants being stunted (<-2 standard deviations [SD] of the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] reference curves) by the first month, and this percentage remained high for the 12-mo period, remaining at below - 1 SD NCHS height-for-age standard. Increased weight gain was seen during the first 3 mo and then declined until mean weight-for-age at 12 mo was below 0 SD NCHS. Twelve percent of infants were overweight (>2 SD NCHS) by the 12th month. Postnatally the infants showed a pattern of gradual stunting. Postnatal factors associated with this pattern were related to maternal socioeconomic status, and these included the mother's level of education, employment status, parity, and access to electricity.
CONCLUSION: There was a high frequency of underweight infants at birth but stunting was less common. With respect to feeding practices, the mothers tended to introduce supplementary feeds at an early age.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Ms M. Tshanavha and Mr T. S. Mashamba (dietitians), Ms M.

The study hypothesis was that male malaria vector-control workers highly exposed to DDT in the past should demonstrate clinically significant exposure-related anti-androgenic and/or estrogenic effects that should be reflected in abnormalities in reproductive hormone levels. A cross-sectional study of 50 workers from three camps situated near the Malaria Control Center (MCC) in Tzaneen was performed. Tests included blood sampling before and after a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) challenge (100 microg). Serum o'p' and p'p' isomers of DDE, DDT, and DDD and basal and post-GnRH challenge hormone levels, including luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol (E2), and inhibin, were measured. The mean number of years worked at the MCC was 15.8+/-7.8 years and the mean serum DDT was 94.3+/-57.1 microg/g of lipid. Mean baseline E2 levels (62.4+/-29.9 pg/mL) exceeded the laboratory reference range. Associations between DDT exposure measures (years worked at the MCC and DDT compounds) and hormonal outcomes were weak and inconsistent. The most important finding was a positive relationship of baseline E2 and baseline testosterone with DDT compounds, especially with p'p'-DDT and -DDD. The strongest association found, adjusted for age and SHBG, was between baseline estradiol and p'p'-DDT (beta=1.14+/-0.33 pg/mL/microg/ g lipid, P=0.001, R2=0.31, n=46). An overall anti-androgenic mechanism best explains the results, but with a number of inconsistencies. Associations might be due to chance, as multiple comparisons were made. The results therefore do not suggest an overt anti-androgenic or estrogenic effect of long-term DDT exposure on hormone levels, but correlations do exist in a manner that is not understood.","AcknowledgementsThe following individuals and organizations are thanked for their role in the study: The South African Medical Research Council, the Faculty of Health Sciences Research Committee and the University of Michigan/US National Institutes of Health/Forgarty International Centre–Southern African Programme in Environmental and Occupational Health for their financial support; The Michigan State University which performed the blood DDT analysis; The Department of Health in Tzaneen, Limpopo, for providing the venue, staff, resources, and assistance during the study; The National Centre for Occupational Health, Department of Health, Johannesburg, for providing staff and resources during the study; The endocrinology laboratory of the Department of Chemical Pathology, University of Cape Town, for performing most of the hormone analysis; The Reproductive Biology Centre in Edinburgh, UK, for conducting the inhibin analyses; The Faculty of Health, University of the North, for providing students to assist in the study, and Mags Paul, Grace Mogoshoa, Xolane Masoka, Dr. Mary Gulumian, Professor Leslie London, Uche Onwuchekwa, Mohamed Jeebhay, Andrea Rother, Susan Ramushu, Dr. Di Cooper, Mrs. Kekana, Hans Onja, and Professor James Davidson for their assistance on the project.",,Environmental Research,,,Adult; Animals; DDT; Estradiol; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Humans; Malaria; Male; Middle Aged; Mosquito Control; Occupational Exposure; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires; Testosterone,2004-09,2004,,2004-09,96,1,9-19,Closed,Article,"Dalvie, Mohamed A; Myers, Jonathan E; Thompson, Mary Lou; Dyer, Silke; Robins, Thomas G; Omar, Shaheed; Riebow, John; Molekwa, Josef; Kruger, Phillip; Millar, R","Dalvie, Mohamed A (Occupational and Environmental Health Research Unit, Department of Public Health, Medical School, University of Cape Town, Anzio Road, Observatory, 7925 Cape Town, South Africa); Myers, Jonathan E (Occupational and Environmental Health Research Unit, Department of Public Health, Medical School, University of Cape Town, Anzio Road, Observatory, 7925 Cape Town, South Africa); Thompson, Mary Lou (Department of Statistics, University of Washington, WA, USA); Dyer, Silke (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa); Robins, Thomas G (University of Michigan, School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); Omar, Shaheed (University of Witwatersrand, South Africa); Riebow, John (Michigan State University, MI, USA); Molekwa, Josef (Occupational and Environmental Health Research Unit, Department of Public Health, Medical School, University of Cape Town, Anzio Road, Observatory, 7925 Cape Town, South Africa); Kruger, Phillip (The Department of Health, Tzaneen, Limpopo, South Africa); Millar, R (The Reproductive Biology Centre, Edinburgh, UK)","Dalvie, Mohamed A (University of Cape Town)","Dalvie, Mohamed A (University of Cape Town); Myers, Jonathan E (University of Cape Town); Thompson, Mary Lou (University of Washington); Dyer, Silke (University of Cape Town); Robins, Thomas G (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor); Omar, Shaheed (University of the Witwatersrand); Riebow, John (Michigan State University); Molekwa, Josef (University of Cape Town); Kruger, Phillip (Department of Health); Millar, R (The Reproductive Biology Centre, Edinburgh, UK)",58,2,1.44,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031146213,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The longevity trait considered was the number of lactations initiated and the linear type traits were rump height, body depth, angularity, rear udder height, fore udder attachment, udder depth, fore teat placement and fore teat length. Fixed effects included in the models were herd year, season of calving and herd–date of classification–classifier and days in milk. Age at first calving and age at classification were included as linear and quadratic covariates. Heritability estimates were low for longevity and moderate for most type traits except rump height and fore teat length. All the phenotypic correlations between longevity and the linear type traits were slightly positive (0.01 to 0.09) except the relationships with rump height and fore teat length which were –0.01 and –0.02, respectively. Genetic correlations between longevity and udder traits as well as angularity were moderate to high and positive (0.22 to 0.48). The only notable negative genetic correlations were longevity with body depth and fore teat length (–0.15 and –0.07, respectively).

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most indicated imaging modality to evaluate the components of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Forty patients with signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders were treated with splints for a mean period of 12 months, comprising regular semimonthly follow-ups. After stabilization of the clinical status, occlusal adjustments and MRI evaluation were performed. It was concluded that the success of this kind of treatment are related to the total (70%) or partial improvement (22.5%) of painful symptomatology and to the functional reestablishment of the craniomandibular complex. The MRI allowed evaluation and also the conclusion that the splints provide conditions for the organism to develop means to resist to the temporomandibular disorders by means of elimination of several etiologic factors.

This enables to attempt a definition of elements belonging to the Formative iconographic universe, beyond the strict limits of the textile field. The large body of images we have assembles provides visual information that is sufficiently solid to: a) outline the existence of an iconographic horizon characteristic of the late phase of the Formative; b) define its constituent elements, and; c) connect it to south-Peruvian and altiplano developments. The Frontal Figure with Radiate Head is one of the iconographic themes we consider for the Late Formative, as an icon with specific and well-defined attributes.

Fueron realizados estudios osteobiogrficos en 161 individuos de los cementerios Solcor-3, Coyo-3 y Quitor-6, representativos de los perodos pre-Tiwanaku (Fases Sequitor, Quitor), Tiwanaku (Fase Coyo; auge de influencia altiplnica), Tiwanaku Final (final Fase Coyo) y post-Tiwanaku (Fase Yaye-Solor). Los resultados de tres de los marcadores usados apuntan a que se verifica una mejora en la calidad de vida biolgica de la poblacin local, traducida en mayor estatura y dimorfismo sexual, menor ocurrencia de caries, de desgaste oclusal y de prdida de dientes durante la vida del individuo, ello posiblemente debido al incremento en el consumo de protena animal durante el momento de influencia de Tiwanaku. La hipoplasia sistmica del esmalte dental y la hiperostosis indican, a primera vista, un cuadro opuesto al de un impacto positivo en esta poblacin; sin embargo, es posible pensar que la mayor incidencia de estas variables se deba a que, como resultado de una mejor dieta, los individuos eran ms resistentes a los ataques de agentes patognicos. El ltimo indicador se relaciona con el uso del cuerpo, el cual seala que, al margen de cualquier cambio propiciado por la influencia altiplnica, la poblacin local mantuvo sus tradicionales actividades cotidianas a lo largo de todo el tiempo We examine four prehistorical moments in San Pedro de Atacama with the purpose of qualifying the impact that Tiwanaku had on the local population. To this end, we carried out osteobiographic studies on 161 individuals from the cemeteries of Solcor-3, Coyo-3 and Quitor-6, which are representative of pre-Tiwanaku (Sequitor and Quitor Phases), Tiwanaku (Coyo Phase; with a rise of altiplano influence), Final Tiwanaku (final Coyo Phase) and post-Tiwanaku (Yaye-Solor Phase). The results for three of the indicators that we used, suggest an improvement in the biological quality of life of the local population, expressed in greater height and sexual dimorphism, the lesser occurrence of caries, occlusal abrasion and loss of teeth during the individual's life, all of this possibly owing to the increase in the consumption of animal protein that took place under Tiwanaku influence. Although, on a first impression, hyperostosis and the systemic hypoplasia of tooth enamel would indicate a negative impact on the population, it is conceivable that the greater incidence of these variables results from an improved diet that made individuals more resistant to attacks by pathogenic agents. The last indicator we used relates to body use, which reveals that, notwithstanding the changes that would have been propitiated by altiplano influence, the local population kept to its traditional daily activities throughout.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2004,2004,2004,,,27,103-116,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"J, Maria Antonietta Costa; Neves, Walter Alves; Hubbe, Mark","J, Maria Antonietta Costa (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo R.

The focus is on the sexual abuse of children in the home/community, as opposed to the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
METHODS: English language, peer-reviewed papers cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) are examined. Reports from international and local NGOs and UN agencies are also examined.
RESULTS: Few published studies on the sexual abuse of children have been conducted in the region, with the exception of South Africa. Samples are predominantly clinical or University based. A number of studies report that approximately 5% of the sample reported penetrative sexual abuse during their childhood. No national survey of the general population has been conducted. The most frequent explanations for the sexual abuse of children in SSA include rapid social change, AIDS/HIV avoidance strategies and the patriarchal nature of society. Child sexual abuse is most frequently perpetrated by family members, relatives, neighbors or others known to the child.
CONCLUSIONS: There is nothing to support the widely held view that child sexual abuse is very rare in SSA-prevalence levels are comparable with studies reported from other regions. The high prevalence levels of AIDS/HIV in the region expose sexually abused children to high risks of infection. It is estimated that, approximately.6-1.8% of all children in high HIV-incidence countries in Southern Africa will experience penetrative sexual abuse by an AIDS/HIV infected perpetrator before 18 years of age.",,,Child Abuse & Neglect,,,"Adolescent; Africa South of the Sahara; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male",2004-04,2004,,2004-04,28,4,439-460,Closed,Article,"Lalor, Kevin","Lalor, Kevin (Department of Social Sciences, Dublin Institute of Technology, Mountjoy Square, Dublin 1, Ireland.)","Lalor, Kevin (Technological University Dublin)","Lalor, Kevin (Technological University Dublin)",186,12,2.82,47.79,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016689396,44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

Also determine whether LPG molecule and the sand fly the gut lysates have shared epitopes.
DESIGN: A laboratory based study.
SETTING: Colony bred P. duboscqi sand flies and all other experiments were done under laboratory conditions.
METHODS: Laboratory reared sand flies were allowed to feed beneath a blood filled membrane feeder containing 1 x 10(6) amastigotes in 20 microl mixed with 0.5 ml of defibrinated rabbit blood with a 1:100 dilution of anti-LPG MABS. Control blood contained a similar number of amastigotes but no MABS. At least five female previously fed sand flies were later dissected on days two, four, and six post-feeding and examined for promastigote forms and parasite loads in the sand fly mid gut. In vitro, the same number of amastigotes in 100 microl complete Schneider's Drosophila medium was mixed in a 96 well plate with either 100 microl of 1:100 anti-LPG MABS, 1:1000 anti LPG MABS or undiluted sera from L. major infected mice. The control well contained a similar number of amastigotes but no antibodies added. Following an overnight incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 degrees C and growth at 26 degrees C, parasites were assessed at 3, 6 and 24 hour intervals for changes in their developmental forms.
RESULTS: 1:100 dilution of anti-LPG MABS when mixed with amastigotes were effective in reducing L. major development at the early log phase or procyclic stage both in vitro and within the sand fly (p<0.05). The control cultures or sand flies that fed on amastigotes alone and no MABS supported full parasite development up to the metacyclic stage. Results also showed that flies, which had fed on MABS, showed low parasitemia levels of 2+, compared to a high density of 4+ for their controls (p<0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that anti-LPG MABS were effective in reducing sand fly infections. This study also showed that P. duboscqi gut lysates and proteins present in L. major-derived LPG share two common proteins of molecular weights 105 kDa and 106 kDa. Further analysis of these individual proteins from the gut should be studied with a view of determining their vaccine potential.",,,East African Medical Journal,,,"Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Protozoan; Epitopes; Glycosphingolipids; Host-Parasite Interactions; Insect Vectors; Leishmania major; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Phlebotomus",2004-02,2004,2004-08-19,2004-02,81,2,97-103,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Tonui, W K; Ngumbi, P M; Mpoke, S S; Orago, A S; Mbati, P A; Turco, S J; Mkoji, G M","Tonui, W K (Centre for Biotechnology Research and Development, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya.); Ngumbi, P M (); Mpoke, S S (); Orago, A S (); Mbati, P A (); Turco, S J (); Mkoji, G M ()",,"Tonui, W K (Kenya Medical Research Institute); Ngumbi, P M (); Mpoke, S S (); Orago, A S (); Mbati, P A (); Turco, S J (); Mkoji, G M ()",2,0,0.03,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/eamj/article/download/9133/2056,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033198557,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The formulation also deals with the uncertainty of relevant parameters, such as demand and exchange rates, and uses an objective function that incorporates a measure of risk.

S) using stable lead isotopes,"This study evaluates the main sources of antropogenic Pb in one of the most industrialized centers of the southern Chilean coast (36 degrees S). Stable lead isotopes ((206)Pb/(207)Pb, (208)Pb/(207)Pb) were used to trace main Pb sources to coastal sediments, considering the suspended particulate matter (SPM) from marine (traps), continental (rivers) and industrial effluents, sediments and leaded gasoline samples. The atmospheric input was evaluated through natural collectors; i.e. Raqui-Tubul salt marsh. Results show that marine samples lie on a trend between industrial effluents ( approximately 1.16, 2.44) and natural sources (1.20, 2.50), not related to gasoline consumption. Salt marsh sediments show comparable isotopic composition to marine samples, suggesting the importance of the atmospheric input in the coastal sediments, not related to the leaded gasoline composition either. The continental input (1.18, 2.48) is highly influenced by precipitation, being difficult to separate both sources (atmosphere and continental runoff), showing also similar isotopic ratio to marine sediments. The signal of industrial emissions is masked with the introduction of Pb with higher isotopic ratios, compared to the values observed in the material collected from traps (SPM approximately 1.19, 2.48). The contribution of more radiogenic Pb by the upwelling is suggested.","AcknowledgementsThis research project was financially supported by a cooperation contract under National Scholarship program of Chile CONICYT and DAAD scholarship research Program of Germany.

Morphological analysis does not provide a well-resolved phylogeny. In the present study, we use amino acid sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene to produce a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the families of Cumacea. Phylogenetic analyses at the amino acid level were performed under Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony methods. Results strongly suggest that families lacking an articulated telson form a monophyletic group. This pleotelson clade, composed of the families Bodotriidae, Leuconidae, and Nannastacidae, is the most derived within the Cumacea. Within this group, the Bodotriidae resolve paraphyletically, with Leuconidae and Nannastacidae embedded within it. Comparison of the molecular phylogeny with that based on morphology suggests that many ""diagnostic"" characters are homoplasious.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Dan DenDanto, Alan Davis, Mathew Hooge, Sarah Gerken, Exequiel González, Peter Smith and Martin Thiel for invaluable help on specimen collection around the world.

An average of 118 Ton h(-1) of finely divided solids were discharged into the rocky intertidal zone of the bay for a period of over 16 years, producing continuous turbidity in the water column and sedimentation in the subtidal zone. Data obtained four months before cessation of the discharge showed that the macrofauna present at 20 and 50 m depth in the bay suffered an important decrease in abundance and species richness, low diversity/high dominance, and deep changes in community structure related to the discharge. The faunal assemblages present at 110 m depth did not show effects from the discharge, suggesting that the impact was limited to the inner part of the bay. The impoverished faunal aggregates at 20 and 50 m depth showed exclusive domination by the Lumbrineris bifilaris (polychaete)-Diastylis tongoyensis (cumacean) association, representing a simple trophic guild of deposit feeders. The complete absence of opportunistic species such as capitellid, spionid, and/or cirratulid polychaetes may be associated with the turbidity and sedimentation levels in the bay.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to M.

The article proposes relationships between violence and different topics such as the role of the media in the possibility of cultural control, the various memories and narratives that condition the present and explain the past, and the construction of identities starting from feelings such as hate and revenge. In order to face complex phenomena such as excessive violence, the article goes as far as proposing mediations between the act of killing and the aesthetic impact produced by images presented both in televised and printed news.

Prokaryotes inhabiting athalassohaline environments are poorly known and very few of such places have been surveyed for microbial diversity studies around the world. We analyzed the planktonic bacterial and archaeal assemblages inhabiting several of these evaporitic basins in a remote and vast area in northern Chile by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Most systems were springs and athalassohaline ponds in different saltflats of the Atacama Desert region, including Salar de Llamará (in the Central Depression), Salar de Atacama (in the Pre-Andean Depression) and Salar de Ascotán (in the Altiplano). Overall, we analyzed more than 25 samples from 19 different environments with strong gradients of altitude, qualitative ionic compositions and UV influence. Between 4 and 25 well-defined DGGE bands were detected for Bacteria in each sample, whereas Archaea ranged between 1 and 5. Predominant DGGE bands (defined by intensity and frequency of appearance) were excised from the gel and sequenced. Bacterial assemblages were dominated by the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum and a few Proteobacteria. There was a tendency for increasing contribution of CFB with higher salinities and altitude. Thus, CFB accounted for the major fraction of band intensity in the Ascotán samples and for lower percentages in Atacama and Llamará. When the distribution of particular CFB sequences was examined, there were several relatives of Psychroflexus torquis substituting each other as salinity changed in Ascotán. Another set of CFB sequences, very distantly related to Cytophaga marinovorus, was abundant in both Llamará and Atacama at salinities lower than 7%. Archaeal assemblages were dominated by uncultured haloarchaea distantly related to cultured strains mostly obtained from thalassohaline environments. Most of the archaeal sequences did not have a close match with environmental 16S rRNA genes deposited in the database either. Therefore, athalassohaline environments are excellent sources of new microorganisms different from their counterparts in thalassohaline sites and useful tools to relate microbial genetic diversity and environmental characteristics such as changes in salinity (both qualitative and quantitative) and altitude.","Sampling and measurements carried out in Chile were funded by projects FONDEF D97F1078 and D99I1026.

The paper also reviewed issues related to methods of data collection, data analysis, reliability and validity in qualitative research. Focus group discussions took place in classrooms in three schools in Mankweng, Limpopo Province of South Africa. Three groups (boys only, girls only and mixed) took part in each school. Participants were selected from the pool of standard seven (grade 9) students from the chosen schools. The nine steps that were involved in using focus group discussions as a research method and the Mankweng experience is discussed. These steps include: (1) conducting a social influence analysis; (2) identifying the specific information to collect; (3) designing focus group discussion guide; (4) choosing the participants for the focus group discussion; (5) selecting focus group discussion moderators; (6) training focus group discussion moderators; (7) conducting the focus group discussion; (8) analysing the data collected; (9) formulating study conclusions and policy recommendations. Little adolescent health research in South Africa has been based upon methods that can capture the complexity of the role of significant others in adolescent health and development and the powerlessness of rural communities in dealing with the 'new morbidity' of adolescent risk behaviours. Understanding what sort of power relations, for example, that are involved in being relatively disadvantaged and how the power of such social groups can be increased is common concern of development managers and other individuals and institutions engaged in policy changes and implementation and deserve to be an essential component of child and adolescent health research. Well-collected and well-analysed qualitative data is needed in order to clearly understand some of the underlying predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors that could account for adolescent risk behaviours in rural communities. Qualitative research method is important in that they capture the complexity of life, rather than trying to 'reduce' this complexity, and the potential for gaining an understanding of what is going on in the situation with the phenomenon is greater. Focus group discussions, a qualitative research methodology, can yield valuable data.",,,Journal of Child and Adolescent Mental Health,,,,2004-10,2004,,2004-10,16,2,117-125,Closed,Article,"Onya, He; Flisher, Aj","Onya, He (); Flisher, Aj ()",,"Onya, He (); Flisher, Aj ()",1,0,,0.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070959007,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

In Colombia, expansion has been slower and has attempted to improve the quality of education.

The palynomorph assemblages are dominated by terrestrial cryptospores, but also contain marine elements (acritarchs, prasinophycean algae and chitinozoans). The cryptospore assemblages are similar in composition to those described from coeval deposits worldwide, suggesting that the producers were cosmopolitan and tolerated a wide range of climatic conditions. They are correlated with the Imperfectotriletes spp. Interval Biozone (sub‐biozone α) of the Imperfectotriletes spp.‐ Laevolancis divellomedia Assemblage Biozone, indicating a Hirnantian (latest Ordovician) age. Acritarchs include late Ordovician species such as Eupoikilosusa striata and Villosacapsula cf. setosapellicula , that coexist with the Llandovery species Dactylofusa estillis.

Ancient fjord fills provide the potential for three-dimensional views of the evolution of depositional environments in response to changing sediment supply and base level through the deglacial process. We describe the fill (Jejenes Formation) of a well-exposed Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) glacial valley and its tributaries; these deposits record the progressive marine flooding and infilling of topography by glacially derived sediments. The geometry of the valley and its tributaries is controlled by the underlying lower Paleozoic lithologies: a deep valley with steep sides exists where the bedrock is massive limestones, and a broader, shallower valley exists where the bedrock is generally a fine-grained olistostrome. The valleys are locally floored with diamictites, including both in situ tillites and remobilized diamictites. In the trunk valley these are locally overlain by a small, shallow-water delta. The major part of the valley fill consists of a ≤150-m-thick mudstone-dominated succession (probably generated by plumes of glacial outwash) containing numerous dropstones that decrease in abundance down the fjord. The mudstones contain numerous thin sandstone and conglomerate turbidites that were supplied laterally via subaqueous gravel fans feeding in from the tributary valleys, each of which has a distinctive clast suite related to the local subcrop. The entire succession is overlain by >300 m of sandy turbidites, of which the upper part includes large mass-transport complexes. Intercalated within the succession in the trunk valley are structureless, graded, silty mudstones lacking dropstones but with abundant large wood fragments. Close to the steep western margin of the trunk valley, each of these massive mudstones is underlain by a slump or debris flow, locally containing meter-scale blocks of Ordovician limestone from the valley side. We interpret these as a consequence of rockfalls from the steeper valley sides, triggering debris flows on the subaqueous fjord slopes. We suggest that large solitary waves were generated as the rockfalls entered the water, traveling along the fjord and stripping vegetation from the shoreline. Large amounts of mud and silt were thrown into suspension during these events and subsequently settled from suspension to form the structureless graded beds. These deposits, and other mass-flow deposits within the succession, emphasize the potential importance of catastrophic sedimentation within deglacial successions.",,,Geological Society of America Bulletin,,,,2004,2004,,2004,116,3-4,348-367,Closed,Article,"Kneller, Ben; Milana, Juan Pablo; Buckee, Clare; Ja'aidi, Omar al","Kneller, Ben (School of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK); Milana, Juan Pablo (CONICET e Instituto de Geología, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina); Buckee, Clare (School of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK); Ja'aidi, Omar al (School of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK)",,"Kneller, Ben (University of Leeds); Milana, Juan Pablo (National University of San Juan); Buckee, Clare (University of Leeds); Ja'aidi, Omar al (University of Leeds)",67,15,,5.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008621608,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,

The heavy mineral assemblages and the major and trace element contents of sedimentary rocks from the Neogene continental successions of the Central Depression in Chile and the Mauri and Corque Basins in the Altiplano of Bolivia reflect volcanic source rocks with different degrees of magmatic differentiation and alkalinity. These results indicate that the source rocks of the Central Depression were less differentiated (andesite to rhyodacite) than those of the Altiplano basins (rhyodacite to rhyolite). The low concentration (cations per formula unit) of total Al (<0.15 pfu) and [Ca+Na] (∼0.82 pfu) in the detrital clinopyroxenes and low [Nb/Y] ratio (<0.7) of whole-rock analyses of sandstones from the Central Depression indicate erosion of a calc-alkaline source rock. By contrast, the high concentration of total Al (>0.15 pfu) and [Ca+Na] (∼0.92 pfu), the variable Ti content (0.01–0.04 pfu) of the clinopyroxenes and the high [Nb/Y] (>0.7) in whole-rock analyses of sandstones from the Mauri Basin indicate erosion of alkaline rock sources. Locally, the low concentration of total Al (<0.15 pfu) in the detrital clinopyroxenes of sandstones from the Corque Basin indicates erosion of a subalkaline source rock. The chemical trends in the sandstones are similar to those in volcanic suites from the Western Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera of the Central Andes.","AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Philippe de Parseval, Michel Valladon and Remi Freydier of the LMTG (Toulouse) and Eugenia Fonseca of the SERNAGEOMIN (Santiago) for valuable help in assembling the data file; to Didier Beziat, Luis Aguirre and Jacobus Le Roux for fruitful discussions; and the Universidad de Chile and IRD for financial support of this work.

Focacci in the funerary site Az-71a (valley of Azapa). Most significantly, this painted piece represents the antique image of the ""Lord of the Scepters"", topic that has not shown up in Tiwanaku pottery, but more typically, in stone sculptures from the altiplano. It would be, in fact, the only object of this sort so far known for the entire altiplano sphere of distribution. The uniqueness of this piece leads us to reflect on the so-called ""Tiwanaku Expansion"", and more specifically at that which would have taken place in the Westerns Valleys region of the South-Central Andes area. We reviewed and registered existing ceramic collections and their iconography with this in mind, putting particular attention to those pieces found in the peripheries of the Titicaca State, and with a special focus on those found in the valley of Azapa",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2004,2004,2004,,,27,77-101,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"R, Mauricio Uribe","R, Mauricio Uribe (Universidad de Chile Facultad de Ciencias Sociales Departamento de Antropologa, Santiago, CHILE)",,"R, Mauricio Uribe (University of Chile)",5,2,,2.88,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/eatacam/n27/art04.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042427376,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,

The prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 10.5 g/dl) in this study population was 16.4%. The mean number of clinic visits during pregnancy was 4.1 (standard deviation (SD) 2.18). There were no differences in clinic attendance for the anaemic and non-anaemic participants. Maternal weight was found to be lower (p = 0.051) in the anaemic than the non-anaemic group. Iron, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are still common in this area, with 50.9%, 16.4% and 10.3% of the pregnant women respectively having biochemical evidence of these deficiencies. In the anaemic group iron deficiency was the most prevalent deficiency, with 62.8% of the women having iron deficiency (serum ferritin < 12 5g/ml). In the non-anaemic group there was a significant negative correlation between both serum and red cell folate and the time of first visit to the clinic, indicating that folate supplementation given by the clinics is effective in prevention of folate deficiency. Conclusion. Although both iron and folate supplements are issued at antenatal clinics in the central area of Limpopo province, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia are still prevalent in pregnant women. However there has been a marked improvement in the prevalence of folate deficiency.",,,South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition,,,,2004-02,2004,2016-05-31,2004-02,17,1,15-21,Closed,Article,"Cape, W.; Mamabolo, R.L.; Alberts, M.; Steyn, N.P.; de Waal, H.A.

The RRA employed was a mixture of inorganic salts, some of which occur as residues from industrial mineral processing in Chile. Chemical characteristics of the mixture are described, as well as results of measurements of electrical resistance of ground electrodes over time with and without RRA treatment. Measures are also given for current intensities and loss of electrode mass in test electrodes buried below ground with RRA and within cell containers having a specific capacity. Small scale tests were made on the effects of impulse current in test cells containing electrodes treated with the RRA.","This work was supported under Project PROIM “Industrial Minerals: New Opportunities for development of the country,” University of Antofagasta–Chile.

Based on vegetation surveys conducted at three enclosed sites at the Messina Experimental Farm during the period 1964 to 2001, no clear fixed grass species establishment sequence was observed. The classic plant succession model of the grass component, as usually found in other veld types, is absent in Mopani veld of the Limpopo Valley. Shallow, nutrient poor, gravelly, severely eroded soils with low moisture retention and a high runoff rate are mainly colonised by annual grasses and forbs. Perennial grasses take long to establish. This results in an unstable herbaceous component that is vulnerable to changes, which in turn depends on the erratic availability of soil moisture. Where the woody component is concerned, eight tree species appeared to be early colonisers, five intermediate colonisers and seven late colonisers. Tree numbers increased at sites with deeper soils, indicating that bush encroachment is a general, natural process that occurs irrespective of rest treatments applied to the herbaceous component. At a site with an extremely shallow soil, bush density decreased, suggesting that the bush encroachment process in the Limpopo Valley is much more affected by soil and climate than in other veld types and climatic zones of the Limpopo Province.",,,African Journal of Range and Forage Science,,,,2004-12,2004,,2004-12,21,3,205-210,Closed,Article,"Jordaan, JJ; Wessels, DCJ; Dannhauser, CS; Rootman, GT","Jordaan, JJ (); Wessels, DCJ (); Dannhauser, CS (); Rootman, GT ()",,"Jordaan, JJ (); Wessels, DCJ (); Dannhauser, CS (); Rootman, GT ()",8,1,,0.54,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070956729,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

As a result, the upper rock part is loosened and then eroded away by physical forces such as wind, water, trampling. This special type of ‘exfoliation’ is widely distributed and affects the geomorphology of whole sandstone mountain ranges and outcrops across several biomes. We show, that this weathering type is initiated by bioalkalization because of the photosynthesis of cryptoendolithic (i.e. those organisms living in small tight open spaces between the sand grains) cyanobacteria causing pH values high enough to enhance silica solution in the cryptoendolithic zone. As modern cyanobacteria are the initial photoautotrophic colonizers of bare rocks in arid and semiarid landscapes, it is possible that they may also have played a significant role in shaping sandstone landscapes in the geological past.","The first author would like to thank the DFG (German Research Foundation) for funding.

Arguments are drawn from legislative and policy provisions.

Immobilization supports with different physico-chemical characteristics were evaluated for use in continuous reactors. Immobilization and activity yields were calculated. Among the adsorption on Duolite, Amberlite, Celite and DEAE-sepharose, and entrapment in polyacrylamide gel or reticulation using glutaraldehyde, highest yields were obtained when β-xylosidase was adsorbed on Duolite A 7 and when β-glucosidase was adsorbed on DEAE-sepharose.Enzyme preparations from S. sclerotiorum cultures were used in a biphasic (alcohol/aqueous) medium for the synthesis of alkyl-glycosides by trans-glycosylation of sugars and long-chain alcohols. The synthesis was studied under different conditions with primary and secondary alcohols as substrates, in the presence of free or immobilized enzyme. Xylan and cellobiose were used for the synthesis of alkyl-xylosides and alkyl-glucosides, respectively. The majority of the immobilized preparations were unable to catalyze the synthesis of alkyl-glycosides.Highest yields were obtained when using xylan and C4–C6-alcohols. The reaction produced alkyl-β-xyloside and alkyl-β-xylobioside, as confirmed by MS/MS. Up to 22mM iso-amyl-xyloside and 14mM iso-amyl-xylobioside were produced from iso-amyl alcohol and xylan.","AcknowledgementsWe thank Professor Elizabeth Goyvaerts (University of the North, South Africa) for critical reading of the manuscript.

The deuterium oxide (DO) dilution method for measuring body composition was validated against the widely used skinfold (SF) measurement-based equation of Durnin and Womersley. The study involved 10 lactating women living in a rural community in Nandi, Kenya and participating in a cross-sectional study aimed at determining their iron and vitamin A status. Methods. The selection criteria were exclusive breast-feeding, infants between 2 and 4 months of age, maternal parity < 4, birth weight more than 2 500 g and no congenital abnormalities. Maternal and infant anthropometric measurements were taken. DO (approximately 0.1 g 2H2O/kg body water) was given orally to each mother accordingly to the Maastricht protocol (DO) for total body water (TBW) determination. The 2H enrichment of the urine was measured using gas-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Blood samples were collected. Serum retinol and ferritin were determined using high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Body mass index (BMI) was determined as weight/height (m2). The Bland-Altman pair-wise comparison was used to compare maternal fat-free mass (FFM), body fat (BF) and percentage body fat (% BF) that were determined based on the DO and SF techniques. Results. Maternal mean (± standard deviation (SD)) for parity, age, BMI, haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin and serum retinol were 3 (2), 26 (4) years, 23.4 (4), 12.1 (1.8) g/dl, 10.3 (4.0) µg/l and 0.696 (0.300) µmol/l respectively. The FFM, BF and % BF accordingly to the DO and SF methods respectively were 44.0 (4.7) kg v. 42.9 (5.9) kg, 16.7 (8.8) kg v. 17.8 (7.5) kg and 26.2 (8.1)% v. 28.4 (6.4)%. Limits of agreement for underestimation of FFM and % BF were 4.4 kg (SEE 3.4) and 11.6% (SEE 5.8) respectively. Bias in the measurement of FFM and % BF was 1.1 kg (SEE 1.9), and —2.2% (SEE 3.3) respectively. Conclusion. The variability (5.8 - 17.5%) observed in the SF technique may result in lower prediction of % BF. This may be an important factor for community-based nutritional interventions that aim at improving the body composition of vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women or subjectswith severe undernutrition.",,,South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition,,,,2004-02,2004,2016-05-31,2004-02,17,1,10-15,Closed,Article,"Ettyang, G.A.; van Marken Lichtenbelt; Saris, W.H.M.; Oloo, A.","Ettyang, G.A.

Adults wishing to enrol in the Ikhwelo Project were required to have at least Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) Level 3 competency in English communication and numeracy. Certain prior assumptions made by the Department of Education were subsequently proved to be incorrect. These assumptions and their negative impact on the project and, in particular, the progress of the learners, will be discussed in this article. The implications of combining an outcomes-based approach to teaching/learning with non-mother tongue instruction is also discussed. This information, as well as the findings of two research projects and Ikhwelo staff members form the basis for recommendations for solving some of the problems arising from the Ikhwelo experience.",,,Language Matters,,,,2004-01,2004,,2004-01,35,2,363-375,Closed,Article,"Basel, Barbara","Basel, Barbara (Project Literacy, Pretoria, South Africa, E-mail:, Barbara@projectliteracy.org.za)",,"Basel, Barbara (Project Literacy, Pretoria, South Africa, E-mail:, Barbara@projectliteracy.org.za)",4,2,,1.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046353362,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

Analyses were made of the Matrices scores, an English Comprehension test, the Similarities subscale from the South African Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, end‐of‐year university grades, and high‐school grade point average. Out of the 36 Matrices problems, the African students solved an average of 23; East Indian students, 26; and White students, 29 ( p <.001), placing them at the 60th, 71st, and 86th percentiles, respectively, and yielding IQ equivalents of 103, 108, and 118 on the 1993 US norms. The same pattern of group differences was found on the Comprehension Test, the Similarities subscale, university course grades, and high‐school grade‐point average. The items on the Matrices ‘behaved’ in the same way for the African students as they did for the non‐African students, thereby indicating the test's internal validity. Item analyses, including a confirmatory factor analysis, showed that the African/non‐African difference was most pronounced on the general factor of intelligence. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by correlating the Matrices with the other measures, both individually and in composite. For the African group, the mean r =.28, p <.05, and for the non‐African group, the mean r =.27, p <.05. Although the intercepts of the regression lines for the two groups were significantly different, their slopes were not. The results imply that scores on the Raven's Matrices are as valid for Africans as they are for non‐Africans.",,,International Journal of Selection and Assessment,,,,2004-09,2004,2004-10-13,2004-09,12,3,220-229,Closed,Article,"Rushton, J.

It tested assertions by various writers about mass media, as applicable to a semi-urban or rural group of (black) South Africans with educational levels ranging from Grade 10 to Honours level. Owing to the fact that interviewees are financially constrained (and therefore cannot always afford television access or the acquisition of magazines), the focus of ‘persuasive messages’ was on billboard advertising in their living and work contexts. It was found that the consumers (respondents to the questionnaire) reacted positively to billboards that supported products on which they have been relying; that once they have been introduced to a product and found it efficient, competitive campaigns do not impinge on their stance; but also that – in this particular semi-urban area – traditional values folklore and usages have to be taken into consideration by advertisers for effective communication.",,,Communicatio,,,,2004-01,2004,,2004-01,30,2,98-113,Closed,Article,"Nagel, Pieter; Louw, Salomi","Nagel, Pieter (); Louw, Salomi ()",,"Nagel, Pieter (); Louw, Salomi ()",1,0,,0.28,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003110685,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

In recent years, children were moving from rural and township schools to suburban White schools. This trend emerged in the late 1980s and simmered after the demise of apartheid. At face value, school choice appears to be happening merely for the reason of accessing resources in the former Model C 1 schools. The author argues that school choice is not simply driven by a lack of resources in local schools or by the motivation to gain access to educational opportunities. It happens because of several factors, which the author analyzes through selected theories.

To this end, we use a noninteracting Anderson Hamiltonian. The conductance at zero temperature shows a complex behavior as a function of the Fermi energy. In particular, two well-defined energy regions are observed. Far from the site-energy of the quantum dots, the conductance depends smoothly on the Fermi energy. On the contrary, at the center of the band the conductance develops an oscillating pattern with resonances and antiresonances due to constructive and destructive interference in the ballistic channel, respectively.

Land use change was examined on five Communal Property Associations using remotely sensed images and quantitative and qualitative survey techniques. Land was abandoned or used less productively after redistribution. The primary reason for the lack of land use change to more productive states was that the land redistribution policy was not sufficiently sensitive to the diversity of rural livelihoods. Other reasons include farm-level general disorganization, lack of capital and labor, gender inequities, and age distribution. Regional political diseconomies also hindered change, namely poor tenure relations and a persistent urban bias.",,,Human Ecology,,,,2004-02,2004,,2004-02,32,1,49-75,Closed,Article,"McCusker, Brent","McCusker, Brent (Department of Geology and Geography, West Virginia University, 425 White Hall, P.O.

In this article, I argue that while it is important to maintain confidentiality on the disclosure of HIV, there is a limitation to this confidentiality. The information may be legally passed on to other particular persons under procedures prescribed by law and policy. In this article arguments are drawn from a literature study and an empirical investigation. The empirical investigation was conducted through the medium of an authentic case study, but was constructed hypothetically on a critical incident of HIV/AIDS in the school context. The school governing bodies (SGBs) were asked to respond to the case in terms of the actions they would take should such an event occur in the schools. SGBs of five schools were interviewed. This research clarifies the levels of understanding of HIV/AIDS legislation and policy and the practices likely to arise from such understandings in South African public schools. The findings amplify the distance between policy and practice and the need for vigilance with respect to legal challenges that schools might face without adequate knowledge of, and information on, the pandemic.",,,Africa Education Review,,,,2004-01,2004,,2004-01,1,1,113-127,Closed,Article,"Maile, S.","Maile, S.

The distribution of solar radiation (Rs) at the soil surface is calculated by the difference between total incoming solar radiation and radiation intercepted by the canopy of the trees. Soil evaporation at different distances from the tree row is calculated as a function of daily potential evaporation, local estimates of Rs, air humidity and humidity of the top soil layer. The soil evaporation routine of SWB-2D was tested using measurements obtained with solarimeter tubes and micro-lysimeters installed across a row in a peach orchard. In an additional experiment to test the lysimeter technique, the micro-lysimeter readings in bare and grass-covered areas in an open field were compared to reference evapotranspiration values calculated by the weather station. Simulated Rs fitted the measurements well, though the dimensions of the tree canopy had to be adjusted to obtain the best fit. Simulated evaporation fitted the micro-lysimeter measurements well in the bare soil area, and the evolution of evaporation patterns during soil drying was reproduced well. In the grass-covered areas, the mulching effect of dormant grass and the continuing transpiration by the active grass should be taken into account in order to accurately simulate soil evaporation.",,,South African Journal of Plant and Soil,,,,2004-01,2004,2013-01-15,2004-01,21,4,220-229,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Lobit, P; Mpandeli, N S; Annandale, J G; Jovanovic, N Z; du Sautoy, N","Lobit, P (Department of Plant Production and Soil Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, 0002); Mpandeli, N S (Department of Plant Production and Soil Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, 0002); Annandale, J G (Department of Plant Production and Soil Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, 0002); Jovanovic, N Z (Department of Earth Sciences, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, 7535); du Sautoy, N (Department Soil Science, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga, 0727)","Jovanovic, N Z (Department of Earth Sciences, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, 7535)","Lobit, P (University of Pretoria); Mpandeli, N S (University of Pretoria); Annandale, J G (University of Pretoria); Jovanovic, N Z (Department of Earth Sciences, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, 7535); du Sautoy, N (Department Soil Science, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga, 0727)",2,1,,0.2,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02571862.2004.10635053?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000459132,41 Environmental Sciences; 4106 Soil Sciences,

This work investigated the feasibility of coupling this property of Au nanopaticles with the catalytically sought-for features of MCM-41 (high surface area and large pores) to improve the catalytic properties of gold for the near-ambient oxidation of CO. Gold-containing derivatives of MCM-41 were prepared both directly during synthesis, and post-synthetically using preformed MCM-41. Large Au particles resulted from the former method as a result of the high calcination temperatures needed to remove the template, whereas smaller particles were obtained in the latter method due to starting with an already ordered material, and using low activation temperatures. Pre-modification of MCM-41, with Fe or Co before the post-synthesis incorporation of Au, improved the particle size distribution and the activity of the catalyst systems with compatible metal contents. The Co-based systems showed better catalytic activity than their Fe-based counterparts for the same Au content, a trend also observed for materials prepared by coprecipitation of the Au and the Fe or Co precursor in the presence of calcined Si-MCM-41.",,,Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis,"Recent Advances in the Science and Technology of Zeolites and Related Materials, Proceedings of the 14th International Zeolite Conference",,,2004,2004,,2004,154,,827-833,Closed,Chapter,"Mokhonoana, M.P.; Coville, N.J.; Datye, A.","Mokhonoana, M.P.

For many years it was believed that this species should be cultivated annually for better production, but without any scientific evidence. A study was undertaken at Towoomba Research Station, Limpopo Province, South Africa to evaluate no tillage (0C), one initial tillage (1C), annual tillage (AC) and two mulch treatments (0M + M as 2t hay ha–1). The study was conducted from 1990 to 1994, with a below average rainfall. It was done in a camp where the sward had a dense cover and a camp with an uneven, sparse cover. It can be concluded that with such rainfall seasons there was no necessity to aerate the grass, where the cover was dense. Mulch and tillage had a positive effect on DM production (1–2t ha–1), in areas with a sparse cover, but there was doubt that it had any financial benefit.",,,African Journal of Range and Forage Science,,,,2004-12,2004,,2004-12,21,3,201-203,Closed,Article,"Dannhauser, CS","Dannhauser, CS ()",,"Dannhauser, CS ()",1,0,,0.07,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070956728,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

Some of them were exposed to air for a period ranging from 1 day to 2 weeks. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a clean copper surface with a trace of oxygen. These films that were exposed to air presented oxides in the state Cu(II), the amount of CuO depended on the time that the film was exposed to air. Subsequently, we deposited TiO ultra-thin films on polycrystalline copper substrates. Both these thin films were formed by electron beam evaporation. XPS spectra showed that the surface of the titanium monoxide (TiO) films was contamination-free. An evaporation of 0.3nm of TiO reduced the native oxide of the copper substrates from Cu(II) to Cu(I) or Cu(0) and transformed the TiO into TiO2 at the interface. Low-energy ion spectroscopy showed that the complete coverage of the substrates depends on the thickness of the copper films. For 10nm copper thin films the complete coverage occurred at 1.5nm of TiO, and for 100nm it occurred at 2.0nm of TiO. In samples exposed to air, the complete coverage occurred at a film thickness slightly higher than those treated under ultra-high-vacuum conditions.","AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by the Chilean Government under grants FONDECYT No. 3990042, No. 1960739 and No. 11980002.

Technological properties related to water absorption, linear shrinkage and flexural strength were obtained from specific tests. Samples were prepared by pressing clay bodies at 20 MPa, which were then fired at temperatures from 850 to 1200 °C. The results showed that both clays from three deposits are highly plastic due to the elevated percentage of kaolinitic clay minerals. The samples richer in clay minerals present higher linear shrinkage as well as a decrease in water absorption in comparison to the others.

The prevalences were $13.6\% $ and $6.8\% $ for C. johni in Coquimbo and Huasco, respectively, while in P. monodon they were $18.2\% $ and $0.6\% $ in Coquimbo and Caldera, respectively. Between fishing grounds, no significant differences were found in the prevalence of infestation between male and female C. johni, but in Coquimbo, the prevalence of infestation in P. monodon was significantly higher in females. The sizes of infested squat lobsters were significantly lower than those of uninfested hosts. Males and females parasitized by P. monodon showed significantly lower body weights than uninfested hosts. Parasitized males of C. johni showed lower body weight than uninfested males. Only $0.6\% $ of ovigerous females of C. johni and none of P. monodon were infested. The near absence of infested ovigerous females suggests castration process in females. A nonlinear relationship was detected between host size and parasite size for both females and males. Multiple infestations of P. humboldtensis were found in both host species, but they were more common in P. monodon. Given the high prevalence of multiple infestations $(50\% )$ and the significantly lower body weights of infested P. monodon, we suggest that this host is more vulnerable to P. humboldtensis than is C. johni.",The authors especially thank the technician Danny Rivera for his help with onboard sampling and in the laboratory.

The granite waste came from an industry of stone sawing operations located in the municipal area of Santo Antônio de Pádua, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Initially the granite sawing waste was characterized in terms of chemical composition, particles size distribution and X-ray diffraction. After that, clay mixtures with 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40wt.% of granite waste were prepared. Red ceramic specimens were fabricated by extrusion and then fired in an industrial furnace at 970°C. The specimens were also tested to determine the water absorption, linear shrinkage and three points bending flexural strength. Microstructural evaluation was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and mercury porosimetry. The results indicate that granite waste presents favorable characteristics for addition into red ceramics due to facilities on the drying stages and decrease in porosity.","AcknowledgementsThe support provided by the Brazilian Agencies: FAPERJ (process number E-26/151.544/2001), CNPq and FENORTE/TECNORTE is gratefully acknowledged.",,Materials Science and Engineering A,,,,2004-05,2004,,2004-05,373,1-2,115-121,Closed,Article,"Vieira, C.M.F; Soares, T.M; Sánchez, R; Monteiro, S.N","Vieira, C.M.F (Advanced Materials Laboratory-LAMAV, State University of the North Fluminense-UENF, Av.

In contrast to the powerful FR 2 galaxies with edge-brightened lobes, the low radio power FR 1 galaxies in our sample do not exhibit any high MIR or FIR dust luminosity, which is typical for a buried, intrinsically more luminous AGN. This consolidates the fact already inferred from optical studies that their AGNs have only a relatively low luminosity. Also the FR 1 galaxies show a high FIR/MIR luminosity ratio, compared to quasars, suggesting that their FIR luminosity is substantially powered by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of the giant elliptical hosts. Finally, we discuss the FR 1 – FR 2 morphological dichotomy. FR 1 galaxies do not have more interstellar matter (ISM) than FR 2s as traced – on the large scale – by the cool FIR emitting dust and – in the nuclear region – by the warm MIR emitting dust. Due to the lack of central gas we suggest that the black holes of our FR 1 galaxies are fed at a lower accretion rate than those of the FR 2 galaxies.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2004-10-11,2004,2004-10-11,2004-11,426,2,l29-l32,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Müller, S.

A cluster of very red Cubewanos is firmly identified in orbits of low inclination and eccentricity beyond 40 AU from the Sun. Further correlations between surface colours and dynamical parameters (inclination and perihelion distance) are suggested for Cubewanos and scattered disk objects, but lack complete confidence for their reality. Plutinos and Centaurs do not show any clear correlation between surface colours and orbital parameters. We present in this paper 12 spectra obtained in the visible region and nine of them for which we obtained also near infrared spectra up to 2.4 microns. A few other objects have been observed, but the data are still under reduction and analysis. The principal reported results obtained are: (i) a wide range of visible slopes; (ii) evidence for surface variations on 2001 PT13; and (iii) possible detection of few percent of water ice (1999 TC36, 2000 EB173, 1999 DE9, 2001 PT13, 2000 QC243, 1998 SG35).",,,,The First Decadal Review of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt,"John K.

The small larval size of many marine species presents significant challenges to culture, however, these highly valuable fish offer considerable promise for aquaculture. A particularly attractive group for marine aquaculture is the flatfish. The California halibut, Paralichthys californicus, with a range in nature from Washington State south to Baja California Sur, Mexico is one such species. With the goal of enhancing the fishery for this species, a hatchery program was developed over a decade ago. The hatchery at Redondo Beach, California, maintains a group of adults that routinely spawn throughout most of each year. Further development of routine culture and juvenile growout techniques ultimately aimed at commercial aquaculture was initiated last year with support from the California Sea Grant College Program. Profitable commercial ventures culturing various flatfish species already exist in other parts of the world, but development of a flatfish culture industry in California confronts unique challenges. Two challenges in particular are the relatively high cost of energy and stringent environmental regulations. To meet these challenges, a culture system built around recirculation technology is being developed that would allow for an energy-efficient industrial-like approach to the culture of California halibut while minimizing environmental impacts.",,,Journal of Applied Aquaculture,,,,2004-01-14,2004,,2004-01-14,14,3-4,143-154,Closed,Article,"Conklin, Douglas E.; Piedrahita, Raul H.; Merino, German E.; Muguet, Jean-Benoit; Bush, Douglas E.; Gisbert, Enric; Rounds, James; Cervantes-Trujano, Margarita","Conklin, Douglas E.

Upon metathesis of methyl linoleate, substrate conversions of ca. 95 and 78% were obtained in 2h with the W(O-2,6-C6H3Ph2)2Cl4/Me4Sn and W(O-2,6-C6H3Cl2)2Cl4/Me4Sn catalytic systems respectively. The lower activity of the W(O-2,6-C6H3Cl2)2Cl4/Me4Sn catalytic system was attributed to the highly deactivating nature of the Cl substituents on the o,o′-position of the aryloxide ligand. Highly electron-withdrawing Cl substituents cause the tungsten atom to be electron-deficient and thus more susceptible to attack by the electron-rich ester groups. However, the W(O-2,6-C6H3Cl2)2Cl4/Me4Sn system was more selective towards dicarboxylic esters. The latter are interesting starting materials for the synthesis of polyesters and polyamides.

The sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus acclimated at 15°C, 18°C and 21°C exposed to a rising thermal stress showed a series of well-defined responses.2. All responses were significantly different and stage E4, characterized when the sea urchins ceased moving, relaxed the large spines but the smaller spines continued to make small movements. This was considered to be the critical thermal maximum (CTMax).3. The resistance of S. franciscanus is independent of the acclimation interval used in this work.4. The effect of the CTMax on the osmotic pressure of the sea urchin body fluid acclimated at 18°C was significantly different (P<0.05) when compare to the 15°C and 21°C conditions.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the scuba divers and fisherman of the Ejido Coronel Esteban Cantú, S.

Each body posture was considered to represent a particular TRB, which was ranked in a sequence that reflected different degrees of thermal load and was assigned an arbitrary thermoregulatory score. During summer, birds exhibited eight different TRBs, mainly oriented to heat dissipation, and experienced a wide range of Ta (from 14 to 31°C), occasionally above their thermoneutral zone (TNZ, from 2 to 30°C), this being evident by observations of extreme thermoregulatory responses such as panting. In winter, birds exhibited only three TRBs, mainly oriented to heat retention, and experienced a smaller range of Ta (from 11 to 18°C), always within the TNZ, even at night. The components of behavioural responses increased directly with the heat load which explains the broader behavioural repertoire observed in summer. Since penguins are primarily adapted in morphology and physiology to cope with low water temperatures, our results suggest that behavioural thermoregulation may be important in the maintenance of the thermal balance in Humboldt penguins while on land.","Roberto Villablanca, Angelo Navarro and Nele Markones provided valuable help in the field.

We used laboratory culture experiments to study the effect of temperature and nutrient addition on the per capita production of oogonia and sporophytes from Macrocystis pyrifera female gametophytes. Our results indicate that individual multicellular female gametophytes can give rise to more than one oogonium and that per capita oogonia production significantly increases with the enhancement of culture conditions (i.e., decreased temperature and increased nutrient concentration).

The IP3 content in the tissue samples was determined by a radioreceptor analysis. The amounts of IP3 remained unchanged during the intermediate stages of spawning and increased when the release of gametes had just been completed. The content of this compound in the gonads decreased as the gonadal maturation proceeded. IP3 does not appear to be significantly involved in the process of gametogenesis but may be involved in the mechanism of spawning.

X-ray diffraction shows that the films are polycrystalline, in the tetragonal phase. Raman Spectroscopy shows the cubic phase in the 30 nm films and the tetragonal phase in the 300 nm films. The values of the refractive index obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry indicate that the films contain, also, an amorphous phase. We think that the amorphous phase contributes to high resistivity, I–V measurements present typical resistivity values in the range of 1011 to 1012 Ω-cm, and that the crystalline phase is responsible of the ferroelectric behavior. The latter was observed in 300 nm thick films, showing unsaturated hysteresis loops. However, 30 nm films present rounded hysteresis loops, due to current leakage. Both cases were demonstrated by a numerical simulation of the ferroelectric capacitor, which fits the experimental measurements. The dielectric constant and loss factor are affected, also, by the amorphous character of the films.","This work was partially supported by FONDECYT grants N° 3990066, N° 1010548, N° 1030642, N° 1980285 and Fundación Andes grant N° C-12510.

                  Factors affecting seabird distribution in the Humboldt Current upwelling system in northern Chile were studied in January 1999 using ship transect counts. Of 24 species recorded, the Peruvian booby (Sula variegata), the kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and the Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) were the most abundant. Species composition varied among different areas of the system and distribution patterns differed substantially among eight of the more abundant species. Most species showed links to variation in environmental factors (trawler distribution, SST and chlorophyll concentration). Principal component analysis identified a feeding-flock factor as the most important one for explaining observed distribution patterns. One-third of all birds recorded were associated in feeding flocks and 3% of all individuals were directly attending fishing vessels.","The project was funded by the Volkswagen-Stiftung (“Effects of the marine environment on at-sea distribution, feeding ecology, reproduction and energetics of seabirds in northern Chile”, Az. I/74 573). G. Cubillos, V. Dierschke, and T. Ponce helped with the ornithological fieldwork. M. Castro, P. Lagos, and R.

It is shown that a finite element model based on the geometric parameters of the rod can be reconstructed from one eigenpair, that is, one eigenvalue and its respective eigenvector. This reconstruction permits development of an inverse eigenvalue procedure for damage detection. The procedure is sensitive to perturbations for a large order model. The use of overdetermined data decreases sensitivity, although this may lead to a more expensive procedure. Therefore, we use a new technique for filtering the information from a single eigenpair to obtain a realizable and less expensive procedure.",,,Computers & Mathematics with Applications,,,,2004-02,2004,,2004-02,47,4-5,643-657,Closed,Article,"Jiménez, R.D; Santos, L.C; Kuhl, N.M; Egaña, J.C; Soto, R.L","Jiménez, R.D (Departamento de Matemática Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Santos, L.C (Departamento de Matemática Aplicada Instituto de Matemática e Estatística Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil); Kuhl, N.M (Departamento de Matemática Aplicada Instituto de Matemática e Estatística Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil); Egaña, J.C (Departamento de Matemática Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Soto, R.L (Departamento de Matemática Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Jiménez, R.D (University of Antofagasta); Santos, L.C (Universidade de São Paulo); Kuhl, N.M (Universidade de São Paulo); Egaña, J.C (Catholic University of the North); Soto, R.L (Catholic University of the North)",10,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036890987,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences",

In practice, however, bricks have been produced at temperatures as low as 600 °C. In the present work the possibility of lower temperature solid state sintering of clay particles is theoretically explained based on geometrical aspects, vacancy diffusion and active surface bonding consolidation. A model of close-packed discs of a few micrometers in diameter and nanoscale thickness is proposed to explain a much more efficient sintering process for clay minerals than the classical spherical particle model. The proposed disc model presents specific characteristics of high contact surface area, lower porosity and nanoscale pores. The initial vacancy diffusion sintering rate is constant and several orders of magnitude greater than for the classical model. At 600 °C the completion of dehydroxylation in the clay crystals turns their flat surfaces into active sites for bonding consolidation.","AcknowledgementsThe support provided by the Brazilian Agencies: FAPERJ (process number E-26/151.544/2001), CNPq and FENORTE is gratefully acknowledged.",,Ceramics International,,,,2004-01,2004,,2004-01,30,3,381-387,Closed,Article,"Monteiro, S.N; Vieira, C.M.F","Monteiro, S.N (State University of the North Fluminense, UENF Advanced Materials Laboratory, LAMAV Av.

Digenite (Cu1.8S) was the main reaction product at 160–212 °C, and chalcocite (Cu2S) at 225 °C. The reaction was characterized by the formation of a compact layer of copper sulfide around the sphalerite nuclei. Final particles retained the size and shape of the original ZnS. Reaction rate followed a parabolic kinetic law. No significant effect of aqueous copper concentration was observed in the range 1–10 g/L. An activation energy of 147 kJ/mol was obtained, indicating kinetic control by solid-state counter diffusion of Cu+ and Zn2+ ions through the copper sulfide layer. A possible electrochemical mechanism is discussed. The removal of zinc from digenite or chalcocite bearing copper concentrates is effective at ∼225 °C, in which a high sphalerite conversion can be achieved in times allowing autoclave processing (∼1 h).",AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank the Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile) for the financial support of this research in the framework of a Doctorate Program in collaboration with the Universidad de Barcelona (Spain).

This is of significance owing to the role of the active layer in processes governing development of the periglacial morphogenetic zone. Local factors—including moisture content, vegetation cover, and slope aspect—are important determinants of active-layer thickness and its variability in the Calypsostranda area.

It is known that the consequencesof the situation will depend on the quality and quantity of decisions which they makeor allow to occur at the critical time. Based on this concept, the Local System of Tsunami Alert (SLAT; Spanish) was developed. This is a computational tool designed for the automatic implementation of integral management for an emergency of this type.The System is able to immediately evaluate possible risks and determine thetype of alert represented (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Celeste) if relevantdata such as coordinates of the epicenter, magnitude, date, and origin of theearthquake (>6.5° on the Richter scale) threatening the Pacific areknown. Other relevant data include location of the coastal or marine epicentreand the superficial hypocenter. The relevant data may now be obtained fromthe internet from international seismological services, and fed into the programto give the most probable time for arrival of the first wave train at a given pointof interest, whether this be a port, bathing area, generating plant, or coastal city.The program also gives the time required for the first wave train to arrive at agiven coast, and displays a menu of previously planned actions to be taken accordingto the type of alert. It also permits dissemination of a bulletin with critical data and action plans by fax or e-mail to scattered users as well as for storage on the computer disc. The system is designed in a way that the user always confirms with authorities that anevent has in fact been generated. On a local scale, the user is required to prepare an operative emergency plan of action to be followed by his company, community, or municipality, to be followed for each type of alert.The System permits carrying out test exercises with the users, as well as simulationof past events. Knowledge concerning past events permits understanding correctdesign of emergency action plans for mitigation of potential present and future events.This software is specifically designed for the Pacific Coast of South America, and isprepared in Spanish, with the intention of improving responses of inhabitants of coastalareas to the potential threat from tsunamis.",,,Natural Hazards,,,,2004-01,2004,,2004-01,31,1,129-142,Closed,Article,"Ramirez, F.

The second level represents circuits of equipment needed to carry out the tasks of each system. (2) The superstructures are modeled mathematically including the selection of equipment, mass balance, and operational conditions. (3) The objective function is the maximization of profits.With the help of examples that are included to demonstrate the advantages of the procedure, it is shown that the method can be useful in deciding the configuration of the flotation circuits and the operational conditions.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank CONICYT for financial support, through Fondecyt Project 1020892.",,International Journal of Mineral Processing,,,,2004-11,2004,,2004-11,74,1-4,121-131,Closed,Article,"Cisternas, Luis A.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Zavala, Marı́a F.; Magna, Julio","Cisternas, Luis A.

Process flow patterns regularly range from single-solvent circulation loops to schemes employing solvent and aqueous bypass or intermediate solvent recycle. The design of these processes using graphical methods runs into a series of complications produced by the coupling of the flow loops. In this paper, a graphical method is developed for the preliminary analysis of different flow structures for these coupled circuits. The method is simple and can be performed by hand.

We released newly molted sexually receptive females of the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus in the field and recorded their interactions with males. In the dense aggregations in which these shrimp live, most females were encountered and seized by males within 2 min. Usually, females were first seized by subordinate males, and subsequently taken over by the dominant males. Many females (17 out of 23) had multiple mates during the 10-min observation period, and most of them received spermatophores from multiple males. Males used different mating tactics in accordance with their dominance status: subordinate males often used the sneaking tactic, seizing the female and immediately transferring spermatophores. In contrast, all dominant males used the primary mating tactic; they seized and stimulated the female before transferring spermatophores. Results from previous studies had indicated that females may reduce the fertilization chances of subordinate males by delaying spawning and removing spermatophores. We suggest that this capability in combination with the observed rapid mate succession may enable females to exploit male contest behaviors.",We are grateful to W. Stotz and I.

It argues that there has never been a strong consensus in the HE community regarding the content of a new policy framework. In particular, the analysis focuses on the limits imposed by the neoliberal macro-economic policy framework, Growth, Employment and Redistribution, which drastically reduced the new state’s abilities to coherently steer and plan the fundamental reconstruction and transformation of HE. The article also examines the most recent phase in the development of HE policy, which has been largely to do with attaining institutional efficiencies through mergers—a key element of HE restructuring across the globe during the past two decades.

Here we systematize and extend these results, in particular allowing the sets to be complex. The leading idea is that one can associate to any nonrealizable set Γ a certain negativity N(Γ), and to any realizable set Λ a certain positivity M(Λ). Then, under appropriate conditions, if M(Λ)⩾N(Γ) we can conclude that Γ∪Λ is the spectrum of a nonnegative matrix.

Genetic differentiation was analysed at 21 protein-coding loci. The results were compared to those for three other populations/breeds: representatives of established Western breeds, crossbred dogs of Western descent from rural areas in South Africa, and indigenous Saluki dogs from the Middle East. Nine polymorphic loci were found (Ak-1,-2, Ck, Per, Hb, Po-A-1 to-3 andPo-Tf). Two unique alleles at theCk andPo-A-2 loci separated the Africanis breed from the other groups. There were also significant differences between Africanis and the other breeds in pair-wise comparisons of allelic frequencies at polymorphic loci. An assignment test, fixation index values, gene flow and genetic distance values indicated a closer genetic association between the Africanis and Saluki breeds than with dogs of Western origin. This finding supports archaeological evidence that the endemic Africanis breed was introduced from the Middle East into Africa thousands of years ago, and not through later western influences. The average heterozygosity ranged from 0.106–0.15, with least heterozygosity in the Africanis and most in the rural crossbred group. The percentage of polymorphic loci, the mean number of alleles per locus (biologically more significant than heterozygosity), and conformation of genotypes to Hardy-Weinberg proportions showed no evidence of recent loss of genetic diversity in Africanis. Genetic differentiation and support of archaeological evidence by genetics indicate that the endemic southern African domestic dog breed is unique.",,,Mammal Research,,,,2004-09,2004,,2004-09,49,3,369-382,Closed,Article,"Greyling, Letitia M.; Grobler, Paul J.; Van der Bank, Herman F.; Kotze, Antoinette","Greyling, Letitia M.

Livestock were not the only source of income for pastoral households. Livestock farming was a post-retirement activity and a way of supplementing pension grants, suggesting that pastoralism could be a dying tradition. Pastoralists concentrated on keeping as many animals as possible (by selling and slaughtering animals only when it was necessary to buy food and supply household meat) to reduce the risk of destitution. Goats and sheep were not kept for sacrificial purposes. Besides making their individual choices, pastoralists employed a range of risk-mitigating farming strategies (manipulating herd composition, spatial distribution and timing of grazing) to maximise the efficient harvesting of available forage and water resources. This emphasised the variable nature of the motives underlying herd management practices. Alliances among pastoralists were mainly a matter of mutual convenience and maintaining social ties with kin or friends from another herd.",,,African Journal of Range and Forage Science,,,,2004-07,2004,,2004-07,21,1,29-36,Closed,Article,"Hendricks, HH; Midgley, JJ; Bond, WJ; Novellie, PA","Hendricks, HH (); Midgley, JJ (); Bond, WJ (); Novellie, PA ()",,"Hendricks, HH (); Midgley, JJ (); Bond, WJ (); Novellie, PA ()",10,0,,0.67,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070956707,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,
269,pub.1039793520,10.1071/mf04040,,,A simple approach for dealing with dynamics and uncertainty in fisheries with heterogeneous resource and effort distribution,"Most fisheries models are based on dynamic pool assumptions. For sedentary and sessile species, these assumptions are inadequate, because they are spatially distributed in patches that vary in size, density and age structure. A simple bioeconomic model, negative binomial (NEGBIN), is proposed; this model relaxes the dynamic pool assumption without entering into the complexities of a geographically structured model. NEGBIN assumes a probability density function (the negative binomial), to describe heterogeneity in the density distribution over the population range. The model incorporates decision theory and different levels of risk aversion in resource management. The uncertainty associated with alternative fishing strategies, given imperfect knowledge about virgin stock biomass, is also included in the analysis. The model is applied to the Mesodesma donacium (surf clam) fishery in the central northern zone of Chile (South America). Alternative management strategies are evaluated with different levels of risk aversion. In the fisheries literature to date, this approach to evaluating the uncertainty associated with spatial allocation decisions has been rare. It is suggested that this kind of analysis, whether accompanied by quantitative probabilities of alternative states of nature or not, is an alternative way of dealing with risk and uncertainty in spatial allocation decisions.","We wish to express our gratitude to Miguel Angel Cabrera, Daniel Hernandez and Marian Hylkema for their useful comments on the first draft of this manuscript.

Specifically it concerns the poetry of Lesego Rampolokeng as an example of this strategy. It examines specific cultural influences that give Rampolokeng's poetry its syncretic and non-aligned aspect, notably praise poetry and the poetry of the Black Consciousness movement. The syncretism of Rampolokeng's work can also be related to poetry of the diaspora, in particular the Caribbean dub poets. The argument demonstrates how Rampolokeng uses the debasing techniques of Caribbean dub and the tactics of the carnivalesque to subvert privileged forms of ""high art"" poetry and de-centre hegemonic discourse.

Over a study period of 24 days, the average specific growth rate (SGR) observed was 1.4% and the feed conversion (FC) was 0.84g feed/g fish weight. Daily mortality rate observed was 0.09%, with an overall survival of 98%. At the end of the study, average bottom coverage reached 262% (8kg/m2). This study demonstrated that RAS technology in combination with shallow raceways allows high fish densities, improves overall productivity, decreases water pump requirements, and enhances reliability by having better control over environmental and operational parameters. Additional, longer period studies must be conducted to fully validate and approach this combined-technology to the commercial stage.","AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank Tecnofish S.A. for allowing using their installations, and to the entire staff for their technical as well personal support.

Morphological and reproductive aspects of this alga are dependent on environmental conditions and geographic distribution, and the present study gives data on its reproductive periodicity. The reproductive phenology for three populations from northern Chile (29–30°S) was evaluated by means of seasonal examination of morphological and reproductive characteristics of both macroscopic sporophytes and microscopic gametophytes. Comparative laboratory cultures of spores were made to determine seasonal differences in their capacity to produce viable plants. This species is perennial, and demonstrates year‐round presence of reproductive tissues, although showing variation in reproductive phenology over time and among populations. The size of blades increases in spring and summer, whereas its reproductive potential (e.g., area and proportion of the reproductive tissue and the release of spores) increases in autumn. Culture experiments showed that spring and summer reproductive tissue released zoospores which had low germination rates compared to those of autumn and winter, and which produced female gametophytes of low fertility. The population differences depended on the character analysed and the season of the year. The development of both phases of the life cycle of L. trabeculata may be influenced by the local environmental conditions and their seasonal changes, and were expressed as morphological and/ or reproductive changes in the plants. A better understanding of the seasonal adaptations may be obtained if future comparisons are made between widely separated populations or between individuals from the extremes of geographic distribution of the species.",,,New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,2004-06,2004,,2004-06,38,2,255-266,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Tala, Fadia; Edding, Mario; Vásquez, Julio","Tala, Fadia (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, P.O.Box 117, Coquimbo, Chile, E-mail:, ftala@ucn.cl); Edding, Mario (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, P.O.Box 117, Coquimbo, Chile); Vásquez, Julio (Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, P.O.Box 117, Coquimbo, Chile)","Tala, Fadia (Catholic University of the North)","Tala, Fadia (Catholic University of the North); Edding, Mario (Catholic University of the North); Vásquez, Julio (Catholic University of the North)",43,6,,3.09,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00288330.2004.9517235?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044194538,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology; 41 Environmental Sciences,

This paper reports on the National Indigenous Games Research Project of 2001/2002 in which eleven tertiary institutions collaborated. Researchers from these institutions collected data from 6489 participants through questionnaires (quantitative data on trends, content and nature of games), triangulated with focus groups, case studies, observations and visual recordings (qualitative data). The sample is representative of the ethnic, gender, geographic (urban and rural), and socio-economic diversity in all nine provinces of the Republic of South Africa. A rationale is offered for an ethno-scientific taxonomy, representing a culturally informed reconstruction of South African children's games. The paper explores and reports on game preference, socio-cultural themes and play behaviour. An analysis of the theoretical underpinnings, participant-constructed meanings, reasons for playing and play patterns are reflected upon.

Independent living and the threat of incarceration: a human right,"To research what empowerment and independent living meant to physically impaired people with severe impairments, and to consider whether their understanding and interpretation of empowerment equates to the politically generated version of empowerment and independent living as described in the Direct Payments Act 1996. An important element of the research was to consider the issue of impairment in the empowerment of physically impaired people with severe impairments within current social models of disability, i.e. current field of disability studies the need for a social model of impairment. As the research progressed it became evident that the Direct Payments Act was not about empowerment, but rather a process of ‘enablement’ in which the principles of empowerment and independent living espoused by physically impaired people was fundamentally different to the politically‐generated version inherent within the Act itself. The findings revealed that empowerment and independent living transcended the realms of the political rhetoric of ‘enablement’ and was seen as a rights issue in which ‘the right to live in ones own home or accommodation within mainstream society and community without fear of incarceration in a residential institution’ was accorded the status of a fundamental human right.",,,Disability & Society,,,,2004-06,2004,,2004-06,19,4,307-321,Closed,Article,"*, Stewart Houston","*, Stewart Houston (University of Northumbria, UK)",,"*, Stewart Houston (Northumbria University)",6,0,,1.54,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001413928,44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work,

We achieved a photometric accuracy of 0.07 ... 0.12 mag in spite of rather unfavourable locations of most stars near the plate borders. 17 field stars turned out to be variables, most of them with time scales of 1000-8000 days in the form of slow waves with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.3 mag, i.e. below the threshold of traditional variable searches on photographic plates. About 50% of these new long-term variables exhibit drifts indicating periodic or erratic variability at much longer time scales than covered here. For the 23 known variables we achieved improvements in their periods and amplitudes and detected long-term variations (drifts, waves) in about 50% of them. The above fraction of low-amplitude long-term variables among field stars implies that a total of about 45 000 new variables should be detectable in the Sonneberg patrol plate archive.

Samples of both species were taken in wave-exposed and wave-protected areas. In addition, spore production, germination and early growth rate of sporophytes of each population was studied at monthly intervals under three temperature and salinity regimes. Results indicate that M. integrifolia from northern Chile presents perennial plants with a mean density of three individuals per 0.25 m2 throughout the year and that it reproduces mainly during spring and winter. Although, M. pyrifera in exposed areas of southern Chile also have a perennial-type life strategy, they are able to reproduce all year round. In contrast, M. pyrifera populations in protected areas of southern Chile show a clear annual cycle, with high recruitment during late winter and fertile sporophytes in summer and autumn, although the populations become completely decimated thereafter. The effect of temperature and salinity on M. integrifolia shows that it is independent of water movement, but requires low temperatures and high salinities for the release of zoospores, germination and early sporophyte growth. This pattern differs from that of M. pyrifera in southern Chile, which has a broader tolerance range for salinity and temperature than does M. integrifolia. However, in southern Chile wave-protected populations showed higher spore release and germination at 15°C and 18°C, whereas sporophyte growth responded better at the lowest temperature tested (8°C). In general, these results are contrary to those expected, since a seasonal reproductive pattern was observed in M. integrifolia inhabiting a less seasonally variable environment. In exposed sites of southern Chile, plants showed greater tolerance and continuous reproduction throughout the year, despite the greater environmental variability. Finally, population dynamics of protected kelps in southern Chile shows an annual pattern, which is contrary to the expected perennial strategy shown by exposed populations.","This paper was funded by FONDECYT (Chile) 1000044 and 1010706.

Throughout Africa, Europe and the United States of America he has played a major role in the development, teaching and promotion of African literature. He has written autobiographies, criticism, works of fiction, poetry, plays and essays. Throughout his career he has brought dynamism, individuality and an unremitting clarity of purpose to African Letters. In a profound sense he has promoted through his own life, his writing and his often-controversial career the dignity of ordinary people and specifically the well-being of black South Africans. Chabani Manganyi, Mphahlele's biographer, in his introduction to Bury me at the marketplace , characterizes his subject as “a voice in the prophetic mode” (1983: 1). Indeed, from his earliest writings Mphahlele has attempted to grapple with and define the essential humanity of people. In this sense he became one of the most eloquent formulators of intellectual resistance to apartheid. Although he wrote exclusively in English he has through his writings transcended the narrow confines of ethnicity and language to promote what he has called African Humanism – Ubuntu, Botho, Vumunhu, Vhuthu – an awareness of African values and the generosity of ordinary human beings, reaching beyond voyeuristic glances through the keyhole – in contradistinction to his own experience: “In Southern Africa, the black writer talks best about the ghetto life he knows; the white writer best about his own ghetto life. We see each other, black and white, as it were through a keyhole” (Mphahlele, 1962: 81).

As with numerous other muricacean snails, this species engages in communal egg laying, with females depositing egg capsules in clusters on subtidal rocks. Each cluster of capsules contains 100–150 pedunculate, ampulliform egg capsules, with each capsule containing an average of 2,600 small (130 μm) eggs. Intracapsular development was followed using light and scanning electron microscopy to describe the successive embryonic stages of the species. Free-swimming veliger larvae of about 225 μm length were released from capsules after 49 days incubation at 13.6°C. The planktotrophic larvae were cultured in seawater aquaria by feeding with pure cultures of phytoplankton, recording growth and form of the larvae. Larvae reached competence after 4 months at 22°C, at 1,450–1,740 μm in size, and a few larvae were observed through metamorphosis and early definitive growth. The embryonic-larval development of T. chocolata coincides with the general characteristics of the ontogeny observed in other Thais species as well as of other genera of the Rapaninae such as Concholepas. This lent support to grouping these genera into a single clade. The lack of knowledge of the development of free larvae of Thais spp. means that we do not know whether these similarities also include an extensive larval phase as generally characteristic of other members of the clade. The mode of development may be useful in characterizing some clades of this family. Thus for example, the transference of some Thais to the genus Nucella (Subfamily Ocenebrinae) is supported by differences in the mode of embryonic development, which differentiates these subfamilies. Paleobiological data reported for Neogastropoda allow postulation of primitiveness in planktotrophic larval development compared to more recent developmental strategies such as direct development of different types, which characterize various clades of this family.",We would like to thank Unidad de Producción de la Universidad Católica del Norte and Mr. Helmo Pérez for cooperation during this study.

252,pub.1030358378,10.1016/j.epsl.2004.05.006,,,Different sulfate sources and their post-depositional migration in Atacama soils,"Sulfate is one of the major salts accumulated in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, Chile. Its origin has been attributed to local weathering, volcanic source, sea salt, and atmosphere deposition. Previous studies concluded that atmospheric sulfate is present in the desert, but this term was poorly defined in terms of chemical origin, and its contribution to the total sulfate budget in soil is debated. The contribution of each potential sulfate source is expected to vary geographically due to different source locations. Efforts to quantify the contribution from each source have been hampered by the lack of well-defined isotopic compositions for its end-members. In this study, we discard the vague term of “atmospheric sulfate” by recognizing two major sulfate sources on the basis of their formation pathways: primary and secondary sulfate. Primary sulfate, including those from rock weathering, sea salt, and volcanic ash leachates, do not have an 17O anomaly. Secondary sulfate, derived from the oxidation of reduced sulfur gases (biological or volcanic emissions) by atmospheric ozone or hydrogen peroxide, however, has an 17O anomaly. We developed a method to extract water-soluble anions sequentially or entirely from bulk soil samples, and analyzed the sulfate concentrations and 17O anomalies for four geographically representative soil profiles in the central Atacama Desert (23°S to 25.5°S). We found that sequential sulfate extractions on the same soil sample produce sulfate with decreasing Δ17O values. Except for a positive bulge at 20 to 50 cm in depth, there is a general increase in the Δ17O value for total sulfate with soil depth for all the four soil profiles that we examined. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that secondary sulfates (17O-anomalous sulfates) are more soluble and thus preferentially leached in liquid water than primary sulfate. The finding also warns that incomplete sulfate extraction from sulfate-rich soils yields unpredictable results. We infer a Δ17O value of ∼4.6‰ for secondary sulfate based on data from partial sulfate extraction experiments. Total contribution of secondary sulfate in the central Atacama Desert is estimated to range from 9% to 24%, with the highest percentage in the Central Depression.","This study is supported by Louisiana State University (LSU).

While inclusion in national and international MBA league‐tables is part of the marketing arsenal of every MBA supplier that appears in them, identifying the determinants of success in this ever more crowded marketplace is a far less well understood issue. On the one hand, recognition of the fact that the task is more complex than a simple application of the traditional 4Ps is obvious to all, but on the other hand, operationalisation of relationship marketing principles seems rather too complex in this market where repeat purchase is clearly not the norm. This paper seeks to shed some light on this important but little understood area. We first examine the task through the traditional services marketing mix; comprised of Product, Price, Place, Promotion and People. Then, based on a sample of 507 current MBA students spread across the twelve different state‐subsidised universities in South Africa, determine whether this is indeed the appropriate model, deriving instead a new seven‐element model of the underlying success factors for student recruitment in the MBA marketplace.",,,Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management,,,,2004-11,2004,,2004-11,26,3,401-417,Closed,Article,"*, Jonathan Ivy; Naude´, Peter","*, Jonathan Ivy (University of Leicester, UK); Naude´, Peter (University of Bath, UK)","*, Jonathan Ivy (University of Leicester)","*, Jonathan Ivy (University of Leicester); Naude´, Peter (University of Bath)",21,0,,4.76,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004658099,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

The aim of this study was to globally compare and quantify how shallow hard‐bottom communities are affected by UV during early succession. Identical field experiments in 10 different coastal regions of both hemispheres produced a consistent but unexpected pattern: (i) UV radiation affected species diversity and community biomass in a very similar manner, (ii) diversity and biomass were reduced to a larger extent by UVA than UVB radiation, (iii) ambient UV levels did not affect the composition of the communities, and (iv) any UV effects disappeared during species succession after 2–3 months. Thus, current levels of UV radiation seem to have small, predictable, and transient effects on shallow marine hard‐bottom communities.","We gratefully acknowledge financial support by GTZ Proklima, Namibia &amp; Germany.

En el presente trabajo se evalan las diferencias morfolgicas entre distintas muestras del Perodo Arcaico Tardo de la costa de Arica y Norte Semirido. Para ello, se emple la informacin derivada del relevamiento de rasgos mtricos (177 individuos no deformados) y no mtricos (288 individuos) en materiales de las siguientes localidades: Morro 1-1/6, Morro Arica Uhle, El Cerrito y Punta de Teatinos. El procesamiento de la informacin se realiz mediante la utilizacin de tablas de contingencia y distancias MMD para los rasgos discretos, anlisis de componentes principales, anlisis discriminante, anlisis de la varianza y clculo de valores D para caracteres mtricos. Los resultados obtenidos indican la presencia de diferencias estadsticamente significativas entre las muestras empleadas, lo cual constituye una prueba importante acerca de la existencia de una poblacin arcaica costera estructurada espacialmente. Todo parece indicar el desarrollo de fases de un mismo proceso de divergencia a partir de una poblacin ancestral comn, varios cientos de generaciones ms antigua que contena la mayor parte de la variacin gentica observada. La segregacin espacial de cuatro modelos fenotpicos representados por cada una de las muestras es el producto de fuerzas evolutivas que determinaron por migracin, deriva y aislamiento las diferencias morfolgicas entre ambas regiones In this paper we determine the unit or most probable diversity for the archaic groups of Northern coast of Chile and infer the microevolutionary factors that determined the existence of an earlier structuring of the population. Metric (177 non-deformed individuals) and non-metric (288 individuals) features were recorded for samples from the sites of Morro 1-1/6, Morro Arica Uhle (Arid Northern Chile), El Cerrito and Punta de Teatinos (Semiarid Northern Chile). The data was processed by means of contingency tables and MMD distances analysis for discret traits and univariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, discriminant analysis and calculation of D values for metric features. An evaluation of the non-metric traits distribution provides initial proof for the true existence of a structured Archaic coastal population based on the differences found amongst the samples. This spatial structure is supported by the distribution of distinct discreet traits as well as the specific frequencies within each group but without evidencing any apparent tendencies from north to south. Evidence seems to indicate the action of random mechanisms and the presence of phases in the same evolutionary process starting, maybe hundreds of generations previously, from a much older common ancestral population that contained most of the genetic variation observed. The analysis of metric feature distributions provided similar results. Four phenotypic models were segregated and represented by Morro 1-1/6, Morro of Arica Uhle, El Cerrito and Punta de Teatinos. This particular configuration is the product of evolutionary forces determined the morphological differences between both regions (North and South) by isolation and genetic change as well as the emergence of lines of kin-related individuals that were buried in different cemeteries or in specific sectors within the same funerary burial in these same regions.",,,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,,,,2004-12,2004,2004-12,,77,4,679-693,All OA; Gold,Article,"COCILOVO, JOS A.; VARELA, HCTOR H.; QUEVEDO, SILVIA; STANDEN, VIVIAN; COSTA-JUNQUEIRA, MARA A.","COCILOVO, JOS A.

Photometric observations and pulsational frequency analysis,"We undertook a multisite photometric campaign for the β Cephei star ν Eridani. More than 600 h of differential photoelectric uvyV photometry were obtained with 11 telescopes during 148 clear nights. The frequency analysis of our measurements shows that the variability of ν Eri can be decomposed into 23 sinusoidal components, eight of which correspond to independent pulsation frequencies between 5 and 8 cd−1. Some of these are arranged in multiplets, which suggests rotational m-mode splitting of non-radial pulsation modes as the cause. If so, the rotation period of the star must be between 30 and 60 d. One of the signals in the light curves of ν Eri has a very low frequency of 0.432 cd−1. It can be a high-order combination frequency or, more likely, an independent pulsation mode. In the latter case, ν Eri would be both a β Cephei star and a slowly pulsating B (SPB) star. The photometric amplitudes of the individual pulsation modes of ν Eri appear to have increased by about 20 per cent over the last 40 years. So have the amplitudes of the dominant combination frequencies of the star. Among the latter, we could only identify sum frequencies with certainty, not difference frequencies, which suggests that neither light-curve distortion in its simplest form nor resonant mode coupling is their single cause. One of our comparison stars, μ Eridani, turned out to be variable with a dominant time-scale of 1.62 d. We believe either that it is an SPB star just leaving its instability strip or that its variations are of rotational origin.",This work has been supported by the Austrian Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung under grant R12-N02.

Concerned about the Euro-American, patriarchal, classist, and individualised orientation in clinical, counselling, and social psychology, community psychology's vision arose as a response to this crisis of ‘relevance’ in the 1980s in South Africa. It placed the accent on accessible psychosocial services, re-defining the roles of psychologists, democratising psychological practice, prevention, competencies, empowerment of under-represented groups, collaboration, and inclusive modes of knowledge production. Our content analysis suggests that South African community psychology tends to operate within a porous disciplinary boundary, sharing academic concerns with a larger group of critical psychologists. Authorship characteristics show that for the 1994 to 2003 period male and females were more or less equally represented as authors, the majority of whom were affiliated to academic institutions. In contrast, co-authorship as an expression of collaboration did not feature strongly and the community voice was unrepresented at authorship level. Most of the articles tended to assume an empirical or theoretical slant and examined themes consistent with community psychology's early vision and focus. Similarly, research in community psychology seemed to have attended to selected priority psychosocial issues and drawn on historically neglected groups, including black adolescents and adults, to serve as participants. By way of conclusion, we surmise that community psychology, albeit an under-represented branch of psychology, may be one of many areas of engagement for those aligned to the quest for emancipatory psychological practice and theory in South Africa.",,,South African Journal of Psychology,,,,2004-11-01,2004,2004-11-01,2004-11,34,4,595-612,Closed,Article,"Seedat, Mohamed; MacKenzie, Sarah; Stevens, Garth","Seedat, Mohamed (UNISA Institute for Social and Health Sciences, P.

During the study period anomalously high oxygen bottom waters conditions were observed, coinciding with the 1997-1998 El Nio event. From both sites, intact sediment cores were collected for incubation experiments to directly estimate total ammonium fluxes. Pore-water chemistry was also assessed to estimate diffusive fluxes of nitrogen compounds (NH4+, NO3- and NO2-). The NH4+ flux from incubation experiments ranged from 0.55 to 2.18 mmol m-2 day-1 in the inner bay and from 1.84 to 2.14 mmol m-2 day-1 on the shelf. NO3- diffusive fluxes to the sediments were observed in the bay in March (-17 x 10-2 mmol m-2 day-1)and on the shelf in November (-2.7 x 10-2 mmol m-2 day-1), associated with the lowest NH4+ diffusive fluxes and coincident with a stronger gradient of Eh in the first centimeters of the sediments. Besides, total NH4+ fluxes lower than in normal periods were observed, suggesting the influence of less reducing conditions, consequence in turn of the lower fluxes of particulated organic material and higher dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters. These conditions were probably imposed by the El Nio event. On the other hand, and relative to previous reports, an increase of irrigation coefficients (DI) was estimated. Thus, the flux extension of other nitrogen compounds could have acquired relevance in relation to NH4+ fluxes during the study period Se analizaron los flujos de compuestos nitrogenados desde los sedimentos en dos reas representativas de condiciones costeras y de plataforma (Baha Concepcin y plataforma adyacente, respectivamente). Durante el perodo de muestreo las aguas de fondo presentaron un anmalamente alto contenido de oxgeno disuelto, coincidente con el evento El Nio 1997-1998. De ambos sitios, se incubaron testigos de sedimento intactos para determinar los flujos totales de NH4+. Adems se determin la concentracin de NH4+, NO3- y NO2- en el agua intersticial para estimar los flujos difusivos de compuestos nitrogenados en la interfase agua-sedimento. Los flujos de NH4+ totales variaron entre 0,55 y 2,18 mmol m-2 da-1 al interior de la baha y entre 1,84 a 2,14 mmol m-2 da-1 en la plataforma. Se observaron flujos difusivos de NO3- en direccin a los sedimentos al interior de la baha en Marzo de 1998 (-17 x 10-2 mmol m-2 da-1)y en la plataforma en Noviembre de 1997 (-2,7 x 10-2 mmol m-2 da-1) asociados a los flujos difusivos de NH4+ ms bajos, coincidiendo esto con la mayor gradiente de Eh en los sedimentos superficiales. Adems, los bajos flujos de NH4+ medidos en comparacin con mediciones previas, sugieren la influencia de un ambiente menos reductor, generado a su vez por la disminucin del flujo de material orgnico particulado y por el aumento de las concentraciones de oxgeno disuelto en las aguas del fondo. Estas condiciones fueron generadas probablemente por el evento El Nio. Tambin, con relacin a reportes previos se registr un incremento en los coeficientes de irrigacin (DI).

A peer-reviewing activity was carried out (following a survey of more than 250 students) in normal classroom writing activities with 52 first-year students from two tutorial groups taking an academic writing course. Two short (pre- and post-reviewing) questionnaires were administered to identify problems in and possibilities for using both peer and teacher feedback in student writing. The study confirmed the prediction of the preference of teacher feedback over peer feedback and, concomitantly, greater use of the former. It also resulted in the following findings: an unexpectedly high level of willingness to engage in peer reviewing by the majority of the students (more as reviewers than as recipients of the feedback); and, in some cases, correspondingly actual use of the feedback in revision; notable differences in the types of feedback from peers and from the tutor, a result suggesting the complementary roles played by the two main sources of feedback in revision; some explicit reasons for failure (decision not) to use peer feedback, much less explicit for not using teacher feedback in revision. In conclusion, there was evidence of greater feasibility than had been expected of the introduction of multiple-draft multiple-reader writing instruction at first-year. The study also showed how a ""negotiated"" classroom practice may become ""accepted"" practice, in spite of presumably unfavourable sociocultural and educational traditions. The findings reported in this article have implications for writing pedagogy at tertiary level in South Africa (and may be useful elsewhere).

It is exemplified in the rainfall and production potential maps presented, and also by the wide variety of crops grown and production techniques employed. The latter range from advanced technology to traditional subsistence procedures. Of the total area, <14% is arable and <4% of high potential, with rainfall the main limiting factor. Maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are the main cereal crops. Results presented describe extensive on‐station and on‐farm research to quantify water losses by evaporation, runoff, and deep drainage, and on measures to minimize these losses such as mulching, soil surface modification, and planting patterns. Success depends on correct technique/soil type matching. Increased soil water storage through fallowing, improved infiltration, and water harvesting has received much attention. Further research priorities include studies on: (i) simultaneous optimization of soil water and nutrient use, water harvesting, and mulching to reduce evaporation losses; (ii) refinement of seasonal outlook forecasting to allow for the prediction of seasonal onset and distribution of rainfall; and (iii) determination of the effects of different crop rotation systems on long‐term water‐use efficiency under dryland conditions under different soil and climatic conditions.",,,CSSA Special Publications,Challenges and Strategies of Dryland Agriculture,"Srinivas C.

This Western legislative intervention denies African justice to Africans who believe in the reality of African witchcraft. As a result there have been many recorded instances where ordinary African people, thinking themselves bewitched, have turned to self-help to protect themselves against bewitchment; mob justice and witchcraft violence have escalated like never before. This paper argues that the Suppression of Witchcraft Act should be repealed so that legitimate sangomas can be reinstated as mediators in witchcraft accusation cases. The distinction between sangomas and witches is clarified and a Jungian framework is used to shed light on the nature of African beliefs in witches, ancestors, and spirit worlds. Standard models of anthropology and psychology have tended to treat such beliefs as symptoms of superstition or madness. My argument is that by approaching these belief systems from a Jungian perspective, new ways of thinking about them are introduced which can help us find a solution to the problem of witchcraft violence in South Africa.",,,Journal of Contemporary Religion,,,,2004-01,2004,,2004-01,19,1,67-84,Closed,Article,"Hund, John","Hund, John ()","Hund, John ()","Hund, John ()",12,4,,19.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016850281,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"
213,pub.1049110664,10.1016/j.jembe.2004.08.022,,,Prey selection and predatory impact of four major sea stars on a soft bottom subtidal community,"We dived at regular intervals (8-, 12- or 24-h) over periods up to 24 days to quantify the feeding activities of identified sea stars along permanent transects in the upper sediment bottom zone (8–11 m deep). In this habitat, large individuals of four sea stars predominated. The diet of Asterias vulgaris (molluscs and echinoderms) was intermediate between that of Leptasterias polaris (mainly molluscs) and that of Crossaster papposus (mainly echinoderms), whereas the diet of Solaster endeca strongly differed from the other sea stars, as it only fed on holothuroids. Calculation of the Ivlev electivity index indicated little or no selection for many abundant prey species, whereas some rare prey in this zone (e.g., Mytilus edulis) were strongly selected. We quantified prey size selection, and observed evidence of selection on smaller individuals when feeding on infaunal bivalves (possibly the deeper burying of larger individuals limited attacks) and selection of larger individuals when feeding on epifaunal prey (possibly to maximize energetic intake). We observed A. vulgaris feeding on Mya truncata, which had been captured by L. polaris (kleptoparasitism) and this bivalve disappeared from the diet of A. vulgaris in areas where we experimentally removed L. polaris. Estimations of foraging rates over 100 days relative to prey availability indicated strong interactions among the sea stars themselves. C. papposus likely have a strong impact on conspecifics, L. polaris and A. vulgaris, and A. vulgaris on L. polaris. In contrast, <1% of total biomass of the most abundant prey of L. polaris (M. truncata) and C. papposus (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) was consumed in 100 days.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Robert Rondeau, Yves Beaulé, Jen-René Hamel, Yvan Janelle, Denis Auger, Jean Côté, Patrice Dallaire and Marc Thiaubault for their extensive help with the diving work.

Una aproximacin inicial a su triloga religiosa,"El artculo aborda, en un primer acercamiento, el pensamiento de Xavier Zubiri respecto de la experiencia, en cuanto va de acceso del hombre a Dios, desarrollado especialmente en su triloga religiosa. Una clave fundamental de lectura del tema es el concepto de ""experiencia de religacin"" expresado a travs de tres problemas nodales: el problema de la realidad, el problema de la inteligencia y el problema de Dios. Se parte del principio del ""poder de la realidad"" que se impone al hombre ms all de su voluntad, estableciendo la ""experiencia"" como ""probacin fsica de la realidad"", en un sentido diferente al expresado bajo el concepto de empeira. Siendo Dios el fundamento de todo lo real, el hombre queda religado experiencialmente, fsicamente, a esta realidad absoluta, en la medida en que Dios la constituye. Y si el hombre es parte de esa realidad absoluta participa de su esencia y por lo tanto establece una relacin con Dios desde su propia plenitud y no desde su finitud como suele pensarse. Esto es lo que hace posible, segn el autor, que la experiencia cristiana de la encarnacin sea la mxima expresin del acceso humano a Dios This article surround, in a first approach, Xavier Zubiri's thought on respect the experience, as a path of access that man have on the way to God, that the author has developed in his religious trilogy. A foremost clue of lecture on the theme is the concept of ""experiencia de religacin"" (like reliant experience). That appears expressed in three nodal problems: The reality problem, the intelligence problem and the problem of God. We start from the ""power of reality"" as a principle that act as an imposition to man beyond his will, establishing the ""experience"" as a ""probacin fsica de la realidad"" (like reality verification), in a different sense of empeiria (empirical) concept in traditional metaphysics. Being God the fundament of the hole real, man remains experientially, physically reliant, to this absolute reality, as God constitute it. And if man is part of that absolute reality, he participates of his essence, for what he establish a relation with God from his own plenitude and not from his finitude as it is commonly thought. This makes possible, in the author's believe, that the Christian experience of incarnation becomes the maximum expression of human access to God",,,Teología y Vida,,,,2004,2004,2004,,45,4,477-493,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Schnake, Francisco Correa","Schnake, Francisco Correa (Universidad Catlica del Norte Departamento de Teologa, Coquimbo)",,"Schnake, Francisco Correa (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/tv/v45n4/art01.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004324889,,

This database was compared with previously obtained results from central Peru (Callao). 210Pb activities decreased exponentially with core depth and profiles showed a deepening of the 210Pb in excess (unsupported) in the sediments from north to south (∼6–18cm sediment depth off Peru and northern Chile vs. 8–35cm off central and southern Chile. An onshore–offshore decrease of surface activities was observed off central Peru whereas the reverse was true for surface activities along the Chilean margin. SRs increased from north (0.04–0.17cmyr−1) to south (0.09–0.29cmyr−1). Across the shelf, higher rates were observed at deeper sites, especially at those close to submarine canyons, except off central Peru, where SRs showed similar values through the slope area. Off northern Chile and central Peru, SRs seem to reflect the export of particles over the shelf and redistribution processes such as slumps and lateral transport. In contrast, SRs in central and southern Chile seem to be controlled by several additional factors that modulate the settling particles, such as onshore precipitation and river runoff. In addition, the more complex topography of the southern Chile margin allows for settling or winnowing areas.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank the captains and crew members of the R./V. Sonne, R./V.

This paper, analyzed the longitudinal spatial distribution of the decapod larvae collected between Caldera and Easter island and the relationships with two environmental variables, during the cruise Cimar 5-oceanic islands, October 1999. The 31 taxa of larvae that correspond to three groups, pelagic, mesopelagic and benthonic decapod, were identified. Sergestid shrimp larvae were the most abundant along the track. The diversity was quite variable in the whole track, showing two picks. The first picks in the neritic area and the second to the 150 nm offshore. By means of an ordination analysis (MDS), the presence of two communities of decapod larvae was detected, one was associated to the conditions of temperature and salinity of the sub-antarctic waters from the Humboldt Current System and the other community to the subtropical waters, respectively. Three assemblages of decapod larvae were identified, related with the habitat of the adult individuals.

The observations were carried out using two 8m-units of the ESO/Very Large Telescope operated simultaneously on November 29 and 30, 2000. The KBOs displayed linear reflectivity spectra in the optical with a wide range of slopes from neutral (solar) to very red. In most cases, the reflectivity spectra are linear from B to J bands. We notice a change of regime in the spectra which flatten toward the H and K bandpasses. (33128) 1998 BU48 even has a significantly negative value. Only (54598) 2000 QC243 does not flatten in the infra-red. (24835) 1995 SM55 has a noticeably blue spectrum in the near-IR which might be indicative of water ice absorption features. We also present an empirical model for KBO surface evolution, based on models from [CITE] and [CITE], in which surface colors evolve because of collisions. In the model presented here we propose that cometary activity can refresh the surface. This model predicts that (1) small (e.g. ≪80 km in radius) KBOs should have color variations with rotation, (2) the larger objects should display uniform colors, (3) there should be no color dependence with inclination for objects >100 km in radius, and (4) very distant KBOs are fully irradiated.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2004-03-26,2004,2004-03-26,2004-04,417,3,1145-1158,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Delsanti, A.; Hainaut, O.; Jourdeuil, E.; Meech, K.

The continent lacks investments, jobs, real output, and basic social services. Aggravating the poor performance is poor management. This paper argues that the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) to grapple with Africa's economic problems makes sense but only if necessary policies are properly implemented. It argues that Africa should pursue interest politics through NEPAD as an economic integration. On the issue of financing the budget, which has in the past been a major constraint to OAU‐initiated projects, this paper strongly recommends that it should be made mandatory that all multinational companies operating in all NEPAD member countries pay a certain percentage of their earnings into the NEPAD budget.

Il avance que l’Afrique devrait poursuivre une politique d’intérêt dans le cadre du NEPAD en tant qu’outil d’intégration économique. En ce qui concerne le financement du budget qui, par le passé, a constitué un des obstacles majeurs à la réalisation des projets initiés par l’OUA, l’article recommande vivement que l’on oblige toutes les sociétés multinationales opérant dans les pays membres du NEPAD à verser un certain pourcentage de leurs bénéfices au budget du NEPAD.",,,African Development Review,,,,2004-09,2004,2004-12-13,2004-09,16,2,223-251,Closed,Article,"Ilorah, Richard","Ilorah, Richard (1University of the North, School of Economics and Management, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga 0727, South Africa.

However, asymmetries in the duration and amplitude of the cycles as well as in the intensity of the impact of shocks on commodity price volatility have been noticed. This bears implications for the analysis of producer support strategies. After reviewing some explanations of these irregularities, particularly those concerning the price and the main producer country of cocoa, properties of alternative GARCH models are compared, and a new specification is proposed. Five GARCH specifications are then applied to high frequency data of the cocoa price, relative to a 15‐year period. A moderate level of persistence is observed in the conditional mean of weekly observations. As for the conditional variance, specification tests and forecasting capacity measures give preference to models with a Student‐t distribution, with daily data being also characterized by rightward‐skewness and relatively higher, even if time‐varying, volatility persistence. Finally, estimates of two of these models are used to analyse space‐time relationships among price disparity across different trading centres, inter‐regional producer price dispersion in Côte d’Ivoire, and unforeseen volatility. 
 Résumé:  L’instabilité des prix des produits primaires est souvent évaluée sur la base de statistiques descriptives et méthodes d’estimation qui présument une distribution presque normale. Toutefois, on remarque des asymétries dans la durée et l’ampleur des cycles, ainsi que dans l’intensité de l’impact des choc sur la volatilité de ces prix. Ceci a des implications pour l’analyse des stratégies de soutien aux producteurs. Après avoir considéré des explications de ces irrégularités, surtout pour le prix et pour le principal pays producteur du cacao, on compare ici les propriétés des modèles GARCH alternatifs, et on formule une nouvelle spécification. Cinq variantes GARCH sont appliquées ensuite à des données à haute fréquence du prix du cacao, couvrantes une période de quinze années. Un niveau modéré de persistance est observé dans la moyenne conditionnelle des observations hebdomadaires. Pour la variance conditionnelle, tests de spécification et mesures de capacité prévisionnelle suggèrent une sélection de modèles avec distribution Student‐t, et, dans le cas des données journalières, ils identifient une asymétrie inclinée à droite et une persistance plus accentuée, même si changeante, de volatilité.

English, which became the official language in 1806 in the Cape Colony, threatened both Dutch, the official language between 1652 and 1795, and Afrikaans. The dispersal of the Dutch or Afrikaner colonists across South Africa, the rise of Afrikaner nationalism triggered by the South African War (1899–1902), and widespread Afrikaner poverty in the early decades of the twentieth century created the conditions for the rapid growth of Afrikaans as public language. It is one of only four languages in the world that in the course of the twentieth century was standardized and used in all walks of public and private life, including postgraduate teaching. The transition of South Africa to an inclusive democracy in 1994 freed Afrikaans from its apartheid shackles but also made it only one of eleven official languages.

176,pub.1022356622,10.1029/2003jb002494,,,Role of viscous plate coupling in the late Tertiary Andean tectonics,"Plate coupling between oceanic and continental plates in convergent margins of Andean type is analyzed from the continuum mechanics approach. We postulate a simple mechanism that accounts for the compressive regime in Andean‐type environments. In this mechanism, deformation in the continental lithosphere is split into two distinctive domains: The forearc domain and the arc‐foreland domain. The forearc deformation is controlled by the balance between buoyancy forces associated with the trench and continental slope relief and the stress transferred from the convergence velocity through the age‐ and velocity‐dependent slip zone. The arc‐foreland deformation is controlled by the absolute plate velocity of the continental plate and the resistance at the slip zone. Strength of the coupling zone is determined by analyzing the dynamic trench topography along the active margin of South America between 0 and 55°S. Using this approach, we found strength values in the range of 20–95 MPa, in strong direct correlation with the age of the subducting plate. The slip layer strength observation has been successfully tested against a thermal‐ and strain rate‐dependent rheological model. From this theoretical result we define an empirical relationship between strength of the slip zone and the age and convergence velocity. Applying this plate coupling model, we reproduce shortening rates in the order of 1–10 km/Myr, in agreement with those reported for the late Tertiary evolution of the Andes. Model results reproduce some first‐order features of the geological evolution of the margin, such as the shape of the trench, the overall Andes relief, the Altiplano buildup, and block rotation patterns. In addition, the model provides a mechanism to explain the evolution of the Central Depression, the inversion of Tertiary basins under slow convergence rates during the Miocene, and the segmentation of the margins tectonic erosion.","This paper was supported by Fondecyt grant 1000136.

Can a Euromodernist nation‐state, founded on One Law , infuse itself with another, with an African jurisprudence? And how is it to deal with cultural practices deemed “dangerous” by the canons of enlightenment reason? These questions are especially urgent in postcolonies like South Africa, with highly diverse populations whose traditional ways and means are accorded constitutional protection. Here we examine how South Africans are dealing with such “dangerous” practices in an era in which their nation is becoming ever more poli cultural; how, in the process, an Afromodernity is taking organic shape in the interstices between new democratic institutions and the kingdom of custom; how the confrontation between Culture, in the upper case, and a state founded on liberal universalism is beginning to reconfigure the political landscape of this postcolony—as it is, we argue, in many places across the planet.",,,American Ethnologist,,,,2004-05,2004,2008-01-07,2004-05,31,2,188-204,Closed,Article,"Comaroff, John L.; Comaroff, Jean","Comaroff, John L.

En tanto, las compaas mineras obtienen del gobierno concesiones en reas respecto de las cuales ste percibe a cambio, ingresos por la venta, arriendo y concesin de tierras fiscales, as como por las servidumbres que imponen las faenas. Lo desigual de esta carrera propietaria entre indgenas, Estado y mineras se refleja en que las comunidades andinas de la II Regin no han podido hacer efectivos sus derechos territoriales en tiempo y forma. Este ensayo describe cmo, de una manera similar a lo ocurrido en los dems pases latinoamericanos, la poltica que consiste en demorar la implementacin de los derechos territoriales reconocidos a los indgenas hasta su negacin, le ha permitido a ciertos actores econmicos y polticos expandir sus esferas de influencia sin trabas por tierras que beneficiaran del grado mayor de proteccin jurdico de que gozan las tierras indgenas en Chile. Se consideran algunas razones por las cuales las autoridades tnicas y municipales oficiales no han reclamado por el retraso en el saneamiento, ni por la reduccin por va administrativa y jurdica de las propiedades a regularizar. El caso nos lleva a formular nuevas preguntas de investigacin acerca de los ciclos y modos de territorializacin y diferenciacin en Atacama, incluyendo los del poder estatal Chile's Indigenous Law set a three-year deadline to carry out the regularization of individual, community and patrimonial lands of Atacameo property: 10 have passed and these territorial rights have been neither respected, nor implemented. Meanwhile, mining companies operating in the area have easily obtained diverse types of government land grants, sales and rentals from which the latter profits, as well as from compensations for the rights of passage that mining imposes on `fiscal' land. The unevenness of this proprietorial race between indigenous people, the State and mining companies, is reflected in that the Andean communities of Chile's second region have been unable to make their territorial rights effective. This essay describes how, like in other Latin American countries, the politics that consist in delaying the implementation of indigenous peoples' territorial rights until their negation allow other economic and political agents to expand their spheres of influence without limits; and this, on lands that, in Chile at least, would otherwise benefit from the added legal protection of the Indigenous Law. We consider reasons why ethnic and municipal authorities and officials have neither objected to this delay, nor formally complained about the administrative and juridical reduction of the properties in the process of being regularized. The case leads us to formulate new research questions about the modes and cycles of territorialization and differentiation in the Atacama, including those of the State",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2004,2004,2004,,,27,139-168,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"van H., Alonso Barros","van H., Alonso Barros (Universidad Catlica del Norte Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueolgicas y Museo Arqueolgico R.

Muy pocos le ven como un autor mstico que quiere transparentar su experiencia de Dios y ayudar al lector a buscar su propio razonamiento en su propia experiencia. El trabajo busca presentar a Anselmo como telogo del amor. Para esto se estudia el vocabulario afectivo en todas las obras de Anselmo, sobre todo la palabra 'amare' y sus derivadas. El amor est presente en todas las obras de Anselmo. El amor es fundamental para entender las obras filosficas como el Monologion, las obras teolgicas como el Cur Dus Homo y las obras afectivas como las Oraciones. Cuando no habla de amor en sus obras, Anselmo insiste en buscar la verdad que es Cristo y as entregarse totalmente a l. Lo que busca Anselmo es esclarecer el enigma del hombre. Su intuicin bsica es que el enigma se resuelve no en el espejo (que muestra la persona en su inversa), sino en el cara a cara con Dios. Este encuentro con el Dios de amor es el fundamento de su visin antropolgica. Tambin de su visin cristolgica: Cristo es el hombre que se entrega totalmente por amor Anselm is known as the father of the scholastical and we see him the man who gives to the reason its letters of nobleness. Few persons see him like a mystic author who wants to show through his experience on God and help the reader on searching his own argument in his own experience. The paper try to introduce Anselm like the theologian of love. For that reason all the affective lexicon is studied in all the Anselm's plays (specially the word 'love' and its derivatives). The love is showed in all the Anselm's plays. The love is fundamental in order to understand the philosophical plays like the 'Monologion', the theological plays like the 'Cur Deus Homo' and the affective plays like the Prayers. When he doesn't speak about love in his plays, Anselm persists on searching the truth. That is Christ y so surrender completely on him. Anselm search to lighten the enigma of the man. His basic intuition is: the enigma isn't solved at the mirror (it shows the person at inverse). It resolves face to face with God. This finding with God of love is the reason of his anthropological sight and of his Christological sight too. Christ is the man who delivers all of us up for love",,,Teología y Vida,,,,2004,2004,2004,,45,4,494-530,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"R., Andr Hubert","R., Andr Hubert (UCN, Antofagasta)",,"R., Andr Hubert (Catholic University of the North)",2,0,,3.25,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/tv/v45n4/art02.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024633087,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies",

Our golden age is defined not only by the enormity of new discoveries of dark energy, dark matter, extra-solar planets, and the evolution of Mars, but also by the breadth, diversity, and creativity within our community. This volume records our history, in a period of such rapid change and growth that individual astronomers are hard-pressed to keep abreast of their own fields and neighborhoods, much less of developments world-wide. Since the 1950's, changes in the landscape of astronomy are manifold. We have witnessed two epochs of big telescope construction, the 4-meter class telescopes of the '60s and '70s and the 8-to lO-meter class telescopes of the '90s, continuing through today. We accomplished the transition from photographic to digital data, and we continue to improve the size and sen­ sitivity of astronomical detectors. We have witnessed the flowering of radio astronomy and the opening of the full electromagnetic spectrum through space astronomy.

This is not different for plants. When dealing with plants, however, it soon becomes apparent that the situation is somewhat more complex. Botanists use Latin names to bring order into the vast diversity, while everyday usage resorts to vemacular or ""popular"" names. As practical as these vernacular names are (it is not suggested that you should ask your greengrocer for a kilo­ gram of Solanum tuberosum or Musa paradisiaca subsp. sapientum), their most important draw­ back is the fact that they vary widely, not only from one language to another but also from coun­ try to country, even from region to region within a large country. More importantly, vemacular names in any given language are usually only available for the plants growing locally, or for plants of some special importance, such as crops and vegetables, medicinal plants, or important garden plants. For all other plants, the Latin names used by botanists and other scientists have to be employed.

                  However much people want esteem, it is an untradeable commodity: there is no way that I can buy the good opinion of another or sell to others my good opinion of them. But though it is a non-tradable good, esteem is allocated in society according to systematic determinants; people’s performance, publicity and presentation relative to others will help fix how much esteem they enjoy and how much disesteem they avoid. The fact that it is subject to such determinants means in turn that rational individuals are bound to compete with one another, however tacitly, in the attempt to control those influences, increasing their chances of winning esteem and avoiding disesteem. And the fact that they all compete for esteem in this way shapes the environment in which they each pursue the good, setting relevant comparators and benchmarks, and determining the cost that a person must bear–the price that they must pay–for obtaining a given level of esteem in any domain of activity.
                  Hidden in the multifarious interactions and exchanges of social life, then, there is a quiet force at work–a force as silent and powerful as gravity–which moulds the basic form of people’s relationships and associations. This force was more or less routinely invoked in the writings of classical theorists like Aristotle and Plato, Locke and Montesquieu, Mandeville and Hume and Madison. Sometimes it was invoked to explain why people behaved as they did, sometimes to identify initiatives whereby they might be persuaded to behave better. Although Adam Smith himself gave it great credence, however, the rise of economics proper coincided with a sudden decline in the attention devoted to the economy of esteem. What had been a topic of compelling interest for earlier authors fell into relative neglect throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This book is designed to reverse the trend. It begins by outlining the psychology of esteem and the way the working of that psychology can give rise to an economy. It then shows how a variety of social patterns that are otherwise anomalous come to make a lot of sense within an economics of esteem. And it looks, finally, at the ways in which the economy of esteem may be reshaped so as to make for an improvement–by reference to received criteria–in overall social outcomes. While making connections with older patterns of social theorizing, it offers a novel orientation for contemporary thought about how society works and how it may be made to work. It puts the economy of esteem firmly on the agenda of economic and social science and of moral and political theory.",,,,,,,2004-03-18,2004,2004-11-16,2004-03-18,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,296,28,,333.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1098767019,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5003 Philosophy,

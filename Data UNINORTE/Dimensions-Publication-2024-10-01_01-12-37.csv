Method: We recruited and clinically characterized 408 individuals using an extensive battery of neuropsychological tasks. The genetic variance underpinning these tasks was estimated by heritability. A predictive framework for ADHD diagnosis was derived using these tasks. Results: We found that individuals with ADHD differed from controls in tasks of mental control, visuospatial ability, visuoverbal memory, phonological and verbal fluency, verbal and semantic fluency, cognitive flexibility, and cognitive ability. Among them, tasks of mental control, visuoverbal memory, phonological fluency, semantic verbal fluency, and intelligence had a significant heritability. A predictive model of ADHD diagnosis using these endophenotypes yields remarkable classification rate, sensitivity, specificity, and precision values (above 80%). Conclusion: We have dissected new cognitive endophenotypes in ADHD that can be suitable to assess the neurobiological and genetic basis of ADHD.",We express our highest appreciation to all families enrolled in this study.,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was financed by COLCIENCIAS, project “Fenotipos Complejos y Endofenotipos del Trastorno por Déficit de Atención e Hiperactividad y su Asociación con Genes Mayores y de Susceptibilidad,” Grant 1253-5453-1644, contract RC 384-2011, conferred to Grupo de Neurociencias del Caribe, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla.",Journal of Attention Disorders,,,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Caribbean Region; Endophenotypes; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Semantics,2018-03-28,2018,2018-03-28,2020-12,24,14,2100-2114,All OA; Green,Article,"Cervantes-Henríquez, M.

Barriers to access to the implemented guidelines were identified.
METHODS: For the identification of evidence-based CPGs to be implemented, systematic searches were carried out in international databases of development agencies or compilers of clinical practice guidelines, and in databases that contained scientific literature on issues related to eating disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The two guidelines shortlisted for the final selection by consensus of a multidisciplinary team at the hospital were the ""Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of eating disorders"" and the ""Guía de práctica clínica sobre trastornos de la conducta alimentaria de Catalunya"", the latter being finally chosen by consensus. There are not yet CPGs implemented for health professionals in the priority outpatient department of Colombian hospitals for eating disorders.","Los autores agradecen el apoyo científico recibido a la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad del Norte y su programa de psiquiatría.

We recruited 78 individuals with AD from the Paisa genetic isolate in Antioquia, Colombia. These individuals belong to the world largest multigenerational and extended pedigree segregating AD as a consequence of a dominant fully penetrant mutation in the PSEN1 gene and exhibit an AOO ranging from the early 1930s to the late 1970s. To shed light on the genetic underpinning that could explain the large spread of the age of onset (AOO) of AD, 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with neuroanatomical, cardiovascular, and cognitive measures in AD were genotyped. Standard quality control and filtering procedures were applied, and single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effects models were used to identify AOO-associated SNPs. A full two-locus interaction model was fitted to define how identified SNPs interact to modulate AOO. We identified two key epistatic interactions between the APOE*E2 allele and SNPs ASTN2-rs7852878 and SNTG1-rs16914781 that delay AOO by up to ~ 8 years (95% CI 3.2–12.7, P = 1.83 × 10−3) and ~ 7.6 years (95% CI 3.3–11.8, P = 8.69 × 10−4), respectively, and validated our previous finding indicating that APOE*E2 delays AOO of AD in PSEN1 E280 mutation carriers. This new evidence involving APOE*E2 as an AOO delayer could be used for developing precision medicine approaches and predictive genomics models to potentially determine AOO in individuals genetically predisposed to AD.","The authors express their highest appreciation to the patients and relatives enrolled in this study for more than 25 years.

Despite active research in ornithology, compelling morphological information of most bird species is still sparse. However, morphological information is the baseline to understand how species respond to environmental variation and how ecosystems respond to species loss. As part of a national initiative, the Instituto Alexander von Humboldt in collaboration with 12 Colombian institutions and seven biological collections, measured up to 15 morphological traits of 9,892 individuals corresponding to 606 species: 3,492 from individuals captured in field and 6,400 from museum specimens. Species measured are mainly distributed in high Andean forest, páramo, and wetland ecosystems. Seven ornithological collections in Colombia and 18 páramo complexes throughout Colombia were visited from 2013 to 2015. The morphological traits involved measurements from bill (total and exposed culmen, bill width and depth), wing (length, area, wingspan, and the distance between longest primary and longest secondary), tail (length and shape), tarsus (length), hallux (length and claw hallux), and mass. The number of measured specimens per species was variable, ranging from 1 to 321 individuals with a median of four individuals per species. Overall, this database gathered morphological information for >30% of Colombian bird diversity.

Previous studies have shown that CD8+ T cells play an important role in ZIKV-specific protective immunity. We have previously defined antigenic targets of the ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cell response in humans. In this study, we characterized the quality and phenotypes of these responses by a combined use of flow cytometry and transcriptomic methods, using PBMCs from donors deriving from different geographical locations collected in the convalescent phase of infection. We show that ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cells are characterized by a polyfunctional IFN-γ signature with upregulation of TNF-α, TNF receptors, and related activation markers, such as CD69, as well as a cytotoxic signature characterized by strong upregulation of GZMB and CRTAM. The signature is stable and not influenced by previous dengue virus exposure, geographical location, or time of sample collection postinfection. To our knowledge, this work elucidates the first in-depth characterization of human CD8+ T cells responding to ZIKV infection.",,,The Journal of Immunology,,,"Antigens, Viral; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;

For many years, ventricular and parenchymal devices have been available for this aim. The purpose of this paper is to review the published literature comparing ICP recordings via an intraventricular catheter or an intraparenchymal (brain tissue) catheter.MethodsLiterature search of Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus was performed in which manuscripts discussed both ICP monitoring via an intraventricular catheter and ICP monitoring through intraparenchymal (brain tissue) catheter. Keywords and MeSH terms used include critical care, intracranial pressure, ICP, monitoring, epidural catheter, intracranial hypertension, ventriculostomy, ventricular drain, external ventricular drain, and physiologic monitoring.ResultsEleven articles met inclusion criteria. The published literature shows differences in simultaneously recorded ICP between the intraventricular and intraparenchymal sites.ConclusionsWe propose two new terms that more accurately identify the anatomical site of recording for the referenced ICP: intracranial pressure ventricular (ICP-v) and intracranial pressure brain tissue (ICP-bt). Further delineation of the conventional term “ICP” into these two new terms will clarify the difference between ICP-v and ICP-bt and their respective measurement locations.",,,Neurocritical Care,,,Brain Injuries; Critical Care; Humans; Intracranial Pressure; Neurophysiological Monitoring,2018-09-24,2018,2018-09-24,2019-04,30,2,239-243,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Olson, DaiWai M.; Ortega Peréz, Stefany; Ramsay, Jonathan; Venkatasubba Rao, Chethan P.; Suarez, Jose I.; McNett, Molly; Aiyagari, Venkatesh","Olson, DaiWai M.

6384,pub.1110105026,10.1002/hpja.223,30465690,,Fast and furious: A neglected issue in health promotion among young drivers,"ISSUES ADDRESSED: This paper investigates the influence of mood while driving, advocates for identifying high-risk groups and detects associations between mood while driving and risky driving behaviours. While commensurate studies regarding aggressive driving have confirmed significant detriments in driving performance, little scholarly research has studied the gaps and opportunities at the intersection of mood and risky driving in young drivers.
METHODS: A cross-sectional design was implemented using 660 young drivers (17-25 years) from Australia (34.7%) and Colombia (65.3%), who completed the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS). Cluster analysis differentiated young drivers across two groups: high-risk and low-risk driving while influenced by mood. Hierarchical segmentation analysis explored the relationship between driver mood and self-reported risky driving behaviour.
RESULTS: Young drivers reported frequent driving while influenced by mood. The typical risky driving behaviours of young drivers who are emotion-affected are transient violations (eg, speeding) and risky exposure (eg, driving tired).
CONCLUSIONS: Risky driving behaviours that have been found to increase the risk of road injury (speeding, fatigued driving) and to decrease the survivability of road crashes (speeding) are inextricably intertwined with the influence of driver mood upon driving behaviour at an international level. Driver mood is a neglected issue in health promotion programs for young drivers. SO WHAT?: Current health promotion interventions for young drivers safety such as Graduated Driver Licensing may not prevent driving while influenced by mood. Additional strategies are required to minimise the exposure to driving while affected by negative mood.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Health Promotion Journal of Australia,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Affect; Age Factors; Australia; Automobile Driving; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Licensure; Male; Risk-Taking; Young Adult",2018-12-09,2018,2018-12-09,2019-09,30,3,311-316,All OA; Green,Article,"Oviedo‐Trespalacios, Oscar; Scott‐Parker, Bridie","Oviedo‐Trespalacios, Oscar (Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety—Queensland (CARRS‐Q), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Qld, Australia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Scott‐Parker, Bridie (Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety (cadrosa.org), Birtinya, Qld, Australia; Adolescent Risk Research Unit (ARRU), Sunshine Coast Mind and Neuroscience—Thompson Institute, University of the Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore DC, Qld, Australia; School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts, Business and Law, University of the Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore DC, Qld, Australia; Sustainability Research Centre (SRC), Faculty of Arts, Business and Law, University of the Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore DC, Qld, Australia)","Oviedo‐Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte)","Oviedo‐Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte); Scott‐Parker, Bridie (Consortium of Adolescent Road Safety (cadrosa.org), Birtinya, Qld, Australia; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the Sunshine Coast)",13,2,1.1,2.94,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/124203/2/124203.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110105026,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

The purpose of this study was to assess the cognitive performance, instrumental activities of daily living, depression, and anxiety in patients with asymptomatic HIV-1 infections compared with seronegative participants without neurocognitive impairment. We studied a sample consisted of 60 patients with asymptomatic HIV-1 infections and 60 seronegative participants without neurocognitive impairment from the city of Barranquilla, Colombia, with a mean age of 36.07 years. A protocol of neuropsychological and psychopathological tests was applied to the participants. The group of patients with asymptomatic HIV infections significantly underperformed on tasks that assessed global cognitive screening, attention span, learning, phonemic verbal fluency, auditory-verbal comprehension, information processing speed, cognitive flexibility, and motor skills compared to the group of seronegative participants. No significant differences were found in memory, visual confrontation naming, vocabulary, inhibition, and instrumental activities of daily living. Additionally, the patients with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection had a higher anxiety index than the seronegative participants, but no significant difference was found in depression. A correlation was found between depression and anxiety. In conclusion, the patients with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection had lower cognitive performances than the seronegative participants in the cognitive functions mentioned above and more anxiety but still performed the instrumental activities of daily living.","We express our highest appreciation to all patients and their families who participated in this study.

Improved diagnostic tests are required for early case detection and for monitoring the outcomes of treatments. Previous investigations using Leishmania lysate antigen demonstrated that the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 response is a potential indicator of a patient's clinical status after chemotherapy.
METHODS: IgG1 or IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with rK39 or lysate antigens and novel IgG1 rK39 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were assessed with Indian VL serum samples from the following clinical groups: paired pre- and postchemotherapy (deemed cured); relapsed; other infectious diseases; and endemic, healthy controls.
RESULTS: With paired pre- and post-treatment samples (n = 37 pairs), ELISAs with rK39- and IgG1-specific conjugates gave a far more discriminative decrease in post-treatment antibody responses when compared to IgG (P < .0001). Novel IgG1 rK39 RDTs provided strong evidence for decreased IgG1 responses in patients who had successful treatment (P < .0001). Furthermore, both IgG1 rK39 RDTs (n = 38) and ELISAs showed a highly significant difference in test outcomes between cured patients and those who relapsed (n = 23; P < .0001). RDTs were more sensitive than corresponding ELISAs.
CONCLUSIONS: We present strong evidence for the use of IgG1 in monitoring treatment outcomes in VL, and the first use of an IgG1-based RDT using the rK39 antigen for the discrimination of post-treatment cure versus relapse in VL. Such an RDT may have a significant role in monitoring patients and in targeted control and elimination of this devastating disease.",,,Clinical Infectious Diseases,,,"Antibodies, Protozoan; Antigens, Protozoan; Antiprotozoal Agents; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Leishmania; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Recurrence; Treatment Outcome",2018-12-12,2018,2018-12-12,2019-09-13,69,7,1130-1135,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mollett, Guy; Hinckel, Bruno C Bremer; Bhattacharyya, Tapan; Marlais, Tegwen; Singh, Om Prakash; Mertens, Pascal; Falconar, Andrew K; El-Safi, Sayda; Sundar, Shyam; Miles, Michael A","Mollett, Guy (Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom); Hinckel, Bruno C Bremer (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, Belgium); Bhattacharyya, Tapan (Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom); Marlais, Tegwen (Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom); Singh, Om Prakash (Department of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India); Mertens, Pascal (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux); Falconar, Andrew K (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); El-Safi, Sayda (Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Sudan); Sundar, Shyam (Department of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India); Miles, Michael A (Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom)","Bhattacharyya, Tapan (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine)","Mollett, Guy (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Hinckel, Bruno C Bremer (Coris BioConcept (Belgium); University of Antwerp); Bhattacharyya, Tapan (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Marlais, Tegwen (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Singh, Om Prakash (Institute of Medical Sciences); Mertens, Pascal (Coris BioConcept (Belgium)); Falconar, Andrew K (Universidad del Norte); El-Safi, Sayda (University of Khartoum); Sundar, Shyam (Institute of Medical Sciences); Miles, Michael A (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine)",20,0,1.54,5.66,https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/69/7/1130/30002822/ciy1062.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110482979,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being
5674,pub.1109813910,10.1002/ajb2.1187,30418663,,Early Miocene CO2 estimates from a Neotropical fossil leaf assemblage exceed 400 ppm,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The global climate during the early Miocene was warmer than the present and preceded the even warmer middle Miocene climatic optimum. The paleo-CO2 records for this interval suggest paradoxically low concentrations (<450 ppm) that are difficult to reconcile with a warmer-than-present global climate.
METHODS: In this study, we use a leaf gas-exchange model to estimate CO2 concentrations using stomatal characteristics of fossil leaves from a late early Miocene Neotropical assemblage from Panama that we date to 18.01 ± 0.17 Ma via 238 U/206 Pb zircon geochronology. We first validated the model for Neotropical environments by estimating CO2 from canopy leaves of 21 extant species in a natural Panamanian forest and from leaves of seven Neotropical species in greenhouse experiments at 400 and 700 ppm.
KEY RESULTS: The results showed that the most probable combined CO2 estimate from the natural forests and 400 ppm experiments is 475 ppm, and for the 700 ppm experiments is 665 ppm. CO2 estimates from the five fossil species exhibit bimodality, with two species most consistent with a low mode (528 ppm) and three with a high mode (912 ppm).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite uncertainties, it is very likely (at >95% confidence) that CO2 during the late early Miocene exceeded 400 ppm. These results revise upwards the likely CO2 concentration at this time, more in keeping with a CO2 -forced greenhouse climate.","This work was supported by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Autoridad del Canal de Panama (ACP), the Mark Tupper Fellowship, Ricardo Perez S.A, National Science Foundation grant EAR 0824299 and OISE, EAR, DRL 0966884, the Anders Foundation, Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson and 1923 Fund.

Biosimilars, the regulated copies of biologic products, have a potential to reduce health care costs and expand access to treatment. However, because of a complex development process, biosimilars can be considered only those noninnovator biologics with satisfactory supporting evidence (ranging from structural to clinical), as outlined in the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO). In Latin America, a heterogeneous regulatory landscape and nonconsistent approval practices for biosimilars create decision-making challenges for practicing rheumatologists.
SUMMARY OF LITERATURE: Most Latin American countries either have adopted or are in the process of adopting guidelines for the approval of biosimilars. However, among several marketed bDMARDs in the region, currently there are only 2 products that could be considered true biosimilars, based on the WHO criteria. The rest can be considered only intended copies, whose safety and efficacy are not fully established. One such product had to be withdrawn from the market because of safety concerns.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Practicing rheumatologists in Latin America need to understand the regulatory situation for biosimilars in their countries. When considering bDMARDs that are not innovator products, clinicians should use only those that have been approved according to the WHO recommendations.

I’m running 10 min late”: An investigation into the self-regulation of mobile phone tasks while driving,"The adaptive behaviour of mobile phone distracted drivers has been a topic of much discussion in the recent literature, but the mechanisms of behavioural adaptation are still unclear. This study investigated the influence of driving demands, secondary task characteristics, and personal characteristics on behavioural adaptation of mobile phone distracted drivers. In particular, distracted drivers' self-regulation at strategic, tactical, and operational levels was investigated through a driving simulator experiment. In a high-fidelity driving simulator, participants driving through various driving conditions (e.g. interactions with pedestrian crossings, signalized intersections, merging ramps, roundabouts, etc.) needed to decide where and how to perform the following four mobile phone tasks: (a) ring a doctor and cancel an appointment, (b) text a friend and tell him/her that the participant will be arriving 10 min late, (c) share the doctor's phone number with a friend, and (d) take a 'selfie'. At a strategic level, the decision to pull over was modelled as a function of self-reported personal/attitudinal characteristics with a logistic regression model. Similarly, tactical self-regulation (decision to engage in a task while driving in a specific situation) and operational self-regulation (decision to temporarily stop the mobile phone task) were modelled as a function of driving demands and personal/attitudinal characteristics using a random-effects logistic regression model, which accounts for correlations resulting from multiple observations of a driver. Results suggest that tactical self-regulation is more common among distracted drivers followed by operational and strategic self-regulation. Personal beliefs regarding how safe it is to use the mobile phone for texting/browsing while driving were predictors of self-regulation for all levels. Drivers were observed to use the mobile phone more when the driving demands are low, e.g. while stopped at an intersection. This research suggests that distracted drivers engage in various levels of self-regulation, and future research could be focused on further theoretical refinement and development of technology-based interventions.","We acknowledge the financial support provided by the Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

The present study was designed to (a) compare problem solving skills of first year MBBS students after attending a TBL session on 'organ function test' with that of the students taught the same topic by didactic lecture, (b) assess their perception towards TBL and (c) evaluate if difference in academic standing and gender influence the learning outcome of TBL.One Hundred first professional MBBS students were divided by stratified randomization into two groups. Group I was exposed to TBL to teach 'organ function tests', while group II was taught the same topic by traditional lecture. The outcome of the T-L sessions was assessed by a test for problem solving skills. Student perception towards TBL was assessed from students' response to a questionnaire. No significant difference between the two groups in problem solving skills could be discerned. High achievers performed better after TBL session, while the low achievers were more benefited by traditional lecture method. The female students showed better academic performance after TBL in comparison to male students. The students gave positive feedback for TBL as an instructional technique. We conclude that TBL gives satisfaction, is not inferior to lecture in effectiveness and hence should be used as a T-L method for undergraduate medical students. Moreover, being more effective for female students and high achievers, it is judicious to utilize TBL more frequently for them in an attempt to provide the best individualized teaching. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(1):58-66, 2018.",,We hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest to declare and we have not received any funding for completion of this research work.,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education,,,"Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Learning; Male; Sex Factors; Students, Medical",2018-12-20,2018,2018-12-20,2019-01,47,1,58-66,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Das, Saswati; Nandi, Kajal; Baruah, Priyanki; Sarkar, Sajib K.; Goswami, Binita; Koner, Bidhan C.","Das, Saswati (Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, 110002, India); Nandi, Kajal (Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, 110002, India); Baruah, Priyanki (Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, 110002, India); Sarkar, Sajib K.

BACKGROUND: Nursing students frequently suffer academic burnout, which is brought on by different situations experienced during the training process and that can concern his psychological well-being. Resilience is a personal resource that allows adverse situations to be handled in a successful way.
DESIGN: Longitudinal design.
METHODS: Data were collected at two moments separated by 18 months (2014-2016), with 218 students at T1 and 113 at T2. At each time a questionnaire was given to them, with questions about socioeconomic demographics and three validated scales to measure academic burnout, resilience, and psychological well-being.
RESULTS: The three dimensions that make up academic burnout remained steady over time, while resilience increased and psychological well-being improved. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed the longitudinal effect of emotional exhaustion at T1 and at T2 they showed the longitudinal effect of resilience on psychological well-being at T2. The inverse hierarchical regression analyses did not reveal significant relationships for any of the variables measured at T2 in connection with psychological well-being measured at T1.
CONCLUSIONS: Emotional exhaustion was the most relevant dimension of academic burnout when predicting psychological well-being in the analysed sample. Moreover, resilience has an important positive effect on psychological well-being in the analysed sample. The practical implications of the results are discussed from the perspective of academic training and some recommendations are given for future research in this field.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We would like to express our gratitude to the nursing students who participated in this study.

Renal involvement is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality of systemic lupus erythematosus, and its diagnosis is based on renal biopsy, an invasive procedure with a high risk of complications. Therefore, the development of alternative, non-invasive diagnostic tests for kidney disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is a priority.
AIM: To evaluate the plasma levels of a panel of cytokines and chemokines using multiplex xMAP technology in a cohort of Colombian patients with active and inactive systemic lupus erythematosus, and to evaluate their potential as biomarkers of renal involvement.
RESULTS: Plasma from 40 systemic lupus erythematosus non-nephritis patients and 80 lupus nephritis patients with different levels of renal involvement were analyzed for 39 cytokines using Luminex xMAP technology. Lupus nephritis patients had significantly increased plasma eotaxin, TNF-α, interleukin-17-α, interleukin-10, and interleukin-15 as compared to the systemic lupus erythematosus non-nephritis group. Macrophage-derived chemokine, growth regulated oncogene alpha, and epidermal growth factor were significantly elevated in systemic lupus erythematosus non-nephritis patients when compared to lupus nephritis individuals. Plasma eotaxin levels allowed a discrimination between systemic lupus erythematosus non-nephritis and lupus nephritis patients, for which we performed a receiver operating characteristic curve to confirm. We observed a correlation of eotaxin levels with active nephritis (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index). Our data indicate that circulating cytokines and chemokines could be considered good predictors of renal involvement in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus.",,,Lupus,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Kidney; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Nephritis; Male; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",2018-11-19,2018,2018-11-19,2019-01,28,1,34-43,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Pacheco-Lugo, L.; Sáenz-García, J.; Quiroz, E Navarro; Torres, H.

DESIGN: We classified children 2) to assess stunting and overweight/obesity, respectively; mothers were categorized according to BMI to assess underweight (<18·5 kg/m2) and overweight/obesity (≥25·0 kg/m2). At the household level, we established four final anthropometric typologies: normal, underweight, overweight and dual-burden households. Separate polytomous logistic regression models for each of the surveyed years were developed to examine several maternal and familial determinants of the different anthropometric typologies.
SETTING: National and sub-regional (urban and rural) representative samples from Colombia, South America.
SUBJECTS: Drawing on data from three waves of Colombia's Demographic and Health Survey/Encuesta Nacional de Salud (DHS/ENDS), we examined individual and household information from mothers (18-49 years) and their children (birth-5 years).
RESULTS: Higher parity was associated with an increased likelihood of overweight and dual burden. Higher levels of maternal education were correlated with lower prevalence of overweight, underweight and dual burden of malnutrition in all data collection waves. In 2010, participation in nutrition programmes for children <5 years, being an indigenous household, food purchase decisions by the mother and food security classification were also associated with the four anthropometric typologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that maternal and family correlates of certain anthropometric typologies at the household level may be used to better frame policies aimed at improving social conditions and nutrition outcomes.","Acknowledgements: The authors thank everyone who was involved and provided useful comments and recommendations, and who were part of D.C.P.’s dissertation committee including Christine Hoehner and Katie Stamatakis.

However, there is limited evidence on the variables influencing sedentary behaviour in university students. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental, and time correlates of sedentary behaviour in university students. Records from 12 electronic databases were screened by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria included: (i) peer-reviewed articles written in English, Spanish, or French; (ii) studies including undergraduate or postgraduate university students; (iii) studies reporting on the association between sedentary behaviour and at least one variable. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017074198). A total of 126 studies published between 1994 and 2017 met the inclusion criteria. The primary measure of sedentary behaviour was self-reported screen time (61%), followed by total sitting time (28%). Most studies were cross-sectional (86%). After excluding high risk of bias studies (58%), only three intrapersonal variables were sufficiently investigated (≥4) to determine an association with sedentary behaviour: physical activity (negative association with sitting time), obesity markers (indeterminate associations with TV viewing), and gender - female (null associations with total sitting time and screen time). Overall, most of the reported correlates of sedentary behaviour were intrapersonal, non-modifiable factors. Further research on modifiable correlates covering all socio-ecologic levels is required to inform future intervention development. In addition, longitudinal studies are needed to enable the identification of determinants. Improvements in designing and reporting future studies are recommended to help strengthen the available evidence and facilitate future reviewing efforts.",We thank research librarian Dr. Tricia Kelly for her important contributions to the development of the database search strategy.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Preventive Medicine,,,Health Behavior; Humans; Leisure Activities; Obesity; Screen Time; Sedentary Behavior; Self Report; Social Environment; Students; Universities,2018-09-25,2018,2018-09-25,2018-11,116,East Mediterr.

2556,pub.1106900059,10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.08.089,,,Response of thin lightly-reinforced concrete walls under cyclic loading,"During the last two decades, thin concrete walls have been frequently used to brace mid- to high-rise buildings in some Latin American countries. This structural system differs significantly in terms of wall geometry and reinforcement layout from traditional cast-in-place reinforced concrete wall buildings. Limited experimental data on this wall system and the absence of post-earthquake field observations make it difficult to assess whether such walls behave similarly to the walls designed according to the current local design code. The paper presents and discusses the results of an experimental program comprising quasi-static cyclic tests of four slender, thin and lightly-reinforced concrete walls with different geometrical configurations, steel properties and reinforcement layouts, which correspond to a common construction practice in Colombia. The seismic response of the specimens was assessed in terms of crack propagation and failure modes, hysteretic and backbone curves, contribution of rocking, flexural, shear and sliding components to lateral drift, stiffness degradation, and energy dissipation capacity. The results suggest that the response of these reinforced concrete walls does not meet the performance specified in the Colombian regulation if they are designed to reach the maximum lateral drift allowed by the code.","The research was financed through an EPFL Seed Money grant through the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Cooperation and Development Center in Switzerland and additional funding was provided by Conconcreto.

2074,pub.1101653131,10.1137/16m1097031,,,An Ensemble Kalman Filter Implementation Based on Modified Cholesky Decomposition for Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation,"This paper develops an efficient implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter based on a modified Cholesky decomposition for inverse covariance matrix estimation. This implementation is named EnKF-MC. Background errors corresponding to distant model components with respect to some radius of influence are assumed to be conditionally independent. This allows one to obtain sparse estimators of the inverse background error covariance matrix. The computational effort of the proposed method is discussed and different formulations based on various matrix identities are provided. Furthermore, an asymptotic proof of convergence with regard to the ensemble size is presented. In order to assess the performance and the accuracy of the proposed method, experiments are performed making use of the atmospheric general circulation model SPEEDY. The results are compared against those obtained using the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF). Tests are performed for dense observations (100% and 50% of the model components are observed) as well as for sparse observations (only 12%, 6%, and $4\%$ of model components are observed). The results reveal that the use of EnKF-MC can reduce the impact of spurious correlations during the assimilation cycle, i.e., the results of the proposed method are of better quality than those obtained via the LETKF in terms of root mean square error.",,,SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing,,,,2018-01,2018,2018-03-20,2018-01,40,2,a867-a886,All OA; Green,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Sandu, Adrian; Deng, Xinwei","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

Saltwater intrusion into a river with high fluvial discharge: A microtidal estuary of the Magdalena River, Colombia. The Magdalena River (Bocas de Ceniza) forms a microtidal estuary subjected to numerous interventions aimed to guarantee navigability towards the port of Barranquilla, Colombia. Significant sedimentation processes are still frequent in this area, however. Understanding the dynamics of both saltwater intrusion and mixing conditions is a fundamental requisite to understanding the sedimentation dynamics in these types of estuaries. The effects of river discharge, tide, and winds on stratification patterns, and mixing and saltwater intrusion dynamics in the estuary of the Magdalena River were evaluated, focusing on the effects of river discharge variability. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model MOHID was implemented, and calibration and validation of the model were carried out using in situ velocity, temperature, and salinity data, obtaining Skill values greater than 0.90. To cover a wide range of variability in the main forcing factors (fluvial discharge, tide, and wind), the conditions recorded in 2010 were simulated when both phases of the El NioSouthern Oscillation phenomenon occurred. During that year, the river discharge ranged between 2465 and 16,463 m3 s1. Results revealed a stratified, saltwater wedge estuary, the dynamics of which were mainly dominated by river discharge. Tide and winds altered saltwater intrusion dynamics, mainly during low-discharge periods.","This research was partially funded by grants from the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) CRN3038, which is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant GEO-1128040), and from Colciencias (Proyecto 121571250890 Convocatoria 745: Hacia el entendimiento de la turbulencia y la floculacin en desembocaduras tropicalesProcesos fundamentales en la formacin de zonas de mxima turbidez y el transporte de sedimentos).",,Journal of Coastal Research,,,,2018-06-21,2018,2018-06-21,2018-11-01,34,6,1273-1288,All OA; Green,Article,"Ospino, Silvio; Restrepo, Juan Camilo; Otero, Luis; Pierini, Jorge; Alvarez-Silva, Oscar","Ospino, Silvio (Departamento de F, sica y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Restrepo, Juan Camilo (Departamento de F, sica y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Otero, Luis (Departamento de F, sica y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pierini, Jorge (Comisi, n de Investigaciones Cient, ficas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Bah, a Blanca, Argentina); Alvarez-Silva, Oscar (Departamento de F, sica y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Ospino, Silvio (Universidad del Norte)","Ospino, Silvio (Universidad del Norte); Restrepo, Juan Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Otero, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Pierini, Jorge (Comisi, n de Investigaciones Cient, ficas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Bah, a Blanca, Argentina); Alvarez-Silva, Oscar (Universidad del Norte)",27,10,,3.74,http://digital.cic.gba.gob.ar/bitstreams/632e6368-e54e-4588-bb3e-0646dd9863e1/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1109903144,37 Earth Sciences; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,

By the end of the Miocene, changes in the major hydrographic systems of the region produced losses of habitats and a regional faunal turnover, as has been documented in the geological record of the Urumaco region. Here, we report a new Tortonian aquatic and terrestrial vertebrate assemblage from two localities of the Caujarao Formation (El Muaco Member) in western Venezuela. The vertebrate assemblage includes a gharial (cf. †Gryposuchus pachakamue), alligatorid crocodylians (†Purussaurus and Alligatoridae indet.), a freshwater turtle (Chelus sp.), snakes (cf. Eunectes sp.), serrasalmids and pimelodids and thorny catfishes, a rodent (†Potamarchus sp.), pampatheres (†Scirrotherium sp.), sloths, as well as plant remains (coal and amber). Although the Caujarao Formation has been referred to as a fully marine environment, the new assemblage reported here suggests a freshwater input to the coastal area. Taxonomic and biogeographic affinities between the Muaco Member community and that reported from the Miocene proto-Amazonian systems are indicative of the persistence of ecological and hydrographic continuity at minimum until the end of the Miocene in at least an area of northwestern South America.","We thank to Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra for academic support and for the financial assistance (University of Zurich research monies) that made this work possible.

The results indicate that the surfaces present magnetization of approximately 4.0μβ/Mn atom, in agreement with the recently reported theoretical and experimental results. Calculations of surface formation energy indicate that Mn atoms are incorporated into top surface layers (first and second) of GaN, being the MnGa incorporation in the polar surface more energetically favourable than in the nonpolar surfaces. In addition, it was observed that the magnetic coupling between the Mn impurities depends on the surface orientation, which could be useful for the design of magnetic nanodevices.","AcknowledgementsThis work has been carried out with the financial support of Universidad del Norte and Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Research of Colombia) under “Convocatoria 658 - Convocatoria para proyectos de investigación en ciencias básicas año 2014”.",,Computational Materials Science,,,,2018-01,2018,,2018-01,141,,68-74,All OA; Green,Article,"Martinez-Castro, O.; González-García, A.; López-Pérez, W.; González-Hernández, R.","Martinez-Castro, O.

We present a full time–space discretization using the discontinuous Galerkin method with polynomials of any degree in time and the  ℙ 2 − ℙ 1  Taylor–Hood finite elements in space, and propose an a posteriori residual‐type error estimator. The upper bounds involve residuals, which are global in space and local in time, and an L 2 ‐error term evaluated on the left‐end point of time step. From the error estimate, we compute local error indicators to develop an adaptive space/time mesh refinement strategy. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results and the proposed adaptive strategy.",This research work was partially funded by Universidad del Norte under contract UN‐J‐2016‐33455.,"Funding Information The third author (NS) acknowledge the support provided by the Universidad del Norte, UN‐J‐2016‐33455.",Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations,,,,2018-09-05,2018,2018-09-05,2019-01,35,1,325-348,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Torres, Ricardo Prato; Domínguez, Catalina; Díaz, Stiven","Torres, Ricardo Prato (Institute of Mathematics, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Domínguez, Catalina (Institute of Mathematics, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Díaz, Stiven (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Domínguez, Catalina (University of Antioquia)","Torres, Ricardo Prato (University of Antioquia); Domínguez, Catalina (University of Antioquia); Díaz, Stiven (Universidad del Norte)",3,0,,1.13,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/num.22302,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106778794,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4903 Numerical and Computational Mathematics,
1808,pub.1086046455,10.1016/j.seps.2017.06.004,,,Discrete choice approach for assessing deprivation cost in humanitarian relief operations,"One of the key objectives of humanitarian logistics is to guarantee the timely delivery of supplies to people affected by disasters during the response phase. In this regard, it is fundamental to design appropriate models to minimize the social costs of response operations to distribute essential supplies to populations in need. In addition to merely cover logistics cost, social costs include deprivations costs, which are an increasing function of deprivation time, derived from the human suffering caused by the lack of access to a good or a service. This research uses the theory of discrete choices to assess deprivation costs due to the time spent waiting for the delivery of a basket of basic supplies, defined as the changes in the welfare of people affected by disasters. To this end, we designed a stated choice survey, applied to people living in areas affected by floods and earthquakes in Colombia. The estimated models consider the influence of individual's socioeconomic characteristics and random effects on the deprivation cost functions. The functions have a nonlinear structure, strictly increasing, and convex on the deprivation time. The results are useful for estimating the social costs of humanitarian relief operations.",The authors wish to thank the program PEER-NSF for supporting this research through the funding of the project “Integrated humanitarian logistic system for developing countries” (No. AID-OAA-A-11-00012).,,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,,,2018-09,2018,,2018-09,63,,33-46,All OA; Green,Article,"Cantillo, Victor; Serrano, Iván; Macea, Luis F.; Holguín-Veras, José","Cantillo, Victor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Serrano, Iván (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58#55-66, Barranquilla, Atlántico, 080002, Colombia); Macea, Luis F.

A total of 30 LAB belonging to the genus Lactococcus sp. (10) and Enterococcus sp. (20) were isolated from native fruits of Ecuador subtropical rainforest. Among Lactococcus species, the isolates assigned Gt28, Gt29, and Ella8, identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis with 99% identity, showing highly inhibitory potential against four food pathogens were further characterized. The treatment of cell-free supernatant with proteolytic enzymes indicated the protein nature of released components, which displayed a broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated the presence of lacticin 3147 gene in all isolates, lactococcin M gene in Gt28 and Gt29 but not in Ella8 and lactococcin A gene in Gt28 only. The antimicrobial activity was not linked to the presence of structural nisin gene as no amplification product was obtained. Treatment of Salmonella enterica ATCC 51741 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 at both vegetative and exponential phase of growth with the cell-free supernatant of Gt28 resulted in complete inactivation upon 3 h suggesting its bactericidal mode of action. An increment on inhibitory activity occurred when partial purified bacteriocin Gt28 was combined with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid rather than bacteriocin only, indicating that the cells were sensitized in vitro by the chelator agent acting synergistically to induce the killing of pathogenic cells.","The work was supported by the Technical University of the North, Grant No. 2618.

Elastic and phonon dispersion relation display that 2D h-IIIAs systems (III = B, Ga and In) are both mechanical and dynamically stable. Electronic structures analysis show that the semiconducting nature of the 3D-IIIAs compounds is retained by their 2D single layer counterpart. Furthermore, density of states reveals the influence of σ and π bonding in the most stable geometry (planar or buckled) for 2D h-IIIAs systems. Calculations of elastic constants show that the Young’s modulus, bulk modulus and shear modulus decrease for 2D h-IIIAs binary compounds as we move down on the group of elements of the periodic table. In addition, as the bond length between the neighboring cation-anion atoms increases, the 2D h-IIIAs binary compounds display less stiffness and more plasticity. Our findings can be used to understand the contribution of the σ and π bonding in the most stable geometry (planar o buckled) for 2D h-IIIAs systems. Structural and electronic properties of h-IIIAs systems as a function of the number of layers have been also studied. It is shown that h-BAs keeps its planar geometry while both h-GAs and h-InAs retained their buckled ones obtained by their single layers. Bilayer h-IIIAs present the same bandgap nature of their counterpart in 3D. As the number of layers increase from 2 to 4, the bandgap width for layered h-IIIAs decreases until they become semimetal or metal. Interestingly, these results are different to those found for layered h-GaN. The results presented in this study for single and few-layer h-IIIAs structures could give some physical insights for further theoretical and experimental studies of 2D h-IIIV-like systems.","This work has been carried out by the financial support of Universidad del Norte and Colciencias (Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Research of Colombia) under Convocatoria 712 - Convocatoria para proyectos de investigación en Ciencias Básicas, año 2015, Cod: 121571250192, Contrato 110–216.",,Computational Materials Science,,,,2018-03,2018,,2018-03,144,,285-293,All OA; Green,Article,"González-García, Alvaro; López-Pérez, William; Rivera-Julio, J.; Peteers, F.M.; Mendoza-Estrada, Víctor; González-Hernández, Rafael","González-García, Alvaro (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); López-Pérez, William (Grupo de Investigación en Física Aplicada, Departamento de Física, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rivera-Julio, J.

Several amino acid mutations in the azole target protein Cyp51Ap contribute to this resistance, with the most concerning being the environmentally derived TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A mutations. Here, we performed passive surveillance to assess a sample of the A. fumigatus population in the United States for the presence of these mutations.

Brackish brine (fed by meltwater inside the ice) is an expanding sympagic habitat in summer all over the CAO. We report for the first time the structure of bacterial communities in this brine. They are composed of psychrophilic extremophiles, many of them related to phylotypes known from Arctic and Antarctic regions. Community structure displayed strong habitat segregation between brackish ice brine (IB; salinity 2.4-9.6) and immediate sub-ice seawater (SW; salinity 33.3-34.9), expressed at all taxonomic levels (class to genus), by dominant phylotypes as well as by the rare biosphere, and with specialists dominating IB and generalists SW. The dominant phylotypes in IB were related to Candidatus Aquiluna and Flavobacterium, those in SW to Balneatrix and ZD0405, and those shared between the habitats to Halomonas, Polaribacter and Shewanella. A meta-analysis for the oligotrophic CAO showed a pattern with Flavobacteriia dominating in melt ponds, Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria in solid ice cores, Flavobacteriia, Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in brine, and Alphaproteobacteria in SW. Based on our results, we expect that the roles of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in the CAO will increase with global warming owing to the increased production of meltwater in summer. IB contained three times more phylotypes than SW and may act as an insurance reservoir for bacterial diversity that can act as a recruitment base when environmental conditions change.","We warmly thank the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat (www.polar.se) and the crew of RV Oden for their assistance with sampling and further help with practical matters before and during the LOMROG III cruise.

To that end, it assess the emotional strategies employed by Alicia, the protagonist, to cope with displacement after losing her home and family. Using the phenomenological methodology, it proposes a contrast between the sight (masculine strategy to control the space) and the tact (feminine strategy to regain the place), through a dialogue between spatial and passion semiotics, and emotional geographies. Thus, the contrast between the haptics and the optics unveils different ways to apprehend the world. This gives ground to interpret the displacement as a phenomenon that, without ignoring their suffering and grief, allowed women from traditional rural communities to find new ways to pertain to society and look at themselves.",,,Nexus,,,,2018-03-01,2018,2018-03-01,,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Prieto, Pamela Flores","Prieto, Pamela Flores (Universidad del Norte (Colombia))",,"Prieto, Pamela Flores (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.26,http://revistas.univalle.edu.co/index.php/nexus/article/download/6240/8458,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110215002,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

In contrast, the fossil and geological record indicate that the Cocinetas Basin was much wetter during the Miocene-Pliocene (∼17–2.8 Ma). Water needed to sustain the paleofauna could either have originated from local sources or been brought by a larger river system (e.g. proto Magdalena/Orinoco river) with headwaters either in Andean ranges or the Guyana shield. We present a provenance study of the Pliocene Ware Formation, using petrographic analysis of conglomerate clasts and heavy minerals, and U-Pb dating of 140 detrital zircons. Clasts and heavy minerals are typical of ensialic metamorphic and igneous sources. The detrital zircon age distribution indicates the Guajira ranges as the most probable sediment source. The overall results indicate that the fluvial system of the Ware Formation drained the surrounding ranges. The water was probably derived by local precipitation onto the Guajira peninsula.","This work was part of We thank GMAS Lab for sample preparations and Miguel Basei at CPGeo for his help with the geochronology.

Rainfall, temperature, and other climate variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. Likewise, climate can be determinant in outbreaks incidence. A growing number of studies have provided evidence indicating the effects of climate variability on vector-borne diseases. However, oftentimes, the different diseases and regions are not uniformly represented, scarcity or lack of publications in some countries is common. The objectives of this work were to analyze the distribution and abundance of publications on vector-borne diseases associated with climate variability in South America, identify those works that conducted a geographic analysis and detect the countries where outbreaks occurred and the climate variables with which they were associated. A systematic review of the literature published on vector-borne diseases linked to climate variability in South America was conducted, identifying, evaluating and summarizing scientific papers. The distribution of the study areas and disease type in the publications were represented on maps. Dengue and leishmaniasis were the most studied and widely represented diseases in South America. The country with the largest number of published papers and presence of all disease types was Brazil. Outbreaks of disease were related to different climate variables. Most diseases from the publications under study occurred in equatorial and tropical climates. The disease represented by the largest number of different types of climates was dengue. The technique used in this work allowed us to determine the status of knowledge of the main diseases associated with climate variability in South America. This methodology could be improved in the future by incorporating other bibliographic sources as well as other diseases related to climate variability.","This work was performed under the project PIO CONICET-UNER 146-201401-00011 from the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas and the Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos.

Thus we call them AMRD codes (almost MRD). An AMRD code is a code with rank defect equal to 1. These codes can be viewed as q-analogs of classical AMDS codes as considered in [3,7,9]. AMRD codes whose duals are AMRD as well are called dually AMRD. These codes have important symmetry properties. For instance, the number of codewords of minimum rank in C and C ⊥ are equal if the size of the matrices divides the dimension of C [4]. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for codes to be dually AMRD and we give a construction of such codes of minimal dimension. We also construct self-dual AMRD codes. Furthermore, we show that dually AMRD codes coincide with codes of rank defect one and maximum 2-generalized weight if the size of the matrices divides the dimension. The results may be seen as q-analogs of results established in classical coding theory [7,9].","The author is very grateful to J.

The thermal plant was modeled as a synchronous machine and the wind farm as a variable speed induction generator based on a doubly-fed induction generator. The load considered the ZIP, exponential recovery, induction motor, and frequency-dependent load models. The bifurcation points were found by continuation power flow and sensitivity analyses. In addition, dynamic voltage stability assessments were performed considering changes in the moment of inertia and the frequency parameters. All simulations were carried out in a 4-bus power system and using the power system analysis toolbox (PSAT) and MATLAB script code. The results show that the thermal generator had difficulties to maintain stability under dynamic load variations and frequency changes, the wind generator had difficulties to maintain voltage for the load with induction motors, and both generators had difficulties when the moment of inertia is increased.",,,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2018-06-01,2018,2018-06-01,,8,3,1401-1411,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Acevedo, Lina F.; Bothia-Vargas, Gilbert; Candelo, John Edwin","Acevedo, Lina F.

Abstract: Marine hunting was an essential activity in the way of life of the Atacama Desert littoral inhabitants, at northern Chile. A pillar in their social structure that was based in the material means to realize it, as boats and their sophisticated harpoon device, resting in the last the possibility of capture and drag mainland preys that substantially outweigh the hunter. Currently the knowledge of harpooning is scarce in archaeology. For this reason we will delve in their morphology, composition, technical qualities, instrumental diversity, and chronology from a 129 harpoon heads sample from different prehistoric periods (6500 cal BP to colony). We will begin conceptually defining the harpoon function, followed by a first typological exercise to order the multiplicity of forms and solutions in a global scale to place the analyzed specimens. In a second typological exercise we will classify the local expression diversity, differentiating them materially and placing them chronologically. Only after this necessary classificatory stage we can approach to their harpoon technology, the hunter role as a social subject, and the position of hunting in the littoral society.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2018,2018,2018,,,ahead,65-950,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"R., Benjamn Ballester","R., Benjamn Ballester ()",,"R., Benjamn Ballester ()",8,2,,,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/pdf/eatacam/n57/0718-1043-eatacam-00401.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105165259,,

This paper clarifies a mechanism through which an inefficient financial system can reduce productivity growth. Using a two-sector model, second, we examine the implications for employment and the distribution of income. Both classical and Keynesian versions of the model are considered; saving decisions are central in the classical version while firms’ investment and pricing decisions take center stage in the Keynesian version. We find that, although boosting the asymptotic rate of growth, a relaxation of credit constraints may reduce the share of the formal sector, increase inequality and underemployment, and have little or no effect on the medium-run rate of growth.",,,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,,,,2018-06,2018,,2018-06,45,,64-76,All OA; Green,Article,"Skott, Peter; Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo","Skott, Peter (University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA; Aalborg University, Denmark); Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo (Universidad del Norte)","Skott, Peter (University of Massachusetts Amherst; Aalborg University); Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo (Universidad del Norte)",11,2,,4.01,http://www.umass.edu/economics/publications/2017-13.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101201217,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,10 Reduced Inequalities; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Despite long-term efforts to prevent engagement in mobile phone tasks, drivers continue to use their phones while driving. To develop better policy and prevention practices, gaining an understanding of the predictors and strategies utilised by drivers who use their mobile phone for distracting tasks is necessary. Visually intensive tasks are the main interest of this investigation, e.g., texting and browsing. In an online-questionnaire in Queensland (Australia), of the 484 drivers who participated, a 33.5% (n = 162) of respondents reported using a mobile phone for texting and browsing while driving on a typical day. Answers from these participants were analysed for this study. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of the independent variables (personal characteristics, perceived crash risk, beliefs, workload management strategies, and police avoidance strategies) over the rate of texting/browsing events per hour driving. The final statistical model confirmed that drivers who reported previous collisions; who believed that the effects of doing the texting/browsing task would last after it was finished; and who reported keeping their phone low to avoid police had an increased texting/browsing incidence rate. Comparably, drivers who held a valid driving license for longer; who perceived larger crash risk regarding texting/browsing behaviour; who avoided mobile phone use in demanding driving conditions; and who used workload management strategies such as reduced speed when engaged in mobile phone use had a reduced texting/browsing incidence rate. The results provide insights into the limitations of actual enforcement control and potential opportunities for countermeasures.",,,Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice,,,,2018-10,2018,,2018-10,116,,112-121,All OA; Green,Article,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety – Queensland (CARRS-Q), Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Faculty of Health, Queensland, Australia; Queensland University of Technology (QUT), School of Civil Engineering and Built Environment, Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland, Australia; Department of Industrial Engineering, Division of Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte)","Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar (Queensland University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology; Universidad del Norte)",61,11,,15.87,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/120323/1/120323.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104649566,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Mortality associated with CAP remains high, even after excluding patients from nursing homes or those bedridden before CAP. According to the available studies, we can classify the timing of mortality of hospitalized patients with CAP as (I) early mortality (generally within the first 48 hours to 7 days after hospital admission); (II) short-term mortality (frequently measured in the first 28–30 days after diagnosis or during hospital admission); and (III) mortality occurring months or years after hospital discharge (long-term mortality). A considerable number of recognizable factors may impact CAP mortality. Importantly, the associated risk factors and the causes of mortality of patients with CAP can vary according to the time in which mortality is evaluated. Better understanding of predictors and causes may improve strategies for management and follow-up of CAP.

Very little, however, is known about the ecosystems that developed on the ecospaces first formed once the Altiplano reached its present high altitude. We present a micropaleontological (diatoms and ostracods) and stratigraphic analysis of Pliocene Member C of the El Descanso Formation that outcrops near the town of Yaurí, Perú. Lithofacies analysis indicates that fluvial conditions were eventually replaced by several lacustrine and marsh environments. Diatom and ostracod assemblages indicate that these bodies of water were alkaline, slightly saline and shallow. Lacustrine conditions were favoured by a change in the tectonic regime from compressional to tensional, which led to formation of small isolated basins, and by wet conditions. We hypothesize that a stronger and/or longer rainy season prevailed during that time in the Altiplano, possibly as a consequence of an intensified South American Summer Monsoon, driven by a warmer atmosphere, imposed by high concentrations of atmospheric CO2.","Acknowledgments C.

Estudio de prevalencia de enfermedad reumática en población colombiana mayor de 18 años","Introducción Las enfermedades reumáticas son causa frecuente de discapacidad, deterioran la calidad de vida y causan alto gasto en salud. El modelo COPCORD se ha implementado universalmente para estimar su prevalencia. El objetivo es estimar la prevalencia de las enfermedades reumáticas en la población colombiana mayor de 18 años. Métodos Se realizó un estudio de prevalencia utilizando un método probabilístico de muestreo aleatorio estratificado en 3 etapas: selección de los sectores cartográficos en cada ciudad, selección de los bloques de cada sector y del hogar de cada bloque. El cuestionario COPCORD, adaptado para Colombia, fue aplicado por entrevistadores estandarizados. La confirmación del diagnóstico fue hecha por un reumatólogo con acceso a toda la información. Resultados De un total de 6.693 personas encuestadas el 64% fueron mujeres. El dolor no asociado con trauma fue reportado por el 48% de los participantes. Los sitios más frecuentes fueron rodillas (35%), manos (26%), columna lumbar (20%) y hombros (16%). El malestar musculoesquelético no específico, la osteoartritis, el síndrome de dolor regional apendicular y la lumbalgia no inflamatoria fueron las enfermedades más prevalentes. La artritis reumatoide y la lumbalgia crónica inflamatoria fueron las condiciones inflamatorias más comunes. La fiebre chikungunya afectó al 6,68% de la población. Conclusión La prevalencia de la artritis reumatoide en Colombia es mayor a lo comúnmente reportado, menor para fibromialgia y gota, y similar para osteoartritis, lupus eritematoso sistémico y espondiloartritis. En Colombia, estas enfermedades representan un problema de salud pública sin que exista conciencia de su impacto en la población general. Introduction Rheumatic diseases are the leading cause of permanent disability. The COPCORD model is an effective tool in the determination of the prevalence of diseases. The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of rheumatic disease in a Colombian population over 18 years of age. Methods A prevalence study was carried out using a probabilistic method of stratified random sampling in three stages: cartographic sectors in each city, selection of the blocks of each sector, and the households of each block. The COPCORD questionnaire adapted for Colombia was applied by standardised interviewers. Confirmation of the diagnosis was made by a rheumatologist with access to all the information. Results Out of a total of 6,693 patients that completed the questionnaire, 64% were women. Pain not associated with trauma was reported by 48% of the participants. The most frequent locations were: knees 35%, hands 26%, lumbar spine 20%, and shoulders 16%. Non-specific skeletal muscle discomfort, osteoarthritis, regional appendicular syndrome, and non-inflammatory low back pain, were the most prevalent diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammatory low back pain were the most common inflammatory conditions. The prevalence of Chikungunya fever was estimated at 6.68%. Conclusion The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in Colombia is higher than commonly reported, lower than for fibromyalgia and gout, and similar for osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and spondyloarthritis. In Colombia these diseases are a public health problem without awareness of their impact on the general population.","En su realización se comprometieron instituciones especializadas en cada uno de sus campos: la Asociación Colombiana de Reumatología, que soportó económicamente el desarrollo del proyecto; la Universidad de La Sabana, que dio el respaldo metodológico y académico, y el Centro Nacional de Consultoría que realizó el trabajo de campo en 6 diferentes ciudades del país.

Abstract: This study aimed to characterize the process of knowledge recontextualization (Bernstein, 1990) based on the functions that Knowledge Genres perform in elementary school textbooks, used in Chile. The analysis was conducted on a corpus comprising the 11,139 instances of the 15 Knowledge Genres reported by Ibez, Moncada, Cornejo and Arriaza (2017), adopting a top-down bottom-up approach (Biber, Connor & Upton, 2007). Our results reveal 11 functions that can be performed by Knowledge Genres in school textbooks. Additionally, it was observed that some functions are realized in one or more Knowledge Genres and, also, that some Knowledge Genres perform two functions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that recontextualization can also be observed in the functions that Knowledge Genres perform in school textbooks and that such functions vary across subjects.",,,Revista signos,,,,2018-12,2018,2018-12,,51,98,430-456,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ibez, Romualdo; Moncada, Fernando; Arriaza, Valeria","Ibez, Romualdo (); Moncada, Fernando (); Arriaza, Valeria ()",,"Ibez, Romualdo (); Moncada, Fernando (); Arriaza, Valeria ()",5,0,,4.01,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/pdf/signos/v51n98/0718-0934-signos-51-98-00430.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110099401,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

Land monopoly in conventional economics is a theoretical ‘impossibility’ which, nonetheless, allows for a spatial empirical approach. We design a spatial land monopoly test of our own, understood as a pricing strategy where land prices can be ‘over and above’ those determined by city-wide location, urban regulation and externalities. We use the city of Barranquilla (Colombia) as a case study. This city offers ideal conditions for investigation of theories of land monopoly, given extreme land concentration in its highly regulated elite northern fringe. We found no evidence of land monopoly pricing using different specifications of the spatial tests, which conformed to standard urban economic expectations: the pattern of development pointing to different, political channels influencing development.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Urban Studies,,,,2018-09-18,2018,2018-09-18,2019-08,56,10,1931-1950,All OA; Green,Article,"Garza, Nestor; Lizieri, Colin","Garza, Nestor (Georgia Institute of Technology, and Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Lizieri, Colin (University of Cambridge, UK)","Lizieri, Colin (University of Cambridge)","Garza, Nestor (Universidad del Norte); Lizieri, Colin (University of Cambridge)",12,6,,3.22,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstreams/95ea866b-cdb9-4531-8a2e-efcf183e86db/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107095551,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,15 Life on Land
1276,pub.1107285596,10.2993/0278-0771-38.3.372,,,"On the Brink of Extinction: Llama Caravans Arriving at the Santa Catalina Fair, Jujuy, Argentina","The practice of using llama (Lama glama) caravans has decreased in Jujuy, northwestern Argentina, in recent years. Peasants, in this area known as pastores, llameros, or caravaneros, belong to Andean indigenous communities in Nor Lipez, Bolivia. The llameros, with their caravans, travel essentially to barter llama fiber in exchange for industrial food-products, mainly flour and sugar. The caravan trip to and from Santa Catalina takes an average of 12 days, five days going to and from the fair, and two days camping at the fair itself. These llameros belong to extended families that include young boys and women. Llameros have their own ethnotaxonomy and can recognize each animal of the troop. Today's llama caravans are pre-Hispanic in origin, thereby presenting collective continuance with the past. Yet caravans are disappearing given the ever more ubiquitous presence of vehicles, a trend that is also seen in other regions of the world. This paper presents a systematic study of the factors relating to the decline in the use of caravans in northwestern Argentina based on data collected from 2013 to 2017. Three reasons are offered (two socioeconomic and one environmental) to explain the observed decline: (a) the presence of a growing textile industry in Bolivia, with an increase in the demand for camelid fiber; (b) the improvement in living conditions in Bolivia; and (c) the drought that affected the area, with very little pasture for the animals on their route.","This work was funded by PICT 0479-2013 of the Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology Promotion, Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation of Argentina.

These stars are located in the outskirts of the disk, between 7° and 13° from the LMC's center where there is very low H I content. Gaia DR2 proper motions confirm that four stars formed locally, in situ, while two are consistent with being expelled via dynamical interactions from inner, more gas-rich regions of the LMC. This finding establishes that recent star formation occurred in the periphery of the LMC, where thus far only old populations were known.","D.I.C. and T.M.G. were supported, in part, by NASA grant 80NSSC18K0422.

In addition, an experimental investigation was carried out to verify the predicted trends of theoretical analysis and evaluate the performance of a modified scroll expander. The theoretical analysis showed that maximum effective first law and exergy efficiencies were 7.2% and 45%, respectively. The experimental tests showed that the scroll expander reached a 30–40% of efficiency when boiler temperature was 85 °C and rectifier temperature was 55 °C.

In this approach, for the spatial discretization, an arbitrary high order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element (DG) method is combined with a finite volume (FV) scheme in order to simulate complex flow problems involving strong shocks. Regarding the time discretization, a fourth order strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta method is used. In the proposed hybrid scheme, a shock indicator is computed at the beginning of each Runge–Kutta stage in order to flag those elements containing shock waves or discontinuities. Subsequently, the DG solution in these troubled elements and in the current time step is projected onto a subdomain composed of finite volume subcells. Right after, the DG operator is applied to those unflagged elements, which, in principle, are oscillation-free, meanwhile the troubled elements are evolved with a robust second/third order FV operator. With this approach we are able to numerically simulate very challenging problems in the context of MHD and SRHD in one, and two space dimensions and with very high order polynomials.

While it may contribute to the development of new combinations of exploration and exploitation, it may also lead to disagreements and potential conflict within top management teams (TMTs). To improve our understanding of the effectiveness of diversity in ambidextrous organizations, we develop a synergistic perspective on TMT diversity and examine how two types of diversity – functional and age diversity – affect the achievement of organizational ambidexterity. We also identify shared responsibility and CEO cognitive trust as important contingencies that may complement the effects of diversity within TMTs in terms of resolving potential conflicts and managing tensions between exploration and exploitation effectively. Based on multisource data, our study shows that CEO cognitive trust and shared responsibility moderate the relationship between different types of diversity and ambidexterity. Our study has important implications for research on organizational ambidexterity, diversity, and senior leadership.","We are grateful for the finance received by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (ECO2011-28706) and Conselleria d’Educació, Investigació,Cultura i Esport (GV2015-044) to carry out this research.

This study aims to extract chromium from chrome shaving waste, by alkaline hydrolysis or incineration in order to reuse it in leather tanning. Sodium hydroxide and carbonate were used in chemical hydrolysis and compared with incineration method in chrome yielding. Twenty five sheep pelts were tanned with recovered and commercial chromium 33% basicity to compare their effects in tanning. The results showed that among alkaline treatments, caustic soda was more effective than sodium carbonate in extraction, but incineration method was the best extraction method because of its high extraction yield (99.37%). Using sugar as a reducing agent was better than sodium sulphite to prepare tanning liquor. It increased chrome yield and produced chromium sulphate 33% basicity, which are more suitable for leather tanning. Most physical and chemical properties, except fat and ash contents, were similar in leathers tanned with recovered chrome and those tanned with commercial chrome. Thus, all studied tanned leathers were suitable for using in leather manufacturing.",,,Egyptian Journal of Desert Research,,,,2018-06-01,2018,2018-06-01,2018-06-01,68,1,75-88,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Nasr, Ahmed; Gaber, Mohamed; Ali, Hamdy; Eissa, Mahmoud","Nasr, Ahmed (); Gaber, Mohamed (); Ali, Hamdy (); Eissa, Mahmoud ()",,"Nasr, Ahmed (); Gaber, Mohamed (); Ali, Hamdy (); Eissa, Mahmoud ()",0,0,,0.0,https://ejdr.journals.ekb.eg/article_39093_c4832d145209b0c2b07be041a377bad0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117848297,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering",

Certain dimorphic traits are used in sex estimation methods, and populational variation in the expression of these traits can result in inaccurate sex estimation. However, the underlying causes of variation in trait expression remain unclear. This study explores body size, which also exhibits sexual dimorphism, as a potential factor influencing trait expression. To test this, skeletons of 209 individuals of varying body size were analyzed, and morphological traits were scored according to the Walker (2008), Klales et al. (2012), and Rogers (1999) sex estimation methods. Statistical analyses found significant correlations between body size parameters and expression of traits, with stature explaining more relative variance in trait expression than body mass. However, the relationships are weak and few in number, suggesting that body size has a minimal impact on the expression of these morphological traits.","The authors would like to thank Dr. Benjamin M.

Handheld measurement devices may be helpful but their accuracy is unknown. We compare a portable, science-grade solar UVR monitoring device against two fixed, science-grade solar UVR instruments.
METHODS: Instruments were (1) a fixed Solar Light 501 UV-B biometer to measure UV-B; (2) a fixed Kipp and Zonen radiometer used to measure UV-A and UV-B; and (3) Goldilux ultraviolet probes which are commercially available portable devices. Two different probes were used, one measured UV-A and the other UV-B radiation. The Goldilux probes were levelled and secured next to the UV-B biometer. Between 10:00 and 14:40 UTC+2, the UV-B biometer was set to record at 10-minute intervals and measurements by the Goldilux probes were manually taken simultaneously. Results were compared for all data and by solar zenith angle (SZA) ranges.
RESULTS: The Goldilux UV-B probe measured UV-B relatively well in its diurnal pattern, however, its readings were ~77% higher than those made by the UV-B biometer. While UV-A measurements from the Goldilux UV-A probe and those from the radiometer were in relatively good agreement in pattern, the radiometer read ~47% higher than the Goldilux UV-A probe. UV-B data from Goldilux UV-B probe had a moderately strong correlation with UV-B biometer data for small SZAs; conversely, for UV-A, the Goldilux UV-A probe had a strong correlation with the UV-A radiometer data for large SZAs.
CONCLUSION: Handheld devices may be useful to provide real-time readings of solar UVR patterns, however, to achieve synchronicity in the magnitude of readings to those made by science-grade fixed instruments, devices may need to be used during certain times of the day and in clear-sky conditions which may not be practical in personal exposure studies.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We acknowledge the South African Weather Service for provision of Biometer and Radiometer data and for providing us with access to the South African Weather Service sites for performing the experiments.,Dr Wright receives funding support from the South African Medical Research Council and the National Research Foundation of South Africa.,Skin Research and Technology,,,Humans; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Dosimeters; Radiometry; Skin; South Africa; Sunlight; Ultraviolet Rays,2018-02-23,2018,2018-02-23,2018-11,24,4,527-534,All OA; Green,Article,"du Preez, D.

The Magdalena River, the main contributor of continental fluxes into the Caribbean Sea, delivers important amounts of water and sediments into Cartagena Bay, a major estuarine system in northern Colombia. Until now, trends in fluvial fluxes into the bay, as well as the relationship between these tendencies in fluvial inputs and associated upstream changes in the Magdalena catchment, have not been studied. Here we explore the interannual trends of water discharge and sediment load flowing from the Magdalena River-Canal del Dique system into Cartagena Bay during the last three decades, forecast future scenarios of fluxes into the bay, and discuss possible connections between observed trends in fluvial inputs and trends in human intervention in the Magdalena River basin. Significant upward trends in annual runoff and sediment load during the mid-1980s, 1990s, and post-2000 are observed in the Magdalena and in the Canal del Dique flowing into Cartagena Bay. During the last decade, Magdalena streamflow and sediment load experienced increases of 24% and 33%, respectively, compared to the pre-2000year period. Meanwhile, the Canal del Dique witnessed increases in water discharge and sediment load of 28% and 48%, respectively. During 26y of monitoring, the Canal del Dique has discharged ~177Mt of sediment to the coastal zone, of which 52Mt was discharged into Cartagena Bay. Currently, the Canal drains 6.5% and transports 5.1% of the Magdalena water discharge and sediment load. By 2020, water discharge and sediment flux from the Canal del Dique flowing to the coastal zone will witness increments of ~164% and 260%, respectively. Consequently, sediment fluxes into Cartagena Bay will witness increments as high as 8.2Mty−1 or 317%. Further analyses of upstream sediment load series for 21 tributary systems of the main Magdalena during the 2005–2010 period reveal that six tributaries, representing 55% of the analyzed Magdalena basin area, have witnessed increasing trends in sediment load, raising the river's sediment load by 44Mty−1. Overall, trends in sediment load of the Magdalena and the Canal del Dique during the last three decades are in close agreement with the observed trends in human induced upstream erosion. The last decade has witnessed even stronger increments in fluvial fluxes to Cartagena Bay. Our results emphasize the importance of the catchment-coast linkage in order to predict future changes of fluvial fluxes into Caribbean estuarine systems.","This study was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) grant number 107756-001, Ottawa, Canada, in the BASIC Project, Basin Sea Interactions with Communities, Cartagena-Colombia.

The research uses stated choice data about preferences for water purchases under different scenarios of deprivation. The economic impacts are estimated as the change in consumer surplus caused by the deprivation. The estimated models show that the social benefits for timely delivery of critical supplies are considerably larger than the market price under normal conditions. The findings suggest that disregarding the effects of deprivation, or incorrectly estimating the economic value of critical supplies such as water, is bound to produce a significant miss-allocation of resources. The results produced in this paper could be integrated into economically consistent humanitarian logistics mathematical models that could lead to optimal allocation and distribution of critical supplies.",The authors wish to thank the program PEER-NSF for supporting this research through the funding of the project “Integrated humanitarian logistic system for developing countries” (No. AID-OAA-A-11-00012).,,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,,,,2018-06,2018,,2018-06,28,,427-438,All OA; Green,Article,"Macea, Luis F.; Amaya, Johanna; Cantillo, Víctor; Holguín-Veras, José","Macea, Luis F.

Chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (4600 M) attenuates pulmonary vasodilation induced by acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside. High Alt Med Biol. 19:149-155, 2018.
BACKGROUND: Previous studies performed in rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH), at a simulated altitude of 4600 m, showed reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, increased arginase activity, and increased oxidative stress. However, studies on vascular function are scarce. Our aim was to measure plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx) concentration and study pulmonary vascular function in rats exposed to CIHH in the presence of potassium chloride (KCl), acetylcholine (Ach), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP).
METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: A control group (normoxia (N), n = 10) and a CIHH group (2N × 2H × 30 days, n = 20). CIHH exposure was performed in a hypobaric chamber at 428 Torr (4600 m). Noninvasive systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate, and body weight (BW) were measured. Blood samples were obtained to measure NOx levels and hematocrit (Hct). CIHH animals that gained BW and presented a Hct <20% and maintained SBP were classified as tolerant, and animals that lost >30% of their BW, increased Hct and SBP >20% were classified as intolerant. Animals were sacrificed and small pulmonary arteries (SPA) were obtained to perform concentration-response curves to KCl, Ach, and SNP.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Intolerant rats (30%) had decreased NOx levels.

However, alginate scaffolds are bioinert and thus inhibit cellular interactions. To overcome this disadvantage, bioactive alginate surfaces were produced by conjugating tyramine molecules to high-molecular-weight alginates using the carbodiimide chemistry. Structural elucidation using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and contact angle measurements revealed a surface chemistry and wettability of tyramine-alginate hydrogels similar to standard cell culture treated polystyrene. In contrast to stiff cell culture plastic, tyramine-alginate scaffolds were found to be soft (60-80 kPa), meeting the elastic moduli of human tissues such as liver and heart. We further demonstrated an enhanced protein adsorption with increasing tyramine conjugation, stable for several weeks. Cell culture studies with human mesenchymal stem cells and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes qualified tyramine-alginate hydrogels as bioactive platforms enabling cell adhesion and contraction on (structured) 2-D layer and spherical matrices. Due to the alginate functionalization with tyramines, stable cell-matrix interactions were observed beneficial for an implementation in biology, biotechnology, and medicine toward efficient cell culture and tissue substitutes. © 2018 The Authors.

Despite the great advance on the structure and function of these receptors in the last decades, there is still lack of specific and potent antagonists for P2XRs subtypes, especially for the P2X4R. Here, we studied in detail the effect of the P2X4R antagonist 5-(3-bromophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzofuro[3,2-e]-1,4-diazepin-2-one (5-BDBD) on ATP-induced currents mediated by the rat P2X4R and compared its specificity among another rat P2XRs. We found that 5-BDBD is a potent P2X4R antagonist, with an IC50 of 0.75 μM when applied for 2 min prior and during ATP stimulation. Moreover, at 10 μM concentration, 5-BDBD did not affect the ATP-induced P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X7R current amplitude or the pattern of receptor desensitization. However, at 10 μM concentration but not 0.75 μM 5-BDBD inhibited the P2X1R and P2X3R-gated currents by 13 and 35% respectively. Moreover, we studied the effects of 5-BDBD in long-term potentiation experiments performed in rat hippocampal slices, finding this antagonist can partially decrease LTP, a response that is believed to be mediated in part by endogenous P2X4Rs. These results indicate that 5-BDBD could be used to study the endogenous effects of the P2X4R in the central nervous system and this antagonist can discriminate between P2X4R and other P2XRs, when they are co-expressed in the same tissue.","This work was funded by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH (C.C., and S.S.), FONDECYT Initiation Grant #11121302 and Regular grant #1161490 (C.C.) and CONICYT Ph.D. Fellowship #21181885 (M.J.H).

1073,pub.1099912786,10.1002/2017tc004785,,,Transition From Collisional to Subduction‐Related Regimes: An Example From Neogene Panama‐Nazca‐South America Interactions,"Abstract A geological transect across the suture separating northwestern South America from the Panama Arc helps document the provenance and thermal history of both crustal domains and the suture zone. During middle Miocene, strata were being accumulated over the suture zone between the Panama Arc and the continental margin. Integrated provenance analyses of those middle Miocene strata show the presence of mixed sources that includes material derived from the two major crustal domains: the old northwestern South American orogens and the younger Panama Arc. Coeval moderately rapid exhumation of Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene sediments forming the reference continental margin is suggested from our inverse thermal modeling. Strata within the suture zone are intruded by ~12 Ma magmatic arc‐related plutons, marking the transition from a collisional orogen to a subduction‐related one. Renewed late Miocene to Pliocene acceleration of the exhumation rates is the consequence of a second tectonic pulse, which is likely to be triggered by the onset of a flat‐slab subduction of the Nazca plate underneath the northernmost Andes of Colombia, suggesting that late Miocene to Pliocene orogeny in the Northern Andes is controlled by at least two different tectonic mechanisms.
Key Points    We evaluate the Miocene tectonic evolution of the northwestern Andes of Colombia through a multitechnical approach   Ongoing exhumation and deposition of middle Miocene strata with mixed provenance constrain the collision of the Panama Arc before 12 Ma   Late Miocene exhumation of the continental margin result from subduction tectonics that followed the collisional episode","This work was is the result of the MSc. thesis of S.

Central to our method is the introduction of the notion of fiberwise orthogonality, a strengthening of ordinary orthogonality which allows us to give a number of useful characterizations of the class of n‐excisive maps. We use these results to show that the pushout product of a Pn‐equivalence with a Pm‐equivalence is a Pm+n+1‐equivalence. Building on topos‐theoretic methods developed in previous work, we then prove a Blakers–Massey type theorem for the Goodwillie tower of functors.

We are considering an interaction between fermions with different masses leading to an inter-band pairing. In addiction to the attractive interaction we have an hybridization term to couple both bands, which in general acts unfavorable for the pairing between the electrons. We get first order phase transitions as the hybridization breaks the Cooper pairs for the s-wave symmetry of the gap amplitude. The results show the dependence of the Cooper-pair size as a function of the hybridization for T = 0 . We also propose the structure of the binding energy of the inter-band system as a function of the two-bands quasi-particle energies.","The authors thank to the Brazilian Agencies, FAPEAM and CNPq for partial financial support.",,Physica C Superconductivity,,,,2018-06,2018,,2018-06,549,,159-163,All OA; Green,Article,"Neto, F.

This work evaluated the effect of fine cellulosic components in organic mixtures and of enrichment with inoculum, on sulfate and metals removal in discontinuous cultures for three types of synthetic AMD. The cellulosic substrates evaluated were sawdust, microcrystalline cellulose, and forestry cellulose fibers, supplemented with cow manure and leaf compost. Using microcrystalline cellulose and forestry cellulose fibers with the less concentrated AMD, high sulfate reduction rates (73 mg/L-d and 58.2 mg/L-d, respectively) were achieved. Correspondingly, iron concentrations were reduced by 69% and 86.6%. Based on their higher sulfate reducing capacity, cellulose fibers obtained as fiber boards from a local kraft pulp mill were selected for treating a synthetic AMD with a high copper concentration (273 mg/L) and pH 4.94. In batch culture, low sulfate reducing activity (13.10 mg/L-d) was only observed at the highest substrate/AMD ratio (0.5:10) tested.

Additionally, there are currently no available blood-based markers of central glutamatergic function to support clinical diagnosis and aid brain based investigations.
METHODS: In this study, we measured levels of glutamate in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in-vivo using 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in medication free unipolar and bipolar patients (n = 29, 20 unipolar and 9 bipolar) experiencing a major depressive episode, in comparison with a group of matched healthy controls (n = 20). We also analysed peripheral glutaminase measured in serum to examine the relationship between central and peripheral measures.
RESULTS: Anterior cingulate glutamate levels were reduced in both unipolar and bipolar depression groups relative to healthy controls, although this only reached significance in the unipolar group. Peripheral glutaminase levels did not differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression and a positive correlation with central glutamate levels did not reach statistical significance.
LIMITATIONS: The sample of bipolar disorder patients was relatively small due to the difficulties involved in finding medication-free patients experiencing a depressive episode.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that glutamatergic hypofunction might represent a state marker for a depressive episode irrespective of diagnosis. Peripheral glutaminase did not index central glutamate levels in this study, which could potentially reflect a small magnitude of the effect requiring larger samples for detection.","This research was funded by Academy of Medical Sciences grant AMS-SGCL8 to DA, and a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Ph.D. studentship to TW supervised by AJC and DA.

To illustrate the potential of innovative solutions to this problem, this paper presents new research on the emission reductions associated with off-hour freight deliveries (OHD). The paper uses fine-level GPS data of delivery operations during regular-hours (6AM to 7PM), and off-hours (7PM to 6AM), to quantify emissions in three major cities in the Americas. Using second-by-second emissions modeling, the paper compares emissions under both delivery schedules for: reactive organic gases, total organic gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter. The results show that the magnitude of the emission reductions depends on the extent of the change of delivery time. In the case of the “Full” OHD programs of New York City and São Paulo—where the deliveries were made during the late night and early morning periods (7PM to 6AM)—the emission reductions are in the range of 45–67%. In the case of the “Partial” OHD used in Bogotá (where OHD took place between 6PM and 10PM), the reductions were about 13%. The emission reductions per kilometer are used to estimate the total reductions for the cities studied, and for all metropolitan areas in the world with more than two million residents. The results indicate the considerable potential of OHD as an effective—business friendly—sustainability tool to improve the environmental performance of urban deliveries. The chief implication is that public policy should foster off-hour deliveries, and all forms of Freight Demand Management, where practicable.","This research is made possible by partial funding from multiple sources, including: the VREF Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems, the Inter-American Development Bank grant “Methodology to Assess the Impacts of Congestion on Supply Chains”, and the Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Technologies’ project “Integrative Freight Demand Management in the New York City Metropolitan Area: Implementation Phase,” which is part of the United States Department of Transportation’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (USDOT’s OASRT).",,Transportation Research Part D Transport and Environment,,,,2018-06,2018,,2018-06,61,,84-103,All OA; Green,Article,"Holguín-Veras, José; Encarnación, Trilce; González-Calderón, Carlos A.; Winebrake, James; Wang, Cara; Kyle, Sofia; Herazo-Padilla, Nilson; Kalahasthi, Lokesh; Adarme, Wilson; Cantillo, Víctor; Yoshizaki, Hugo; Garrido, Rodrigo","Holguín-Veras, José (VREF Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180, USA); Encarnación, Trilce (VREF Center of Excellence for Sustainable Urban Freight Systems, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180, USA); González-Calderón, Carlos A.

1030,pub.1101636091,10.1016/j.ssci.2018.03.004,,,Contextual factors explaining risk-taking intentions at Australian level crossings,"In Australia, the number of collisions at level crossings (LCs) remains stable and even increased between 2003 and 2011. A consistent number of crashes between trains and pedestrians compared to a decreasing number of crashes between trains and vehicles calls for a better understanding of the factors underpinning pedestrians’ decision-making at such risky intersections. This study reports on an innovative method used to measure pedestrians’ crossing intentions and risk perceptions in crossing scenarios recorded at three representative LCs for Queensland (Australia). Predictors of crossing intentions were examined and compared between five scenarios. An online survey featuring the footages of the crossing scenarios was completed by 222 participants. The results revealed that pedestrians’ intentions to transgress depend on the situation, justifying the use of such methodology. Pedestrians perceived the lowest risk and reported the highest likelihood of risk-taking after the pedestrian lights are active, but before the pedestrian gates have started moving, confirming that pedestrian gates are an efficient safety measure. It was found that pedestrians perceive others as more prone to risk-taking at LCs, but not as being more at risk of fatal consequences, suggesting that the risk of being hit by a train as a pedestrian is generally perceived as low. Past unsafe behaviour, descriptive norms and perceived risk of being involved in a crash were found to be consistent predictors of the likelihood to engage in risk-taking behaviour at LCs across the different scenarios. Implications for future research and strategies to reduce habitual unsafe behaviour are discussed.",Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the CRC for Rail Innovation (established and supported under the Australian Government&#x27;s Cooperative Research Centres program) for the funding of this research.

New whole-rock geochemistry and isotopic constraints, together with a review of 332 geochemical, 76 isotopic and 204 geochronological data from Paleocene to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks exposed in central and western Colombia and Panama, are used to evaluate cause-effect relations between regional plate kinematics and the spatio-temporal distribution of the circum-Caribbean magmatic arcs. Short-lived, ~60–45 Ma arc-like magmatism in the Central Cordillera of Colombia was emplaced in a thickened continental crust due to the oblique subduction of the Caribbean oceanic plate underneath South America, as suggested by the high Sr/Y ratios. Conversely, the Panama Arc, and its poorly explored extension in the northwestern segment of the Western Cordillera of Colombia document a major phase of tholeiitic to calc-alkaline arc magmatism between ~71 Ma and ~34 Ma, mostly derived from a hydrated mantle wedge, and emplaced in an oceanic plateau crust. This arc record a major phase of magmatic activity between 40 Ma and 50 Ma that can be associated to changes in the convergence direction and subduction rates of the Farallon plate. Farther to the south, in the Pacific region of Colombia, Eocene arc-related rocks from the Timbiqui Complex show a geochemical signature that suggests a magmatic origin from melting of both a subduction-modified mantle and lower tectonically thickened crust. A possible interpretation for the Pacific and Western Colombia-Panama Arc systems, and its analogous in Ecuador, recall an Aleutian-type convergent margin in which the continental arc laterally switches to a purely oceanic system along the trailing edge of the Caribbean plate as consequence of eastward subduction of the Farallon plate.","The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute supported fieldwork in Panama.

Divisiones y uniones fotográficas entre descendientes de víctimas y victimarios de la guerra de España - y su amplio marco medial y transcultural,"Este artículo propone una mirada sobre el extenso y a la vez denso entramado de trabajos por la memoria postdictatorial articulada entre Argentina y España. Partiendo de sus implicaciones conflictivas más estudiadas, vuelca su mirada sobre los novísimos aportes tanto en términos generacionales como mediales, y en distintas cohortes descendientes de víctimas y victimarios. El interés por la transferibilidad de los esfuerzos mnemónicos de las sociedades postdictatoriales lleva a un objeto medial específico: la fotografía. La pregunta que orienta entonces el ensayo es cuáles serían las posibilidades de este arte (lúcido) de participar de un narrative que busque hacer visibles aspectos de una memoria a la que se la han inscrito anatomías de la división ideológica. Así, se analiza un encuentro entre descendientes de víctimas y victimarios de la guerra de España y su registro fotográfico realizado por José Aymá, y se verifica si este trabajo puede ser comparado con una obra genuinamente transcultural del argentino Gustavo Germano. Esta puesta en relación de dos trabajos fotográficos que enfocan los estatus de unión/separación, se verá enmarcada por una serie de reflexiones referidas a las (meto-)mnemografías transculturales que se expresan en el espacio de los nuevos medios. The present essay proposes a perspective on the very complex network of post-dictatorial ‘memory work’ articulated between Argentina and Spain, including not only the most conflictive zones —that have been widely studied— but primarily the newest contributions, both with regard to generational patterns and to media communication strategies. The essay’s focus lies on photography, seeing this form of expression as a ‘lucid art’ and as an important element when it comes to creating a narrative that helps to make visible certain aspects of a memory that has been ideologically divided. In the light of this, the essay analyses an encounter between descendants of victims and victimizers of the Spanish war, portrayed by José Aymá. The intention is to determine if the work of this Spanish photographer could be compared with another, genuinely transcultural work by the argentine photographer Gustavo Germano. Beyond this ‘dialogue’ of photographic portraits that focus the status of union versus separation, the essay suggests a number of reflections on the transcultural meta-mnemographies that are to be found in the new media space.",,,Memoria y Narración Revista de estudios sobre el pasado conflictivo de sociedades y culturas contemporáneas,,,,2018-10-06,2018,2018-10-06,,,1,76-113,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Bolte, Rike","Bolte, Rike (Universidad de Onsabrück Universidad del Norte Barranquilla)",,"Bolte, Rike (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://journals.uio.no/MyN/article/download/6073/5477,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135466038,,

However, it is unclear to what degree these patterns of morphometric change reflect symptom dimensions. Here, we aimed to predict depressive symptoms and hypomanic symptoms based on patterns of grey matter volume using machine learning.
METHOD: We used machine learning methods combined with voxel-based morphometry to predict depressive and self-reported hypomanic symptoms from grey matter volume in a sample of 47 individuals with unmedicated unipolar and bipolar depression.
RESULTS: We were able to predict depressive severity from grey matter volume in the anteroventral bilateral insula in both unipolar depression and bipolar depression. Self-reported hypomanic symptoms did not predict grey matter loss with a significant degree of accuracy.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest that patterns of grey matter volume alteration in the insula are associated with depressive symptom severity across unipolar and bipolar depression. Studies using other modalities and exploring other brain regions with a larger sample are warranted to identify other systems that may be associated with depressive and hypomanic symptoms across affective disorders.","This research was funded by Academy of Medical Sciences grant AMS‐SGCL8 to DA, a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) PhD studentship to TW supervised by AJC and DA, a Medical Research Council (MRC) / IoPPN Excellence PhD studentship to LM, supervised by AJC and AMP and departmental funds generated by AJC and SCRW.

This integration is developed by encompassing the use of sensors, microcontrollers, civil engineering problems, app development, and fabrication. The proposal provides an explorative way of approaching the numerous possibilities that arise in civil engineering when it comes to IoT, automation, monitoring, and control of civil engineering processes. The used tools represent accessible and affordable ways for application in classrooms and in educational laboratories for beginners. The initial explorative approach implies the fusion of three realms: (i) the phenomenology and mathematics of varied civil engineering problems; (ii) the systematic use of digital fabrication technologies and electronic prototyping platforms; and (iii) the creative and visual way of developing codes provided by block‐based development platforms. This integration of perspectives is an attempt of approaching civil engineering mathematics to technology and arts with a rigorous scientific approach. A set of different examples is presented with the corresponding findings in educational terms. These examples are developed in a constructive, scaffolding‐based way and may contribute as a potential alternative in the development of open‐source teaching labs in civil engineering schools.","This educational research has been granted to Camins Makers by the AMD 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 scholarships of the School of Civil Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.

It was therefore a central adaptive problem for our ancestors to avoid damaging the willingness of other group members to render them assistance. Cognitively, this requires a predictive map of the degree to which others would devalue the individual based on each of various possible acts. With such a map, an individual can avoid socially costly behaviors by anticipating how much audience devaluation a potential action (e.g., stealing) would cause and weigh this against the action's direct payoff (e.g., acquiring). The shame system manifests all of the functional properties required to solve this adaptive problem, with the aversive intensity of shame encoding the social cost. Previous data from three Western(ized) societies indicated that the shame evoked when the individual anticipates committing various acts closely tracks the magnitude of devaluation expressed by audiences in response to those acts. Here we report data supporting the broader claim that shame is a basic part of human biology. We conducted an experiment among 899 participants in 15 small-scale communities scattered around the world. Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, shame in each community closely tracked the devaluation of local audiences (mean r = +0.84). The fact that the same pattern is encountered in such mutually remote communities suggests that shame's match to audience devaluation is a design feature crafted by selection and not a product of cultural contact or convergent cultural evolution.","We thank Angela Garcia, Carmen Hové, Elsa Ermer, Aaron Lukaszewski, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

To expand the understanding of how the material surface charge affects protein adsorption and mesenchymal stem cell behavior, differently charged surfaces with zeta potentials spanning from −25 mV to +15 mV were fabricated by the conjugation of poly(amidoamine) to alginate-based hydrogels. We showed that the increase of the biomaterials surface charge resulted in enhanced quantities of biologically available, surface-attached proteins. Since different surface charges were equalized after protein adsorption, mesenchymal stem cells interacted rather with diverse protein compositions instead of different surface features. Besides an enhanced cell attachment to increasingly positively charged surfaces, the cell spreading area and the expression of adhesion-related genes integrin α5 and tensin 1 were found to be increased after adhesion. Moreover, first results indicate a potential impact of the surface charge on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation towards bone and fat cells. The improved understanding of surface charge-related cell behavior has significant impact on the design of biomedical devices and artificial organs.","This work was supported by a grant from the German Federal Ministry of Education (BMBF), given to Heiko Zimmermann (grant no. 031A345B).

The method supplements rapid control prototyping (RCP) with effective math tools to quickly select and validate models of a controlled system. We show stability analysis of the classical and two modified buck converter models controlled by zero average dynamics (ZAD) and fixed-point induction control (FPIC). The methodology consists of obtaining the mathematical representation of power converters with the controllers and the Lyapunov Exponents (LEs). Besides, the theoretical results are compared with the simulated and experimental results by means of one- and two-parameter bifurcation diagrams. The responses of the three models are compared by changing the parameter K_s of the ZAD and the parameter N of the FPIC. The results show that the stability zones, periodic orbits, periodic bands, and chaos are obtained for the three models, finding more similarities between theoretical, simulated, and experimental tests with the third model of the buck converter with ZAD and FPIC as it considers more parameters related to the losses in different elements of the system. Additionally, the intervals of the chaos are obtained by using the LEs and validated by numerical and experimental tests",,,International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering (IJECE),,,,2018-06-01,2018,2018-06-01,,8,3,1551-1568,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hoyos, Fredy Edimer; Candelo, John Edwin; Taborda, John Alexander","Hoyos, Fredy Edimer (Universidad Nacional de Colombia); Candelo, John Edwin (Universidad Nacional de Colombia); Taborda, John Alexander (Universidad del Magdalena)",,"Hoyos, Fredy Edimer (National University of Colombia); Candelo, John Edwin (National University of Colombia); Taborda, John Alexander (University of Magdalena)",7,1,,1.47,http://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE/article/download/9223/9893,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105863072,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

Contar con una gran cantidad de fuentes y archivos de distinta naturaleza ha desarrollado las potencialidades metodolgicas, dando acceso a la comparacin de resultados a partir de los distintos documentos, promoviendo una visin crtica del anlisis individual de cada una de las fuentes, as como de los resultados de los diversos mtodos. La complementariedad entre ellos facilita una comprensin global de los variados aspectos que intervienen en la conformacin de las familias. En el caso de Beln, la integracin de registros parroquiales, revisitas y un padrn, informes eclesisticos y pliegos matrimoniales, me han llevado a distinguir fenmenos tales como la presencia de familias compuestas, dos posibles casos de poliginia, la tendencia masculina a la endogamia al interior del pueblo, las posibles preferencias que regulan los matrimonios -sobre todo en primeras nupcias-, as como a observar las dificultades demogrficas y sociales que me llevan a hipotetizar respecto del rol que jugaron estos factores en contra de la familia extensa y a favor del parentesco ritual. Abstract: The reconstitution of families of Beln gave me access not only to demographic aspects scarcely studied in Andean populations, but also to other qualitative phenomena, that allow a historical analysis related to marriage and kinship. The use of different kind of files and sources has strengthened the methodology development, which allows the comparison of different documents, fomenting a critical review of each of the sources as well as the results obtained using the various methods. Complementarity between them provides a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects involved in the formation of families. In the case of Beln, the integration of parish registers, revisitas and one padrn, church reports and marriage certificate have led me to distinguish phenomena such as the presence of compound families, two possible cases of polygyny, the male tendency towards endogamy within the village, possible preferences regulating marriages, especially concerning first marriage, as well as to observe demographic and social problems that lead me to hypothesize about the role those factors played in favor of ritual kinship and against extended family.",,,Estudios Atacameños,,,,2018,2018,2018,,,ahead,107-123,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ponce, Xochitl G.

Debido a que la utilización de dicho instrumento está dirigido al estudio de la depresión y la desregulación emocional en la población general, la muestra del estudio está compuesta por 446 estudiantes adultos de una institución académica de educación superior de Barranquilla, Colombia. Con base en el AFC se examinaron dos modelos de manera separada: un modelo definido por un factor general y dos factores específicos, representados por el modelo bifactorial y el modelo oblicuo (correlacionados). Los resultadosde dichos análisis se reportan separadamente para las subescalas “estado” y “rasgo”, y sugieren una estructura de dos dimensiones inversamente relacionadas, a las cuales se les denominó distrés y eustrés, en comparación a un modelo que incluya una sola dimensión general. Los indicadores deajuste del modelo de factores oblicuos para la subescala “estado” fueron satisfactorios, CFI = .984, RMSEA = .047 (IC 90 % = .034, .060), MFI = .943, SRMR = .064.

A Present-Day Issue,"El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar y discutir la aplicación de la categoría historiográfica translatio studiorum al conjunto de producción filosófica y teológica americana que se designa como scholastica americana, y fundamentar a su vez esta expresión señalándole un contenido específico que la convierta también en categoría historiográfica. Para ello se analizarán en primer lugar algunos caracteres de esta producción durante los siglos coloniales (mediados del siglo XVI a principios del XIX) estableciendo su delimitación geográfica, cronológica, temática e institucional. Se justificará la caracterización de la producción en los siguientes períodos: 1. Escolástico; 2. Pre-ilustrado ecléctico: 3. Ilustrado. Asimismo, se discutirá la tesis de Walter Redmond sobre la doble translatio de la lógica, tesis aplicable análogamente a las demás disciplinas filosóficas. La justificación epistemológica y metodológica de la categoría historiográfica scholastica colonialis americana incluirá los siguientes puntos: un proceso peculiar dentro de la categoría general; su contexto problemático; la consideración de la «tradición» filosófica americana (en el sentido gadameriano) como translatio americana; y su relación con la scholastica americana en el sentido que se le da en la historiografía reciente. This paper discusses the application of the historiographical category translatio studiorum to the compilation of American philosophical and theological production designated as scholastica americana, and substantiates this expression – by highlighting specific content that puts it in a historiographical category. The article analyses some characteristics of this production in the colonial period (from the mid-sixteenth century to the early nineteenth century), establishing its geographical, chronological, thematic and institutional delimitation. The characterization of the production is justified for the following periods: 1. Scholastic; 2. Eclectic pre-Enlightenment; and 3. Enlightenment.Walter Redmond’s thesis of the double translatio of logic is also discussed – a thesis equally applicable to other philosophical disciplines. The epistemological and methodological justification of the historiographical category scholastica colonialis americana includes the following topics: an unusual process within the general category; its problematic context; the consideration of the American philosophical ‘tradition’ (in the Gadamerian sense) as translatio americana; and its connexion with the scholastica americana as being understood in recent historiography.",,,Revista Española de Filosofía Medieval,,,,2018-12-20,2018,2018-12-20,,25,,81-96,All OA; Bronze,Article,"MENDOZA, Celina A.

In order to determine the effects of geographical isolation on population genetic structure and wing morphology, 281 individuals of the cosmopolitan odonate Pantala flavescens were collected from four continental (Central and South America) and five insular sites (Polynesian islands and the Maldives). COI sequences and eight microsatellite loci were used to characterize genetic diversity and genetic structure between and within locations. Linear and geometric morphometry were used to evaluate differences in the size and shape of wings. Genetic analysis showed a global genetic difference between the continental and insular sites. American locations did not show genetic structure, even in locations separated by a distance of 5000 km. Easter Island showed the lowest values of genetic diversity (mainly mitochondrial diversity) and the highest values of genetic differences compared to other insular and continental sites. Individuals from Easter Island showed smaller forewings, a different abdomen length to thorax length ratio, and a different configuration of anal loop in the hindwings. Thus, the greater isolation, smaller area, and young geological age seem to have determined the genetic and morphological differences in P. flavescens of Easter Island, where selection could promote a loss of migratory behavior and may improve other life history traits, such as reproduction. This work provides new insight into how microevolutionary processes operate in isolated populations of cosmopolitan species.","The authors thank doctoral fellowship Nº21130053 (CONICYT), Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands (ESMOI), Basal Grant PFB 023, ICM P05-002, and CONICYT PIA Apoyo CCTE AFB170008.

We test a series of hypotheses about the role of sex, foreign contact, ritual access, and temporal shifts, in the patterning of cranial trauma in this cemetery.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven crania from Coyo Oriental were analyzed using standard bioarcheological methods to determine sex and age as well as the presence of cranial fractures. We also documented the presence of Tiwanaku goods, objects tied to warfare or hunting, camelid offerings, snuff paraphernalia, and items related to mining.
RESULTS: We recorded 98 cranial fractures in the sample with 94.9% (93/98) on the anterior of the cranium. No significant differences are observed in the prevalence of trauma by sex, type of grave, or date. However, Coyo Oriental's trauma prevalence is two to three times higher than other Middle Period sites.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence and location of these injuries suggest that conflict at Coyo Oriental, while of the same nature, was at a scale different to that seen elsewhere in the oases. We posit here that the development of social hierarchy, population growth, expansive social networks, and foreign contact that characterized the Middle Period may have resulted in a need for social control among the emergent elites of the region.","We would like to express our gratitude to M.

900,pub.1100423543,10.1002/ecy.2142,29336480,,Species co‐occurrence networks: Can they reveal trophic and non‐trophic interactions in ecological communities?,"Co-occurrence methods are increasingly utilized in ecology to infer networks of species interactions where detailed knowledge based on empirical studies is difficult to obtain. Their use is particularly common, but not restricted to, microbial networks constructed from metagenomic analyses. In this study, we test the efficacy of this procedure by comparing an inferred network constructed using spatially intensive co-occurrence data from the rocky intertidal zone in central Chile to a well-resolved, empirically based, species interaction network from the same region. We evaluated the overlap in the information provided by each network and the extent to which there is a bias for co-occurrence data to better detect known trophic or non-trophic, positive or negative interactions. We found a poor correspondence between the co-occurrence network and the known species interactions with overall sensitivity (probability of true link detection) equal to 0.469, and specificity (true non-interaction) equal to 0.527. The ability to detect interactions varied with interaction type. Positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation were detected at the highest rates. These results demonstrate that co-occurrence networks do not represent classical ecological networks in which interactions are defined by direct observations or experimental manipulations. Co-occurrence networks provide information about the joint spatial effects of environmental conditions, recruitment, and, to some extent, biotic interactions, and among the latter, they tend to better detect niche-expanding positive non-trophic interactions. Detection of links (sensitivity or specificity) was not higher for well-known intertidal keystone species than for the rest of consumers in the community. Thus, as observed in previous empirical and theoretical studies, patterns of interactions in co-occurrence networks must be interpreted with caution, especially when extending interaction-based ecological theory to interpret network variability and stability. Co-occurrence networks may be particularly valuable for analysis of community dynamics that blends interactions and environment, rather than pairwise interactions alone.","M. A.

It is associated with diarrhea both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Direct person-to-person, zoonotic, and waterborne are the principal transmission routes. Despite the significant impact on public health of cryptosporidiosis, especially in developing countries, there are few studies on this parasitic disease. This systematic review will focus on the cryptosporidiosis situation in Colombia, describing the prevalence data on humans, other animals, and environmental sources. Species and subtypes, risk factors, and diagnosis techniques used in these studies are summarized.Recent FindingsSix electronic databases were searched for articles in Spanish, English, or Portuguese, using the keywords Cryptosporidium, cryptosporidiosis, intestinal parasites, and Colombia. Out of 569 studies identified in the electronic search, 42 articles were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in humans, animals, and water sources was 7.8, 20.4, and 38.9% respectively. Seroepidemiologic studies described a seropositivity prevalence rate of 83.3% in humans and 53.3% in adult cattle. Staining techniques were the most frequent method used in the parasite detection. Circulating species in Colombia included C. parvum and C. hominis both in humans and animals; C. felis and C. viatorum in humans; and C. muris and C. bovis in felines and bovines, respectively.SummaryCryptosporidium prevalence data in Colombia indicate a high risk of infection for this protozoon and reinforce the importance of its routine surveillance among humans, animals, and waterbodies. More genetic studies on circulating species and subtypes are required in order to characterize the transmission dynamics of cryptosporidiosis in the country, including host range, reservoirs, and infection sources.",,The author gratefully acknowledges the Committee for the Research Development (Comité para el Desarrollo de la Investigación-CODI) of the Universidad de Antioquia by supporting this investigation through the Fund for the First Professor Project grant (Code 2015-7020).,Current Tropical Medicine Reports,,,,2018-05-19,2018,2018-05-19,2018-09,5,3,144-153,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Galván-Díaz, Ana Luz","Galván-Díaz, Ana Luz (Escuela de Microbiología, Grupo de Microbiología ambiental, Universidad de Antioquia, Building 5-410, Medellín, Colombia)","Galván-Díaz, Ana Luz (University of Antioquia)","Galván-Díaz, Ana Luz (University of Antioquia)",7,1,,2.23,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40475-018-0149-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104125084,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",3 Good Health and Well Being

The information that was collected and served as support, was extracted from contexts where situations of pedophilia have been experienced. In Colombia, the problem of the sexual abuse of minors has taken on unexpected dimensions, making it necessary to rethink the criminal policy and all those policies that are related to the prevention of abuse; most statistics indicate that this is one of the most serious ways of damaging the physical, moral and psychological integrity of the victims. Pedophilia, considered a crime, punishable by penalties that does not comply with its fines and does not provide protection to minors; allows to make a reproach to the ineffectiveness and insufficiency of the norm and the criminal policy, in the face of this disorder, in a society where the real and effective protection of the rights of children has become a necessity.",,,Derecho y Realidad,,,,2018-07-05,2018,2018-07-05,,16,32,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Balaguera, Monica Paola Rincón","Balaguera, Monica Paola Rincón ()",,"Balaguera, Monica Paola Rincón ()",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.uptc.edu.co/index.php/derecho_realidad/article/download/13712/11858,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150868154,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The maintenance of mental health is commonly considered a sign of successful coping with adverse conditions. The goal of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the association between resilience and mental health in patients with a somatic illness or health problem.
METHODS: Studies were included if they reported measures of association between resilience, as assessed using a version of Wagnild and Young's Resilience Scale, and self-reported mental health. A systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline, Web of Science, PsycInfo, PubPsych, and ProQuest databases and in the dissertation catalogue of the German National Library. In addition, a manual search was carried out. The study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42017054822).
RESULTS: 55 studies involving a total of 15 003 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Assuming a random-effects model, the weighted mean Pearson correlation between resilience and mental health was r = 0.43 (95% confidence interval [0.39; 0.48], p<0.001). This association was robust, although the heterogeneity among individual effect sizes was substantial (I2 = 89.6%). Correlations tended to be weaker in unpublished studies than in published ones.
CONCLUSION: Despite substantial heterogeneity across studies, the findings suggest a strong association between resilience and mental health in the somatically ill. In clinical practice, a lack of resilience as a resource for successful coping might indicate a need for psychosocial support during treatment for somatic illness.",,,Deutsches Ärzteblatt international,,,"Adaptation, Psychological; Bias; Cost of Illness; Humans; Mental Disorders; Resilience, Psychological",2018-09-21,2018,2018-09-21,2018-09-21,115,38,621-627,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Färber, Francesca; Rosendahl, Jenny","Färber, Francesca (Institute of Psychosocial Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Jena, Friedrich-Schiller University Jena.); Rosendahl, Jenny ()",,"Färber, Francesca (Institute of Psychosocial Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Jena, Friedrich-Schiller University Jena.); Rosendahl, Jenny ()",87,30,3.43,24.37,https://ruidera.uclm.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10578/10072/TESIS%20Garcia-Maroto%20Fern%C3%A1ndez.pdf?sequence=1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106994245,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This work is dedicated to the case when S takes the half-integer spin S = 5 / 2 and when S assumes the integer value S = 2 . In both cases the phase diagrams exhibit new ferromagnetic phases (for certain values of K) enclosed by branches emerging from the first-order frontiers of the pure ferromagnetic model.

In this study, nitrifying microorganisms in Salar de Huasco (Chile) were surveyed to determine bacterial and archaeal contribution to ammonium (AO), nitrite oxidation (NO), ammonium uptake (AU) during wet and dry seasons. The activity signals from these groups were assessed by specific amoA-qPCR transcription, 15N tracer studies and addition of group specific inhibitor experiments for nitrifying microorganisms (N1-guanyl-1, 7-diaminoheptane [GC7]-archaeal specific and allylthiourea [ATU]-bacterial specific). Nitrifying communities, i.e. Nitrosopumilus, Nitrosospira, Nitrosomonas, Kuenenia and Nitrospira, were more frequent (∼0.25% of 16S rRNA sequences) at low salinity sites. Bacterial amoA-qPCR transcripts also increased at low salinity and along in situ ammonium increase observed between wet/dry seasons. Nutrient changes through time and 15N tracer experiments results showed that AO and NO were detected and peaked mainly at low salinity-high ammonium sites (<37 000 μS cm-1 and >0.3 μM), whereas AU was predominant at evaporitic sites. Our results indicate that salinity and ammonium affect the nitrifying communities that are potentially more active at low-salinity sites but persistent at saltier evaporitic areas of the wetland when ammonium is available.","We are grateful to C.

The role of competition in determining range limits and preventing invasions at biogeographic scales is more controversial, partly because of the complexity of processes involved in species colonization of novel habitats and the difficulties in performing appropriate manipulations and controls. We examined experimentally whether competition is likely to affect poleward range expansion hindering or facilitating the establishment of the limpet Scurria viridula along the south-eastern Pacific rocky shore (30°S, Chile) in the region occupied by the congeneric S. zebrina. We also assessed whether competition with the ""invader"" or range-expanding species could reduce individual performance of the ""native"" S. zebrina and depress local populations Geographic field surveys were conducted to characterize the abundance and identity of limpets along the south-eastern Pacific coast from 18°S to 41°S, and the micro-scale (few cm) spatial distribution across the range overlap of the two species. Field-based competition experiments were conducted at the southern leading edge of the range of S. viridula (33°S) and at the northern limit of S. zebrina (30°S). Field surveys showed poleward range expansion of S. viridula of ca. 210 km since year 2000, with an expansion rate of 13.1 km/year. No range shift was detected for S. zebrina. The resident S. zebrina had significant negative effects on the growth rate of the invading juvenile S. viridula, while no effect of the latter was found on S. zebrina. Spatial segregation between species was found at the scale of cms. Our results provide novel evidence of an asymmetric competitive effect of a resident species on an invader, which may hamper further range expansion. No negative effect of the invader on the resident species was detected. This study highlights the complexities of evaluating the role of species interactions in setting range limits of species, but showed how interspecific competition might slow the advance of an invader by reducing individual performance and overall population size at the advancing front.","This research was funded by FONDECYT #11121360 and #1160223, and PAI‐CONICYT #79150002 to M.A.A.

844,pub.1109833531,10.1090/tran/7405,,,Geometry of ν \nu -Tamari lattices in types A A and B B,"In this paper, we exploit the combinatorics and geometry of triangulations of products of simplices to derive new results in the context of Catalan combinatorics of ν\nu-Tamari lattices. In our framework, the main role of “Catalan objects” is played by (I,J¯)(I,\overline {J})-trees: bipartite trees associated to a pair (I,J¯)(I,\overline {J}) of finite index sets that stand in simple bijection with lattice paths weakly above a lattice path ν=ν(I,J¯)\nu =\nu (I,\overline {J}). Such trees label the maximal simplices of a triangulation whose dual polyhedral complex gives a geometric realization of the ν\nu-Tamari lattice introduced by Prévile-Ratelle and Viennot. In particular, we obtain geometric realizations of mm-Tamari lattices as polyhedral subdivisions of associahedra induced by an arrangement of tropical hyperplanes, giving a positive answer to an open question of F. Bergeron. The simplicial complex underlying our triangulation endows the ν\nu-Tamari lattice with a full simplicial complex structure. It is a natural generalization of the classical simplicial associahedron, an alternative to the rational associahedron of Armstrong, Rhoades, and Williams, whose hh-vector entries are given by a suitable generalization of the Narayana numbers. Our methods are amenable to cyclic symmetry, which we use to present type BB analogues of our constructions. Notably, we define a partial order that generalizes the type BB Tamari lattice, introduced independently by Thomas and Reading, along with corresponding geometric realizations.","The research of the first author was supported by the Austrian Science Foundation FWF, grant F 5008-N15, in the framework of the Special Research Program “Algorithmic and Enumerative Combinatorics”.

We prove the existence of a unique, locally mild solution and an extension property when the nonlinear term satisfies a local Lipschitz condition. Moreover, we guarantee the existence of the global mild solution and blow up profiles for a large class of kernels and nonlinearities. If the nonlinearity has critical growth, we prove the existence of the local $\epsilon $-mild solution.

However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win-win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.","We thank the many growers, field assistants, pest-control advisors, funders, agricultural experiment stations, and researchers who provided access to study sites, technical expertise, labor, and other types of investment underlying the studies in our database.

769,pub.1100819958,10.1111/acps.12852,29397570,,Short‐term and long‐term measures of cortisol in saliva and hair in atypical and non‐atypical depression,"BACKGROUND: Atypical depression may show lowered rather than raised short-term cortisol levels. Atypical major depressive episodes (A-MDE) may also be more closely linked to environmental factors and show overlap with somatic symptom disorders. Hair specimens allow measuring long-term cortisol levels.
METHODS: Twenty-seven A-MDE and 44 NA-MDE patients and 40 matched controls were tested. Measures of hair cortisol concentration [HCC] covering the previous 3 months and short-term cortisol parameters (six saliva specimens to assess the cortisol awakening response [CAR] and total daily cortisol output calculated as the area under the curve [AUCg]) were taken alongside measures of environmental factors and clinical variables.
RESULTS: There were no differences in HCC between the three groups (P = 0.8), and no difference in the CAR (P = 0.95). However, A-MDE showed lowered short-term cortisol output (AUCg) compared to controls (P = 0.04). A-MDE patients also reported a higher number of daily hassles, and higher levels of fatigue and impaired concentration than NA-MDE.
CONCLUSIONS: Normal long-term (HCC) and reduced short-term (AUCg) cortisol levels in A-MDE could suggest a disrupted long-term cortisol rhythm, perhaps affected by environmental factors or by certain symptoms, such as mid-nocturnal insomnia. However, other underlying explanations for these findings should also be investigated in the future.","Acknowledgements This research was funded by departmental funds generated by AJC, AHV and AHY and start up funds from the Academy of Medical Sciences to DA (Ref.

The study aimed to examine the factor structure and to explore the cross-cultural utility of the MHC-SF using bifactor models and exploratory structural equation modelling.
METHOD: Using multigroup confirmatory analysis (MGCFA) we examined the measurement invariance of the MHC-SF in 38 countries (university students, N = 8,066; 61.73% women, mean age 21.55 years).
RESULTS: MGCFA supported the cross-cultural replicability of a bifactor structure and a metric level of invariance between student samples. The average proportion of variance explained by the general factor was high (ECV = .66), suggesting that the three aspects of mental health (emotional, social, and psychological well-being) can be treated as a single dimension of well-being.
CONCLUSION: The metric level of invariance offers the possibility of comparing correlates and predictors of positive mental functioning across countries; however, the comparison of the levels of mental health across countries is not possible due to lack of scalar invariance. Our study has preliminary character and could serve as an initial assessment of the structure of the MHC-SF across different cultural settings. Further studies on general populations are required for extending our findings.",,"Funding informationThe work of Jarosław P.

Despite being highly celebrated on the coast, in the capital of Bogotá and other big cities of the country’s interior, champeta is still marginalized and not recognized as a music suitable for the rest of Colombian society. This article reviews the history of champeta music from the late 1960s to the late 1990s, with a particular focus on the diverging developments in Cartagena and Barranquilla, respectively. It analyzes factors that may explain the local and regional popularity as well as the national rejection of champeta, and concludes that the elements which made champeta regionally successful are precisely those elements which hindered its acceptance on a national level: namely, the focus on blackness and the African Diaspora, distinct class-based tastes, a loud claim to space by the lower classes, and the high regional stratification of the Colombian society.","I would like to thank my interview partners, also those who do not appear in this article.

Although there were whispers of rebellion in rural communities during the mid-1970s, and urban students studying in the countryside were prominent in these uprisings, it was only in the 1980s that rural youths reached a level of political consciousness comparable to that of their urban counterparts and began to play a leading role in local struggles against apartheid policies and the Bantustan system. In the 1970s, rural youths were increasingly drawn into the education system, but they had not yet developed a strong political consciousness, whereas by the 1980s young people throughout the country had developed, what Colin Bundy calls, “generational consciousness”. Ambient social and historical processes reshaped their consciousness and they became self-assertive and conscious of themselves as a distinct social category with a common identity. They realised that they had the capacity to effect far-reaching changes in society. This consciousness developed at the time when there were progressive erosion of African tradition and the legitimacy of chieftainship; thus rendering rural youths more receptive to urban youth culture and political ideologies propagated by the urban-based liberation movements. Using archival material and oral sources, mainly interviews with former students in the area, this article looks at changing patterns of youth mobilisation in the village of Zebediela in the northern Transvaal from 1976 to the early 1990s.",,,Southern Journal for Contemporary History,,,,2018,2018,2018,2018,43,1,21-42,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lekgoathi, Sekibakiba Peter","Lekgoathi, Sekibakiba Peter (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa)",,"Lekgoathi, Sekibakiba Peter (University of the Witwatersrand)",0,0,,0.0,http://journals.ufs.ac.za/index.php/jch/article/download/3518/3347,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105580055,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4410 Sociology,4 Quality Education

There were occasions whereby student political activists and their organisations were depicted as a united core, despite their political affiliations. However, at some point the underlying ideological differences took centre stage in the contest for political space on campus. This article attempts to highlight the role played by UNIQWA student formations and their contestation for political space, and the impact this had on the advancement of the liberation cause.",,,Southern Journal for Contemporary History,,,,2018,2018,2018,2018,43,1,137-159,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Twala, Chitja","Twala, Chitja (University of the Free State, South Africa)",,"Twala, Chitja (University of the Free State)",1,0,,0.55,http://journals.ufs.ac.za/index.php/jch/article/download/3523/3352,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105580060,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,

The common ancestral population radiated rapidly from just one of the two early branches that contributed to Native Americans today. We document two previously unappreciated streams of gene flow between North and South America. One affected the Central Andes by ∼4,200 years ago, while the other explains an affinity between the oldest North American genome associated with the Clovis culture and the oldest Central and South Americans from Chile, Brazil, and Belize. However, this was not the primary source for later South Americans, as the other ancient individuals derive from lineages without specific affinity to the Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a population replacement that began at least 9,000 years ago and was followed by substantial population continuity in multiple regions.","In Belize, we thank the Institute of Archaeology, our Maya collaborators, and the Ya’axché Conservation Trust for providing opportunities to consult with their community.

He is known to have, among many of his unravelling thoughts, objected to oppression and illuminated hope and freedom for the oppressed. In addition, Freire maintained that the liberation of the oppressed and, by extension, the liberation of the oppressor can emanate only from the oppressed. Thus, the ball in this regard may inadvertently be seen to be in the court of the oppressed. The South African higher education system in particular, as well as the education system in general, have continuously presented, contrary to the oppressors’ intentions, lecture rooms as sites or spaces where oppressive tendencies were deliberated and challenged. Contributing to the interrogation of, or on, oppression was an underlying quest for liberation, grounded on the utility of higher education as a vehicle for liberation. Therefore, higher education could not be divorced from the liberation struggle. In this article, the author traverses the history of the liberation struggle through the eyes of those who cared to write about it, as well as those who walked and toiled the grounds and lecture rooms of the then University of the North (Qwaqwa Branch), and the three former teacher training colleges in the former Qwaqwa homeland. It is argued that, while the reason for the existence of the former was to build capacity among the civil servants in the homeland and the provision of teaching qualifications for the latter (colleges), those higher education institutions made far-reaching and indelible contributions in respect of dealing with oppression and advancing the liberation struggle during the apartheid era and beyond.",,,Southern Journal for Contemporary History,,,,2018,2018,2018,2018,43,1,178-195,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hlalele, Dipane J.","Hlalele, Dipane J.

Previously, we have found that the mRNA for the purinergic P2Y2 receptor is significantly increased in GC samples as compared to adjacent healthy mucosa taken from patients diagnosed with GC. In this work, we studied in detail the purinergic signaling in the gastric adenocarcinoma-derived AGS cell line and compared to the non-tumoral epithelial cell line, GES-1. In AGS cells, we detected the expression of several purinergic receptors, and we found important differences in the expression pattern compared to GES-1 cells. Functional studies revealed a strong contribution of P2Y2 receptors in the increase in intracellular calcium, elicited by ATP, UTP and the specific agonist MRS2768. Purinergic responses were preserved in the absence of extracellular calcium and inhibited by the P2Y2 antagonists suramin and AR-C118925. In contrast, in GES-1 ATP induced significantly higher responses as compared to UTP and P2X receptor antagonists were able to partially block these responses. Proliferation studies showed that ATP regulates AGS cell proliferation in a biphasic manner, slightly increasing cell proliferation at 10 and 100 uM, but inhibiting at 300 uM ATP. On the other hand, 1-300 uM UTP, a selective P2Y2 agonist, increased concentration-dependently cell proliferation. The effects of UTP and were prevented by wide range and specific purinergic antagonists. In contrast in GES-1 cells ATP only decreased cell-proliferation in a concentration dependent manner and UTP had no effect. Notably, the application of purinergic antagonist alone was enough to change the rates of AGS cells proliferation, indicating that nucleotides released by the cells can signal through paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Finally, in tumor-derived biopsies, we found that whereas the expression of P2Y2 is significantly increased, the expression of P2X4 is significantly decreased, as compared to healthy tissues. Taken together, these results demonstrate the involvement of different purinergic receptors and signaling in GC, and the pattern of expression changes in tumoral cells, and this change probably directs ATP and nucleotide signaling from an anti-proliferative effect in healthy cells to a proliferative effect in tumoral cells.",,,Proceedings for Annual Meeting of The Japanese Pharmacological Society,,,,2018,2018,2020-09-10,2018,WCP2018,0,po2-10-10,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Coddou, Claudio; Hevia, M.

A case of the University of Fort Hare and Alice,"In the South African context, the post-apartheid university is deemed a critical contributor towards the national development agenda and community engagement is a significant principle through which universities would bring about social and economic transformation. This is reflective of a growing global movement of networks of universities iterating the civic and social role of higher education and its responsibility to its place. Drawing on notions of place-making, this study briefly recalls the histories of the University of Fort Hare and the town of Alice and evidences the more contemporary engagement policy, design and praxis of both, to surmise the significance the university gives to its place. The findings reveal a disconnect between the University of Fort Hare and the town of Alice and conclude that whilst the University of Fort Hare remains the economic power in Alice, it has no intrinsic commitment towards either the town or place-making.",,,Development Southern Africa,,,,2018-02-06,2018,2018-02-06,2018-09-03,35,5,673-688,All OA; Green,Article,"Thakrar, Jayshree S","Thakrar, Jayshree S (International Development Consultant (Independent), St Ives, England)","Thakrar, Jayshree S (International Development Consultant (Independent), St Ives, England)","Thakrar, Jayshree S (International Development Consultant (Independent), St Ives, England)",10,5,,5.65,https://zenodo.org/records/3768453/files/Ch9%20Anchored%20in%20Place.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100863019,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

It reveals how movements are able to reiterate established cultures of resistance across time and space through performative means. It also shows how – given requisite stage settings and skilful actors – methods of performance allow movements to subvert established structures of domination to their political advantage. It does this through focussing on Steve Biko’s role as a defence witness in an apartheid-era political trial of leaders of the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). It demonstrates how, within the courtroom setting, Biko and the defendants improvised upon various pre-established codes, scripts, and dramatic techniques, augmenting the likelihood that their performances would resonate successfully with their audiences. In addition, it shows how Biko and the defendants used social performance to subvert many of apartheid’s established culture structures, enabling them not only to explicitly articulate the principles of BC philosophy, but also to implicitly embody and act them out.",,,Cultural Sociology,,,,2018-02-28,2018,2018-02-28,2018-12,12,4,456-477,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Morgan, Marcus","Morgan, Marcus (University of Bristol, UK)","Morgan, Marcus (University of Bristol)","Morgan, Marcus (University of Bristol)",10,3,,3.99,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1749975517752586,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101278761,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,

As a result, and taking into consideration a broader view of the specialised nature of the teacher’s mathematical knowledge, the authors propose a framework which, whilst respecting the major domains of Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge, regards the specialisation in respect of mathematical knowledge as a property which is inherent to the model and extends across all sub-domains.","The Spanish Government (EDU2013-44047-P and EDU2016-81994-REDT), the Mexican Sub-secretary of Higher Education (PRODEP) and the Research Centre COIDESO (University of Huelva, Spain) supported this research.","The Spanish Government (EDU2013-44047-P and EDU2016-81994-REDT), the Mexican Sub-secretary of Higher Education (PRODEP), and the Research Centre COIDESO (University of Huelva, Spain) supported this research; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Ministry of Economy Industry and Competitiveness.",Research in Mathematics Education,,,,2018-07-19,2018,2018-07-19,2018-09-02,20,3,236-253,All OA; Green,Article,"Carrillo-Yañez, José; Climent, Nuria; Montes, Miguel; Contreras, Luis C.; Flores-Medrano, Eric; Escudero-Ávila, Dinazar; Vasco, Diana; Rojas, Nielka; Flores, Pablo; Aguilar-González, Álvaro; Ribeiro, Miguel; Muñoz-Catalán, M.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the esophageal body motility and the motility of the proximal jejunal loop in patients subjected to total gastrectomy.Patients and methodsA prospective cohort of 17 total gastrectomy patients, operated on 5 years earlier, were studied using high-resolution esophageal manometry including the first 7 cm of the jejunal loop.ResultsManometry results were similar for all patients, showing normal esophageal body motility, with the exception of the maximum intrabolus pressure that was elevated in all cases. The jejunal loop motility was disordered and ineffective.ConclusionEsophageal body motility was normal 5 years after total gastrectomy. However, maximum mean intrabolus pressure was elevated in all patients. The most plausible reason for this finding would be the resistance exerted by the motility of the jejunal loop. Although this abnormality might not explain the mild symptoms presented by some patients, its pathological consequences are of little relevance.",,,European Surgery,,,,2018-05-30,2018,2018-05-30,2018-10,50,5,215-220,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Beltrán, Marcelo A.","Beltrán, Marcelo A.

The subgiant leads to an age τ ≃ 3.2 Gyr for a mass MA = 1.39 ± 0.09 M⊙, in contradiction with its low iron-to-magnesium abundance that classifies it as a Population II (thick-disk) star. Upon the assumption of an ancient source, and since there appears to be no inner Aa–Ab subsystem for HR 3750, the mass of the subgiant primary can only be understood in terms of a merger with a former tertiary component. In a mass conserving scenario, and with MAa = 1.03 ± 0.03 M⊙ as the likely progenitor mass of the primary, the mass of the accreted companion is suggestive of an M dwarf at MAb = 0.36 ± 0.03 M⊙.",Based on observations with the MPG 2.2 m telescope at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programme 099.A-9022(A).

Moreover, it is shown that some of these bounds are sharp and examples of graphs attaining the corresponding bounds are given.","Acknowledgments We are indebted to two anonymous referees for the careful reading and for all their suggestions which improved the text.

A Macro Quantile Regression Approach,"The goal of this paper is to provide empirical evidence to determine whether microfinance, measured through a country's gross loan portfolio per capita, has a heterogeneous effect on poverty reduction among countries with different levels of poverty. We have used a panel‐data quantile regression with a data set for 57 countries for the years 2005, 2008, and 2011 to estimate the distributional impacts of microcredits on two poverty indices. Results reveal not only that microfinance significantly reduces the incidence and depth of poverty, but also that this effect differs across the different poverty levels (quantiles). The effect of microcredit on poverty reduction is slightly larger among countries where the incidence and depth of poverty are the highest, suggesting that microcredit reaches and benefits even the poorest individuals.",,,The Developing Economies,,,,2018-02-18,2018,2018-02-18,2018-03,56,1,51-65,All OA; Green,Article,"Lacalle‐Calderon, Maricruz; Perez‐Trujillo, Manuel; Neira, Isabel","Lacalle‐Calderon, Maricruz (Department of Economic Development, School of Economics and Business, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain); Perez‐Trujillo, Manuel (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Neira, Isabel (Department of Quantitative Economics, School of Economics and Business, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Spain)","Lacalle‐Calderon, Maricruz (Autonomous University of Madrid)","Lacalle‐Calderon, Maricruz (Autonomous University of Madrid); Perez‐Trujillo, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Neira, Isabel (University of Santiago de Compostela)",27,12,,11.24,https://minerva.usc.es/xmlui/bitstream/10347/32129/1/2018_tde_lacalle_does_postprint.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101104240,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,1 No Poverty; 10 Reduced Inequalities; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

The energy E ( G ) is the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of G. The vertex connectivity κ ( G ) is referred as the minimum number of vertices whose deletion disconnects G. The positive inertia ν + ( G ) corresponds to the number of positive eigenvalues of G. Finally, the matching number β ( G ) is the maximum number of independent edges of G. In this paper, we derive a sharp upper bound for the energy of the line graph of a graph G on n vertices having a vertex connectivity less than or equal to k. In addition, we obtain upper bounds on E ( G ) in terms of the edge connectivity, the inertia and the matching number of G.

Inestabilidad eclesial en su proceso de maduración,"Ecclesiastical and civil historiography, during the XIX and XX centuries, tried to prove that the independence of Latin-American countries caused a deep crisis in the ecclesiastical structure and in every day Catholic life. This hypothesis asserted that the Christian world-view and culture would not have been rooted enough to constitute an anthropological and sociological foundation of this society. The present study, based on unpublished documents, shows that, although the crisis existed, it didn't affect the ecclesiastical structure or personal religious experience, but, on the contrary was an original process of development, that will constitute an example for the interior continent.

This means that variables relevant to the Ghanaian setting that might be associated with RJ ideology have not been examined. The current study investigates the association between High School teachers’ Collectivism, Openness to Experience (OE), and their idea of Restoration. Analysis of data from 191 (Male = 128, Female = 63) teachers in Accra indicated that Collectivism and OE both predicted the idea of Restoration. This suggests that both Collectivism and OE are important resources that may help teachers embrace the idea of restoring a student offender to morally acceptable behaviour.

(2018) analyzed the Quaternary history of a purported paleo-lake in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. They provide a much more thorough analysis than previous publications of the field relationships where there are landform benches surrounding a bedrock knob, Cerro Soledad. They conclude that the benches formed due to shoreline erosion by a paleo-lake while Cerro Soledad rose in elevation due to tectonic activity. Ritter et al. (2018) also used terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (Neon, Beryllium, and Aluminum) data to determine a history of the landforms, and thus what they conclude is a history of former lake levels and uplift rate. This Comment examines the distribution of mapped geological units, especially Pliocene lake deposits, relative to the locations sampled and described by Ritter et al. (2018). We find that some of the benches sampled for cosmogenic nuclide dating occur on Miocene and Pliocene lacustrine strata, which opens the possibility that clasts were recycled from Miocene-Pliocene lake deposits into the Pleistocene bench clast population. We reach the alternative interpretation that differential resistance to erosion by hillslope processes created most benched forms on the flanks of Cerro Soledad, rather than generation of the benches by shoreline processes. An alternative exhumation scenario which utilizes the cosmogenic exposure ages better explains many of the landforms. In this scenario, the cosmogenic nuclide exposure dates reveal valley-scale denudation in response to tectonic uplift of Cerro Soledad, reduction of valley floor elevation by dissolution of evaporite units, and capture of the valley by the Loa River, rather than shoreline erosion. Irrespective of the alternative interpretation, the exposure history chronological information provided by Ritter et al.

                    Gaia
                    show a negligible contamination by the surrounding nebula, the difference is negligible for statistical distances based on radio flux, while those derived from H
                    α
                    surface brightness still show minor differences.

261,pub.1104293365,10.1029/2018gl078793,,,From Slab Coupling to Slab Pull: Stress Segmentation in the Subducting Nazca Plate,"Abstract  We investigate the stress field that the Nazca slab experiences during subduction beneath the South American plate by determining the focal mechanisms of moderate subduction‐related earthquakes continuously from 20‐ to 120‐km depth and inverting for the stress directions of four slab regions. Our results show the sharp termination of the coupling zone, which is characterized by compressional stresses, uplift of the overlying mountain range, and likely the activation of preexisting slab structures. Beyond and below this zone slab pull is the dominant stress. Near the slab surface, we also find signatures of the activation of inherited structures. Deeper in the slab, fault orientations are more likely controlled by the stress field alone. Along the subduction pathway, we find indication for an increase of the absolute slab pull component of the stress field that correlates with an increase in event rate and the occurrence possibility of M > 7 intermediate depth earthquakes. 
Plain Language Summary We investigated the sense of movement and the orientation of ruptures of moderate earthquakes that occur in the part of the Nazca tectonic plate which sinks below the South American tectonic plate. We aim to better understand why and how tectonic plates sink into the Earth. Our research shows that the earthquakes on top of the Nazca plate to about 50‐km depth occur, because both plates partially stick together in their movement against each other. Below 50‐km depth, the sticking together ends and the deepest part of the Nazca plate pulls on the shallower part, likely because there it is heavier. We discovered that the pulling becomes stronger below 100‐km depth, and we think that this is one aspect of why at this depth there are more and potentially very strong earthquakes. Our research also shows that ruptures that were mapped on the ocean floor are likely still there when the tectonic plate sinks into the Earth but that they do not reach deeper than approximately 12 km into the plate. With this knowledge we can start to estimate how heavy the plate is at which depth, where the pulling starts, and what contributes to it.
Key Points    We find a systematic segmentation of focal mechanisms of moderate earthquakes in a subducting slab   We observe the sharp downdip termination of the locked zone of the plate interface   Slab pull stresses are not fully transferred from below 100 km to the shallower parts of the slab","This work has been funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft research grant Ku 2484/2‐1.

Data from this high-cadence wide-field survey was originally analyzed for finding variable static sources using machine learning to select the most-likely candidates. In this work, we search for moving transients consistent with solar system objects and derive their orbital parameters. We use a simple, custom motion detection algorithm to link trajectories and assume Keplerian motion to derive the asteroid’s orbital parameters. We use known asteroids from the Minor Planet Center database to assess the detection efficiency of the survey and our search algorithm. Trajectories have an average of nine detections spread over two days, and our fit yields typical errors of , σe ∼ 0.07 and σi ∼ 0.°5 in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination, respectively, for known asteroids in our sample. We extract 7700 orbits from our trajectories, identifying 19 near-Earth objects, 6687 asteroids, 14 Centaurs, and 15 trans-Neptunian objects. This highlights the complementarity of supernova wide-field surveys for solar system research and the significance of machine learning to clean data of false detections. It is a good example of the data-driven science that Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will deliver.","J.P., C.F., F.F., J.S.M., G.C.V., S.G.G., and J.M. acknowledge support from Basal Project PFB-03, Centro de Modelamiento Matemático (CMM), Universidad de Chile.

Aiming to decide whether the star is a variable chemically peculiar (CP) star, we searched for the photometric and spectroscopic variability, and determined chemical abundances of σ Scl. The possible variability was tested using several types of periodograms applied to the photometry from Long-Term Photometry of Variables project (LTPV) and Hipparcos. Sixty spectrograms of high signal-to-noise (S/N) were obtained and used for chemical analysis of the stellar atmosphere and for looking for spectral variability that is symptomatic for the CP stars. We did not find any signs of the light variability or prominent chemical peculiarity, that is specific for the CP stars. The only exception is the abundance of scandium, which is significantly lower than the solar one and yttrium and barium, which are strongly overabundant. As a by-product of the analysis, and with the addition of 29 further spectra, we found that σ Scl is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with orbital period of 46.877(8) d. We argue that σ Scl is not an Ap star, but rather a marginal Am star in SB1 system. The spectral energy distribution of the binary reveals infrared excess due to circumstellar material.","This work was supported by the grants GA ČR 16-01116S, as well as MŠMT 7AMB14AT015 and 7AMB17AT030.

                    Our study has revealed that the effects of the nonphotospheric outer atmosphere are present in the spectro-interferometric data not only in the strong CO first overtone lines but also in the weak molecular and atomic lines. Therefore, analyses of spatially unresolved spectra, such as, for example, analyses of the chemical composition, should be carried out with care even if the lines appear to be weak.","We thank the ESO VLTI team for supporting our AMBER observation.

This is a long-standing unsolved inverse problem, but also necessary to apply a perturbation result, due to R. Rado, which has played an important role in the study of nonnegative inverse eigenvalue and inverse elementary divisors problems. Distinct versions of Rado's result have been also obtained for certain structured matrices. To apply Rado's result and its different versions we need to guarantee the existence of an r × r , r < n , nonnegative (structured) matrix with prescribed spectrum and diagonal entries. This is an important motivation for this work. Here, we prove new sufficient conditions for n ≥ 4 , which extend and strictly contain the Perfect and Fiedler conditions.

259,pub.1107146663,10.1029/2018gl079283,,,"Fluids Along the Plate Interface Influencing the Frictional Regime of the Chilean Subduction Zone, Northern Chile","Abstract  The plate interface beneath the Mejillones Peninsula in Northern Chile is characterized by anomalous seismogenic behaviors, with seismic and aseismic slip, and low coupling values. We analyze this zone through the seismicity pattern and a 3‐D tomography model. We identify high V  P  / V  S  values within the oceanic crust and in the lower continental crust, which we interpret as hydrated zones rich in fluids. These zones are correlated with the Mejillones fracture zone and with highly permeable lithologies of the lower continental crust, which allow a greater accumulation of fluids at the plate interface beneath the Mejillones Peninsula. Additionally, these areas exhibit a high rate of seismicity and concentrated swarms and repeaters. We propose that the presence of fluids controls the anomalous seismogenic behavior along the plate interface beneath the Mejillones Peninsula. 
Plain Language Summary The interplate zone beneath Mejillones Peninsula (MP), northern Chile, presents an anomalous seismogenic behavior with aseismic pulses, low coupling values, and acting as a seismic barrier for earthquakes occurred in adjacent areas. We believe that this anomalous behavior is due to the presence of fluids in the interplate zone under the MP. To corroborate this, we study the seismicity recorded by a local seismological network and constructed a tomographic velocity model. Our results show that within the oceanic crust and in the lower continental crust exist the presence of fluids that concentrates to the north and center of the MP, which correlate with the presence of the Mejillones fracture zone and with more fractured and permeable lithologies of the continental crust. This situation changes to the south of the MP where fluid concentration is lower. This is the first detailed attempt to characterize the role of fluids in the rheology of barriers within subduction zones and to distinguish geological controls on the fluid distribution. We believe that this type of study is fundamental for facilitating future prospective analysis of earthquake distributions and conducting hazard assessments.
Key Points    The Mejillones Peninsula presents variability in the distributions of seismicity, swarms, and repeaters    High V  P  / V  S  values indicate zones rich in fluids, correlated with the Mejillones fracture zone and permeable lithologies    Areas rich in fluids control the seismogenic behavior of the plate interface beneath the Mejillones Peninsula","This work was funded by the Fondap CIGIDEN project 15110017.

This has a northwestern orientation in the northern Chile-Argentina Andes between 21° and 26° south latitude with a northeastern directed subduction zone and developed on a continental crust represented by a metamorphic basement. A paleogeographical scheme for the Ordovician magmatic arc is proposed and two tectonic environments can be recognized from our own data and data from the literature: forearc and arc. The Cordón de Lila Complex can be assigned to a forearc position. Here the turbiditic flows become paralell to the northwestern elongation of the magmatic arc. The sedimentation in the frontal-arc high platform of the forearc is represented by stromatolitic limestones and a zone of phosphate production. The internal structure of the arc can be inferred from the petrographic composition of the turbidites: basaltic and andesitic lavas, dacitic and/or rhyolitic lavas and ash fall tuffs. Also the Quebrada Grande Formation was developed on the forearc. Plutonic Ordovician rocks testify the continuity of the magmatic arc.

The main goal of the project is to achieve a moderately high spectral resolution with R up to 5000 simultaneously in the 4300–6800 Å visible spectral range on a single standard CCD, together with an increased throughput. The experimental study consisted of (1) resolution and image quality tests performed using the solar spectrum, and (2) a total throughput test performed for a number of wavelengths using a calibrated lab monochromator. The measured spectral resolving power reaches values over R > 4000 while the experimental throughput is as high as 55%, which agrees well with the modeling results. Comparing the obtained characteristics of the spectrograph under consideration with the best existing spectrographs, we conclude that the used concept can be considered as a very competitive and cheap alternative to the existing spectrographs of the given class. We propose several astrophysical applications for the instrument and discuss the prospect of creating its full-scale version.","The creation and characterization of the prototype were supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant N14-50-00043).

This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8 weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4–8 weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,,,2018-03-27,2018,2018-03-27,2018-12,72,1,4,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Krüger, I.; Lenz, M.; Thiel, M.","Krüger, I.

The Guo's index λ 0 of a realizable list is the minimum spectral radius such that the list (up to the initial spectral radius) together with λ 0 is realizable. The Guo's index of block circulant matrices with circulant blocks is obtained, and in consequence, necessary and sufficient conditions concerning the NIEP, Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem, for the realizability of some spectra are given.","The authors would like to thank the referee for his/her constructive suggestions that improved the final version of this paper.

As such, they are constantly becoming coalitions of powerful constituencies who seek to influence the running of the council to satisfy stakeholder demands across the university and beyond. Consequently, there is a concern whether institutional stakeholder moves to become a part of the council and is bound to improving governance practices in the universities. This article argues that at the level of the university councils, the institutional strategies, policies and articulation with its different stakeholder groups are critical, using data obtained through the use of documentary sources, interviews and surveys. The results show that institutional stakeholders have strong inclinations towards the governance mechanisms of how individuals become members of the university council, calling for greater professionalization of the governance best practises for improving governance in strongly stakeholder-governed university councils and pointing out possible areas of further research.",,,Higher Education for the Future,,,,2018-12-04,2018,2018-12-04,2019-01,6,1,115-131,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Omal, Felix; Ndofirepi, Amasa Philip; Cross, Michael","Omal, Felix (Ali Mazrui Centre for Higher Education Studies, School of Education, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, Johannesburg, South Africa); Ndofirepi, Amasa Philip (Senior Lecturer, Education & Curriculum Studies Dept., Faculty of Education, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, Johannesburg, South Africa); Cross, Michael (Ali Mazrui Centre for Higher Education Studies, School of Education, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, Johannesburg, South Africa)","Omal, Felix (University of Johannesburg)","Omal, Felix (University of Johannesburg); Ndofirepi, Amasa Philip (University of Johannesburg); Cross, Michael (University of Johannesburg)",0,0,,0.0,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2347631118767295,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110385850,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

In this study, we evaluated how the photochemical efficiency, cell damage and reproductive biomass of Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) were affected by different intensities of UV-B radiation in the absence and presence of fungal endophytes. In addition, we evaluated the hormonal content of plants at different UV-B radiation intensities and how hormonal content was affected by endophytes. Overall, plants exposed to UV-B radiation showed higher numbers of flowers, higher total biomass and lower lipid peroxidation in the presence of endophytes compared with plants without endophytes. Photochemical efficiency was unaffected. Fungal endophytes affected the content of salicylic acid, jasmonate, indole-3-acetate and abscisic acid in shoot tissue of plants exposed to UV-B radiation. These results suggest that endophytes could modulate the hormonal content of C. quitensis to improve its ecophysiological performance under high UV-B radiation.","We acknowledge the financial, authorizations and logistic support of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH).

The selection of metallurgical equipment is especially critical, since it restricts the processing options that are available to different ore blocks, even as the nature of the deposit is still highly uncertain. Current approaches for long-term mine planning are successful at addressing geological uncertainty, but do not adequately represent alternate modes of operation for the mineral processing plant, nor do they provide sufficient guidance for developing processing options. Nonetheless, recent developments in stochastic optimisation and computer data structures have resulted in a framework that can integrate operational modes into strategic mine planning algorithms. A logical next step is to incorporate geometallurgical models that relate mineralogical features to plant performance, as described in this paper.",,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2018-05,2018,,2018-05,120,,118-126,All OA; Green,Article,"Navarra, A.; Grammatikopoulos, T.; Waters, K.","Navarra, A.

D. Arbañil, P. S. Lemos, and V. T. Zanchin, Phys. Rev. D 88, 084023 (2013)PRVDAQ1550-799810.1103/PhysRevD.88.084023]. An equation of state connecting the pressure p and the energy density ρ is assumed. In the nonrelativistic fluid case, the connection is through a nonrelativistic polytropic equation of state, p=ωργ, with ω and γ being respectively the polytropic constant and the polytropic exponent. In the relativistic fluid case, the connection is through a relativistic polytropic equation of state, p=ωδγ, with δ=ρ-p/(γ-1), and δ being the rest-mass density of the fluid. For the electric charge distribution, we assume that the charge density ρe is proportional to the energy density ρ, ρe=αρ, with α being a constant such that 0≤|α|≤1. The study is developed by integrating numerically the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. Some properties of the charged spheres such as the gravitational mass, the total electric charge, the radius, the surface redshift, and the speed of sound are analyzed by varying the central rest-mass density, the charge fraction, and the polytropic exponent. In addition, some limits that arise in general relativity, such as the Chandrasekhar limit, the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, the Buchdahl bound, and the Buchdahl-Andréasson bound are studied. It is confirmed that charged relativistic polytropic spheres with γ→∞ and α→1 saturate the Buchdahl-Andréasson bound, thus indicating that it reaches the quasiblack hole configuration. We show by means of numerical analysis that, as expected, the major differences between the two cases appear in the high energy density region.","V. T.

238,pub.1100287224,10.1111/geb.12713,,,Rare long‐distance dispersal of a marine angiosperm across the Pacific Ocean,"Abstract  Aim  Long‐distance dispersal (LDD) events occur rarely but play a fundamental role in shaping species biogeography. Lying at the heart of island biogeography theory, LDD relies on unusual events to facilitate colonization of new habitats and range expansion. Despite the importance of LDD, it is inherently difficult to quantify due to the rarity of such events. We estimate the probability of LDD of the seagrass Heterozostera nigricaulis , a common Australian species, across the Pacific Ocean to colonize South America.    Location Coastal Chile, Australia and the Pacific Ocean.   Methods  Genetic analyses of H. nigricaulis collected from Chile and Australia were used to assess the relationship between the populations and levels of clonality. Ocean surface current models were used to predict the probability of propagules dispersing from south‐east Australia to central Chile and shipping data used to determine the likelihood of anthropogenic dispersal.    Results  Our study infers that the seagrass H. nigricaulis dispersed from Australia across the entire width of the Pacific ( c.  14,000 km) to colonize South America on two occasions. Genetic analyses reveal that these events led to two large isolated clones, one of which covers a combined area of 3.47 km 2 . Oceanographic models estimate the arrival probability of a dispersal propagule within 3 years to be at most 0.00264%. Early shipping provides a potential alternative dispersal vector, yet few ships sailed from SE Australia to Chile prior to the first recording of H. nigricaulis and the lack of more recent and ongoing introductions demonstrate the rarity of such dispersal.    Main conclusions These findings demonstrate LDD does occur over extreme distances despite very low probabilities. The large number of propagules (100s of millions) produced over 100s of years suggests that the arrival of propagules in Chile was inevitable and confirms the importance of LDD for species distributions and community ecology.","This work was funded by the Deakin University School of Environmental Sciences collaborative research grant (to T.S., C.S., P.Y. and P,M.) and an Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship (to P.M).

238,pub.1100350569,10.1016/j.enggeo.2018.01.010,,,Block toppling stability in the case of rock blocks with rounded edges,"A characteristic feature of spheroidal weathering is the rounding of rock block edges, which affects the mechanical stability of slender rock blocks and, consequently, that of slopes prone to toppling. We analysed the influence of this erosion phenomenon on block toppling stability, first discussing the geological environments that produce this kind of phenomena and then reviewing classic limit equilibrium equations for block toppling that account for the role played by rounded edges. On the basis of this approach, it is clear that rounded edges do not greatly affect stability against sliding. However, since the equation to compute stability against toppling tends to overestimate the stability of slopes with round-edged slender blocks, we propose a modification that results in a more accurate estimation. In physical model testing in the laboratory, we compared results for sharp-edge block models and artificially weathered rounded-edge blocks, confirming our formulated hypothesis and enabling us to explain the failure of sets of a small number of not-so-slender blocks. Fieldwork case studies confirm that rounded edges play a role in decreasing stability against toppling. We suggest that our proposed approach can be an appropriate tool to take this effect into account.","The authors Leandro R.

Using a model where DM interacts with nucleons in the stellar core through a pseudoscalar boson (a) we find that the neutrino production rates from the dominant reaction channels or , with subsequent decay of the mediator , could locally match and even surpass those of the standard neutrinos from the modified nuclear URCA processes at early ages. We find that the emitting region can be localized in a tiny fraction of the star (less than a few percent of the core volume) and the process can last its entire lifetime for some cases under study.

In addition to offer flexibility benefits, random parameter models allow researchers to make conditional (posterior) inference on preference parameters at the individual-specific level. In this paper we extend the individual-specific experimental approach, that was conducted by Revelt and Train (2000) for the continuous heterogeneity distributions of a mixed logit, to the discrete case of the latent class logit model. Our Monte Carlo study results confirm the expectation that for a given number of individuals, the density of the conditional means converges to the conditional population as the number of choice situations increases. We also add to the analysis the behavior of interval estimates using two methods for the derivation of standard errors of the individual-specific estimates. In general, as we have more information of the choices made by the individuals, we are in better shape to identify individual-specific preferences. Our main conclusion is that accurate individual-specific estimation is possible – including correct assignment to classes, but a large number of choice situations is needed to correctly approximate the true underlying distribution.",This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation CAREER Award CBET-1253475 and FONDECYT Grant 11160104.,,Journal of Choice Modelling,,,,2018-06,2018,,2018-06,27,,50-61,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sarrias, Mauricio; Daziano, Ricardo A.","Sarrias, Mauricio (Department of Economics, IDEAR, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Daziano, Ricardo A.

The entangled double nature of the building–environment interrelation in an urban context is analyzed. The research question is whether an increase in the building density produces a superlinear increase of energy consumption at the urban scale. Advanced spatially explicit quantitative methods are used to select representative samples of the urban environment and to quantify the volumes of TM in four South American cities. Principal component analysis is used to extract representative urban tissue categories. The Urban Weather Generator tool is used to produce the urban weather data used in building performance simulations. The results confirm the superlinear dependence of the total cooling consumption of each sample in relation to the existing TM in areas with high-rise buildings due to the combined primary and secondary effects, namely, the increase of the total energy needs and the increase of air temperature due to the urban heat island effect. The great significance of the second-order effect poses challenges to current assessments performed on the basis of consumption per m2.

                    . Globular clusters are known to host multiple stellar populations, which are a signature of their formation process. The globular cluster E3 is one of the few low-mass globulars that is thought not to host multiple populations.
                  
                  
                    Aims
                    . We investigate red giant branch stars in E3 with the aim of providing a first detailed chemical inventory for this cluster, we determine its radial velocity, and we provide additional insights into the possible presence of multiple populations in this cluster.
                    Methods
                    . We obtained high-resolution FLAMES-UVES/VLT spectra of four red giant branch stars likely members of E3. We performed a local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis based on one-dimensional plane parallel ATLAS9 model atmospheres. Abundances were derived from line equivalent widths or spectrum synthesis.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    . We measured abundances of Na and of iron peak (Fe, V, Cr, Ni, Mn),
                    α
                    (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), and neutron capture elements (Y, Ba, Eu). The mean cluster heliocentric radial velocity, metallicity, and sodium abundance ratio are

The low Na abundance with no appreciable spread is suggestive of a cluster dominated by first-generation stars in agreement with results based on lower resolution spectroscopy. The low number of stars observed does not allow us to rule out a minor population of second-generation stars. The observed chemical abundances are compatible with the trends observed in Milky Way stars.","We thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the paper and constructive comments which improved the quality of the presentation.

                    The outer atmosphere of K giants shows thermally inhomogeneous structures consisting of the hot chromospheric gas and the cool molecular gas. We present spectro-interferometric observations of the multicomponent outer atmosphere of the well-studied K1.5 giant Arcturus (

                    Results.
                    The high spectral resolution of the VLTI/AMBER instrument allowed us to spatially resolve Arcturus in the individual CO lines. Comparison of the observed interferometric data with the MARCS photospheric model shows that the star appears to be significantly larger than predicted by the model. It indicates the presence of an extended component that is not accounted for by the current photospheric models for this well-studied star. We found out that the observed AMBER data can be explained by a model with two additional CO layers above the photosphere. The inner CO layer is located just above the photosphere, at 1.04 ± 0.02

Along with more and cheaper transportation alternatives, the use of FIFO/DIDO systems have importantly increased in last decades around the world, which has translated to FIFO/DIDO systems operating even when already established cities are present in extractive regions.

Archival Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (HST/WFPC2) narrow band filter images were used to investigate shocked regions by two independent methods: using low-excitation ions (via H α/[N ii] versus H α/[S ii] extended diagnostic diagrams) and by means of high-excitation species looking for regions of enhanced [O iii]/H α line ratios. Shocked region analysis via low-excitation ions shows that major deviations from the general inside to outside ionization trend correspond only to regions where fast low-ionization emission regions or low-ionization emission line structures are located. The reduction on the signal-to-noise ratio at the outskirts of the [O iii]/H α ratio maps made us unable to unambiguously identified for an enhancement on the [O iii]/H α line ratio as an indicator for shocks. For non-shocked regions, we performed a photoionization modelling using cloudy. Fittings to the [O iii]- and H α-observed radial profiles lead us to constrain on the free parameters of the density laws and filling factors together to temperatures and luminosities for the CSPNe. Best-fitting models show a very well representation of the [O iii] and H α emission. Discrepancies in the model fittings to the [N ii] and [S ii] profiles at NGC 6826 and NGC 3242 can be attributed in the former case, due to a contamination by the light of the CSPN and, in the latter case, either due to gas inhomogeneities within the clumps or to a leaking of ultraviolet radiation.","All data used in this paper were based on observations made with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration &amp; European Space Agency (NASA/ESA) Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained from the Hubble Legacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI/NASA), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF/ESA), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC/NRC/CSA).

225,pub.1104693084,10.3847/1538-4357/aac2c2,,,On the Use of the Main-sequence Knee (Saddle) to Measure Globular Cluster Ages,"In this paper, we review the operational definition of the so-called main-sequence knee (MS-knee), a feature in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) occurring at the low-mass end of the MS. The magnitude of this feature is predicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this reason, its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO) point has been suggested as a possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular cluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that the operational definition of the MS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection point of the MS (which we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is well distinct from the knee and which cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee is only visible in near-infrared CMDs, while the MS-saddle can be also detected in optical–NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones, we then demonstrate that the absolute magnitude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex from one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may not capture the full systematic error in the method. We also demonstrate that while the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost coincident in different models, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations which is not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable reference for absolute age determination. Moreover, when statistical and systematic uncertainties are properly taken into account, the difference in magnitude between the MS-TO and the MS-saddle does not provide absolute ages with better accuracy than other methods like the MS-fitting.",We thank the anonymous referee for the careful reading of the paper and the useful suggestions that greatly helped to better present our results.

225,pub.1103840887,10.1029/2018gl076998,,,What Can We Do to Forecast Tsunami Hazards in the Near Field Given Large Epistemic Uncertainty in Rapid Seismic Source Inversions?,"Abstract The variability in obtaining estimates of tsunami inundation and runup on a near‐real‐time tsunami hazard assessment setting is evaluated. To this end, 19 different source models of the Maule Earthquake were considered as if they represented the best available knowledge an early tsunami warning system could consider. Results show that large variability can be observed in both coseismic deformation and tsunami variables such as inundated area and maximum runup. This suggests that using single source model solutions might not be appropriate unless categorical thresholds are used. Nevertheless, the tsunami forecast obtained from aggregating all source models is in good agreement with observed quantities, suggesting that the development of seismic source inversion techniques in a Bayesian framework or generating stochastic finite fault models from a reference inversion solution could be a viable way of dealing with epistemic uncertainties in the framework of nearly‐real‐time tsunami hazard mapping.
Plain Language Summary Owing to recent advancements in rapid seismic source characterization and tsunami simulation, nearly‐real‐time tsunami hazard forecasts in the framework of tsunami early warning systems are starting to be within reach. However, in this study we bring a note of caution regarding its future operational implementation since the level of uncertainty associated to a single rupture inversion is high and thus calls for the use of multiple realizations of seismic inversions to forecast inundation maps and assess their uncertainty bounds.
Key Points    We provide an empirical assessment of the variability of finite fault inversions and its consequences for rapid tsunami hazard mapping   The variability in modeled tsunami maximum amplitudes, runups, and inundated 16 areas is of the same order as their median values evidencing a high inherent uncertainty   Combining the available knowledge to build a distribution of the tsunami source allows to obtain sound predictions of tsunami variables","This research has been funded by the CONICYT Fondap program under the grant CONICYT/FONDAP/1511017.

225,pub.1103659749,10.1111/jbi.13231,,,Global species delimitation and phylogeography of the circumtropical ‘sexy shrimp’ Thor amboinensis reveals a cryptic species complex and secondary contact in the Indo‐West Pacific,"Abstract  Aim  The “sexy shrimp” Thor amboinensis is currently considered a single circumtropical species. However, the tropical oceans are partitioned by hard and soft barriers to dispersal, providing ample opportunity for allopatric speciation. Herein, we test the null hypothesis that T. amboinensis is a single global species, reconstruct its global biogeographical history, and comment on population‐level patterns throughout the Tropical Western Atlantic.    Location Coral reefs in all tropical oceans.   Methods  Specimens of Thor amboinensis were obtained through field collection and museum holdings. We used one mitochondrial ( COI ) and two nuclear (NaK, enolase) gene fragments for global species delimitation and phylogenetic analyses ( n  = 83 individuals, 30 sample localities), while phylogeographical reconstruction in the TWA was based on COI only ( n  = 303 individuals, 10 sample localities).    Results  We found evidence for at least five cryptic lineages (9%–22% COI pairwise sequence divergence): four in the Indo‐West Pacific and one in the Tropical Western Atlantic. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that endemic lineages from Japan and the South Central Pacific are more closely related to the Tropical Western Atlantic lineage than to a co‐occurring lineage that is widespread throughout the Indo‐West Pacific. Concatenated and species tree phylogenetic analyses differ in the placement of an endemic Red Sea lineage and suggest alternate dispersal pathways into the Atlantic. Phylogeographical reconstruction throughout the Tropical Western Atlantic reveals little genetic structure over more than 3,000 km.    Main conclusions  Thor amboinensis is a species complex that has undergone a series of allopatric speciation events and whose members are in secondary contact in the Indo‐West Pacific. Nuclear‐ and mitochondrial‐ gene phylogenies show evidence of introgression between lineages inferred to have been separated more than 20 Ma. Phylogenetic discordance between multi‐locus analyses suggest that T. amboinensis originated in the Tethys sea and dispersed into the Atlantic and Indo‐West Pacific through the Tethys seaway or, alternatively, originated in the Indo‐West Pacific and dispersed into the Atlantic around South Africa. Population‐level patterns in the Caribbean indicate extensive gene flow across the region.",,,Journal of Biogeography,,,,2018-04-27,2018,2018-04-27,2018-06,45,6,1275-1287,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Titus, Benjamin M.; Daly, Marymegan; Hamilton, Natalie; Berumen, Michael L.; Baeza, J.

This system is only one of three field-age (>1 Gyr), late M dwarf eclipsing binaries known, and has a period of 1.74774 d, similar to that of CM Dra and KOI126. Modelling of the eclipses and radial velocities shows that the component masses are Mpri =$0.17391 ^{+0.00153}_{-0.00099}$ M⊙, Msec = $0.17418 ^{+0.00193}_{-0.00059}$ M⊙; and the radii are Rpri = $0.2045 ^{+0.0038}_{-0.0058}$ R⊙, Rsec= $0.2168 ^{+0.0047}_{-0.0048}$ R⊙. The effective temperatures are $T_{\rm pri}=2995\, ^{+85}_{-105}$ K and $T_{\rm sec}=2997\, ^{+66}_{-101}$K, consistent with M5 dwarfs and broadly consistent with main-sequence models. This pair represents a valuable addition that can be used to constrain the mass–radius relationship at the low-mass end of the stellar sequence.","This publication is based on data collected under the NGTS project at the ESO La Silla Paranal Observatory.

                    The bulge globular clusters (GCs) are key tracers of the bulge, a central and ancient component of our Galaxy. It is essential to understand their formation and evolution to study that of the bulge, as well as their relationship with the other Galactic GC systems (halo and disk GCs). High-resolution spectroscopy is a powerful tool for such studies, allowing us to obtain a detailed chemical characterization and kinematics of the clusters and to compare their chemical patterns with those of their halo and disk counterparts.
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    Our main goals are to obtain detailed abundances for a sample of seven red giant members of NGC 6528 in order to characterize their chemical composition and study the relationship of this GC with the bulge, and with other bulge, halo, and disk GCs. Moreover, we analyze this cluster’s behavior associated with the multiple-populations phenomenon.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    We obtained the stellar parameters and chemical abundances of light elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu),
                    α
                    -elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and heavy elements (Zr, Ba, Eu) in seven red giant members of NGC 6528 using high-resolution spectroscopy from FLAMES-UVES.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    In six stars of our sample we obtained a mean iron content of [Fe/H] = − 0.14 ± 0.03 dex, in good agreement with other studies. We found no significant internal iron spread. We detected one candidate variable star, which was excluded from the mean in iron content, and derived a metallicity in this star of [Fe/H] = − 0.55 ± 0.04 dex. Moreover, we found no extended O-Na anticorrelation but instead only an intrinsic Na spread. In addition, NGC 6528 does not exhibit a Mg-Al anticorrelation, and no significant spread in either Mg or Al. The
                    α
                    and iron-peak elements show good agreement with the bulge field star trend. The heavy elements are slightly dominated by the
                    r
                    -process. The chemical analysis suggests an origin and evolution similar to that of typical old Galactic bulge field stars. Finally, we find remarkable agreement in the chemical patterns of NGC 6528 and another bulge GC, NGC 6553, suggesting a similar origin and evolution.",This work is based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the southern hemisphere under ESO programme ID 093.D-0286.

The results demonstrate that ‘ease of use’ was portrayed as a beneficial construct and has a positive influence on behavioural intention and use of Web 2.0 technologies.

The planet is in a P = 4.51 d orbit with mass $0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$MJ, radius $1.595^{+0.047}_{-0.045}$RJ, and density $0.226^{+0.040}_{-0.038}$ g cm−3; therefore one of the lowest density exoplanets currently known. With a relatively deep $1.0{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ transit around a bright V = 10.96 host star, NGTS-2b is a prime target for probing giant planet composition via atmospheric transmission spectroscopy. The rapid rotation ($v$ sin i = 15.2 ± 0.8 km s−1) also makes this system an excellent candidate for Rossiter–McLaughlin follow-up observations, to measure the sky-projected stellar obliquity. NGTS-2b was confirmed without the need for follow-up photometry, due to the high precision of the NGTS photometry.","This publication is based on data collected under the NGTS project at the ESO La Silla Paranal Observatory.

203,pub.1107894506,10.1002/hyp.13318,,,Assessing multidecadal runoff (1970–2010) using regional hydrological modelling under data and water scarcity conditions in Peruvian Pacific catchments,"Abstract  In a context of water scarcity in Peruvian Pacific catchments as a crucial issue for Peru, added to the paucity of data availability, we propose a methodology that provides new perspectives for freshwater availability estimation as a base reference for unimpaired conditions. Under those considerations, a regional discharge of 709 m 3 /s to the Pacific Ocean is estimated with a significant increasing trend of about 43 m 3 /s per decade over the 1970 – 2010 period.   To represent the multidecadal behaviour of freshwater runoff along the region, a regional runoff analysis is proposed based on hydrological modelling at annual and monthly time step for unimpaired conditions over the whole 1970 – 2010 period. Differential Split‐Sample Tests are used to assess the hydrological modelling robustness of the GR1A and GR2M conceptual lumped models, showing a satisfactory transposability from dry to wet years inside the thresholds defined for Nash–Sutcliffe and bias criteria. This allowed relating physical catchment characteristics with calibrated and validated model parameters, thus offering a regional perspective for dryland conditions in the study area (e.g., the anticlockwise hysteresis relationship found for seasonal precipitation–runoff relationship) as well as the impacts of climate variability and catchment characteristics.","This work was supported by the Peruvian Ministry of Education (MINEDU‐PRONABEC, scholarship).

It is first proven that two different ARSs are isometric if and only if there exists an isometry between them that fixes the identity. Such an isometry preserves the left-invariant distribution and the linear field. If the Lie group is nilpotent it is an automorphism.

202,pub.1107590593,10.1051/0004-6361/201833981,,,Planetary nebula IC 5148 and its ionized halo★,"Context.
                    Many round or roundish planetary nebulae (PNe) show multiple shells and halo structures during their evolutionary stage near the maximum temperature of their central star. Controversial debate is ongoing if these structures are recombination halos, as suggested by hydrodynamic modeling efforts, or ionized material. Recently, we discovered a halo with somewhat unusual structures around the sparsely studied PN IC 5148 and present for the first time spectroscopy going out to the halo of such a PN.
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    We investigate the spatial distribution of material and its ionization state from the center of the nebula up to the very outskirts of the halo.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    We obtained long-slit low resolution spectroscopy (FORS2 at VLT) of the nebula in two position angles, which we used to investigate the nebular structure and its halo in the optical range from 450 to 880 nm. In addition we used medium resolution spectra taken with X-shooter at VLT ranging from 320 nm to 2.4
                    μ
                    m to derive atmospheric parameters for the central star. We obtained the distance and position in the Galaxy from various methods combined with
                    Gaia
                    DR2 data. We also applied Cloudy models to the nebula in order to derive physical parameters of the various regions.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    We obtained spatially resolved structures and detailed descriptions of the outrunning shock front and a set of unusual halo structures denoted to further shock. The halo structures appears clearly as hot ionized material. Furthermore, we derived a reliable photometric value for the central star at a
                    Gaia
                    distance of
                    D
                    = 1.3 kpc. Considering the large distance
                    z
                    = 1.0 kpc from the galactic plane together to its non-circular motion in the galaxy and, a metallicity only slightly below that of typical disk PNe, most likely IC 5148 originates from a thick disk population star.","We would like to thank the referee Martin Guerrero for his helpful comments.

201,pub.1100348070,10.1002/tal.1463,,,Distribution of strong earthquake input energy in tall buildings equipped with damped outriggers,"Summary The seismic design of optimal damped outrigger structures relies on the assumption that most of the input energy will be absorbed by the dampers, whilst the rest of the structure remains elastic. When subjected to strong earthquakes, nevertheless, the building structure may exhibit plastic hinges before the dampers begin to work. In order to determine to which extent the use of viscously damped outriggers would avoid damage, both the host structure's hysteretic behaviour and the dampers' performance need to be evaluated in parallel. This article provides a parametric study on the factors that influence the distribution of seismic energy in tall buildings equipped with damped outriggers: First, the influence of outrigger's location, damping coefficients, and rigidity ratios core‐to‐outrigger and core‐to‐column in the seismic performance of a 60‐story building with conventional and with damped outriggers is studied. In parallel, nonlinear behaviour of the outrigger with and without viscous dampers is examined under small, moderate, strong, and severe long‐period earthquakes to assess the hysteretic energy distribution through the core and outriggers. The results show that, as the ground motion becomes stronger, viscous dampers effectively reduce the potential of damage in the structure if compared to conventional outriggers. However, the use of dampers cannot entirely prevent damage under critical excitations.",The authors thank the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions that helped to improve this paper.

In the resulting field equations, the torsion is closely related to the dynamics of the scalar field, i.e., if non-minimally coupled terms are present in the theory, then the torsion must be present. For the studied lagrangian we analyze the cosmological consequences of an effective torsional fluid and we show that this fluid can be responsible for the current acceleration of the universe.

However, although the recent 2015–16 EN event provides a new data point consistent with the sparse strong EN regime, it is not enough to statistically reject the null hypothesis of a unimodal distribution based on observations alone. Nevertheless, we consider the possibility suggestive enough to explore it with a simple theoretical model based on the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback. In this study, we implemented this nonlinear mechanism in the recharge-discharge (RD) ENSO model and show that it is sufficient to produce the two EN regimes, i.e. a bimodal distribution in peak surface temperature (T) during EN events. The only modification introduced to the original RD model is that the net damping is suppressed when T exceeds Tc$$T_c$$, resulting in a weak nonlinearity in the system. Due to the damping, the model is globally stable and it requires stochastic forcing to maintain the variability. The sustained low-frequency component of the stochastic forcing plays a key role for the onset of strong EN events (i.e. for T>Tc$$T>T_c$$), at least as important as the precursor positive heat content anomaly (h). High-frequency forcing helps some EN events to exceed Tc$$T_c$$, increasing the number of strong events, but the rectification effect is small and the overall number of EN events is little affected by this forcing. Using the Fokker–Planck equation, we show how the bimodal probability distribution of EN events arises from the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback and also propose that the increase in the net feedback with increasing T is a necessary condition for bimodality in the RD model. We also show that the damping strength determines both the adjustment time-scale and equilibrium value of the ensemble spread associated with the stochastic forcing.","The authors thank Drs. S.-I.

The study of the photocentre displacement allows us to constrain a large number of stellar parameters – equatorial radius Req, equatorial velocity Veq, inclination i, rotation-axis position angle PArot and flattening – with an estimation of gravity-darkening coefficient β using previously published theoretical results. We use the Simulation Code of Interferometric-observations for ROtators and CirCumstellar Objects (scirocco), a semi-analytical algorithm dedicated to fast rotators. We chose Regulus because it is a very well-known edge-on star, for which an alternative approach is needed to check the previously published results. Our analysis showed that a significant degeneracy of solution is present. By confronting the results obtained by differential interferometry with those obtained by conventional long-base interferometry, we obtain similar results (within the uncertainties), thereby validating our approach, where Veq and i are found separately. From the photocentre displacement, we can independently deduce PArot. We use two minimization methods to restrict observed stellar parameters via a fast rotator model: a non-stochastic method (χ2 fit) and a stochastic one (Markov Chain Monte Carlo method), in order to check whether the correct global minimum is achieved, particularly with respect to the degeneracies of the gravity-darkening parameter β, where we demonstrate, using a quantitative analysis of parameters, that estimation of β is easier for stars with an inclination angle of around 45°.","This article was based on observations performed at the European Southern Observatory, Chile under ESO AMBER Visitor mode program IDs 092.D-0342.

193,pub.1100961258,10.1111/raq.12234,,,From an open‐access fishery to a regulated aquaculture business: the case of the most important Latin American bay scallop (Argopecten purpuratus),"Abstract  The South Pacific bay scallop Argopecten purpuratus represents a high‐value species harvested along the Peruvian and Chilean coastline for more than 60 years. Following the strong El Niño event of 1983/84, both countries experienced a boom in scallop fisheries, but catches dropped as soon as environmental conditions normalized. Aquaculture production began in Chile, which dominated the Latin American scallop market in the 1990s. Peruvian production remained small until the early 2000s, but has increased dramatically ever since, with a single location in northern Peru, Sechura Bay, contributing most (50%) to the Latin American scallop production. We review the historical trends of this species’ production and analyse the ecological and socio‐economic factors that have favoured Sechura Bay's progress, and largely displaced Chilean production through dominance of the market. Advantageous environmental conditions in Sechura Bay (e.g. low water depths, higher temperatures, high natural seed supply) result in improved scallop growth and production, and the socio‐economic factors, causing lower operational costs than those of the Chilean production favoured this development. The bottom‐up initiation of aquaculture operations by small‐scale producers likely created a personal incentive for the long‐term sustainable use, which differs from the more industrialized aquaculture activities in Chile.","This paper was prepared as part of the bilateral SASCA project (‘Sustainability Analysis of Scallop Culture in Sechura Bay (Peru)’), financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, SASCA 01DN12131, MOSETIP 01LC1725A).

193,pub.1107969767,10.1051/0004-6361/201833328,,,"The dependence of mass and environment on the secular processes of AGNs in terms of morphology, colour, and specific star-formation rate","Context
                    . Galaxy mass and environment play a major role in the evolution of galaxies. In the transition from star-forming to quenched galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGNs) also have a principal action therein. However, the connections between these three actors are still uncertain.
                  
                  
                    Aims
                    . In this work we investigate the effects of stellar mass and the large-scale structure (LSS) environment on the fraction of optical nuclear activity in a population of isolated galaxies, where AGN would not be triggered by recent galaxy interactions or mergers.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    . As a continuation of a previous work, we focus on isolated galaxies to study the effect of stellar mass and the LSS in terms of morphology (early- and late-type), colour (red and blue), and specific star-formation rate (quenched and star-forming). To explore where AGN activity is affected by the LSS, we separate galaxies into two groups, of low- and high mass, respectively, and use the tidal strength parameter to quantify the effects.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    . We found that AGN is strongly affected by stellar mass in “active” galaxies (namely late-type, blue, and star-forming), but that mass has no influence on “quiescent” galaxies (namely early-type, red, and quenched), at least for masses down to 10
                    10
                     
                    M
                    ⊙
                    . In relation to the LSS, we found an increase in the fraction of star-forming nuclei galaxies with denser LSS in low-mass star-forming and red isolated galaxies. Regarding AGN, we find a clear increase in the fraction of AGNs with denser environment in quenched and red isolated galaxies, independently of the stellar mass.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions
                    . Active galactic nuclei activity appears to be “mass triggered” in active isolated galaxies. This means that AGN activity is independent of the intrinsic properties of the galaxies, but is dependent on their stellar mass. On the other hand, AGN activity appears to be “environment triggered” in quiescent isolated galaxies, where the fraction of AGNs as a function of specific star formation rate and colour increases from void regions to denser LSS, independently of stellar mass.","The authors acknowledge the anonymous referee for his/her report, which helped to clarify and improve the quality of this work.

However, the reality tells us the atmospheric water cannot help to slake the world's thirst. Thus an important question occurs: what are the fundamental limits of atmospheric water harvesting that can be achieved in typical arid and semi-arid areas? Here, through a thorough review on the present advances of atmospheric water-harvesting technologies, we identify the achievements that have been acquired and evaluate the challenges and barriers that retard their applications. Lastly, we clarify our perspectives on how to search for a simple, scalable, yet cost-effective way to produce atmospheric water for the community and forecast the application of atmospheric water harvesting in evaporative cooling, such as electronic cooling, power plant cooling, and passive building cooling.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Quanwen Pan and Dr. Zhengyuan Xu for discussions and Mr. Audun Bull Kristiansen, Mr. Biye Cao, and Ms. Linji Hua for manuscript modification.

184,pub.1106017447,10.1007/s10533-018-0477-3,,,"Molecular biomarkers in the subsurface of the Salar Grande (Atacama, Chile) evaporitic deposits","The Late Miocene–Pliocene aged hyperarid evaporitic system of Salar Grande is a unique, halite-rich sedimentary basin in the Cordillera de la Costa of the Central Andes (Chile) whose bio-sedimentary record is poorly understood. The persistence of hyperacidity over millions of years, the hypersalinity, and the intense UV radiation make it a terrestrial analogue to assess the potential presence of organic matter in the halite deposits found on Mars. We investigated the occurrence and distribution of biomolecules along a 100-m depth drill down to the ~ 9 Ma old detrital deposits topped by La Soledad Formation (ESF). We have identified two well-defined mineralogical and geochemical units by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and ion chromatography: a nearly pure halite down to 40 m, and a detrital one down to 100 m depth. One-dimensional GC–MS and two-dimensional GC × GC-TOF–MS gas chromatography–mass spectrometry techniques allowed us to detect a variety of lipidic compounds (n-alkanes, n-alkanols, isoprenoids, steroids, and hopanoids), and a relative abundance of functionalized hydrocarbons (n-fatty acids or n-aldehydes), mostly in the upper halite. We also detected biopolymers and microbial markers by fluorescence sandwich-microarray immunoassays. A dominant prokaryotic origin was associated with halophile bacteria and archaea, with minor contributions of lichens, macrophytes, or higher plants. The lipidic record was also imprinted by oxic (high pristane over phytane ratios) and saline (squalane, and mono-methyl n-alkanes) signatures. The vertical abundance and distribution of biomarkers in the Salar Grande was explained by a generalized effect of xeropreservation, combined with salt encapsulation in the upper halite deposits, or with protective organics-mineral interactions in the deeper detrital unit. The results contribute to the interpretation of terrestrial bio-sedimentary records of halite deposits and their association to environmental conditions. The high potential for preservation of biosignatures at Salar Grande suggests that similar evaporitic deposits in Mars should be priority targets for searching for signs of life.","We thank Maria Teresa Fernández-Sampedro for technical assistance in XRD.

This brand of institutional language politics has been characterised by several contestations and permutations which can symbolically be described as a struggle for the soul of the UFS because of its far-reaching implications on UFS’s “curriculum as institution” and linguistic culture. Four critical junctures have defined UFS’s language politics over the last century. After a detailed characterisation of these critical junctures, the article argues and demonstrates that the contestations and permutations that have characterised institutional language politics at the UFS are a  microcosm of the socio-political and economic struggles in the Free State Province through time, because of the centrality of the UFS in socio-political and economic discourses and dynamics of the province.",,,Southern Journal for Contemporary History,,,,2018,2018,2018,2018,43,1,215-241,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mwaniki, Munene","Mwaniki, Munene (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa)",,"Mwaniki, Munene (University of the Witwatersrand)",1,1,,0.6,http://journals.ufs.ac.za/index.php/jch/article/download/3527/3356,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105580052,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",4 Quality Education
184,pub.1106387142,10.1029/2018gc007703,,,Watching Dehydration: Seismic Indication for Transient Fluid Pathways in the Oceanic Mantle of the Subducting Nazca Slab,"Abstract  Intermediate depth seismicity in subduction zones often occurs in the form of two slab‐parallel bands. We estimated the seismic P to S wave velocity ratio within the shallowest part of the lower seismicity zone (LSZ) in the mantle of the subducting slab of the Central Andean subduction system at 50‐km depth, 30 km below the Moho, using local earthquake data. We find an exceptionally high V  P  / V  S  value larger than ∼2.0 that cannot be explained by a realistic solid lithology but requires the presence of fluid‐filled porosity. This implies that the incoming Nazca plate must be partially hydrated to this depth below the seafloor. We introduce a state‐of‐the‐art petrophysical model that takes into account the thermodynamic and poroelastic effects of dynamic metamorphic mineral dehydration at 1.8 GPa and consider anisotropic effects. The model shows that a high V  P  / V  S  value generally indicates that the medium is near the percolation threshold, that is, that porosity must be interconnected. This result is consistent with observations from outcrops of paleosubduction zones, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations. It follows that the shallowest part of the LSZ of the Central Andes must reside at a temperature at which mineral dehydration reactions take place, here between 430 and 500 ° C. For the first time, we can confirm that the observations of transient dehydrating fluid‐filled vein structures with a pore volume in the order of only 10 −3 are reasonable for the LSZ and enough to allow for effective drainage. 
Plain Language Summary Beneath the Central Andes, small earthquakes occur along a band 30 km within the subducting Nazca tectonic plate that slowly sinks below the South American plate. Such earthquake bands occur worldwide, and it has been proposed that they happen, because there is water bound in the solid rocks there, which would be released when the subducting plate heats up while it sinks into the Earth. We test this hypothesis by determining a rock property that can indicate whether liquid water is present from the arrival times of earthquake waves. We then theoretically calculate how this property would be for different kinds of rock that can be present at this specific location within the Earth. It results that the rock property that we derived in the earthquake band can best be explained by the presence of liquid water that is stored in thin interconnected veins there. Other researchers saw in laboratory experiments, in computer simulations, and in the field that rocks that release water look exactly like this, so that their and our pieces of the puzzle fit together well. With this knowledge, we can understand better how water sinks into the Earth and how it finds its way back to the surface.

This work aims to identify and discuss prevalent paradigms used to teach BPS. Through a comprehensive and critical literature review, three paradigms are found: training the simulation ‘expert’ and training the architecture student to become either a ‘consumer’ or ‘performer’ of simulations. Examples from the literature are presented to illustrate each paradigm, followed by a discussion of where trainees of each paradigm would be situated in practical project environments. Recognizing these paradigms serves as a foundation to set up future teaching initiatives and research in this area.

The available photometric data can be fitted with a double-peaked light curve with a period of 904 days. Color variations are consistent with variable extinction with a flatter wavelength dependence than interstellar extinction, i.e., larger grains. MHO 3252 Y3 is the source of a large-scale bipolar outflow, but the most recent outflow activity has produced a microjet detectable in the shock-excited H2 1–0 S(1) line, while [Fe ii] emission appears confined to the immediate vicinity of the central star. The proper motion of individual shock fronts in the H2 microjet has been measured and traces these knots back to ejection events in the past two centuries. Integral field spectroscopy with the Keck 1 adaptive optics system and the OSIRIS instrument shows velocity components near the launch region that are distinct from the microjet in both radial velocity and apparent proper motion. They match the prediction of dual wind models with a distinct low-velocity disk wind component. We find evidence for the entrainment of this low-velocity component into the high-velocity microjet, leading to shock-excited emission at intermediate velocities in an envelope around the microjet.","Most photometric data on MHO 3252 Y3 were obtained at the IRIS telescope of the Universitätssternwarte Bochum on Cerro Armazones, which is operated under a cooperative agreement between the “Astronomisches Institut, Ruhr Universität Bochum,” Germany, and the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, USA.

The formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies in low-density environments are less understood than classical elliptical galaxies in high-density environments. Isolated galaxies are defined as galaxies without massive neighbors within scales of galaxy groups. The effect of the environment at several Mpc scales on their properties has been barely explored. We study the role of the large-scale environment in 573 isolated elliptical galaxies out to z = 0.08.   Aims . We aim to explore whether the large-scale environment affects some of the physical properties of the isolated galaxies studied in this work.   Methods . We used three environmental estimators of the large-scale structure within a projected radius of 5 Mpc around isolated galaxies: the tidal strength parameter, projected density η k,LSS , and distance to the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy. We studied isolated galaxies regarding stellar mass, integrated optical g − i color, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and emission lines.   Results . We find 80% of galaxies at lower densities correspond to “red and dead” elliptical galaxies. Blue and red galaxies do not tend to be located in different environments according to η k,LSS . Almost all the isolated ellipticals in the densest large-scale environments are red or quenched, of which a third are low-mass galaxies. The percentage of isolated elliptical galaxies located in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) region of the BPT diagram is 64%. We identified 33 blue, star-forming (SF) isolated ellipticals using both color and sSFR. Half of these are SF nuclei in the BPT diagram, which amounts to 5% of the galaxies in this diagram.   Conclusions . The large-scale environment does not play the primary role in determining the color or sSFR of isolated elliptical galaxies. The large-scale environment seems to be negligible from a stellar mass scale around 10 10.6 M ⊙ , probably because of the dominant presence of AGN at higher masses. For lower masses, the processes of cooling and infall of gas from large scales are very inefficient in ellipticals. Active galactic nuclei might also be an essential ingredient to keep most of the low-mass isolated elliptical galaxies quenched.","We thank the anonymous referee for the constructive revision of our paper.

Quantum Grav. 33 125036) by including self-interaction potentials beyond the exponential one. It will be shown that, consistently with the results of De Arcia et al (2016 Class. Quantum Grav. 33 125036), the cubic self-interaction of the galileon vacuum appreciably modifies the late-time cosmic dynamics by the existence of a phantom-like attractor (among other super-accelerated solutions that do not modify in any appreciable way the late-time dynamics and hence are not of interest in the present investigation). In contrast, in the presence of background matter the late-time cosmic dynamics remains practically the same as in the standard quintessence scenario. This means that we can not recover the cubic galileon vacuum continuously from the more general cubic quintessence with background matter, by setting to zero the matter energy density (and the pressure). This happens to be a kind of cosmological vDVZ discontinuity that can be evaded by means of the cosmological version of the Vainshtein screening mechanism.","RDA, TG, UN and IQ want to thank SNI-CONACyT and IAC of México for continuous support of their research activity, meanwhile GL thanks Departamento de Matematicas and to Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico at Universidad Catolica del Norte for financial support.

169,pub.1109959019,10.1093/mnras/sty3101,,,SDSS-IV MaNGA: signatures of halo assembly in kinematically misaligned galaxies,"We investigate the relationship of kinematically misaligned galaxies with their large-scale environment, in the context of halo assembly bias. According to numerical simulations, halo age at fixed halo mass is intrinsically linked to the large-scale tidal environment created by the cosmic web. We investigate the relationship between distances to various cosmic web features and present-time gas accretion rate. We select a sub-sample of ∼900 central galaxies from the MaNGA survey with defined global position angles (PA; angle at which velocity change is greatest) for their stellar and H α gas components up to a minimum of 1.5 effective radii (Re). We split the sample by misalignment between the gas and stars as defined by the difference in their PA. For each central galaxy, we find its distance to nodes and filaments within the cosmic web, and estimate the host halo’s age using the central stellar mass to total halo mass ratio M*/Mh. We also construct halo occupation distributions using a background subtraction technique for galaxy groups split using the central galaxy’s kinematic misalignment. We find, at fixed halo mass, no statistical difference in these properties between our kinematically aligned and misaligned galaxies. We suggest that the lack of correlation could be indicative of cooling flows from the hot halo playing a far larger role than ‘cold mode’ accretion from the cosmic web or a demonstration that the spatial extent of current large-scale integral field unit surveys hold little information about large-scale environment extractable through this method.","CD acknowledges support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) via an PhD studentship (grant number ST/N504427/1).

In this first paper of a series resulting from these observations, we give an overview of target cluster selection, observations, and data reduction procedures for optimizing the resulting photometric catalogs. Artificial star tests are used to compare the respective advantages of different data reduction strategies in terms of photometric and astrometric precision and photometric incompleteness.

The observed DIB spectra are sharpened using a spectral deconvolution algorithm. This reveals finer spectral features that provide tighter constraints on candidate carriers. We analyze a deconvolved λ6614 DIB spectrum and derive spectroscopic constants that are then used to model the λ6196 spectra. The common-carrier spectroscopic constants enable quantitative fits to the contrasting λ6196 and λ6614 spectra from two sightlines. Highlights of our analysis include (1) sharp cutoffs for the maximum values of the rotational quantum numbers, Jmax = Kmax, (2) the λ6614 DIB consisting of a doublet and a red-tail component arising from different carriers, (3) the λ6614 doublet and λ6196 DIBs sharing a common carrier, (4) the contrasting shapes of the λ6614 doublet and λ6196 DIBs arising from different vibration–rotation Coriolis coupling constants that originate from transitions from a common ground state to different upper electronic state degenerate vibrational levels, and (5) the different widths of the two DIBs arising from different effective rotational temperatures associated with principal rotational axes that are parallel and perpendicular to the highest-order symmetry axis. The analysis results suggest a puckered oblate symmetric top carrier with a dipole moment aligned with the highest-order symmetry axis. An example candidate carrier consistent with these specifications is corannulene (C20H10), or one of its symmetric ionic or dehydrogenated forms, whose rotational constants are comparable to those obtained from spectral modeling of the DIB profiles.",,,The Astrophysical Journal,,,,2018-06-01,2018,2018-06-05,2018-06-01,859,2,174,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Bernstein, L.

162,pub.1101567347,10.1051/0004-6361/201732483,,,Kepler Object of Interest Network★,"During its four years of photometric observations, the
                    Kepler
                    space telescope detected thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates. One of
                    Kepler
                    ’s greatest heritages has been the confirmation and characterization of hundreds of multi-planet systems via transit timing variations (TTVs). However, there are many interesting candidate systems displaying TTVs on such long timescales that the existing
                    Kepler
                    observations are of insufficient length to confirm and characterize them by means of this technique. To continue with
                    Kepler
                    ’s unique work, we have organized the “
                    Kepler
                    Object of Interest Network” (KOINet), a multi-site network formed of several telescopes located throughout America, Europe, and Asia. The goals of KOINet are to complete the TTV curves of systems where
                    Kepler
                    did not cover the interaction timescales well, to dynamically prove that some candidates are true planets (or not), to dynamically measure the masses and bulk densities of some planets, to find evidence for non-transiting planets in some of the systems, to extend
                    Kepler
                    ’s baseline adding new data with the main purpose of improving current models of TTVs, and to build a platform that can observe almost anywhere on the northern hemisphere, at almost any time. KOINet has been operational since March 2014. Here we show some promising first results obtained from analyzing seven primary transits of KOI-0410.01, KOI-0525.01, KOI-0760.01, and KOI-0902.01, in addition to the
                    Kepler
                    data acquired during the first and second observing seasons of KOINet. While carefully choosing the targets we set demanding constraints on timing precision (at least 1 min) and photometric precision (as good as one part per thousand) that were achieved by means of our observing strategies and data analysis techniques. For KOI-0410.01, new transit data revealed a turnover of its TTVs. We carried out an in-depth study of the system, which is identified in the NASA Data Validation Report as a false positive. Among others, we investigated a gravitationally bound hierarchical triple star system and a planet–star system. While the simultaneous transit fitting of ground- andspace-based data allowed for a planet solution, we could not fully reject the three-star scenario. New data, already scheduled in the upcoming 2018 observing season, will set tighter constraints on the nature of the system.","Funding for the Stellar Astrophysics Centre is provided by The Danish National Research Foundation (Grant DNRF106).

Comparing continuous and discrete spatial heterogeneity,"Using subjective well-being estimations, this study analyzes whether compensating variations vary across space using a cross-sectional data set from Chile. To achieve this goal, it describes and compares two econometric ways of modelling unobserved spatial heterogeneity. Both approaches allow compensating variations to vary across spatial units by assuming some distribution a priori. One method assumes that the spatial heterogeneity can be represented by a discrete distribution (a group of regions that share the same coefficient) and the other that the preferences can be represented by a continuous distribution (each region has a different coefficient). The results show that focusing just on the average estimates of compensating variations, as the applied studies have done so far, masks useful local variation. More empirical studies are needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both econometric approaches and how their results compare across a wide range of conditions and samples.",The author is obliged to five anonymous referees; the editor for helpful comments; and Victor Iturra for enlightening conversations.,The author thanks the FONDECYT – Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico [grant number 11160104] for full financial support.,Spatial Economic Analysis,,,,2018-07-20,2018,2018-07-20,2019-01-02,14,1,53-87,All OA; Green,Article,"Sarrias, Mauricio","Sarrias, Mauricio (Department of Economics, IDEAR, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Sarrias, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North)","Sarrias, Mauricio (Catholic University of the North)",14,1,,5.51,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Do_monetary_subjective_well-being_evaluations_vary_across_space_Comparing_continuous_and_discrete_spatial_heterogeneity/6844862/1/files/12461783.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105735130,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,
161,pub.1105251754,10.1111/bre.12305,,,"The synrift phase of the early Domeyko Basin (Triassic, northern Chile): Sedimentary, volcanic, and tectonic interplay in the evolution of an ancient subduction‐related rift basin","Abstract  The geodynamic setting along the SW Gondwana margin during its early breakup (Triassic) remains poorly understood. Recent models calling for an uninterrupted subduction since Late Palaeozoic only slightly consider the geotectonic significance of coeval basins. The Domeyko Basin initiated as a rift basin during the Triassic being filled by sedimentary and volcanic deposits. Stratigraphic, sedimentological, and geochronological analyses are presented in order to determine the tectonostratigraphic evolution of this basin and to propose a tectonic model suitable for other SW Gondwana‐margin rift basins. The Domeyko Basin recorded two synrift stages. The Synrift I (~240–225 Ma) initiated the Sierra Exploradora sub‐basin, whereas the Synrift II (~217–200 Ma) reactivated this sub‐basin and originated small depocentres grouped in the Sierra de Varas sub‐basin. During the rift evolution, the sedimentary systems developed were largely controlled by the interplay between tectonics and volcanism through the accommodation/sediment supply ratio (A/S). High‐volcaniclastic depocentres record a net dominance of the syn‐eruptive period lacking rift‐climax sequences, whereas low‐volcaniclastic depocentres of the Sierra de Varas sub‐basin developed a complete rift cycle during the Synrift II stage. The architecture of the Domeyko Basin suggests a transtensional kinematic where N‐S master faults interacted with ~ NW ‐ SE basement structures producing highly asymmetric releasing bends. We suggest that the early Domeyko Basin was a continental subduction‐related rift basin likely developed under an oblique convergence in a back‐arc setting. Subduction would have acted as a primary driving mechanism for the extension along the Gondwanan margin, unlike inland rift basins. Slab‐induced dynamic can strongly influence the tectonostratigraphic evolution of subduction‐related rift basins through controls in the localization and style of magmatism and faulting, settling the interplay between tectonics, volcanism, and sedimentation during the rifting.","This research was funded through the Plan Nacional de Geología of the Chilean Geological and Mining Survey (Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería) (DM, PV, CC, RG, JC), the Fondecyt grant 1120715 (VO) and the doctoral fellowship 21140774 (ME).

                    line. In addition we obtained a single contemporary spectrum with the spectrograph FAST at Mt. Hopkins. Compared to earlier epochs 3C 120 is about a factor of three brighter, allowing us to study the shape of the broad line region (BLR) and the dust torus in a high luminosity phase. The analysis of the light curves yields that the dust echo is rather sharp and symmetric in contrast to the more complex broad H
                    α
                    BLR echo. We investigated how far this supports an optically thick bowl-shaped BLR and dust torus geometry. The comparison with several parameterizations of these models supports the following geometry: The BLR clouds lie inside the bowl closely above the bowl rim up to a halfcovering angle 0° <
                    θ
                     <  40° (measured against the equatorial plane). Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces, yielding a smeared and structured echo as observed. Furthermore, if the BLR clouds shield the bottom of the bowl rim against radiation from the nucleus, the hot dust emission comes essentially from the top edge of the bowl (40° <
                    θ
                     <  45°). Then, for small inclinations as for 3C120, the top dust edge forms a ring that largely coincides with a narrow range of isodelay surfaces, yielding the observed sharp dust echo. The scale height of the BLR increases with radial distance from the black hole (BH). This leads to luminosity dependent foreshortening effects of the lag. We discuss the implications and possible corrections of the foreshortening for the BH mass determination and consequences for the lag (size)–luminosity relationships and the difference from interferometric torus sizes.","We are grateful to Emilio E.

The underlying Gaia-based, volume-complete parent sample consists of 1633 sources, dominated by Population I. The design of the survey is such that around 130 sources are expected to be members of Population II (τ ≥ 12 Gyr) and the intermediate disc (τ ≃ 10 Gyr). Upon completion of the search and the analyses, this sample of ancient solar-type stars will represent an increase by a factor of 4 compared to our former 25 pc survey (N = 31) and will serve as an unbiased reference to address most relevant questions on the star formation, the stellar multiplicities, and the chemical enrichment in the early Milky Way. With the first major set of analyses presented in this work, we in effect double the number of ancient disc stars now at hand (N = 60). We discuss a number of aspects on known or new companion candidates, on barium enrichment and blue straggler stars, and on a magnesium-rich and massive Population II, and we present further evidence for substructure among the local Population II stars, as formerly suspected with the 25 pc survey. In an appendix, we describe a priori survey candidates, whose analyses dismiss them as Population I stars.","This study was based on observations with the MPG 2.2 m telescope at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programme 099.A-9022(A) and data obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility.

139,pub.1105374443,10.1051/0004-6361/201629454,,,Characterization of low-mass companion HD 142527 B⋆,"Context . The circumstellar disk of the Herbig Fe star HD 142527 is host to several remarkable features including a warped inner disk, a 120 au-wide annular gap, a prominent dust trap and several spiral arms. A low-mass companion, HD 142527 B, was also found orbiting the primary star at ~14 au.   Aims . This study aims to better characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the peculiar geometry of the disk.   Method . We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in H + K band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several algorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI).   Results . HD 142527 B is conspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to extract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within 0.″1 from its central star. Fitting our spectrum with both template and synthetic spectra suggests that the companion is a young M2.5 ± 1.0 star with an effective temperature of 3500 ± 100 K, possibly surrounded with a hot (1700 K) circum-secondary environment. Pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks provide a mass estimate of 0.34 ± 0.06 M ⊙ , independent of the presence of a hot environment. However, the estimated stellar radius and age do depend on that assumption; we find a radius of 1.37 ± 0.05 R ⊙ (resp. 1.96 ± 0.10 R ⊙ ) and an age of 1.8 -0.5 +1.2 Myr (resp. 0.75 ± 0.25 Myr) in the case of the presence (resp. absence) of a hot environment contributing in H + K . Our new values for the mass and radius of the companion yield a mass accretion rate of 4.1–5.8 × 10 −9 M ⊙ yr −1 (2–3% that of the primary).   Conclusions . We have constrained the physical properties of HD 142527 B, thereby illustrating the potential for SINFONI+ADI to characterize faint close-in companions. The new spectral type makes HD 142527 B a twin of the well-known TW Hya T Tauri star, and the revision of its mass to higher values further supports its role in shaping the disk.","We acknowledge the anonymous referee for his/her constructive comments.

                    The spatial structure of the emission lines and continuum over the 50″ extent of the nearby, O-rich, PN NGC 7009 (Saturn Nebula) have been observed with the MUSE integral field spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope. This study concentrates on maps of line emission and their interpretation in terms of physical conditions.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    MUSE Science Verification data, in <0.6″ seeing, have been reduced and analysed as maps of emission lines and continuum over the wavelength range 4750–9350 Å. The dust extinction, the electron densities and temperatures of various phases of the ionized gas, abundances of species from low to high ionization and some total abundances are determined using standard techniques.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    Emission line maps over the bright shells are presented, from neutral to the highest ionization available (He 
                    II
                    and [Mn 
                    V
                    ]). For collisionally excited lines (CELs), maps of electron temperature (
                    T
                    
                      e
                    
                    from [N 
                    II
                    ] and [S 
                    III
                    ]) and density (
                    N
                    
                      e
                    
                    from [S 
                    II
                    ] and [Cl 
                    III
                    ]) are available and for optical recombination lines (ORLs) temperature (from the Paschen jump and ratio of He 
                    I
                    lines) and density (from high Paschen lines). These estimates are compared: for the first time, maps of the differences in CEL and ORL

                    ’s have been derived, and correspondingly a map of

                    2
                    between a CEL and ORL temperature, showing considerable detail. Total abundances of only He and O were formed, the latter using three ionization correction factors. However, the map of He/H is not flat, departing by ~2% from a constant value, with remnants corresponding to ionization structures. An integrated spectrum over an area of 2340 arcsec
                    2
                    was also formed and compared to 1D photoionization models.
                  
                  
                    Conclusions.
                    The spatial variation of a range of nebular parameters illustrates the complexity of the ionized media in NGC 7009. These MUSE data are very rich with detections of hundreds of lines over areas of hundreds of arcsec
                    2
                    and follow-on studies are outlined.","We sincerely thank the whole MUSE Science Verification team for achieving such a high level of data quality during this phase of the instrument testing.

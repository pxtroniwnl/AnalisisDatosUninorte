It is therefore important that this theme is taken into account as part of universities´ teaching and research programs.MethodsA three-tiered approach was used, consisting of a bibliometric analysis, an online survey and a set of case studies, which allow a profile to be built, as to how a sample of universities from 45 countries handle climate change as part of their teaching programs.ResultsThis paper reports on a study which aimed at identifying the extent to which matters related to climate change are addressed within the teaching and research practices at universities, with a focus on the training needs of teaching staff. It consists of a bibliometric analysis, combined with an online worldwide survey aimed at ascertaining the degree of involvement from universities in reducing their own carbon footprint, and the ways they offer training provisions on the topic. This is complemented by a set of 12 case studies from universities round the world, illustrating current trends on how universities handle climate change. Apart from reporting on the outcomes of the study, the paper highlights what some universities are doing to handle climate issues, and discusses the implications of the research.ConclusionsThe paper lists some items via which universities may better educate and train their students on how to handle the many challenges posed by climate change.",Not applicable.,There is no external funding received for the research included in the manuscript.,Environmental Sciences Europe,,,,2021-09-25,2021,2021-09-25,2021-12,33,1,109,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal Filho, Walter; Sima, Mihaela; Sharifi, Ayyoob; Luetz, Johannes M.; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Mifsud, Mark; Olooto, Felicia Motunrayo; Djekic, Ilija; Anholon, Rosley; Rampasso, Izabela; Kwabena Donkor, Felix; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta; Klavins, Maris; Finnveden, Göran; Chari, Martin Munashe; Molthan-Hill, Petra; Mifsud, Alexandra; Sen, Salil K.; Lokupitiya, Erandathie","Leal Filho, Walter (School of Science and the Environment, Manchester Metropolitan University, Chester Street, M1 5GD, Manchester, UK; Research and Transfer Centre “Sustainable Development and Climate Change Management”, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany); Sima, Mihaela (Romanian Academy, Institute of Geography, 12 Dimitrie Racovita St, Sector 2, 023993, Bucharest, Romania); Sharifi, Ayyoob (Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and Network for Education and Research on Peace and Sustainability, Hiroshima University, 739-8530, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan); Luetz, Johannes M.

The COVID-19 pandemic has marked everything. We have lived through unimaginable experiences. Scenarios of confinement and social distance have required incorporating technologies as an essential means of continuing professional, educational and social activities. On a social level, the advance in the digital competencies of the population has increased exponentially. However, this need to use technology does not mean that, in general, institutions and individuals were prepared to face digital processes, which reveals deficits in their digital transformation strategies. This has been very evident in the universities, which, although thanks to technologies they have been able to fulfil their missions, especially in teaching, the maturity of their digital transformation processes has been compromised. In terms of the journal Education in the Knowledge Society (EKS), as for the rest of the scientific publications, in 2020 the review processes have been a little longer, but they have been fulfilled, and volume 21 has had 30 contributions of proven quality.

The paper aims to investigate the factors that impact communication and collaboration in a distance learning environment in and outside of the virtual classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of social media in this process. The online survey was used to collect the data and test the research hypotheses. In total, 234 students’ answers were analyzed. The study findings indicate that the increasing use of Facebook (FB) for professional purposes improves students’ communication and collaboration during distance learning courses. High activity on FB and LinkedIn (LKND) is important for communication with educators. In line with engagement theory, active participation in distance classes and high assessment of the online tools used positively influence the processes of communicating and collaborating among students. The study contributes to the distance learning literature as it adds to our understanding of distance learning in the midst of a pandemic through the lenses of engagement theory. It also has practical implications for all active participants in the educational process.",,The authors received no direct funding for this research.,Cogent Arts and Humanities,,Haina Jin,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-07-14,2021-01-01,8,1,1953228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zarzycka, Ewelina; Krasodomska, Joanna; Mazurczak-Mąka, Anna; Turek-Radwan, Monika","Zarzycka, Ewelina (Department of Accounting, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland); Krasodomska, Joanna (Cracow University of Economics, Krakow, Poland); Mazurczak-Mąka, Anna (Cracow University of Economics, Krakow, Poland); Turek-Radwan, Monika (Cracow University of Economics, Krakow, Poland)","Zarzycka, Ewelina (University of Łódź)","Zarzycka, Ewelina (University of Łódź); Krasodomska, Joanna (Kraków University of Economics); Mazurczak-Mąka, Anna (Kraków University of Economics); Turek-Radwan, Monika (Kraków University of Economics)",50,36,,68.7,https://doi.org/10.1080/23311983.2021.1953228,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139706140,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media,

Therefore, having access to an automatic, reliable system that is able to detect the presence of melanoma via a dermatoscopic image of lesions and/or skin pigmentation can be a very useful tool in the area of medical diagnosis.
MethodsAmong state-of-the-art methods used for automated or computer assisted medical diagnosis, attention should be drawn to Deep Learning based on Convolutional Neural Networks, wherewith segmentation, classification and detection systems for several diseases have been implemented. The method proposed in this paper involves an initial stage that automatically crops the region of interest within a dermatoscopic image using the Mask and Region-based Convolutional Neural Network technique, and a second stage based on a ResNet152 structure, which classifies lesions as either “benign” or “malignant”.ResultsTraining, validation and testing of the proposed model was carried out using the database associated to the challenge set out at the 2017 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging. On the test data set, the proposed model achieves an increase in accuracy and balanced accuracy of 3.66% and 9.96%, respectively, with respect to the best accuracy and the best sensitivity/specificity ratio reported to date for melanoma detection in this challenge. Additionally, unlike previous models, the specificity and sensitivity achieve a high score (greater than 0.8) simultaneously, which indicates that the model is good for accurate discrimination between benign and malignant lesion, not biased towards any of those classes.ConclusionsThe results achieved with the proposed model suggest a significant improvement over the results obtained in the state of the art as far as performance of skin lesion classifiers (malignant/benign) is concerned.",Not applicable.,FundingNot applicable.

With the current global COVID-19 pandemics, the usual health care service has been significantly altered in many aspects. Given the fragile health system and high number of immunocompromised populations in lower and lower-middle income countries, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are anticipated to be worse. In such scenarios, technological solutions like, Telemedicine which is defined as the delivery of healthcare service remotely using telecommunication technologies for exchange of medical information, diagnosis, consultation and treatment is critical. The aim of this study was to assess healthcare providers' acceptance and preferred modality of telemedicine and factors thereof among health professionals working in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A multi-centric online survey was conducted via social media platforms such as telegram channels, Facebook groups/pages and email during Jul 1- Sep 21, 2020. The questionnaire was adopted from previously validated model in low income setting. Internal consistency of items was assessed using Cronbach alpha (α), composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) to evaluate both discriminant and convergent validity of constructs. The extent of relationship among variables were evaluated by Structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS Amos version 23.
RESULTS: From the expected 423 responses, 319 (75.4%) participants responded to the survey questionnaire during the data collection period. The majority of participants were male (78.1%), age <30 (76.8%) and had less than five years of work experience (78.1%). The structural model result confirmed the hypothesis ""self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on effort expectancy"" with a standardized coefficient estimate (β) of 0.76 and p-value <0.001. The result also indicated that self-efficacy, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence have a significant direct effect on user's attitude toward using telemedicine. User's behavioral intention to use telemedicine was also influenced by effort expectancy and attitude. The model also ruled out that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence does not directly influence user's intention to use telemedicine. The squared multiple correlations (r2) value indicated that 57.1% of the variance in attitude toward using telemedicine and 63.6% of the variance in behavioral intention to use telemedicine is explained by the current structural model.
CONCLUSION: This study found that effort expectancy and attitude were significantly predictors of healthcare professionals' acceptance of telemedicine. Attitude toward using telemedicine systems was also highly influenced by performance expectancy, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions. effort expectancy and attitude were also significant mediators in predicting users' acceptance of telemedicine. In addition, mHealth approach was the most preferred modality of telemedicine and this opens an opportunity to integrate telemedicine systems in the health system during and post pandemic health services in low-income countries.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.

The different garments and ornaments come from the excavation of two important pre-Columbian cemeteries of the Tarapacá region: Tarapacá-40 attributed to the Formative period (1100 BC–660 AD) and Pica-8 to the Late Intermediate period (900–1450 AD). For the first time, a multi-analytical approach with non-invasive techniques using FORS and SERS was applied on samples of less than 2 cm of length for physicochemical characterization of the raw materials and the dyes employed in the textile production of northern Chile. The fibers are from animal origin. Blue, green, and yellow are identified as indigo, but we cannot discard a mixture with other dyes to vary hue and shade; while carminic acid and alizarin—to a lesser extent—are found on red, orange, and brown samples. This research provides new elements for the discussion about the textile technology developed in this desertic region, its changes, and continuities along the history. Our results are compared to recent findings on neighboring regions from South-Central Andes, to improve the current knowledge and discuss the existence of dyeing textile cultural traditions.","Analysis was performed at Laboratorio de Análisis e Investigaciones Arqueométricas (LAIA) of Universidad de Tarapacá and LANCIC Laboratory of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México during 2016.

For this purpose, an ex post facto design was employed together with an instrument composed of 30 items classified into seven dimensions: digital skills, digital ethics, digital flow, anxiety towards ICT, quality of ICT resources, intention to use ICT, and ICT integration. The sample consisted of a total of 1704 higher education teachers from all over Spain. The results showed that, overall, there were no significant differences in the level of digital competence of teaching staff between the two genders. However, significant differences were found in the following dimensions: digital skills, digital ethics, ICT anxiety, quality of ICT resources, and intention to use ICT.

A puzzling aspect of ZIKV emergence is that all human outbreaks and birth defects to date have been exclusively associated with the Asian ZIKV lineage, despite a growing body of laboratory evidence pointing towards higher transmissibility and pathogenicity of the African ZIKV lineage. Whether this apparent paradox reflects the use of relatively old African ZIKV strains in most laboratory studies is unclear. Here, we experimentally compare seven low-passage ZIKV strains representing the recently circulating viral genetic diversity. We find that recent African ZIKV strains display higher transmissibility in mosquitoes and higher lethality in both adult and fetal mice than their Asian counterparts. We emphasize the high epidemic potential of African ZIKV strains and suggest that they could more easily go unnoticed by public health surveillance systems than Asian strains due to their propensity to cause fetal loss rather than birth defects.","We thank Catherine Lallemand for assistance with mosquito rearing, the Institut Pasteur animal facility staff for the breeding of Ifnar1−/− mice.

Burnout can have negative repercussions on their well-being and can even lead them to abandon their studies. The objective of the study focuses on academic burnout and taking medication as a consequence of the requirements of the academic path of students at a Portuguese public university. To achieve this goal, a quantitative methodology was used, consisting of the distribution of a questionnaire to a sample of students from the analyzed university. The first study questionnaire obtained 207 responses, all valid. To perform the analysis of the quantitative data, the program IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25 was used. Inferential statistics were used, namely, Student t-test and one-way ANOVA (parametric tests), Spearman’s correlation coefficient, and the Chi-square test, to test the previously defined research hypotheses. Among the variables for which statistically significant relationships with burnout were found, the following stand out: the arithmetic mean (course average); the professional situation; participation in extracurricular activities; the practice and frequency of physical exercise; the choice and expectations regarding the course; the uncertainty felt about the professional future; the evaluation of the relationship with colleagues.",The authors would like to thank the respondents to the questionnaire.

Although interest in both topics has increased in recent years, there has been no evidence of a literature review showing their evolution and trends through citation analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this article was to identify the emerging research trends in these topics, covering the Web of Science and Scopus literature by means of scientific mapping. For this, a bibliometric analysis of the scientific production was developed; and the tree analogy was used to classify the main documents. The results showed that Corporate Social Responsibility is applicable to any type of organization; however, in small companies and entrepreneurships it is limited due to pressures from interest groups. Three perspectives or streams of research were evident in the citation analysis: performance and sustainability; institutional and organizational change; shared value and social entrepreneurship.

Most of these applications trust that the blockchain will prevent issues like fraud, thanks to the built-in cryptographic mechanisms provided by the data structure and the consensus protocol. However, blockchains suffer from what is called a 51% attack or majority attack, which is considered a high risk for the integrity of these blockchains, where if a miner, or a group of them, has more than half the computing capability of the network, it can rewrite the blockchain. Even though this attack is possible in theory, it is regarded as hard-achievable in practice, due to the assumption that, with enough active members, it is very complicated to have that much computing power; however, this assumption has not been studied with enough detail. In this work, a detailed characterization of the miners in the Bitcoin and Crypto Ethereum blockchains is presented, with the aim of proving the computing distribution assumption and creating profiles that may allow the detection of anomalous behaviors and prevent 51% attacks. The results of the analysis show that, in the last years, there has been an increasing concentration of hash rate power in a very small set of miners, which generates a real risk for current blockchains. Also, that there is a pattern in mining among the main miners, which makes it possible to identify out-of-normal behavior.",,"This work was supported in part by the Program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017—Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017,” and in part by the Universidad del Norte.",IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-10-11,2021-01-01,9,,140549-140564,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Wightman, Pedro","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja, 150009, Colombia); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia; Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia); Wightman, Pedro (Escuela de Ingeniería, Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, 111711, Colombia)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Universidad del Norte; Complutense University of Madrid); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Rosario)",63,50,,22.43,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09567686.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141793811,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

Two schools appear to be opposed to each other: the philological school and a creolistic view. The philological school tried to demonstrate with meticulous research of sources that Afrikaans is a full daughter of 17th century Dutch, which set foot ashore with van Riebeeck in 1652 at the Cape of Good Hope. Linguists who thought of a pattern of creolization in the formation of Afrikaans point to the influence of the languages of slaves brought to South Africa and to the influence of the original inhabitants, the Khoi and the San. This contribution mainly outlines the ideological background of these two schools of thought. For the philological school this is the system of Apartheid, while for the Creolist view the emphasis is more on decolonization.",,,Scripta Neophilologica Posnaniensia,,,,2021-12-15,2021,2021-12-15,,21,,15-92,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hamans, Camiel","Hamans, Camiel (Comité International Permanent des Linguistes (CIPL))",,"Hamans, Camiel (Comité International Permanent des Linguistes (CIPL))",17,16,,22.2,https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/snp/article/download/30561/26996,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144050391,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

METHODS: The study included a total of 624 young adults aged 21-30 years from the Ellisras rural area. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure (BP), and biochemical measurements were measured.
RESULTS: BRI was significantly correlated with insulin (0.252 males, females 0.255), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-β (0.250 males, females 0.245), and TG (0.310 males, females 0.216). Conicity Index was significantly associated with pulse rate (PR) (β 0.099, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.017, 0.143, p < 0.013; β 0.081, 95% CI 0.000 0.130, p < 0.048), insulin (β 0.149, 95% CI 0.286 0.908, p < 0.001; β 0.110, 95% CI 0.123 0.757, p < 0.007). Conicity Index is associated with insulin resistance (IR) (odds ratio (OR) 7.761, 95% CI 5.783 96.442, p < 0.001; OR 4.646, 95% CI 2.792 74.331, p < 0.007), underweight (OR 0.023, 95% CI 0.251 0.433, p < 0.001; OR 0.031, 95% CI 0.411 0.612, p < 0.001), and obesity (OR 1.058, 95% CI 271.5 4.119, p < 0.001; OR 1.271, 95% CI 0.672 1.099, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Conicity Index was positively associated with insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Further investigation of these indices and their association with nutritional status and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) could assist in efforts to prevent CVD in the rural South African population.","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the National Research Foundation of South Africa, Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the University of Limpopo.

Using structural equation models, we found an indirect longitudinal effect of the perceived impact of COVID-19 (W1) on comfort food consumption (W3 to W6) through increased emotional distress (W2). The perceived negative impact of COVID-19 on comfort food consumption was fully mediated by the emotional distress during the first waves (W3 and W4), ending in a partial mediation in the last waves (W5 and W6). These findings contribute to disentangling the mechanisms by which the perceived impact of COVID-19 affects comfort food consumption over time, and highlight the role of emotional distress. Future interventions should address comfort food consumption by focusing on handling emotional distress during a crisis.",,"This research was funded by National Research and Development Agency (ANID, Chile), grant number COVID0282.",Nutrients,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Diet; Emotions; Faculty; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Perception; Psychological Distress; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult",2021-06-02,2021,2021-06-02,,13,6,1910,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salazar-Fernández, Camila; Palet, Daniela; Haeger, Paola A.; Mella, Francisca Román","Salazar-Fernández, Camila (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco 478000, Chile;, camila.salazar@ufrontera.cl, (C.S.-F.);, daniela.palet@ufrontera.cl, (D.P.)); Palet, Daniela (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco 478000, Chile;, camila.salazar@ufrontera.cl, (C.S.-F.);, daniela.palet@ufrontera.cl, (D.P.)); Haeger, Paola A.

METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to a cohort of persons from the general population of eight countries: Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) from April 22 to May 5 and May 26 to June 1, 2020. Country-level stringency indices were adopted from the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Primary outcomes were HRQoL, measured using the EQ-5D-5L, and mental well-being, measured using the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being (WHO-5).
FINDINGS: 21,354 respondents were included in the study. Diseased respondents had lower EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 scores compared to healthy respondents. Younger respondents had lower WHO-5 scores than older respondents. The stringency index had a stronger association with the EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 among diseased respondents compared to healthy respondents. Increasing stringency was associated with an increase in EQ-5D-5L scores but a decrease in the WHO-5 index.
CONCLUSION: The stringency of government response is inversely related to HRQoL and mental well-being with a small positive relation with HRQoL and strong negative relation with mental well-being. The magnitude of effects differed for healthy and diseased persons and by age but was most favourable for diseased and older persons.","We thank Periklis Charalampous, Vanessa Gorasso, Svetlana S.

The mathematical modeling is implemented in Matlab/Simulink® software to evaluate the influence of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and overpotentials on the overall performance. The models are further merged into an integrated electrolyzer-fuel cell system for electrical power generation. The operational description of the integrated system focuses on estimating the overall efficiency as a novel indicator. Additionally, the study presents an economic assessment to evaluate the cost-effectiveness based on different economic metrics such as capital cost, electricity cost, and payback period. The parametric analysis showed that as the temperature rises from 30 to 70 °C in both devices, the efficiency is improved between 5-20%. In contrast, pressure differences feature less relevance on the overall performance. Ohmic and activation overpotentials are highlighted for the highest impact on the generated and required voltage. Overall, the current density exhibited an inverse relation with the efficiency of both devices. The economic evaluation revealed that the integrated system can operate at variable load conditions while maintaining an electricity cost between 0.3-0.45 $/kWh. Also, the capital cost can be reduced up to 25% while operating at a low current density and maximum temperature. The payback period varies between 6-10 years for an operational temperature of 70 °C, which reinforces the viability of the system. Overall, hydrogen-powered systems stand as a promising technology to overcome energy transition as they provide robust operation from both energetic and economic viewpoints.","The authors thank UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE, UNIVERSIDAD DE LA COSTA, the industrial instrumentation and thermal machines laboratory (LIMTER) at UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO, and SPHERE ENERGY Company.",This work was supported by COLCIENCIAS and Gobernación del Atlántico (Grant No. 673 (2014) and Grant 727 (2015)).,Heliyon,,,,2021-03-19,2021,2021-03-19,2021-03,7,3,e06506,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escobar-Yonoff, Rony; Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel; Charry, Sebastián; Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana; Portnoy, Ivan","Escobar-Yonoff, Rony (KAÍ Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8 - 49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (KAÍ Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8 - 49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Charry, Sebastián (KAÍ Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8 - 49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana (Universidad del Norte, Department of Mechanical Engineering, km 5 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte, Department of Mechanical Engineering, km 5 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia; Universidad de la Costa, Department of Productivity and Innovation, Calle 58 # 55 – 66, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)","Escobar-Yonoff, Rony (University of Atlántico); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (University of Atlántico); Charry, Sebastián (University of Atlántico); Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte; University of the Coast)",45,25,0.79,16.22,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844021006095/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136499148,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In this study, we consider a two-field cosmological model with scalar fields defined in the Jordan frame. In particular, we consider a Brans–Dicke scalar field theory and for the second scalar field we consider a quintessence scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. For this cosmological model, we apply for the first time a new technique for the derivation of conservation laws without the application of variational symmetries. The results are applied for the derivation of new exact solutions. The stability properties of the scaling solutions are investigated and criteria for the nature of the second field according to the stability of these solutions are determined.",,"The research of AP and GL was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID through the program FONDECYT Iniciación grant no. 11180126.

We investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nifurtimox administered as divisible, dispersible 30 mg and 120 mg tablets in children with Chagas disease. In this blinded, controlled study conducted January 2016-July 2018, 330 patients aged <18 years from 25 medical centres across three South American countries were randomised 2:1 to nifurtimox 10-20 mg/kg/day (aged <12 years) or 8-10 mg/kg/day (aged ≥12 years) for 60 days (n = 219), or for 30 days plus placebo for 30 days (n = 111) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974). The primary outcome was anti-Trypanosoma cruzi serological response (negative seroconversion or seroreduction ≥20% in mean optical density from baseline determined by two conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) at 12 months in the 60-day treatment group versus historical placebo controls. Nifurtimox for 60 days achieved negative seroconversion (n = 10) and seroreduction (n = 62) in 72 patients (serological response 32.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26.4%, 39.3%, of all treated patients), confirming superiority relative to the upper 95% CI of 16% for controls. In patients aged <8 months, 10/12 treated for 60 days (83.3%) and 5/7 treated for 30 days (71.4%) achieved negative seroconversion. Overall serological response was lower for 30-day than for 60-day nifurtimox (between-treatment difference 14.0% [95% CI 3.7%, 24.2%]). The frequency of T. cruzi-positive quantitative polymerase chain reactions decreased substantially from baseline levels (60-day regimen 53.4% versus 1.4%; 30-day regimen 51.4% versus 4.5%). Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which were observed in 62 patients (28.3%) treated for 60 days and 29 patients (26.1%) treated for 30 days, were generally mild or moderate and resolved without sequelae; 4.2% of all TEAEs led to nifurtimox discontinuation. Age- and weight-adjusted nifurtimox for 60 days achieved a serological response at 12 months post-treatment that was superior to historical placebo, was well tolerated and had a favourable safety profile in children with Chagas disease. Although, at 1 year serological follow-up, efficacy of the shorter nifurtimox treatment was not comparable to the 60-day treatment regimen for the overall study population, further long-term follow-up of the patients will provide important information about the progress of serological conversion in children treated with nifurtimox, as well as the potential efficacy difference between the two regimens over time.","JA has acted as a consultant to Bayer for the design, conduct and review of the CHICO and SECURE studies.

Here, we define a “litter windrow” as any aggregation of floating litter at the submesoscale domain (<10 km horizontally), regardless of the force inducing the surface convergence, be it wind or other forces such as tides or density-driven currents. The marine litter windrows observed to date usually form stripes from tens up to thousands of meters long, with litter densities often exceeding 10 small items (<2 cm) per m2 or 1 large item (>2 cm) per 10 m2. Litter windrows are generally overlooked in research due to their dispersion, small size and ephemeral nature. However, applied research on windrows offers unique possibilities to advance on the knowledge and management of marine litter pollution. Litter windrows are hot spots of interaction with marine life. In addition, since the formation of dense litter windrows requires especially high loads of floating litter in the environment, their detection from space-borne sensors, aerial surveys or other platforms might be used to flag areas and periods of severe pollution. Monitoring and assessing of management plans, identification of pollution sources, or impact prevention are identified as some of the most promising fields of application for the marine litter windrows. In the present Perspective, we develop a conceptual framework and point out the main obstacles, opportunities and methodological approaches to address the study of litter windrows.",,"Funding.

We evaluate several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in a butterfly family, the Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generate a time-calibrated phylogeny containing 2,866 nymphalid species (~45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the latitudinal diversity gradient among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. The Neotropical diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and biotic interchanges with other regions are rare. Southeast Asia is also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, is the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, combined with tropical niche conservatism, played a major role in generating the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of nymphalid butterflies.","This study would not have been possible without the generous support of amateur and professional lepidopterists around the world, too many to name here; thank you to all for providing specimens and information about life histories of the butterflies.

The results indicate that most of the studies focused on medium to large samples of European university students, who attended social science programs. Ad hoc, self-reported questionnaires measuring various digital competence areas were the most commonly used method for data collection. The studies were mostly published in low tier journals. 36% of the studies did not report any quality assessment, while less than 50% covered both groups of reliability and validity assessments at the same time. In general, the studies had a moderate to high depth of evidence on the assessments performed. We found that studies in which several areas of digital competence were measured were more likely to report quality assessments.

In his State of the Nations Address on 16 February 2018, President Ramaphosa cited the Thuma Mina song of Hugh Masekela to mobilise the resourcefulness of South Africans to volunteer their services to create a better future for all. In this article, it becomes clear that ‘Thuma Mina’ is more than just a song by Hugh Masekela and churches; it has deep roots in Isaiah 6:8 and the narrative of Isaiah’s calling by God to be a prophet. In embracing the ‘Thuma Mina’ concept, Ramaphosa’s presidency has a prospect of succeeding against all odds. The president must just remain rooted to its historical significance, its connectivity to Yahweh (YHWH) and the good will of the people of South Africa as engraved in Ubuntu and the spirit of volunteerism, servanthood and generosity. Interdisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article brings the disciplines of theology, leadership and politics in defining ‘Thuma Mina’ and the prospect of the Ramaphosa presidency. It proposes that the continued use of ‘Thuma Mina’ will remain a driver to mobilise South Africans to embrace the spirit of volunteerism, servanthood and sacrifice to bring about lasting solutions to challenges of decay that South Africa faces.",,,Verbum et Ecclesia,,,,2021-04-30,2021,2021-04-30,,42,1,7,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mashau, Thinandavha D.; Kgatle, Mookgo S.","Mashau, Thinandavha D.

There are many ways to detect it, among them, with the use of blood biomarkers such as albumin, although the association between the two has not been confirmed yet.
This review synthesizes the knowledge on the association between sarcopenia and serum albumin among elderly individuals through a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on the etiology and risk factors. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute software for the review and conducted a search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS databases while two reviewers conducted an independent manual search. EpiDat, version 3.1 was used for the meta-analysis; mean differences with the albumin scores disaggregated by sarcopenia were analyzed by the random-effects model. The degree of heterogeneity was assessed with the DerSimonian and Laird Q test.
We analyzed 630 articles and finally included 14 in the review. Higher blood albumin levels were found in the meta-analysis, which was statistically significant among the elderly adults who did not present sarcopenia compared to those who did. Although there are studies exploring the association between albumin and sarcopenia, there is a need to continue evaluating its association with biological markers and comparing them to verify which can be used to detect sarcopenia among the elderly.",,,Biomédica,,,Aged; Aging; Humans; Risk Factors; Sarcopenia; Serum Albumin,2021-09-22,2021,2021-09-22,,41,3,590-603,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto; Rojas-Huayta, Violeta Magdalena; Aparco-Balboa, Juan Pablo; Céspedes-Panduro, Bernardo; Partezani-Rodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida","Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto (Escola de Enfermagem, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil, Universidade de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Centro Brasileiro para o Cuidado à Saúde Baseado em Evidências: Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil, Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil); Rojas-Huayta, Violeta Magdalena (Núcleo de Investigación en Alimentación y Nutrición Pública, Escuela de Nutrición, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil); Aparco-Balboa, Juan Pablo (Núcleo de Investigación en Alimentación y Nutrición Pública, Escuela de Nutrición, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil); Céspedes-Panduro, Bernardo (Núcleo de Investigación en Alimentación y Nutrición Pública, Escuela de Nutrición, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil; Escuela de Estadística, Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Escuela de Estadística, Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil; Facultad de Estudios Generales, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú, Universidad Privada del Norte, Facultad de Estudios Generales, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Partezani-Rodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida (Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brasil, Universidade de São Paulo, Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil)","Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto (Universidade de São Paulo; Centro Brasileiro para o Cuidado à Saúde Baseado em Evidências: Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil, Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil)","Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto (Universidade de São Paulo; Centro Brasileiro para o Cuidado à Saúde Baseado em Evidências: Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil, Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil); Rojas-Huayta, Violeta Magdalena (National University of San Marcos); Aparco-Balboa, Juan Pablo (National University of San Marcos); Céspedes-Panduro, Bernardo (National University of San Marcos; National University of San Marcos; Private University of the North); Partezani-Rodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida (Universidade de São Paulo)",30,25,3.4,13.54,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5765/4813,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141364926,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Volcanism and crustal shortening built up relief in the southernmost Central and Eastern Cordilleras of Colombia, closing this lowland gap. Independent lines of evidence consist first, of field mapping in the Tatacoa Desert with a coverage area of ∼381 km2, 1,165 km of geological contact traces, 164 structural data points, and 3D aerial digital mapping models. This map documents the beginning of southward propagation of the southernmost tip of the Eastern Cordillera’s west-verging, fold-and-thrust belt between ∼12.2 and 13.7 Ma. Second, a compilation of new and published detrital zircon geochronology in middle Miocene strata of the Tatacoa Desert shows three distinctive age populations: middle Miocene, middle Eocene, and Jurassic; the first two sourced west of the Central Cordillera, the latter in the Magdalena Valley. Similar populations with the three distinctive peaks have now been recovered in western Amazonian middle Miocene strata. These observations, along with published molecular and fossil fish data, suggest that by Serravallian times (∼13 Ma), the Northern Andes were separated from the Central Andes at ∼3°N by a fluvial system that flowed into the Amazon Basin through the Tatacoa Desert. This paleogeographic configuration would be similar to a Western Andean, or Marañon Portal. Late Miocene flattening of the subducting Nazca slab caused the eastward migration of the Miocene volcanic arc, so that starting at ∼4 Ma, large composite volcanoes were built up along the axis of today's Central Cordillera, closing this lowland Andean portal and altering the drainage patterns to resemble a modern configuration.",,"The authors would like to thank Carlos Rosero, doña Orfanda, Natalia Pardo, DIDI (Dirección de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación) of Universidad del Norte-Alianza 4U, Semillero Paleontología EAFIT, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Uniandes P12 160422.002/001, Anders Foundation, 1923 Fund, Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson, and Uniandes field students 2013 to 2017 for their enthusiastic help.

290,pub.1137675513,10.3390/sym13050774,,,Application of Interval Fuzzy Logic in Selecting a Sustainable Supplier on the Example of Agricultural Production,"The selection of sustainable suppliers (SSS) is the first step in applying a sustainable supply chain and sustainable production. Therefore, it is necessary to select the supplier that best meets the set sustainability criteria. However, the selection of suppliers cannot be done by applying symmetric information, because the company does not have complete information, so asymmetric information should be used when selecting suppliers. Since the SSS applies three main sustainability criteria, environmental, social, and economic criteria, this decision-making problem is solved by applying multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). In order to solve the SSS for the needs of agricultural production, interval fuzzy logic was applied in this research, and six suppliers with whom agricultural pharmacies in Semberija work were taken into consideration. The application of interval fuzzy logic was performed using the methods PIPRECIA (Pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment) and MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison). Using the PIPRECIA method, the weights of criteria and sub-criteria were determined. Results of this method showed that the most significant are economic criteria, followed by the social criteria. The ecological criteria are the least important. The supplier ranking was performed using the MABAC method. The results showed that supplier A4 best meets the sustainability criteria, while supplier A6 is the worst. These results were confirmed using other MCDM methods, followed by the sensitivity analysis. According to the attained results, agricultural producers from Semberija should buy the most products from suppliers A4, in order to better apply sustainability in production. This paper showed how to decision make when there is asymmetric information about suppliers.",,This research received no external funding.,Symmetry,,,,2021-04-29,2021,2021-04-29,,13,5,774,All OA; Gold,Article,"Puška, Adis; Nedeljković, Miroslav; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Pamučar, Dragan","Puška, Adis (Agricultural Faculty, University of Bijeljina, Pavlovića put bb, 76300 Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina;, aids.puska@ubn.rs.ba, (A.P.);, poljoprivreda@ubn.rs.ba, (M.N.)); Nedeljković, Miroslav (Agricultural Faculty, University of Bijeljina, Pavlovića put bb, 76300 Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina;, aids.puska@ubn.rs.ba, (A.P.);, poljoprivreda@ubn.rs.ba, (M.N.)); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Catholic University of the North, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, sarfaraz.hashemkhani@ucn.cl); Pamučar, Dragan (Department of Logistics, Military Academy, University of Defence in Belgrade, Pavla Jurišiča Šturma 33, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia)","Pamučar, Dragan (University of Defence)","Puška, Adis (University of Bijeljina; Agricultural Faculty, University of Bijeljina, Pavlovića put bb, 76300 Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina;, aids.puska@ubn.rs.ba, (A.P.);, poljoprivreda@ubn.rs.ba, (M.N.)); Nedeljković, Miroslav (University of Bijeljina; Agricultural Faculty, University of Bijeljina, Pavlovića put bb, 76300 Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina;, aids.puska@ubn.rs.ba, (A.P.);, poljoprivreda@ubn.rs.ba, (M.N.)); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Pamučar, Dragan (University of Defence)",34,15,,12.9,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/5/774/pdf?version=1619689617,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137675513,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science",12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 2 Zero Hunger

This study aimed to compare students' performance in team-based learning and traditional lectures.
METHODS: A total of 176 class 4 and 202 class 6 medical students from University of Bahri, Khartoum, Sudan, participated in the study during 2018. Experienced staff were selected to conduct the teaching and assessment of the two groups, using the standard team-based learning procedure (iRAT, gRAT and AppT) in the first topic and the lecture-based learning procedure in the second, within the same time limit for the two methods.
RESULTS: The two classes overall mean score has a significant 5.1 points difference (p<0.001; 95% CI: 3.5, 6.0). Separate analysis showed consistency of superiority of TBL to LBL in either gender. A remarkable difference was observed when we compared the two methods in class 6 separately from class 4. Class 6 mean score was high for both TBL and LBL (77.2 and 70.2, respectively), with a significant mean difference of 7.0 (p<0.001; 95% CI: 5.1, 8.9). In class 4, the score was lower for both methods (mean of 62.8 for TBL and 59.9 for LBL). The mean difference of 2.95 points was still significant (p<0.05; 95% CI: 0.46, 5.43). Separate multivariate linear regression for TBL and LBL showed no significant difference in performance of males and females in either method. Controlling for gender in TBL, class 4 had a mean of -14.26 points, (p<0.001; 95% CI: -12.54, -15.98) less than class 6. Similarly, in LBL, class 4 had a mean of -10.18 points (p<0.001, 95% CI: -7.02, -13.35), less than class 6.
CONCLUSION: Students' performance using team-based learning was superior to lecture-based learning, irrespective of students' gender, noticeable among senior students.","The authors would like to share condolences with all colleagues and reader for the sad death of our senior coauthor Professor Elfatih Elsamani, who pass away during the preparation and submission of this manuscript, due to COVID-19 and special condolences to his family and students, without his meticulous hands on and guidance this work might not be materialized.

However, the generality of this idea is challenged because (i) most studies have been conducted on two economically important forage grasses {tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) Dumort] and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)}, (ii) endophyte-mediated mechanisms and effects on plant responses to drought have shown to be highly variable across species, and that (iii) symbiosis incidence in plant populations occurring in extremely arid environments is usually low. We question this idea by reviewing the existing information about Epichloë fungal endophyte effects on drought tolerance in cool-season grasses. We combined standard review, vote counting, and calculation of effect sizes to synthesize the literature, identify information gaps, and guide future research. The total number of studies was higher for domesticated than for wild species, a ratio that was balanced when papers with data quality for effect size calculus were considered. After the drought, endophyte-infected plants accumulated more aboveground and belowground biomass than non-infected counterparts, while no effect on tillering was observed. However, these effects remained significant for wild (even on tillering) but not for domesticated species. Interestingly, despite the continuous effort in determining physiological mechanisms behind the endophyte effects, no studies evaluated plant fecundity as a measure of ecological fitness nor vital rates (such as survival) as to escalate individual-level variables to population. Together with the high variability in results, our work shows that generalizing a positive effect of fungal endophytes in plant tolerance to drought may be misleading. Future studies combining field surveys with manipulative experiments would allow us to unravel the role of fungal endophytes in plant adaptation by considering the evolutionary history of species and populations to the different ecological contexts.",,Funding.

A model was tested that evaluated the contribution of socio-demographic factors and fear of COVID-19 on anxiety and depression in samples of residents in seven Latin American countries (Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, and El Salvador). A total of 4,881 individuals, selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. Moderate and severe levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety were identified, as well as a moderate average level of fear of COVID-19. In addition, it was observed that about a quarter of the participants presented symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and a major depressive episode. Fear of COVID-19 significantly and positively predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas the effects of socio-demographic variables are generally low [χ2(287) = 5936.96, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.064 [0.062, 0.065]; CFI = 0.947; and SRMR = 0.050].

Polypropylene (PP) is the most common hemp fiber-reinforced matrix. Despite numerous papers on the application of natural fibers reinforcing polymer composites for ballistic protection, only one was so far dedicated to hemp fibers/PP with this purpose. In the present work, the main objective is for the first time to investigate the ballistic performance of the epoxy matrix reinforced with up to 30 vol% of hemp fabric. Epoxy is recently emerging as another strong alternative for the hemp fiber/fabric matrix. Due to the great variability in properties, a preliminary investigation was conducted on the basic mechanical and thermal behavior of the composites. The 30 vol% reinforcement with hemp fabric increased by 7.5 times the Izod impact energy as well as by more than 60% the tensile strength and 80% of the elastic modulus as compared to the neat epoxy. For all composites, a decrease of 20% in thermal temperatures (Tonset and Tmax) occurred in comparison to neat epoxy. The absorbed ballistic energy from the impact of 0.22 ammunition was significantly higher (95–108.5 J) than that previously reported of 36 J for hemp fabric/PP composite and others natural fiber/epoxy composites.","This study was financed in part by the Brazilian Agency CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior), Protocol #001.

GO2DAT will combine data from the coastal and open ocean, as measured by the chemical Winkler titration method or by sensors (e.g., optodes, electrodes) from Eulerian and Lagrangian platforms (e.g., ships, moorings, profiling floats, gliders, ships of opportunities, marine mammals, cabled observatories). GO2DAT will further adopt a community-agreed, fully documented metadata format and a consistent quality control (QC) procedure and quality flagging (QF) system. GO2DAT will serve to support the development of advanced data analysis and biogeochemical models for improving our mapping, understanding and forecasting capabilities for ocean O2 changes and deoxygenation trends. It will offer the opportunity to develop quality-controlled data synthesis products with unprecedented spatial (vertical and horizontal) and temporal (sub-seasonal to multi-decadal) resolution. These products will support model assessment, improvement and evaluation as well as the development of climate and ocean health indicators. They will further support the decision-making processes associated with the emerging blue economy, the conservation of marine resources and their associated ecosystem services and the development of management tools required by a diverse community of users (e.g., environmental agencies, aquaculture, and fishing sectors). A better knowledge base of the spatial and temporal variations of marine O2 will improve our understanding of the ocean O2 budget, and allow better quantification of the Earth’s carbon and heat budgets. With the ever-increasing need to protect and sustainably manage ocean services, GO2DAT will allow scientists to fully harness the increasing volumes of O2 data already delivered by the expanding global ocean observing system and enable smooth incorporation of much higher quantities of data from autonomous platforms in the open ocean and coastal areas into comprehensive data products in the years to come. This paper aims at engaging the community (e.g., scientists, data managers, policy makers, service users) toward the development of GO2DAT within the framework of the UN Global Ocean Oxygen Decade (GOOD) program recently endorsed by IOC-UNESCO.

The Omega-3 Index (O3I), clinical variables, biometric indices, and nutritional information were directly determined for 74 patients with severe COVID-19 and 10 healthy quality-control subjects. The relationships between the OI3 and mechanical ventilation (MV) and death were analyzed. Results: Patients with COVID-19 exhibited low O3I (mean: 4.15%; range: 3.06-6.14%)-consistent with insufficient fish and Omega-3 supplement consumption, and markedly lower than the healthy control subjects (mean: 7.84%; range: 4.65-10.71%). Inverse associations were observed between O3I and MV (OR = 0.459; C.I.: 0.211-0.997) and death (OR = 0.28; C.I.: 0.08-0.985) in severe COVID-19, even after adjusting for sex, age, and well-known risk factors. Conclusion: We present preliminary evidence to support the hypothesis that the risk of severe COVID-19 can be stratified by the O3I quartile. Further investigations are needed to assess the value of the O3I as a blood marker for COVID-19.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Animals;

Specifically, we assume the dark matter component to be a pressure-less fluid, while the dark energy component is a quintessence scalar field with Lagrangian function modified by the quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle. The latter modification introduces new higher-order terms of fourth-derivative due to quantum corrections in the scalar field’s equation of motion. Then, we investigate asymptotic dynamics and general behaviour of solutions of the field equations for some interacting models of special interests in the literature. At the background level, the present interacting model exhibits the matter-dominated and de Sitter solutions which are absent in the corresponding quintessence model. Furthermore, to boost the background analysis, we study cosmological linear perturbations in the Newtonian gauge where we show how perturbations are modified by quantum corrected terms from the quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle. Depending on the coupling parameters, scalar perturbations show a wide range of behavior.","This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant number 131604).

Numerous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play crucial role in virtually all cellular processes of both plants and animals, such as cell growth, cell division, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The study of rice MIR168a has demonstrated for the first time that exogenous plant MIR168a influences cholesterol transport in mice by inhibiting low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 expression. Inspired by this finding, the cross-kingdom regulation of plant-derived miRNAs has drawn a lot of attention because of its capability to provide novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of miRNA deregulation-related diseases. Notably, unlike mRNA, some plant miRNAs are robust because of their 3' end modification, high G, C content, and the protection by microvesicles, miRNAs protein cofactors or plant ingredients. The stability of these small molecules guarantees the reliability of plant miRNAs in clinical application. Although the function of endogenous miRNAs has been widely investigated, the cross-kingdom regulation of plant-derived miRNAs is still in its infancy. Herein, this review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the anti-virus, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, immune modulation, and intestinal function regulation effects of plant-derived miRNAs in mammals.

It has a crucial function in tumor development and metastasis. Thus, angiogenesis has become one of the most exciting targets for drug development in cancer treatment. Here we discuss the regulatory effects on angiogenesis in glioblastoma (GBM) of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long ncRNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA). These ncRNAs may function in trans or cis forms and modify gene transcription by various mechanisms, including epigenetics. NcRNAs may also serve as crucial regulators of angiogenesis-inducing molecules.

To gain insights into the regulation of gene expression in CHD, we obtained the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in 22 heart tissue samples with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) through strand-specific transcriptomic analysis. Using a causal inference framework based on the expression correlations and validated microRNA (miRNA)-lncRNA-mRNA evidences, we constructed the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-mediated network driven by lncRNAs. Four lncRNAs (FGD5-AS1, lnc-GNB4-1, lnc-PDK3-1, and lnc-SAMD5-1) were identified as hub lncRNAs in the network. FGD5-AS1 was selected for further study since all its targets were CHD-related genes (NRAS, PTEN, and SMAD4). Both FGD5-AS1 and SMAD4 could bind with hsa-miR-421, which has been validated using dual-luciferase reporter assays. Knockdown of FGD5-AS1 not only significantly reduced PTEN and SMAD4 expression in HEK 293 and the fetal heart cell line (CCC-HEH-2) but also increased the transcription of its interacted miRNAs in a cell-specific way. Besides ceRNA mechanism, RNAseq and ATACseq results showed that FGD5-AS1 might play repression roles in heart development by transcriptionally regulating CHD-related genes. In conclusion, we identified a ceRNA network driven by lncRNAs in heart tissues of TOF patients. Furthermore, we proved that FGD5-AS1, one hub lncRNA in the TOF heart ceRNA network, regulates multiple genes transcriptionally and epigenetically.",,"Funding.

As a result, the United Nations General Assembly committed to convening a series of intergovernmental conferences (IGCs) to develop an international legally-binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of ABNJ [the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) agreement] under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The BBNJ agreement includes consideration of marine genetic resources (MGR) in ABNJ, including how to share benefits and promote marine scientific research whilst building capacity of developing states in science and technology. Three IGCs have been completed to date with the fourth delayed by the Covid pandemic. This delay has allowed a series of informal dialogues to take place between state parties, which have highlighted a number of areas related to MGR and benefit sharing that require technical guidance from ocean experts. These include: guiding principles on the access and use of MGR from ABNJ; the sharing of knowledge arising from research on MGR in ABNJ; and capacity building and technology transfer for developing states. In this paper, we explain what MGR are, the methods required to collect, study and archive them, including data arising from scientific investigation. We also explore the practical requirements of access by developing countries to scientific cruises, including the sharing of data, as well as participation in research and development on shore whilst promoting rather than hindering marine scientific research. We outline existing infrastructure and shared resources that facilitate access, research, development, and benefit sharing of MGR from ABNJ; and discuss existing gaps. We examine international capacity development and technology transfer schemes that might facilitate or complement non-monetary benefit sharing activities. We end the paper by highlighting what the ILBI can achieve in terms of access, utilization, and benefit sharing of MGR and how we might future-proof the BBNJ Agreement with respect to developments in science and technology.","We would like to thank the Governments of The Kingdom of Belgium, The Principality of Monaco and Costa Rica, as well as The Prince Albert II Monaco Foundation, The Norwegian Nobel Institute, The Nobel Institute, The High Seas Alliance, The Pew Charitable Trusts, Ocean Unite and REV Ocean for supporting the High Seas Treaty Dialogues which have allowed informal discussions between States representatives on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction agreement. We would also like to thank the participants of the High Seas Treaty Dialogues for their thoughtful contributions to these discussions which highlighted the need for this paper. We would also like to acknowledge REV Ocean for supporting publication costs for this manuscript.","Growing capacity for scientific research, including studying MGR, requires international effort extended over time. The funding required for such efforts is significant and needs to be recognized as a benefit in the BBNJ agreement. Funding can come through specific training programs, scholarships and many other activities tailored to build capacity in developing States.

The RPL protocol (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power a Lossy Networks) arises for the management of this type of network restricted by their physical capabilities through different rules and operations that simplify the communications and constructions of the WSN. Although RPL is an efficient and standardized protocol, it does not consider high traffic handling and presents severe problems regarding load balancing, which leads to service disruption. In this article, WRF-RPL is proposed as a protocol for considering load balancing over RPL to distribute communications and messages into a network topology to avoid one preferred parent’s congestions. The proposed protocol aims to improve the network’s lifetime and the packet delivery through source nodes to the sink in an energy-efficient manner. Different simulated scenarios were conducted over the Cooja simulator. The results show that WRF-RPL protocols outperform the standard RPL protocol over Network Lifetime, PDR, control message overhead, and energy consumption compared with other existing protocols.","This work was supported in part by the Research, Development, and Innovation Management (DIDI), Universidad del Norte.",,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-04-20,2021-01-01,9,,60163-60174,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acevedo, Pedro David; Jabba, Daladier; Sanmartín, Paul; Valle, Sebastián; Nino-Ruiz, Elías D.","Acevedo, Pedro David (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Jabba, Daladier (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Sanmartín, Paul (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Valle, Sebastián (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Nino-Ruiz, Elías D.

This paper analyzes how the spatial accessibility to local public services is distributed equitably among different social and economic groups in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (MR), Chile. To accomplish this objective, I use accessibility measures to local public services such as transportation, public education, healthcare, kindergartens, parks, fire and police stations, cultural infrastructure, and information about housing prices and exempted housing units from local taxes by block, as well as quantile regressions and bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). The main results confirm the accessibility to local public services is unequally distributed among residents. However, it affects more low-income groups who are suffering from significant deficits in the provision of local public services. In this scenario, poor residents face a double disadvantage due to their social exclusion from urban systems and their limited access to essential services such as education, healthcare, or transportation. In particular, I found that social residential segregation might be reinforced by insufficient access to local infrastructure that the most impoverished population should assume.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2021-01-06,2021,2021-01-06,,13,2,442,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cortés, Yasna","Cortés, Yasna (Department of Economics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile)",,"Cortés, Yasna (Catholic University of the North)",21,12,,9.63,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/2/442/pdf?version=1609913217,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134409236,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,10 Reduced Inequalities

The case study is a student welfare unit from a university campus located in the tropical climate (Aw) of Guayaquil, Ecuador. The proposed approach aims to identify the most effective energy saving strategy for building retrofit in this climate. For this purpose, we modeled the base line of the building and proposed energy saving scenarios that were evaluated independently. All building simulations were done in OpenStudio-EnergyPlus, while the on-site power generation was carried out using the Homer PRO software. Results indicated that the incorporation of daylighting controls accounted for the highest energy savings of around 20% and 14% in total building energy consumption, and cooling loads, respectively. Also, this strategy provided a reduction of about 35% and 43% in total building energy consumption, and cooling loads, respectively, when combined with triple low-e coating glazing and active measures.

Despite this, little is known about the intention of students to use online learning. The objective of this research is to study the continuance intention of online learning in the post-COVID-19 period in higher education. The research focuses on online learning tools and technologies by applying a modified Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) developed from earlier theoretical models, including three new constructs: the self-management of learning, computer anxiety, and habit. The international research compares three countries—Spain (Europe), Chile (Latin America), and Jordan (Asia)—which differ economically and culturally. The Partial Least Squares approach (PLS-SEM) was used to test the research model. As a conclusion of the study, the relationships of the proposed model’s constructs vary among the three countries, given their socioeconomic, technological, and cultural differences. Interestingly, self-management learning is a key factor that has a significant positive influence on continuance intention for the three countries, especially in Jordan. This study makes an interesting contribution to existing research in education and discusses how learning can be made more sustainable in complex settings.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2021-12-14,2021,2021-12-14,,13,24,13813,All OA; Gold,Article,"Soria-Barreto, Karla; Ruiz-Campo, Sofia; Al-Adwan, Ahmad Samed; Zuniga-Jara, Sergio","Soria-Barreto, Karla (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, sz@ucn.cl); Ruiz-Campo, Sofia (Department of Economics, Accounting and Finance, EAE Business School, 28002 Madrid, Spain;, sruizc@eae.es); Al-Adwan, Ahmad Samed (Electronic Business and Commerce Department, Business School, Al Ahliyya Amman University, Amman 19328, Jordan;, a.adwan@ammanu.edu.jo); Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, sz@ucn.cl)","Soria-Barreto, Karla (Catholic University of the North)","Soria-Barreto, Karla (Catholic University of the North); Ruiz-Campo, Sofia (EAE Business School); Al-Adwan, Ahmad Samed (Al-Ahliyya Amman University); Zuniga-Jara, Sergio (Catholic University of the North)",17,11,,9.45,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/24/13813/pdf?version=1639495220,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143889331,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 39 Education; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

In the greenhouse cultivation, air temperature and relative air humidity are regulated by switching on/off the evaporative systems and opening/closing the roof windows, which causes VPD fluctuation. However, it remains unclear how VPD fluctuation affects photosynthetic and growth performance in plants. Here, we examined the effects of the VPD fluctuation on the photosynthetic and growth characteristics in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The parameters for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass production were evaluated under the conditions of drastic (1.63 kPa for 6 min and 0.63 for 3 min) or moderate (1.32 kPa for 7 min and 0.86 kPa for 3 min) VPD fluctuation. The drastic VPD fluctuation induced gradual decrease in stomatal conductance and thus CO2 assimilation rate during the measurements, while moderate VPD fluctuation caused no reduction of these parameters. Furthermore, data showed moderate VPD fluctuation maintained leaf expansion and the efficiency of CO2 diffusion across leaf surface, resulting in enhanced plant growth compared with drastic VPD fluctuation. Taken together, fine regulation of VPD can be crucial for better plant growth by maintaining the photosynthetic performance in lettuce. The present work demonstrates the importance of VPD control during plant cultivation in plant factories and greenhouses.",,"Funding.

The optimal location of the D-STATCOMs is identified by implementing the classical and well-known Chu and Beasley genetic algorithm, which employs an integer codification to select the nodes where these will be installed. To determine the optimal sizes of the D-STATCOMs, a second-order cone programming reformulation of the optimal power flow problem is employed with the aim of minimizing the total costs of the daily energy losses. The objective function considered in this study is the minimization of the annual operative costs associated with energy losses and installation investments in D-STATCOMs. This objective function is subject to classical power balance constraints and device capabilities, which generates a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model that is solved with the proposed genetic-convex strategy. Numerical validations in the 33-node test feeder with radial configuration show the proposed genetic-convex model’s effectiveness to minimize the annual operative costs of the grid when compared with the optimization solvers available in GAMS software.","The first author was supported by the Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Científico de la Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, under grant 1643-12-2020 associated with the project “Desarrollo de una metodología de optimización para la gestión óptima de recursos energéticos distribuidos en redes de distribución de energía eléctrica” and in part by the Dirección de Investigaciones de la Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, under grant PS2020002 associated with the project “Ubicación óptima de bancos de capacitores de paso fijo en redes eléctricas de distribución para reducción de costos y pérdidas de energía: Aplicación de métodos exactos y metaheurísticos.”","This work was partially supported in part by the Laboratorio de Simulación Hardware-in-the-loop para Sistemas Ciberfísicos under Grant TEC2016-80242-P (AEI/FEDER), and in part by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under Grant DPI2016-75294-C2-2-R.",Applied Sciences,,,,2021-04-08,2021,2021-04-08,,11,8,3353,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montoya, Oscar Danilo; Chamorro, Harold R.; Alvarado-Barrios, Lazaro; Gil-González, Walter; Orozco-Henao, César","Montoya, Oscar Danilo (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá D.C. 11021, Colombia; Laboratorio Inteligente de Energía, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena 131001, Colombia); Chamorro, Harold R.

This criticism reflects the increasing maturity of the field as well as the different theoretical perspectives and methodological practices of researchers in different disciplines. While debates addressing these criticisms are likely to lead to valuable insights, no empirical studies have been carried out to date that have investigated researchers' critical views on the development and conceptualization of mixed methods research. This study examines the criticisms of the mixed methods field raised by a cross-national sample of researchers in education, nursing, psychology, and sociology. We carried out a secondary analysis of semi-structured interviews with 42 researchers and identified 11 different criticisms, which we classified in four domains: essence of mixed methods, philosophy, procedures, and politics. The criticisms related to the procedures domain were equally distributed among the four disciplines, while those related to the essence, philosophy and politics domains were more common among sociologists. Based on our findings, we argue that the divergence of views on foundational issues in this field reflects researchers' affiliation to different communities of practice, each having its own principles, values, and interests. We suggest that a greater awareness of this divergence of perspectives could help researchers establish effective collaboration and anticipate potential challenges when working with researchers having different methodological approaches.","The authors received no specific funding for this work.

The prognostic significance of TAMs has been confirmed in various tumors. However, whether TAMs can be prognostic factors in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the prognostic value of TAMs in ccRCC.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science for relevant published studies before December 19, 2020. Evidence from enrolled studies were pooled and analyzed by a meta-analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to evaluate the pooled results.
RESULTS: Both of high CD68+ TAMs and M2-TAMs were risk factors for poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. The pooled HRs indicated that elevated CD68+ TAMs correlated with poor OS and PFS (HR: 3.97, 95% CI 1.39-11.39; HR: 5.73, 95% CI 2.36-13.90, respectively). For M2-TAMs, the pooled results showed ccRCC patients with high M2-TAMs suffered a worse OS and shorter PFS, with HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.16-1.50) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.14-1.72), respectively. Also, high density of TAMs was associated with advanced clinicopathological features in ccRCC.
CONCLUSIONS: TAMs could be potential biomarkers for prognosis and novel targets for immunotherapy in ccRCC.

In the present study, we tested the biostimulant proprieties of a sedimentary shale ore-extracted humic acid (HA) on Micro Tom tomato plants under increasing nutritional stress and investigated the correlation with the chemical features of HA by means of ultra-high resolution FT-ICR MS, FT-ATR, and 13C-NMR. Humic acid application proved effective in alleviating the nutritional stress by improving nutrient use efficiency, with results comparable to the control treatment supplied with higher NPK nutrition. Increased yield (up to +19%) and fruit quality (in the range +10-24%), higher ascorbic acid content and a better root growth were the main parameters affected by HA application. Molecular-level characterization identified the possible chemical drivers of bioactivity, and included flavonoids, quinones, and alkaloids among the most represented molecules, some of which exhibiting antioxidant, pro-oxidant, and antimicrobial activity.

A major factor of the modern-day ecological diversity of the group, and supposedly in the past as well, is represented by the highly specialised larval forms of lacewings. Quantitative analyses of the morphology of larvae revealed a loss of morphological diversity in several lineages. Here we explored the diversity of the larvae of mantis lacewings (Mantispidae), lance lacewings (Osmylidae), beaded lacewings (Berothidae and Rhachiberothidae, the latter potentially an ingroup of Berothidae), and pleasing lacewings (Dilaridae), as well as fossil larvae, preserved in amber, resembling these. We used shape analysis of the head capsule and stylets (pair of conjoined jaws) as a basis due to the high availability of this body region in extant and fossil specimens and the ecological importance of this region. The analysis revealed a rather constant morphological diversity in Berothidae. Mantispidae appears to have lost certain forms of larvae, but has seen a drastic increase of larval diversity after the Cretaceous; this is in contrast to a significant decrease in diversity in adult forms.","Mónica M.

A total of 31 contigs is assembled with a total length of 3,264,448 bases, with all contigs matching the core genome of different groups in the database. The genome size is 3,540,752 bases with GC content of 44.53% and the genome repeat sequences constitute around 457,386 bases of the assembly. The UTNGt2 matches the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum genome with 99% identity. The genome contains 3115 genes, 3052 protein-coding genes, assigned with the EggNOG database. On the basis of the results, 745 proteins are classified with an unknown function, from which 128 proteins have no match in the BLASTN database. It also contains 57 tRNAs, 5 copies of 5S rRNA, and 1 copy of tmRNA. Based on gene prediction and annotation results, 9.4% of proteins are involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism and 8.46% in transcription, 2.36% are responsible for defense mechanisms, 0.5% are responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, transport, and catabolism, while 25.11% have an unknown function. The genome revealed the presence of genes involved in riboflavin and folate production, the presence of CRISPR/Cas genes, phage sequences, the absence of acquired antibiotics resistance genes, virulence, and pathogenic factors, suggesting that UTNGt2 is a safe strain. Its highly antimicrobial capacity is related to the presence of two bacteriocin clusters (class IIc) of the sactipeptide class (contig 4) and plantaricin E class (contig 22), as detected by the BAGEL 4 webserver. Several RiPP-like peptides (non-bactericidal ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified peptides), polyketides (PKs), and terpenes were predicted. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that the UTNGt2 strain has diverse bacteriocins with a high inhibitory capacity, thus it is a bacteriocinogenic strain. Considering the safety profile, UTNGt2 is a nonpathogenic, nonvirulent strain with valuable biotechnological traits and can be further exploited for its probiotic and antimicrobial potential in the food industry or as a potential producer strain of antimicrobial peptides as an alternative to conventional antibiotics.","The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North, Centre of Research (CUICYT) for funding this research.

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a frequent threat to computer networks because of its disruption to the services they cause. This disruption results in the instability and/or inoperability of the network. There are different classes of DDoS attacks, each with a different mode of operation, so detecting them has become a difficult task for network monitoring and control systems. The objective of this work is based on the exploration and choice of a set of data that represents DDoS attack events, on their treatment in a preprocessing phase, and later, the generation of a model of sequential neural networks of multi-class classification. This is done to identify and classify the various types of DDoS attacks. The result was compared with previous works treating the same dataset used herein. We compared their classification method, against ours. During this research, the CIC DDoS2019 dataset was used. Previous works carried out with this dataset proposed a binary classification approach, our approach is based on multi-classification. Our proposed model was capable of achieving around 94% in metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. The added value of multiclass classification during this work is identified and compared with binary classifications using the models presented in the previous.",Our highest recognition for the Systems Engineering department of the Universidad del Norte.,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-11-11,2021,2021-11-11,,11,22,10609,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chartuni, Andrés; Márquez, José","Chartuni, Andrés (Computer Science and Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia); Márquez, José (Computer Science and Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia)","Márquez, José (Universidad del Norte)","Chartuni, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Márquez, José (Universidad del Norte)",23,17,,8.58,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/22/10609/pdf?version=1636622720,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143148961,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

We use present-day relationships between fecal pellet diameters from ashy chinchilla rats (Abrocoma cinerea) and mean annual rainfall to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of pluvials (wet episodes) spanning the past 16,000 years in the Atacama Desert based on 81 14C-dated A. cinerea paleomiddens. A transient climate simulation shows that pluvials identified at 15.9 to 14.8, 13.0 to 8.6, and 8.1 to 7.6 ka B.P. can be linked to North Atlantic (high-latitude) forcing (e.g., Heinrich Stadial 1, Younger Dryas, and Bond cold events). Holocene pluvials at 5.0 to 4.6, 3.2 to 2.1, and 1.4 to 0.7 ka B.P. are not simulated, implying low-latitude internal variability forcing (i.e., ENSO regime shifts). These results help constrain future central Andean hydroclimatic variability and hold promise for reconstructing past climates from rodent middens in desert ecosystems worldwide.","We thank the many colleagues, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as laboratory technicians who helped collect middens in the field, prepared samples in the laboratory, and helped to measure rodent pellets.

Integration and social competence in the migrant population are determined by several factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of resilience and acculturation stress on the levels of integration and social competence in migrant students in Northern Chile. In total, 292 school children of both genders aged 8 to 18, from the fourth grade to senior year of high school, participated in the investigation. A subscale of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System (Sistema de evaluación de niños y adolescentes SENA) was used to assess integration and social competence. Additionally, the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12) and the Acculturation Stress Source Scale (FEAC) were used. The results show that integration and social competence have statistically significant and direct associations with resilience (p < 0.001) and indirect associations with acculturation stress (p = 0.009). Both constructs could be defined as protection and risk factors, respectively, and should be considered in educational contexts to favor adaptation in the integration of migrant children and adolescents.",,This research was funded by ANID PIA CIE160007.

Methods: It was based on a retrospective online survey conducted in May 2020. More than 10,000 youths voluntarily recalled their PA-related information at three stages: before COVID-19 (January), during lockdown (February), and after lockdown (May). χ2 tests were conducted to evaluate the significance of the differences in participants' characteristics between sexes, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were performed to examine the significance of differences in changes in PA and sedentary behavior levels between sexes. Results: A total of 8,115 participants were included, with a mean age of 20. The percentage of no PA per week increased significantly and then slightly fell, and that of ≥150 min/week substantially decreased and then rebounded partially (all p < 0.001) (for instance, the percentage of ≥150 min/week of PA total decreased from 38.6 to 19.4%, then rebounded back to 25.3%). Means hours per day spent in sedentary behaviors had significantly increased during lockdown comparing to pre-COVID-19 (all p < 0.001). There were more participants reported reduced PA level than those indicated increased, and more participating youths had their sedentary behavior level increased than those who had it decreased. Conclusions: The study found COVID-19 had both immediate and longer-term impacts on self-reported physical activities and sedentary behaviors among Chinese youths. Relevant efforts should be strengthened to get youths physically moving again.",,Funding.

The others are multi-starter consortia that include non-Saccharomyces/Saccharomyces mixtures or only non-Saccharomyces species. Several commercial yeasts have shown adequate biocompatibility with S. cerevisiae in mixed fermentations, allowing an increased contribution of metabolites of oenological interest, such as glycerol, esters, higher alcohols, acids, thiols, and terpenes, among others, in addition to a lower production of acetic acid, volatile phenols, biogenic amines, or urea.

BACKGROUND: The nursing profession involves high work stress due to emotional involvement, workload and available resources.
METHODS: Descriptive multicentric cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and migration data were collected and participants completed the Job Satisfaction Questionnaire S20/23 and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The data were analysed using descriptive statistical methods using the program SPSS.
RESULTS: The sample included 228 nurses (187 women and 41 men), with a mean age of 37.11 ± 10.87. Reported job satisfaction was medium to high. Overall, values were low in emotional fatigue and medium in depersonalization and personal fulfilment. In terms of migration, 21.59% of the participants had already moved to other Spanish regions or another country, while 18.58% had the intention of doing so.
CONCLUSION: Nurses with a temporary contract showed a high burnout rate, and high levels of emotional fatigue, depersonalization and lack of personal fulfilment.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Strategies are needed to improve working and contractual conditions such as enhancing teamwork, management and leadership skills in nurses; achieving internal promotion; and having higher participation in decision-making and a better balance of power between health institution managers and health professionals.",,"Funding information This study was partially financed by Generalitat de Catalunya, Serra Hunter Programme, and University of Lleida financial aid to promote deficit research areas",Journal of Nursing Management,,,"Burnout, Professional; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Nurses; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workload",2021-06-27,2021,2021-06-27,2021-10,29,7,2208-2215,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acea‐López, Lorena; del Mar Pastor‐Bravo, María; Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther; Bellon, Filip; Blanco‐Blanco, Joan; Gea‐Sanchez, Montserrat; Briones‐Vozmediano, Erica","Acea‐López, Lorena (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain); del Mar Pastor‐Bravo, María (Department of Nursing, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain; ENFERAVANZA research group, IMIB‐Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain); Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; CIBER of Diabetes and Associated Cardiometabolic Diseases (CIBERDEM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Barcelona, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Bellon, Filip (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Blanco‐Blanco, Joan (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Gea‐Sanchez, Montserrat (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Briones‐Vozmediano, Erica (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain)","Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Lleida)","Acea‐López, Lorena (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain); del Mar Pastor‐Bravo, María (University of Murcia; ENFERAVANZA research group, IMIB‐Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain); Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Lleida); Bellon, Filip (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida); Blanco‐Blanco, Joan (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida); Gea‐Sanchez, Montserrat (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida); Briones‐Vozmediano, Erica (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida)",18,13,2.86,8.45,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jonm.13376,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138105445,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,

Identifying the domestic species (alpaca and llama) in archaeological sites based solely on morphological data is challenging due to their similarity with respect to their wild ancestors. Using genetic methods also presents challenges due to the hybridization history of the domestic species, which are thought to have extensively hybridized following the Spanish conquest of South America that resulted in camelids slaughtered en masse. In this study, we generated mitochondrial genomes for 61 ancient South American camelids dated between 3,500 and 2,400 years before the present (Early Formative period) from two archaeological sites in Northern Chile (Tulán-54 and Tulán-85), as well as 66 modern camelid mitogenomes and 815 modern mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America. In addition, we performed osteometric analyses to differentiate big and small body size camelids. A comparative analysis of these data suggests that a substantial proportion of the ancient vicuña genetic variation has been lost since the Early Formative period, as it is not present in modern specimens. Moreover, we propose a domestication hypothesis that includes an ancient guanaco population that no longer exists. Finally, we find evidence that interbreeding practices were widespread during the domestication process by the early camelid herders in the Atacama during the Early Formative period and predating the Spanish conquest.","The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,eLife,,"George H Perry, Jessica C Thompson","Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Archaeology; Camelids, New World; Chile; DNA, Ancient; DNA, Mitochondrial; Domestication; Genetic Variation; Genome, Mitochondrial; Hybridization, Genetic",2021-03-16,2021,2021-03-16,,10,,e63390,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández; Rey-Iglesia, Alba; Cartajena, Isabel; Núñez, Lautaro; Westbury, Michael Vincent; Varas, Valeria; Moraga, Mauricio; Campos, Paula F; Orozco-terWengel, Pablo; Marin, Juan Carlos; Hansen, Anders Johannes","Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Rey-Iglesia, Alba (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Cartajena, Isabel (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Núñez, Lautaro (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Westbury, Michael Vincent (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Varas, Valeria (Faculty of Sciences, Austral University of Chile, Valdivia, Chile); Moraga, Mauricio (Human Genetics Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Campos, Paula F (CIIMAR, University of Porto, Matosinhos, Portugal); Orozco-terWengel, Pablo (School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom); Marin, Juan Carlos (Faculty of Sciences, Bio-Bio University, Chillán, Chile); Hansen, Anders Johannes (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark)","Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández (University of Copenhagen); Orozco-terWengel, Pablo (Cardiff University); Marin, Juan Carlos (Faculty of Sciences, Bio-Bio University, Chillán, Chile)","Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández (University of Copenhagen); Rey-Iglesia, Alba (University of Copenhagen); Cartajena, Isabel (University of Chile); Núñez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North); Westbury, Michael Vincent (University of Copenhagen); Varas, Valeria (Austral University of Chile); Moraga, Mauricio (University of Chile); Campos, Paula F (University of Porto); Orozco-terWengel, Pablo (Cardiff University); Marin, Juan Carlos (Faculty of Sciences, Bio-Bio University, Chillán, Chile); Hansen, Anders Johannes (University of Copenhagen)",28,14,0.62,8.31,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.63390,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136427590,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3105 Genetics,

Different types of decision factors and different characteristics of different international markets have brought up a complicated decision-making problem for food supply companies. In order to select the most suitable and profitable market, food supply companies have to consider several qualitative and quantitative factors, including social, political, economic, and ecological aspects. Purpose of the article: In order to overcome international market selection issues, the current study develops a novel integrated decision-making tool. Methods: A novel decision-making model of market analysis is developed as an extended model of Market Attractiveness and Business Attractiveness (MABA) analysis based on the Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM). To improve the MABA analysis model, we combine the EDAS method with MABA analysis to empower decision-makers in food supply companies to evaluate several international markets and select the most profitable market for their products. Findings & value added: In this study, we first identified the most important and frequently used decision factors for market analysis problems within MABA analysis under two categories: market attractiveness and business attractiveness. To show the proposed methodology's applicability and feasibility, we perform a case study for a food supply company in Iran that supplies products to Middle East and Asian countries. In order to investigate the reliability of the obtained results, we perform a sensitivity analysis concerning the importance of involved decision factors. The proposed decision-making tool results suggest that the model can be used as a reliable tool for market analysis problems. To sum up the long-term value of the study, we have developed a novel decision-making tool using MABA analysis and the EDAS method. No study integrates any MCDM methods with MABA analysis to the best of our knowledge.

Prior to this study, our knowledge of these habitats and the life they support was restricted to what has been observed from eight boreholes drilled for geological and glaciological studies. The established theory of sub-ice shelf biogeography is that both functional and taxonomic diversities decrease along a nutrient gradient with distance from the ice shelf front, resulting in a depauperate fauna, dominated by mobile scavengers and predators toward the grounding line. Mobile macro-benthic life and mega-benthic life have been observed as far as 700 km under an ice shelf. New observations from two boreholes in the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf challenge the idea that sessile organisms reduce in prevalence the further under the ice you go. The discovery of an established community consisting of only sessile, probably filter feeding, organisms (sponges and other taxa) on a boulder 260 km from the ice front raises significant questions, especially when the local currents suggest that this community is somewhere between 625 km and 1500 km in the direction of water flow from the nearest region of photosynthesis. This new evidence requires us to rethink our ideas with regard to the diversity of community types found under ice shelves, the key factors which control their distribution and their vulnerability to environmental change and ice shelf collapse.","The fieldwork on the Filchner Ice Shelf in 2015–2016 was undertaken under the permit 45/2015 issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London, to section 3 of the Antarctic Act 1994.

Of particular interest is the LP family of surfactin, immunogenic molecules involved in induced systemic resistance (ISR) and the bacterial colonization of plant surfaces. We hypothesize that the concentration of surfactin produced by a strain correlates directly with its ability to colonize and persist on different plant surfaces, which conditions its capacity to trigger ISR. We used two Bacillus velezensis strains (BBC023 and BBC047), whose antagonistic potential in vitro is practically identical, but not on plant surfaces. The surfactin production of BBC047 is 1/3 higher than that of BBC023. Population density and SEM images revealed stable biofilms of BBC047 on leaves and roots, activating ISR on both plant surfaces. Despite its lower surfactin production, strain BBC023 assembled stable biofilms on roots and activated ISR. However, on leaves only isolated, unstructured populations were observed, which could not activate ISR. Thus, the ability of a strain to effectively colonize a plant surface is not only determined through its production of surfactin. Multiple aspects, such as environmental stressors or compensation mechanisms may influence the process. Finally, the importance of surfactin lies in its impacts on biofilm formation and stable colonization, which finally enables its activity as an elicitor of ISR.","The authors are thankful to Stefanie Maldonado, Williams Arancibia and Juan Pablo Araya for technical support in the laboratory, UCN Coquimbo for granting access to the SEM platform as well as to Servicios y Almacigos SA for providing assistance with seedling growth.","This research was funded by Projects BIP 30127532 and BIP 30403034 (Regional Fund of Innovation for Competitiveness Coquimbo Region FIC-R, Chile) (A.S.) and ANID Beca Doctorado Nacional Grant/Award N° 21140504 (R.S.-M.).",Microorganisms,,,,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,9,11,2251,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stoll, Alexandra; Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo; González, Máximo; Araya, Michael","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Departamento de Biología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena 1720170, Chile;, rsmesteban@gmail.com); Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo (Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Departamento de Biología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena 1720170, Chile;, rsmesteban@gmail.com); González, Máximo (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl); Araya, Michael (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Algas CIDTA, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, mmaraya@ucn.cl)","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; University of La Serena)","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; University of La Serena); Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo (University of La Serena); González, Máximo (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl); Araya, Michael (Catholic University of the North)",33,23,2.84,7.93,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/11/2251/pdf?version=1635429038,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143009653,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,2 Zero Hunger

Databases with the information transcribed from the Le Paige Notes for these cemeteries served as a basic instrument; from them, the statistical analysis was structured according to artifact categories that allowed us to establish correlations between the different components of the mortuary offerings, comparing those that included elements of the psychotropic equipment with those that lacked them. Thus, differences emerged in the management of certain goods that made up the “circle of materializing objects” of the Atacamenian elite.

Both countries have a long history of scientific collaboration that dates to the 1800s. Both scientific communities also share geographical proximity and common scientific research interests mainly in Biotechnology, Meteorology, and Public Health research. Despite these facts, scientists from both nations face serious barriers to cooperation raised by the U.S. embargo established in 1961 that prohibits exchanges with Cuba. The study aims to analyze the effects of U.S. policy on scientific collaboration with Cuban scientific institutions. The results of the bibliometric analysis of Cuba-U.S. joint publications in the Web of Science, and Scopus databases between 1980 to 2020 indicate sustained growth of scientific collaboration between scientists of both nations over the past forty years. The results also show that after the 1980 Smithsonian Institution and the Cuba's Academy of Sciences agreement significantly increased scientific collaboration between U.S. scientists with their Cuban peers. President Barack Obama's approach to normalizing the U.S. Cuba relations in 2015 enhanced Cuban scientific production with U.S. scientists by exceeding the number of collaborative papers published during any preceding U.S. Presidential administration. By 2020, Cuba had expanded its scientific links to 80% of the countries in the world. Cuban and U.S. scientists converted from adversaries into partners, showing that science is an effective diplomatic channel.

797,pub.1135796440,10.3390/w13050601,,,Challenges of Water Sensitive Cities in Mexico: The Case of the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara,"Mexico is currently facing important water management challenges. Cities in the country are facing water scarcity and at the same time they struggle with floods during the raining season. The water sensitive urban design (WSUD) approach has proved to be helpful around the world in tackling urban water challenges such as floods or water scarcity. The WSUD approach highlights the role of both the water cycle and the water utilities systems, when transitioning towards a water sensitive stage. Therefore, the objective of this research is to demonstrate the relevance for cities of a WSUD approach by analyzing the current situation of the water cycle and the water utility in the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (MAG). This research proposes a case study approach. Within our case of study, we focused on the water cycle and the water utilities system (Sistema Intermunicipal de los Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (SIAPA)) and ask two questions: (1) What are the causes of water scarcity and flooding in the MAG? and (2) What are the proposals to solve these problems under a WSUD approach? By answering these questions, we identified that the water management in the MAG corresponds to a single purpose infrastructure. This type of water management is common in developing cities and does not contribute to solve the problems of water scarcity and floods. The water supply policy is based only on the construction of large dams disregarding the storage and use of rainwater, and reuse of greywater, and water-conservation devices. In order to transition towards a water sensitive stage, changes in the water policy need to take place and a WSUD approach that includes multi-purpose infrastructure, should be considered.","We acknowledge the University of Guadalajara for its support and for financing the APC.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of IPD and the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-10 (PCV-10) over a 10-year period in Bogotá, Colombia.
METHODS: This was a laboratory-based surveillance study of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with IPD from 82 hospitals over 10 years in Bogotá, Colombia. Data were compared between two periods: 2007-2011 (before the introduction of PCV-10) and 2012-2017 (after the introduction of PCV-10).
RESULTS: In total, 1670 patients with IPD were included in the study between 2007 and 2017. Between 2007 and 2011, the most common serotypes were 14, 1, 6B, 6A and 3. Between 2012 and 2017, the most common serotypes were 19A, 3, 14 and 1. A decrease in the incidence of IPD, particularly in children aged 0-4 years, was noted after the introduction of PCV-10. Importantly, this reduction in incidence was not observed in patients aged ≥50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The IPD burden in Bogotá remained stable between 2007 and 2017. The incidence of IPD decreased in children but not in older adults. The introduction of PCV-10 led to a change in the most prevalent serotypes to serotypes that are not included in PCV-10.",,,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,"Aged; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumococcal Infections; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Serogroup; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Vaccines, Conjugate",2021-02-11,2021,2021-02-11,2021-04,105,,32-39,All OA; Gold,Article,"Severiche-Bueno, David Felipe; Severiche-Bueno, Diego Fernando; Bastidas, Alirio; Caceres, Eder L; Silva, Edwin; Lozada, Julián; Gomez, Sandra; Vargas, Hernán; Viasus, Diego; Reyes, Luis F","Severiche-Bueno, David Felipe (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Severiche-Bueno, Diego Fernando (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Bastidas, Alirio (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia; Clínica Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Caceres, Eder L (Clínica Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Silva, Edwin (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Lozada, Julián (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Gomez, Sandra (Grupo Laboratorio de Salud Pública de Bogotá, Secretaria de Salud de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia.); Vargas, Hernán (Grupo Laboratorio de Salud Pública de Bogotá, Secretaria de Salud de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia.); Viasus, Diego (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Reyes, Luis F (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia; Clínica Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.

Real-world data of ATLL in Latin America are lacking.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients with ATLL (acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering) encountered in 11 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2019. Treatment response was assessed according to the 2009 consensus report. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.
RESULTS: We identified 253 patients; 226 (lymphomatous: n = 122, acute: n = 73, chronic: n = 26, and smoldering: n = 5) had sufficient data for analysis (median age 57 years). Most patients with ATLL were from Peru (63%), Chile (17%), Argentina (8%), and Colombia (7%). Hypercalcemia was positively associated with acute type (57% v lymphomatous 27%, P = .014). The median survival times (months) were 4.3, 7.9, 21.1, and not reached for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering forms, with 4-year survival rates of 8%, 22%, 40%, and 80%, respectively. First-line zidovudine (AZT)-interferon alfa (IFN) resulted in an overall response rate of 63% (complete response [CR] 24%) for acute. First-line chemotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 41% (CR 29%) for lymphomatous. CR rate was 42% for etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus 12% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone-like regimen (P < .001). Progression-free survival at 1 year for acute type patients treated with AZT-IFN was 67%, whereas 2-year progression-free survival in lymphomatous type patients who achieved CR after chemotherapy was 77%.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms Latin American ATLL presents at a younger age and has a high incidence of lymphomatous type, low incidence of indolent subtypes, and worse survival rates as compared with Japanese patients. In aggressive ATLL, chemotherapy remains the preferred choice for lymphomatous favoring etoposide-based regimen (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), whereas AZT-IFN remains a good first-line option for acute subtype.",,,JCO Global Oncology,,,"Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Argentina; Chile; Colombia; Humans; Latin America; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Lymphoma; Middle Aged; Peru",2021-07-16,2021,2021-07-16,2021-12,7,7,go.21.00084,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malpica, Luis; Enriquez, Daniel J.; Castro, Denisse A.; Peña, Camila; Idrobo, Henry; Fiad, Lorena; Prates, Maria; Otero, Victoria; Biglione, Mirna; Altamirano, Milagros; Sandival-Ampuero, Gustavo; Aviles-Perez, Ursula; Meza, Kelly; Aguirre-Martinez, Laura; Cristaldo, Nancy; Maradei, Juan L.; Guanchiale, Luciana; Soto, Pablo; Viñuela, Jose L.; Cabrera, Maria E.; Paredes, Sally Rose; Riva, Eloisa; Di Stefano, Marcos; Noboa, Andrea; Choque, Juan A.; Candelaria, Myrna; Von Glasenapp, Alana; Valvert, Fabiola; Torres-Viera, Maria A.; Castillo, Jorge J.; Ramos, Juan Carlos; Villela, Luis; Beltran, Brady E.","Malpica, Luis (Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX); Enriquez, Daniel J.

METHOD: a quantitative, exploratory, descriptive and analytical study. Two hundred and eighty-two health professionals participated in the study. For data collection, a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were used. The psychometric sensitivity for the MBI-HSS items was estimated by measures of central tendency, variability and the distribution shape. Internal consistency was estimated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the adequacy of the sample was verified using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index. As indexes for assessing the quality of fit of the model, the chi-square ratio by the degrees of freedom (χ2/DoF), the comparative fit index (CFI), the goodness of fit index (GFI), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were considered. To test data fit, the maximum likelihood method was used.
RESULTS: the three-factor structure of the Maslach Burnout Inventory was confirmed. Items 9, 12, 15 and 16 had a factorial weight below what was considered appropriate and were removed from the model. The second order hierarchical model with the aforementioned modifications presented an adequate adjustment to the data and can be considered the best and most parsimonious model tested according to the information theory indexes. The internal consistency of the instrument's factors was recalculated considering the exclusion of the items and the three factors were considered adequate.
CONCLUSION: the results obtained show that the Maslach Burnout Inventory is a reliable and factorially valid instrument for measuring the burnout syndrome in emergency service professionals in Brazil.",,,Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem,,,"Brazil; Burnout, Professional; Burnout, Psychological; Humans; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",2021,2021,2021,,29,,e3386,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Souza Pereira, Sandra; Fornés-Vives, Joana; Unda-Rojas, Sara Guadalupe; Pereira-Junior, Gerson Alves; Juruena, Mario Francisco; Cardoso, Lucilene","de Souza Pereira, Sandra (Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, Passos, MG, Brazil, Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, Unidade Passos, Passos, MG, Brazil.); Fornés-Vives, Joana (Universitat de les lles Balears, Departamento de Enfermería y Fisioterapia, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain, Universitat de les lles Balears, Departamento de Enfermería y Fisioterapia, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain.); Unda-Rojas, Sara Guadalupe (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Estudios Superiores Zaragoza, Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Estudios Superiores Zaragoza, Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico.); Pereira-Junior, Gerson Alves (Universidade de São Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.); Juruena, Mario Francisco (King’s College London, Department of Psychological Medicine, London, United Kingdom, King’s College London, Department of Psychological Medicine, London, ENG, United Kingdom.); Cardoso, Lucilene (Universidade de São Paulo, Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, Collaborating Centre for Nursing Research Development, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil, Universidade de São Paulo, Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, PAHO/WHO Collaborating Centre for Nursing Research Development, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.)",,"de Souza Pereira, Sandra (Minas Gerais State University); Fornés-Vives, Joana (Universitat de les lles Balears, Departamento de Enfermería y Fisioterapia, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain, Universitat de les lles Balears, Departamento de Enfermería y Fisioterapia, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain.); Unda-Rojas, Sara Guadalupe (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Pereira-Junior, Gerson Alves (Universidade de São Paulo); Juruena, Mario Francisco (King's College London); Cardoso, Lucilene (Universidade de São Paulo)",17,12,1.92,7.14,https://www.scielo.br/j/rlae/a/v9BRMzXSRVhsDKWXP3szbrf/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134557733,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

The San Gregorio Formation, the younger unit of the Urumaco Sequence, preserves a fauna that documents this critical transition. We report stingrays, freshwater bony fishes, amphibians, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, aquatic and terrestrial turtles, and mammals. A total of 49 taxa are reported from the Vergel Member (late Pliocene) and nine taxa from the Cocuiza Member (Early Pleistocene), with 28 and 18 taxa reported for the first time in the Urumaco sequence and Venezuela, respectively. Our findings include the first fossil record of the freshwater fishes Megaleporinus, Schizodon, Amblydoras, Scorpiodoras, and the pipesnake Anilius scytale, all from Pliocene strata. The late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene ages proposed here for the Vergel and Cocuiza members, respectively, are supported by their stratigraphic position, palynology, nannoplankton, and 86Sr/88Sr dating. Mammals from the Vergel Member are associated with the first major pulse of the Great American Biotic Interchange. In contrast to the dry conditions prevailing today, the San Gregorio Formation documents mixed open grassland/forest areas surrounding permanent freshwater systems, following the isolation of the northern South American basin from western Amazonia. These findings support the hypothesis that range contraction of many taxa to their current distribution in northern South America occurred rapidly during at least the last 1.5 million years.","The authors thank all the institutions mentioned in the methods section for their valuable support and access to study fossil and extant comparative collections.

Scarce lagoons associated with salt flats (salars) in this desert are the surface expression of shallow groundwater; these ponds serve as refugia for life and often host microbial communities associated with evaporitic mineral deposition. Results based on multidisciplinary field campaigns and associated laboratory examination of samples collected from the Puquios of the Salar de Llamara in the Atacama Desert during austral summer provide unprecedented detail regarding the spatial heterogeneity of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of these salar environments. Four main lagoons (‘Puquios’) and more than 400 smaller ponds occur within an area less than 5 km2, and are characterized by high variability in electrical conductivity, benthic and planktonic biota, microbiota, lagoon bottom type, and style of mineral deposition. Results suggest that electrical conductivity is a driving force of system heterogeneity. Such spatial heterogeneity within the Puquios is likely to be expanded with temporal observations incorporating expected seasonal changes in electrical conductivity. The complexity of these Andean ecosystems may be key to their ability to persist in extreme environments at the edge of habitability.","The authors are grateful to René Daza, Sara Swaminathan, Blake Cunningham, Nicolas Barroilhet, Kevin Coloma, and Andy White for their support in field work and data organization.

Precoded communications enable full frequency reuse schemes in satellite communications to achieve broader service availability and higher spectrum efficiency than with the conventional four-color and two-color reuse approaches. In this scope, we develop a novel over-the-air test-bed for end-to-end precoding validations. We were able to demonstrate precoded communications over an actual geostationary orbit multi-beam satellite using the DVB-S2X standard-compliant state-of-the-art gateway and user terminals. The developed system is capable of fully end-to-end real-time communications over a satellite link and demonstrates novel channel measurements and channel compensation techniques for differential frequency and phase tracking. It is shown, that by successfully canceling inter-user interference in the actual satellite link, the precoding improves the received SINR and increases the total system goodput in aggressive full frequency reuse scenarios.","Opinions, interpretations, recommendations and conclusions presented in this paper are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the European Space Agency or SES.","This work was supported in part by the European Space Agency through the Live Satellite Demonstration of Advanced Interference Management Techniques (LiveSatPreDem) and SES S.A. under Project 4000122451/18/NL/NR, and in part by the Fond National de la Recherche Luxembourg, through the CORE Project COHESAT: Cognitive Cohesive Networks of Distributed Units for Active and Passive Space Applications, under Grant 11689919.",IEEE Access,,,,2021-03-09,2021,2021-03-09,2023-01-01,11,,41556-41564,All OA; Gold,Article,"Krivochiza, Jevgenij; Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano; Querol, Jorge; Maturo, Nicola; Marrero, Liz Martinez; Andrenacci, Stefano; Krause, Jens; Chatzinotas, Symeon","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Maturo, Nicola (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Marrero, Liz Martinez (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg); Andrenacci, Stefano (SES S.A., 6815, Betzdorf, Luxembourg); Krause, Jens (SES S.A., 6815, Betzdorf, Luxembourg); Chatzinotas, Symeon (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, 1855, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg)","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (University of Luxembourg)","Krivochiza, Jevgenij (University of Luxembourg); Duncan, Juan Carlos Merlano (University of Luxembourg); Querol, Jorge (University of Luxembourg); Maturo, Nicola (University of Luxembourg); Marrero, Liz Martinez (University of Luxembourg); Andrenacci, Stefano (SES (Luxembourg)); Krause, Jens (SES (Luxembourg)); Chatzinotas, Symeon (University of Luxembourg)",16,5,,7.04,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09373415.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136274020,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,

The three worked symbiotically to address the racial injustices of the past. Each tenet is historically explained and ideologically defined. Black Consciousness and Black Nationalism are still prevalent in the South African sociopolitical landscape. This is expressed through the current political parties that are the minorities in the National Assembly. However, the ruling party, African National Congress (ANC), as a ‘broader church’ also possesses some constituents and adherents who are the Black Consciousness and Nationalistic aspirants. South Africa is developing into a peasant society regardless of capitalistic embraces of development. Poverty and equality are visible in societal structures. Those who were formerly equality aspirants are now in sociopolitical and economic circles and had forgotten their aspirations of justice and equality. Corruption, maladministration, bad governance, etc., are the menaces that cause imbalances and create a wider gap between the rich and the poor. Contribution: Black Theology is invited to lead dialogical deliberations to assess and ascertain how to bring justice into the volatile situation where people’s security and safety is uncertain and warped ideologies such as ethnic cleansing are promoted. Black Theology should resort to the theological mandate of speaking for the poor and oppressed and promote the sense of the New Testament spirit of communality.",,,HTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies,,,,2021-07-05,2021,2021-07-05,,77,3,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Resane, Kelebogile T.","Resane, Kelebogile T.

South African learners continue to face challenges in accessing institutions of higher education due to school performance. Therefore, to address this issue, the University of the Free State (UFS) in South Africa introduced UAP in 1993 to assist deserving students who did not meet university admission requirements due to underperformance at the school level. The UAP seemed to address the issue of access to higher education institution(s). However, once students gained access, they have faced several challenges. A Free-Attitude Interview (FAI) technique was used to identify the challenges that students experienced in UAP.

The aim of this article is to expose the problematic effects brought about by the application of these policies, based on a review of the related literature published between 1991 and 2019. After conducting a keyword-based search in various databases, a hermeneutic analysis of 45 works was carried out, and subsequently the emerging trends were established. The results allow pointing out that both Law 30 of 1992 and decrees on salaries, as well as the scarcity of research funds have problematic effects for Colombian public universities. These include the fact that universities must self-manage a part of their resources; that the defunding of institutions increases budget deficits; and, that the implementation of the salary system, which provides economic incentives for academic productivity, has not been accompanied by a counterpart of state resources to increase university budgets or research funds.",,,UNIPLURIVERSIDAD,,,,2021-06-30,2021,2021-06-30,,21,1,1-18,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castelao-Huerta, Isaura","Castelao-Huerta, Isaura (Investigadora independiente)",,"Castelao-Huerta, Isaura (Investigadora independiente)",7,4,,6.87,https://revistas.udea.edu.co/index.php/unip/article/download/342980/20807019,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149906100,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education
194,pub.1138165010,10.3390/joitmc7020134,,,Brand Personality as a Consistency Factor in the Pillars of CSR Management in the New Normal,"During such a complex crisis as the one experienced by humanity since the first quarter of 2020, it is necessary to develop tools that contribute to creating the corporate image for organizations that are currently interested in being identified as brands with high social and environmental commitment. Likewise, elements that contribute to building strong brands during a context that has changed consumption priorities are required. For this reason, this paper aims at adapting the dimension of socially responsible brand personality (SRBP), proposed by Mayorga (2017), taking the situation experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a new context. The objective of this research is to contribute to the management of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by providing, from a communicative perspective, a tool that optimizes the creation of a socially responsible image by the different stakeholders. The results allow us to conclude that there is a structural modification of the brand personality proposed by Mayorga, which can be presumed to be generated by the current environment, and which, therefore, can be established as a pillar of CSR management in the new normal, from a relational point of view. The findings clearly identify the virtue of integrity in brand personality, which is made up of two attributes, which, in turn, are made up of 17 traits that can identify a socially responsible brand.","This paper was possible thanks to the financial and logistical support of the Universidad Privada del Norte and the Universidad Nacional Tecnológica de Lima Sur de Perú, together with the Universidad Autonoma de Occidente de Cali-Colombia.",This research received no external funding.,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",,,,2021-06,2021,,2021-06,7,2,134,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Gordillo, Javier Mayorga","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Department of Humanities, Faculty of Business Studies, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru;; Faculty of Engineering and Management, Professional School of Business Administration, Universidad Nacional Tecnológica de Lima Sur, Lima 15816, Peru); Gordillo, Javier Mayorga (Marketing Department, Management Sciences Faculty, Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, Cali 760030, Colombia)","Gordillo, Javier Mayorga (Universidad Autónoma de Occidente)","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Private University of the North; Universidad Nacional Tecnológica de Lima Sur); Gordillo, Javier Mayorga (Universidad Autónoma de Occidente)",13,7,,6.61,https://www.mdpi.com/2199-8531/7/2/134/pdf?version=1621300538,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138165010,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3506 Marketing; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Food-borne diseases are considered a major public health challenge worldwide due to their incidence, associated mortality, and negative economic repercussions. Food safety is the guarantee that foods will not cause harm to the health of those who consume them, and it is a fundamental property of food quality. Food safety can be at risk of being lost at any stage of the food chain if the food is contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms. Many diverse bacteria are present in the environment and as part of the microbiota of food that can be transmitted to humans during the handling and consumption of food. Plesiomonas shigelloides has been mainly associated with outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases due to the consumption of fish. This bacterium inhabits the environment and aquatic animals and is associated with the microbiota of fish such as tilapia, a fish of importance in fishing, aquaculture, commercialization, and consumption worldwide. The purpose of this document is to provide, through a bibliographic review of databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, among others), a general informative perspective on food-borne diseases and, in particular, the consumption of fish and tilapia.

Translocated orangutans exposed to human diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), pose risks to wild and previously released conspecifics. Wildlife disease risk experts recommended halting great ape translocations during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize risk of disease transmission to wild populations. We collected data on orangutan releases and associated disease risk management in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic, and developed a problem description for orangutan disease and conservation risks. We identified that at least 15 rehabilitated ex-captive and 27 wild captured orangutans were released during the study period. Identified disease risks included several wild-to-wild translocated orangutans in direct contact or proximity to humans without protective equipment, and formerly captive rehabilitated orangutans that have had long periods of contact and potential exposure to human diseases. While translocation practitioners typically employ mitigation measures to decrease disease transmission likelihood, these measures cannot eliminate all risk, and are not consistently applied. COVID-19 and other diseases of human origin can be transmitted to orangutans, which could have catastrophic impacts on wild orangutans, other susceptible fauna, and humans should disease transmission occur. We recommend stakeholders conduct a Disease Risk Analysis for orangutan translocation, and improve pathogen surveillance and mitigation measures to decrease the likelihood of potential outbreaks. We also suggest refocusing conservation efforts on alternatives to wild-to-wild translocation including mitigating human-orangutan interactions, enforcing laws and protecting orangutan habitats to conserve orangutans in situ.","We thank all participating individuals for information on orangutan releases, other conservation activities, and disease risks.

The participants were 1147 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (male: n = 479; female: n = 668) who watched a 12 s animation representing the situation and filled out a questionnaire to analyze the legitimation of violent behaviors and anxiety levels. We registered their decisions to solve the situation using a categorical scale that included assertive, avoidant, aggressive, submissive, and supportive behaviors. Gender was not associated with the adolescent's behaviors in facing a simulated peer aggression situation. However, male teenagers tended to perceive adults as sanctioners and neutrals; those who used the diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization to justify their behavior also showed a higher state of anxiety. Female teenagers who expected legitimation from their peers, presented higher anxiety as well. Educational interventions may use these results, helping adolescents to understand that their acts have substantial implications in the lives of others. It is essential to develop group interventions that modify how adolescents manage their conflicts and change gender stereotypes that significantly impact health.

Improving the nutrient storage capacity of soils or substrates is an effective approach for solving this problem. Humic acids (HA) are excellent soil conditioners. Thus, in the present study, their ability to improve the physico-chemical properties of three substrates with different textures was evaluated. HA treatments included 1% HA root application in three different types of substrates, including pure sand, pure cocopeat, and a mixture of sand:cocopeat (1:1, v/v) and their relative controls. We examined the morphological parameters of cucumber seedlings as well as pH buffering capacity (pHBC), total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and nutrient storage capacity of the three substrates. The results show that HA application improved the morphological parameters of cucumber seedlings (plant height, stem diameter, and biomass) in pure cocopeat and cocopeat-sand mixture treatments. On the contrary, HA addition had harmful effects on the cucumber seedlings cultivated in sand due to the low pHBC of sand. The seedlings cultivated in pure cocopeat showed the best morphological parameter performances among the seedlings grown in the three substrates. Furthermore, pHBC, TOC, OM, and CEC were enhanced by HA application. Incorporation of HA improved ammonium (NH4 +) and potassium (K+) storage capacity while decreasing phosphorus (P) storage. Pure cocopeat had the highest pHBC, TOC, OM, CEC, and nutrient storage capacity among the three substrates. In conclusion, mixing 1% HA into substrates promoted cucumber growth, improved substrate properties, and enhanced fertilizer use efficiency. Pure cocopeat is a suitable substrate for cucumber cultivation, and mixing cocopeat with sand amends the substrate properties and consequently improves plant growth.","We are grateful to Heng Wang, Lin Chai, Peng Liu, and Xue Zhang for their constructive advice on the experiments, Yangfan Song and Cong Wang for the management of greenhouse.

In this study, we identified the use and importance of engagement in social networks such as Facebook (2008 to 2018), Instagram (2012 to 2018) and Twitter (2010 to 2018) since the creation of their official accounts for the main Chilean wineries. The methods used involve qualitative and quantitative approaches that integrate the opinion of a panel of experts to estimate a social media engagement indicator through a descriptive statistical analysis and network analysis, from data originated of 70,856 publications. The results show the upward evolution of engagement, calculated through the interactions seen from users of social networks of the wineries, with users of networks of these wineries leaning towards Facebook in the first place, then Instagram, and Twitter. The contribution of this research lies in the generation of empirical evidence that allows the wine industry in a developing country to enhance its competitive advantage through the correct use of its social networks, the management of its engagement, and the diffusion of new marketing strategies.","The authors thank to Samuel Lutino and Javier Barreda for their collaboration in database construction.

The situation is grim in water-scarce countries, which need to think and act beyond conventional water resources and tap unconventional water supplies to narrow the gap between water demand and supply. Among unconventional water resources, water embedded in fog is increasingly seen as a source of potable water in dry areas where fog is intense and prevalent. Although a low maintenance option and a green technology to supply freshwater, the potential to collect water from air through fog harvesting is by far under-explored. Based on the comprehensive analysis of fog water collection's research history since 1980, this study reveals that recent years have witnessed a sharp increase in research related to technological developments in fog collection systems. Also, there is an increased focus on associated policy and institutional aspects, economics, environmental dimensions, capacity building, community participation, and gender mainstreaming. In addition to research, fog water collection practice has also increased over time with emerging examples worldwide, notably from Canary Islands, Chile, Colombia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Israel, Morocco, Namibia, Oman, Peru, and South Africa. The functional systems of fog water collection demonstrate community engagement, women empowerment, enhanced capacity and training, and active participation of local institutions as the key drivers for effective fog collection systems to provide a sustainable supply of freshwater to the associated communities.","This work is part of the UNU–INWEH&#x27;s project on unconventional water resources.

Likewise, Peru has a high ecological and climate diversity, which makes it the possessor of renewable energy potential, specifically solar and wind power. The rapid growth of tourism is leading to generating prospects for becoming a sustainable destination. In this sense, it is important to understand and evaluate the Peruvian legislative framework for sustainable tourism and the current state of the implementation of the scenarios provided by the governmental entity in terms of sustainability, and its link with tourism activity. Based on what has been described, this study is aimed at evaluating the four most relevant museums in the northern part of Peru; in addition, it contributes to the studies that exist at the intersection of tourism and sustainability in the chains of activities related to tourism and calls for rationality applied to tourism management in this region of Latin America. The results of the literature review of the Peruvian legal framework reveal a lack of specific laws and regulations on sustainable tourism; on the contrary, there are policies in force that contribute to promoting the development of sustainable tourism.

In turn, sleep disorders (SD) may be more frequently reported in uncertain circumstances.
OBJECTIVES: To identify the association between loneliness and severe SD, in women quarantined due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study carried out in women, between 40 and 79 years and living in Colombia. The women were invited through social network to complete 5 digital instruments: de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Menopause Rating Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Five-item Version, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and Francis Religion Scale. Bivariate analysis and adjusted logistic regression between loneliness and SD were performed.
RESULTS: 1133 women participated, half of them under 50 years old. 43.1% had emotional loneliness, 39.9% social loneliness and 43.3% general loneliness. SD were identified in 6 out of 10 women, those with mild SD presented an OR of 1.84, 1.85, and 1.64, for emotional, social and general loneliness, respectively. Loneliness was associated twice with moderate SD, and more than twice with severe SD. Very severe SD reached OR:5.81 for emotional loneliness, OR:4.38 social loneliness and OR:4.02 general loneliness. In the presence of religiosity, fear and anxiety due to COVID-19, statistical significance was retained for associations, except intense SD with general loneliness.
CONCLUSIONS: SD were significantly associated with loneliness in our study population. It is important to assess sleep quality and perception of loneliness in middle-aged women, especially during periods of quarantine due to a pandemic to avoid health implications.","To the Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia, which institutionally supports the Women’s Health Research Group and the CAVIMEC+COVID STUDY (Calidad de Vida en la Menopausia y Etnias Colombianas bajo condición de Pandemia).","Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Primary Care & Community Health,,,Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Wake Disorders,2021-01,2021,2021-06-16,2021-01,12,,21501327211025170,All OA; Gold,Article,"Monterrosa-Castro, Álvaro; Monterrosa-Blanco, Angélica; González-Sequeda, Andrea","Monterrosa-Castro, Álvaro (Grupo de Investigación Salud de la Mujer.

To determine the best treatment, detecting EGFR and KRAS mutations is of interest. However, non-invasive ways to obtain this information are not available. Furthermore, many times there is a lack of big enough relevant public datasets, so the performance of single classifiers is not outstanding. In this paper, an ensemble approach is applied to increase the performance of EGFR and KRAS mutation prediction using a small dataset. A new voting scheme, Selective Class Average Voting (SCAV), is proposed and its performance is assessed both for machine learning models and CNNs. For the EGFR mutation, in the machine learning approach, there was an increase in the sensitivity from 0.66 to 0.75, and an increase in AUC from 0.68 to 0.70. With the deep learning approach, an AUC of 0.846 was obtained, and with SCAV, the accuracy of the model was increased from 0.80 to 0.857. For the KRAS mutation, both in the machine learning models (0.65 to 0.71 AUC) and the deep learning models (0.739 to 0.778 AUC), a significant increase in performance was found.

Although previous studies have shown adequate levels of diagnostic utility to detect severe impairment, it has not shown sensitivity to detect mild decline. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III in a large sample of elderly people through Item Response Theory, due to the lack of studies using this approach. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1164 people from the age of 60 upwards, of which 63 had a prior diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia. The results showed that, globally, the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III possesses adequate psychometrics properties. Furthermore, the information function test shows that the subscales have different sensitivity to different levels of impairment. These results can contribute to determining patterns of cognitive deterioration for the adequate detection of different levels of dementia.

Aim of the Study: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of TP in treating DKD and offer solid evidence for further clinical applications of TP. Materials and Methods: Eight databases (CNKI, VIP, CBM, WanFang, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were electronically searched for eligible studies until October 17, 2020. We selected animal experimental studies using TP versus renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or nonfunctional liquids to treat DKD by following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two researchers independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias tool. Fixed-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Inplasy registration number: INPLASY2020100042. Results: Twenty-six studies were included. Meta-analysis showed that TP significantly reduced albuminuria (14 studies; standardized mean difference SMD: -1.44 [-1.65, -1.23], I2 = 87%), urine albumin/urine creatinine ratio (UACR) (8 studies; SMD: -5.03 [-5.74, -4.33], I2 = 84%), total proteinuria (4 studies; SMD: -3.12 [-3.75, -2.49], I2 = 0%), serum creatinine (18 studies; SMD: -0.30 [-0.49, -0.12], I2 = 76%), and blood urea nitrogen (12 studies; SMD: -0.40 [-0.60, -0.20], I2 value = 55%) in DKD animals, compared to the vehicle control. However, on comparing TP to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in DKD treatment, there was no marked difference in ameliorating albuminuria (3 studies; SMD: -0.35 [-0.72, 0.02], I2 = 41%), serum creatinine (3 studies; SMD: -0.07 [-0.62, 0.48], I2 = 10%), and blood urea nitrogen (2 studies; SMD: -0.35 [-0.97, 0.28], I2 = 0%). Of note, TP exhibited higher capacities in reducing UACR (2 studies; SMD: -0.66 [-1.31, -0.01], I2 = 0%) and total proteinuria (2 studies; SMD: -1.18 [-1.86, -2049], I2 = 0%). Meta-regression implicated that the efficacy of TP in reducing DKD albuminuria was associated with applied dosages. In addition, publication bias has not been detected on attenuating albuminuria between TP and RAS inhibitors after the diagnosis of DKD.

Cogeneration improves fuel utilization by taking advantage of the energy discharged as waste heat in the exhaust gases. This case study assesses the effects of high ambient temperature on the performance of a natural gas-based cogeneration plant in Barranquilla, Colombia, a location with a hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year with an annual average temperature of 27.4 °C. The cogeneration plant encompasses gas and vapor turbine generation, supplementary fire, waste heat recovery, and process heat exchange. Validated ASPENHYSYS® simulation allows comparing gas-turbine-alone indicators with those at ISO conditions, i.e., 15 °C and 101.3 kPa. Ambient temperature reduces gas turbine power output by up to 22% and decreases thermal efficiency by around 0.06% for every °C rise above ISO conditions. Cogeneration with and without supplementary fire increases power output by 17% and 5% compared to gas-turbine-alone operation. The energy utilization factor increases by 27–37% without supplementary fire and above 37% with supplementary fire. Results give insight into the challenges of cogeneration plants in a tropical climate. Further studies should include the effects of high humidity on power plant performance and the potential benefits of cooling inlet air.","The authors acknowledge the support from UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE.

The survival rate was also calculated after challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila. Seven diets containing 32 % crude protein were formulated as follows: control (0 g/kg of EO), 0.625 and 1.25 g/kg of L. sidoides EO; 1.25 and 5.0 g/kg of O. gratissimum EO; 1.25 and 5.0 g/kg of Z. officinale EO, in triplicate. Tambaqui fed diets supplemented with EO of L. sidoides, O. gratissimum, and Z. officinale did not present significant differences in the growth parameters. After 30 and 60 days of feeding, performance and hematological parameters were evaluated. Reductions in total thrombocytes number occurred after 30 days of feeding with 1.25 g/kg and 5.0 g/kg O. gratissimum EO. After 60 days of feeding, fish were challenged with A. hydrophila (1.6 × 108 UFC mL−1) and were observed for 10 days. Fish fed with diets supplemented with L. sidoides EO at 0.625 g/kg and 1.25 g/kg showed a higher nonspecific immune response through the increased respiratory activity of leukocytes after challenge. Additionally, there was a decrease in plasma glucose levels and no alteration of the total protein levels. Moreover, after the challenge, the highest survival rate occurred among fish fed 0.625 g/kg L. sidoides EO, while treatments with O. gratissimum and Z. officinale EO did not affect fish survival. This is the first report of L. sidoides EO in tambaqui diets. More studies are warranted to adjust the concentration and periods of treatment regarding diets supplemented with L. sidoides EO or thymol in treatment of bacterial fish diseases.","The authors thank the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA MP2 02.12.01.020.00.00), National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq nº 485993/2013-9), and Amazon Research Foundation (FAPEAM #PPP 392/2012) for financial support.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with kidney cancer were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to comprise the training group from 2010 to 2017, and the validation group was drawn from our academic medical center. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses explored the statistical relationships between the included variables and BM. Statistically significant risk factors were applied to develop a nomogram. Calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, probability density functions (PDF), and clinical utility curves (CUC) were used to verify the predictive performance. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves demonstrated survival differences between two subgroups of kidney cancer with and without BMs. A convenient web calculator was provided for users via ""shiny"" package.
RESULTS: A total of 43,503 patients were recruited in this study, of which 42,650 were training group cases and 853 validation group cases. The variables included in the nomogram were sex, pathological grade, T-stage, N-stage, sequence number, brain metastases, liver metastasis, pulmonary metastasis, histological type, primary site, and laterality. The calibration plots confirmed good agreement between the prediction model and the actual results.

174,pub.1137881742,10.3389/fmars.2021.645738,,,Born With Bristles: New Insights on the Kölliker’s Organs of Octopus Skin,"The entire skin surface of octopus embryos, hatchlings and juveniles bears scattered tufts of tiny chitinous setae within small pockets, from which they can be everted and retracted. Known as Kölliker’s organs (KO), they disappear before the subadult stage. The function of these structures during the early life of the octopus is unknown, despite having been first described nearly two centuries ago. To investigate these organs further, general trends in size of KO distribution and density were analyzed in hatchlings and juveniles of 17 octopod species from all oceans, representing holobenthic, holopelagic and meropelagic modes of life. The size of the KO is fairly constant across species, unrelated to mode of life or hatchling size. The density of KO is similar on ventral and dorsal body surfaces, but hatchlings of smaller size tend to have a higher density of KO on the aboral surface of the arms. Analysis of a series of post-hatching Octopus vulgaris shows KO size to be constant throughout ontogeny; it is therefore a consistent structure during the octopus early life from planktonic hatchling to benthic juvenile. New KO are generated on the skin of the arm tips during the planktonic period and initial benthic lives of juveniles. Their density, on both the mantle and arms, gradually decreases as the octopus grows. In older benthic juveniles, the KO degrades, losing its setae and the base of its follicle becomes exposed as a nearly circular stump of muscle. It is estimated that fully everted KO increase the body surface area by around two-thirds compared to when the KO are retracted. This modular mechanism of body surface extension and roughness probably influences flow-related forces such as drag and propulsion of the moving surface of the young octopus while it is of small size with a relatively large surface area. In addition, the distribution of these organs on the aboral surface of the arms of the octopus and their birefringent properties suggest a role in camouflage. Further research is needed to test these hypotheses of KO function in live animals.","RV is very grateful to the valuable help and expertise of Mr. Jose Manuel Fortuño (Institut de Ciències del Mar, Barcelona) and Mrs. Géraldine Toutirais (Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris), responsible for the SEM services where many images were obtained.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with different adipo- and immuno-modulatory capacities on metabolic and immunological parameters and intestinal composition microbiota in high-fat-diet-induced in mice fed a high-fat diet Methods: Balb/c weaning male mice were fed a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with or without supplementation with Limosilactobacillus fermentum CRL1446 (CRL1446), Lactococcus lactis CRL1434 (CRL1434), or Lacticaseibacillus casei CRL431 (CRL431) for 45 days. Biochemical and immunological parameters, white-adipose tissue histology, gut microbiota composition, and ex vivo cellular functionality (adipocytes and macrophages) were evaluated in SD and HFD mice. Results: CRL1446 and CRL1434 administration, unlike CRL431, induced significant changes in the body and adipose tissue weights and the size of adipocytes. Also, these strains caused a decrease in plasmatic glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, TNF-α, IL-6 levels, and an increase of IL-10. The CRL1446 and CRL1434 obese adipocyte in ex vivo functionality assays showed, after LPS stimulus, a reduction in leptin secretion compared to obese control, while with CRL431, no change was observed. In macrophages from obese mice fed with CRL1446 and CRL1434, after LPS stimulus, lower levels of MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6 compared to obese control were observed. In contrast, CRL431 did not induce modification of cytokine values. Regarding gut microbiota, all strain administration caused a decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes index and diversity. As well as, related to genus results, all strains increased, mainly the genera Alistipes, Dorea, Barnesiella, and Clostridium XIVa. CRL1446 induced a higher increase in the Lactobacillus genus during the study period. Conclusions: The tested probiotic strains differentially modulated the intestinal microbiota and metabolic/immunological parameters in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. These results suggest that CRL1446 and CRL1434 strains could be used as adjuvant probiotics strains for nutritional treatment to obesity and overweight. At the same time, the CRL431 strain could be more beneficial in pathologies that require regulation of the immune system.",We sincerely thank Jose Luis Alvarado for his technical assistance in animal care and Lic.

This simple exact solution has been widely utilised in modeling dissipative collapse with the most notable result being prediction of the avoidance of the horizon as the collapse proceeds. We study the dynamics of dissipative collapse arising from the general solution obtained via the method of symmetries and of the singularity analysis.

Hence, we aimed to uncover the role of As in shaping bacterial composition, structure, and functional potential in five different sites in this altiplanic wetland using a shotgun metagenomic approach. The sites exhibit wide gradients of As (9 to 321 mg/kg), and our results showed highly diverse communities and a clear dominance exerted by the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla. Functional potential analyses show broadly convergent patterns, contrasting with their great taxonomic variability. As-related metabolism, as well as other functional categories such as those related to the CH4 and S cycles, differs among the five communities. Particularly, we found that the distribution and abundance of As-related genes increase as the As concentration rises. Approximately 75% of the detected genes for As metabolism belong to expulsion mechanisms; arsJ and arsP pumps are related to sites with higher As concentrations and are present almost exclusively in Proteobacteria. Furthermore, taxonomic diversity and functional potential are reflected in the 12 reconstructed high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the Bacteroidetes (5), Proteobacteria (5), Cyanobacteria (1), and Gemmatimonadetes (1) phyla. We conclude that SH microbial communities are diverse and possess a broad genetic repertoire to thrive under extreme conditions, including increasing concentrations of highly toxic As. Finally, this environment represents a reservoir of unknown and undescribed microorganisms, with great metabolic versatility, which needs further study. IMPORTANCE As microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments are fundamental for maintaining ecosystems, many studies concerning composition, functionality, and interactions have been carried out. However, much is still unknown. Here, we sampled microbial communities in the Salar de Huasco, an extreme environment subjected to several abiotic stresses (high UV radiation, salinity and arsenic; low pressure and temperatures). We found that although microbes are taxonomically diverse, functional potential seems to have an important degree of convergence, suggesting high levels of adaptation. Particularly, arsenic metabolism showed differences associated with increasing concentrations of the metalloid throughout the area, and it effectively exerts a significant pressure over these organisms. Thus, the significance of this research is that we describe highly specialized communities thriving in little-explored environments subjected to several pressures, considered analogous of early Earth and other planets, that have the potential for unraveling technologies to face the repercussions of climate change in many areas of interest.","We thank the illustrator Florence Gutzwiller (IG: @spideryscrawl) for the SH landscape painting (https://spideryscrawl-illustration.webnode.com/).

A homogenous earthquake catalog for Northeast India region was compiled using derived regional and global empirical relationships between different magnitudes and moment magnitude based on an improved error-corrected methodology suggested in the recent literature. To convert smaller magnitude earthquakes, global empirical equations were derived and used. A procedure is suggested to change different magnitudes into moment magnitude. A homogenous earthquake catalog of 9845 events was compiled for the time period 1897–2012. Entire magnitude range (EMR) was found to be the most reasonable method for estimating magnitude of completeness. Derived local and global empirical equations are useful for every seismic hazard or seismicity study. A complete and consistent homogenized earthquake catalog prepared in this study could provide good data for studying earthquake distribution in Northeast India. By carefully converting these original magnitudes into homogenized Mw magnitudes, an obstacle is removed for the consistent assessment of seismic hazards in Northeast India.","This research was supported by CORFO ING203016EN12-Grant, FONDECYT Grant 11200618 and CONICYT/FONDAP grant 15100017.

This book first investigates the national contexts and development of education in the BRICS countries, arguing that this grouping represents a valuable but yet overlooked field for illuminating South African education issues with international perspectives. The book consists of chapters arguing for and illustrating this thesis from a variety of angles. Common to all chapters is that authors used the comparative method in education, that is comparing the national education system, in their education societal context interrelationships, of the BRICS countries.  The chapters focus on a number of critical issues in South African education, including the language of learning and teaching issue, the alignment of the world of education with the world of work, early childhood education, and the development of world-class universities. Regarding the last, for example, China has been the terrain of the most intensive national projects of establishing world-class universities, with Project 985, Project 211, and the 'Double First Class University' project.  The chapters demonstrate what South Africa, in approaching her education issues, can learn from the experience of the BRICS countries.",,,BRICS Education,Critical Issues in South African Education: Illumination from international comparative perspectives from the BRICS countries,Charl C.

The ARGs have been regarded as a contaminant of serious environmental threats on a global scale. The constant increase in aquaculture production has led to extensive use of antibiotics as a means to prevent and treat bacterial infections; there is a universal concern about the environmental risk of ARGs in the aquaculture environment. In this study, a survey was conducted to evaluate the abundance and distributions of 10 ARGs, bacterial community, and environmental factors in sediment samples from aquatic farms distributed in Anhui (AP1, AP2, and AP3), Fujian (FP1, FP2, and FP3), Guangxi (GP1, GP2, and GP3), Hainan (HP1, HP2, and HP3), and Shaanxi (SP1, SP2, and SP3) Province in China. The results showed that the relative abundance of total ARGs was higher in AP1, AP2, AP3, FP3, GP3, HP1, HP2, and HP3 than that in FP1, FP2, GP1, GP2, SP1, SP2, and SP3. The sul1 and tetW genes of all sediment samples had the highest abundance. The class 1 integron (intl1) was detected in all samples, and the result of Pearson correlation analysis showed that the intl1 has a positive correlation with the sul1, sul2, sul3, bla OXA, qnrS, tetM, tetQ, and tetW genes. Correlation analysis of the bacterial community diversity and environmental factors showed that the Ca2+ concentration has a negative correlation with richness and diversity of the bacterial community in these samples. Of the identified bacterial community, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidota were the predominant phyla in these samples. Redundancy analysis showed that environmental factors (TN, TP, Cl-, and Ca2+) have a positive correlation with the bacterial community (AP1, GP1, GP2, GP3, SP1, SP2, and SP3), and the abundance of ARGs (sul1, tetW, qnrS, and intl1) has a positive correlation with the bacterial community (AP2, AP3, HP1, HP2, and HP3). Based on the network analysis, the ARGs (sul1, sul2, bla CMY, bla OXA, qnrS, tetW, tetQ, tetM, and intl1) were found to co-occur with bacterial taxa from the phyla Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Halobacterota, and Proteobacteria. In conclusion, this study provides an important reference for understanding the environmental risk associated with aquaculture activities in China.",,Funding.

Methods: Obtaining the expression of apoptosis-related genes and associated clinical parameters from online datasets (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA), their biological function analyses were performed through differently expressed genes. By means of LASSO, unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analyses, this predictive signature was constructed and validated by internal and external databases (both TCGA and ArrayExpress). Results: A total of nine apoptosis-related genes (SLC27A2, TNFAIP2, IFI44, CSF2, IL4, MDK, DOCK8, WNT5A, APP) were ultimately screened as associated hub genes and utilized to construct a prognosis model. Then our constructed riskScore model significantly passed the validation in both the internal and external datasets of OS (all p < 0.05) and verified their expressions by qRT-PCR. Moreover, we conducted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), finding the area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were all above 0.70 which indicated that riskScore was a stable independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05). Furthermore, prognostic nomograms were established to figure out the relationship between 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and individual parameters for ccRCC patients. Additionally, survival analyses indicated that our riskScore worked well in predicting OS in subgroups of age, gender, grade, stage, T, M, N0, White (all p < 0.05), except for African, Asian and N1 (p > 0.05). We also explored its association with immune infiltration and applied cMap database to seek out highly correlated small molecule drugs. Conclusion: Our study successfully constructed a prognostic model containing nine hub apoptosis-related genes for ccRCC, helping clinicians predict patients' OS and making the prognostic assessment more standardized. Future prospective studies are required to validate our findings.",We would like to thank the researchers and study participants for their contributions.,This article was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 81771571) and the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province: 2020Z071.,Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,,,2021-03-04,2021,2021-03-04,,8,,567730,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Yi; Chen, Yinhao; Zhu, Bingye; Ma, Limin; Xing, Qianwei","Wang, Yi (Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China.); Chen, Yinhao (Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China.); Zhu, Bingye (Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China.); Ma, Limin (Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China.); Xing, Qianwei (Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, China.)","Ma, Limin (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University); Xing, Qianwei (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University)","Wang, Yi (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University); Chen, Yinhao (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University); Zhu, Bingye (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University); Ma, Limin (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University); Xing, Qianwei (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University)",17,4,1.37,5.32,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2021.567730/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135908478,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

It is imperative to understand the best available evidence concerning which public health interventions reduce morbidity, mortality and health inequalities in children aged under five years. To address this gap, we carried out an umbrella review (a systematic reviews of reviews) to identify evidence on the effects of public health interventions (promotion, protection, prevention) on morbidity, mortality and/or health inequalities due to infectious diseases amongst children in LMICs. Ten databases were searched for records published between 2014-2021 alongside a manual search of gray literature. Articles were quality-assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2). A narrative synthesis was conducted. We identified 60 systematic reviews synthesizing 453 individual primary studies. A majority of the reviews reported on preventive interventions (n = 48), with a minority on promotion (n = 17) and almost no reviews covering health protection interventions (n = 2). Effective interventions for improving child health across the whole population, as well as the most disadvantaged included communication, education and social mobilization for specific preventive services or tools, such as immunization or bed nets. For all other interventions, the effects were either unclear, unknown or detrimental, either at the overall population level or regarding health inequalities. We found few reviews reporting health inequalities information and the quality of the evidence base was generally low. Our umbrella review identified some prevention interventions that might be useful in reducing under five mortality from infectious diseases in LMICs, particularly amongst the most disadvantaged groups.","AT and CB&#x27;s contributions were supported by the Norwegian Research Council BEDREHELSE work programme (CHAIN: Centre for Global Health Inequalities Research, project number 288638, https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/about-the-research-council/programmes/bedrehelse/).

What does a ""good"" choral music performance sound like? Is there an objective standard of performance excellence, or is beauty in the eye of the beholder? In teacher preparation programs, choral directors in the United States have been taught to identify and teach particular, culturally-bounded standards of choral tone in their students. Choral directors evaluate their students' voices along two dimensions: health and appropriateness. They discern and describe whether the student's musical instrument-their voice-is producing sound in a healthy and non-damaging way. They also judge whether the style of their sound is appropriate for the music they are singing. However, teacher preparation programs do not provide common standards or lexicon for describing tone. This may increase implicit bias of individual directors, and inadvertently exacerbate ethnocentrism and harm students' self-perception. Using a computational text analysis approach, we evaluate the content of open-ended survey responses from teachers, finding that the language used to describe and rate choral performance varies by experience, and by the choral selection (e.g., whether it is a traditional Western or non-Western song). We suggest that regularizing the terminology and providing common training through professional organizations can minimize potential bias and generate more systematic, precise use of qualitative descriptors of health and appropriateness, which will benefit students and teachers.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Qian-Jie Fu,Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Singing; Teaching; United States; Voice Quality,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,,16,12,e0256587,All OA; Gold,Article,"Frizzell, Emily Y.; Windsor, Leah Cathryn","Frizzell, Emily Y.

State of the Art Review","The use of renewable energy sources, especially wind energy, has been widely developed, mostly during the last decade. The main objective of the present study is to conduct a literature review focused on the evaluation under uncertainty of wind energy investment using the real options approach to find out whether public opposition (NIMBY projects) has been contemplated, and if so, what have been the flexible strategies applied for its intervention. Overall, 97 publications were analyzed, identifying 20 different models or approaches, which were grouped into eight categories: 1. Real options, 2. Optimization, 3. Stochastics, 4. Financial evaluation, 5. Probabilistic, 6. Estimation, 7. Numerical prediction, and 8. Others. The real options approach, present in 32% of the studies, was the most popular. Twenty-eight types of uncertainties were identified, which were grouped, for better analysis, into nine categories. In total, 62.5% of the studies included the price of electricity as a source of uncertainty; 18.8%, the velocity of wind; and 15.6%, the feed-in rates-subsidy. Both random and non-random techniques were applied to assess the real options and to model the uncertainties. When evaluating real options, the Monte Carlo simulation technique was the most preferred, with 16 (51.6%) applications, followed by non-randomized techniques, decision tree, and dynamic programming, with eight (25.8%) applications each. There is a marked tendency to use stochastic processes to model uncertainty, particularly geometric Brownian motion, which was used in 61.3% (19) of the studies in the sample. When searching for “real options AND (nimby OR public opposition)”, no study was found, which shows the possibility of developing research on this aspect to determine its impact on investments in wind energy projects.",,"This research was funded by the departmento de La Guajira-Colombia, through the project: Master’s and Doctoral Studies inside and outside the Country for Professionals in the departamento de La Guajira- BPIN 2013000100032, with resources of Direct Allocation of Royalties, granted through the agreement of Condonable Educational Credit PFAN 019 of 2015, executed by the “Universidad de La Guajira”; and the “Universidad del Norte”.",Applied Sciences,,,,2021-10-31,2021,2021-10-31,,11,21,10213,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murgas, Benjamin; Henao, Alvin; Guzman, Luceny","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.)); Guzman, Luceny (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.))","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia)","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte; Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.)); Guzman, Luceny (Universidad del Norte; Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.))",9,9,,5.27,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/21/10213/pdf?version=1635928759,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143006869,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 40 Engineering",13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Method: A case study was carried out with two participants, from different socioeconomic contexts and universities. The instruments were validated using the Dephi method for greater reliability and confidence in the data.   Results: It was found that there were discrepancies in the perception of the participants about the service provided by the universities. There were also differences in the perception of the way they received classes, access to them due to connectivity and the electronic equipment they had. For student 2, a resident of a neighborhood classified as stratum five, learning Integral Calculus in times of pandemic was a space to promote autonomy and self-study of a complex subject like this. In the case of student 1, a resident of a neighborhood classified as stratum one, there was the perception that learning was limited, there was demotivation and criticism of the e-learning modality in learning subjects related to mathematics. Discussion and Conclusion: It was concluded that the socioeconomic stratum of the students and the availability of resources both by them and by the university where they study, influenced the perceptions of virtual classes.",,,Educación y Humanismo,,,,2021-04-08,2021,2021-04-08,,23,40,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Conde-Carmona, Robinson; Escorcia, Iván Andrés Padilla","Conde-Carmona, Robinson (Universidad del AtlÃ¡ntico); Escorcia, Iván Andrés Padilla (Universidad del Norte)",,"Conde-Carmona, Robinson (Universidad del AtlÃ¡ntico); Escorcia, Iván Andrés Padilla (Universidad del Norte)",6,1,,5.22,https://doi.org/10.17081/eduhum.23.40.4380,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137030024,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,

Even though the benefits of the DE paradigm have been known for years, there is a large gap between the state of practice and the state of the art, particularly in Global South countries (but also in many industrialized nations). We use a SP dataset considering two new transport alternatives (train and metro) and a RP dataset based on a large mobility survey in Bogotá, Colombia, complemented with fairly precise level-of-service data obtained using GIS utilities and the Distance Matrix API by Google.

METHODS: An observational descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. After applying the selection criteria, 315 clinical records were recovered. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used, reporting proportions, means and standard deviations.
RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 45.23 years old and 63.8% of them were females. Patients were mostly referred by retina specialists, general ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, and cornea specialists. Meantime between the first ocular symptom and uveitis specialist evaluation was 2.08 years. Patients had been previously evaluated by a mean of 1.9 ophthalmologists. In 79.9% of patients, inflammation was recognized by the remittent; however, only 4.7% of patients were correctly graded according to SUN classification. At first time consultation with the uvea specialist, 52.1% of the patients arrived with an adequate infectious panel, 58.1% with an adequate rheumatologic panel, 11.6% with aqueous humor PCR study, 65.1% with an initial etiological diagnosis, 34.9% with inadequate topical treatment, and 59.6% with inadequate systemic treatment. The mean time to reach a diagnosis by the uvea specialist was 5.27 weeks (0.10 years). A diagnostic coincidence was not reached in 58.7% of the cases.
CONCLUSION: The referral process to uveitis specialists is complex but highly relevant for those who suffer from this pathology. Health professionals must be aware of the standardized classification of the disease, the appropriate treatment according to the classification, and early referral to the uveologist with adequate laboratory tests.","We thank Universidad del Rosario for their help, guidance, and financial support.

In the former, conciliation is the most developed alternative dispute resolution mechanism, while in the latter, mediation is the most developed. In order to deepen this comparison, a qualitative research of interpretative nature has been developed with the support of bibliographic-documentary material. The main conclusion is that access to justice is a human right that has been positivized as a fundamental right in the constitutions of both Colombia and Russia. However, the Colombian Constitution allows individuals to exercise their jurisdictional functions on a temporary basis, unlike the Russian Constitution, which only authorizes judges from the Federation to exercise their jurisdictional functions. While conciliation in Colombia is developed and implemented through State-supervised Conciliation and Arbitration Centers, mediation in Russia is in its initial phase and has gradually gained acceptance in society. In both states, the implementation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms has been driven by the need to decongest the courts and tribunals of ordinary justice. Therefore, it is useful to insist on the massive use of these instruments to make possible a justice that comes from the parties in conflict, that can repair the relations of the subjects in dispute and that tends towards the construction of more peaceful societies.",,,Justicia,,,,2021-10-06,2021,2021-10-06,,26,40,128-142,All OA; Gold,Article,"López, Milton Arrieta; Godoy, Abel Meza; Afanasiev, Ilya Vladimirovich; Sekerin, Vladimir Dmitriyevich; Noli, Sara","López, Milton Arrieta (Universidad de la Costa, Colombia); Godoy, Abel Meza (Universidad de la Costa); Afanasiev, Ilya Vladimirovich (Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation); Sekerin, Vladimir Dmitriyevich (Moscow Polytechnic University); Noli, Sara (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"López, Milton Arrieta (University of the Coast); Godoy, Abel Meza (University of the Coast); Afanasiev, Ilya Vladimirovich (Financial University); Sekerin, Vladimir Dmitriyevich (Moscow Polytechnic University); Noli, Sara (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,5.11,https://revistas.unisimon.edu.co/index.php/justicia/article/download/4773/5298,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142250352,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This paper presents a highly automated, novel method to enhance the accuracy of utility distribution feeder models to capture their performance by matching simulation results with corresponding field measurements. The method is demonstrated using an actual feeder from an electrical utility with high penetration of DERs. The method proposed uses advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) voltage and derived active power measurements at the customer level, and data acquisition systems (DAS) measurements at the feeder-head, in conjunction with an AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) to estimate customer active and reactive power consumption over a time horizon, while accounting for unmetered loads. The ACOPF uses the measured voltage magnitudes, derived active power measurements, and the feeder head measurements to obtain a complete active power and reactive power capture of the feeder loads. Additionally, the method proposed estimates both voltage magnitude and angle for each phase at the unbalanced distribution substation. The accuracy of the method developed is verified in two stages: by comparing the time-series power flow results obtained from the enhancement algorithm with OpenDSS results and with the field measurements available. The proposed approach seamlessly manages the data available from the optimization procedure through the final model verification automatically.","This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy under Award DE-AR0001001 and in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, Solar Energy Technologies Office, under Award DE-EE0008773.",,IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy,,,,2021-11-08,2021,2021-11-08,2022-01-01,9,,2-15,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montano-Martinez, Karen; Thakar, Sushrut; Ma, Shanshan; Soltani, Zahra; Vittal, Vijay; Khorsand, Mojdeh; Ayyanar, Rajapandian; Rojas, Cynthia","Montano-Martinez, Karen (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Thakar, Sushrut (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Ma, Shanshan (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Soltani, Zahra (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Vittal, Vijay (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Khorsand, Mojdeh (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Ayyanar, Rajapandian (School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA); Rojas, Cynthia (Arizona Public Service, Phoenix, AZ, 85072, USA)","Vittal, Vijay (Arizona State University)","Montano-Martinez, Karen (Arizona State University); Thakar, Sushrut (Arizona State University); Ma, Shanshan (Arizona State University); Soltani, Zahra (Arizona State University); Vittal, Vijay (Arizona State University); Khorsand, Mojdeh (Arizona State University); Ayyanar, Rajapandian (Arizona State University); Rojas, Cynthia (Arizona Public Service, Phoenix, AZ, 85072, USA)",15,11,,5.07,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8784343/9662292/09606764.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142522889,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

The stigma is a relevant barrier to diabetes management. However, evidence in this regard is scarce in Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the level of stigma surrounding type 2 diabetes in the Colombian population and its relationships with sociodemographic, clinical, psychosocial variables and behaviors related to management of the disease (self-management behaviors). This cross-sectional study included 501 Colombian adults with type 2 diabetes. We estimated the relation between stigma and selected variables through linear regression models. Additionally, we analyzed the mediator role of psychosocial variables in the relationship between stigma and self-management behaviors through structural equation models. A total of 16.4% of patients showed concerning levels of stigma. The time elapsed since diagnosis (β = -0.23) and socioeconomic status (β = -0.13) were significant predictors of the level of stigma. Stigma was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (β = -0.36), self-esteem (β = -0.37), and relationship with health care provider (β = -0.46), and positively correlated with stress (β = 0.23). Self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the relationships with health care providers had a mediation role in the relationship between stigma and self-management behaviors. These variables would be part of the mechanisms through which the perception of stigma harms self-management behaviors.

After drifting for several weeks in the ocean, the post-larval glaucothoes settle in the shallow subtidal zone, undergo metamorphosis, and the early juveniles then subsequently make their way to land where they undergo further physiological changes that prevent them from ever entering the sea again. Here, we sequenced, assembled and analyzed the coconut crab genome to shed light on its adaptation to terrestrial life. For comparison, we also assembled the genomes of the long-tailed marine-living ornate spiny lobster, Panulirus ornatus, and the short-tailed marine-living red king crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus. Our selection of the latter two organisms furthermore allowed us to explore parallel evolution of the crab-like form in anomurans.ResultsAll three assembled genomes are large, repeat-rich and AT-rich. Functional analysis reveals that the coconut crab has undergone proliferation of genes involved in the visual, respiratory, olfactory and cytoskeletal systems. Given that the coconut crab has atypical mitochondrial DNA compared to other anomurans, we argue that an abundance of kif22 and other significantly proliferated genes annotated with mitochondrial and microtubule functions, point to unique mechanisms involved in providing cellular energy via nuclear protein-coding genes supplementing mitochondrial and microtubule function. We furthermore detected in the coconut crab a significantly proliferated HOX gene, caudal, that has been associated with posterior development in Drosophila, but we could not definitively associate this gene with carcinization in the Anomura since it is also significantly proliferated in the ornate spiny lobster. However, a cuticle-associated coatomer gene, gammacop, that is significantly proliferated in the coconut crab, may play a role in hardening of the adult coconut crab abdomen in order to mitigate desiccation in terrestrial environments.ConclusionThe abundance of genomic features in the three assembled genomes serve as a source of hypotheses for future studies of anomuran environmental adaptations such as shell-utilization, perception of visual and olfactory cues in terrestrial environments, and cuticle sclerotization. We hypothesize that the coconut crab exhibits gene proliferation in lieu of alternative splicing as a terrestrial adaptation mechanism and propose life-stage transcriptomic assays to test this hypothesis.",We would like to thank Zachary Y.H.

For open FLRW metric late-time attractors are a matter dominated FLRW universe and Milne solution. With this approach, oscillations entering nonlinear system through Klein–Gordon (KG) equation can be controlled and smoothed out as the Hubble factor H – acting as a time-dependent perturbation parameter – tends monotonically to zero.

Thus far, only two cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) associated with hypereosinophilia have been reported. In this paper, we present a case of paraneoplastic hypereosinophilia associated with renal cell carcinoma and a review of the reported cases of hypereosinophilia in solid tumors.
METHODS: The review is based on an electronic literature search performed in the PubMed database in September 2020 with the following key terms: eosinophilia & neoplasm; eosinophilia & cancer; eosinophilia & paraneoplastic syndrome. Papers were included based on screening the titles and/or abstracts. We also included the case of our patient in the analysis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old Caucasian female patient with recurrent CCRCC was admitted to our Clinic for exacerbating dyspnea and chest and right upper abdominal pain, accompanied by confusion. Preliminary blood tests showed an increased white blood cell count of 40,770/μl, and an increased eosinophil count of 6,530/μl indicating eosinophilia. Several tests were carried out to rule out the noncancer causes of hypereosinophilia. The temporal appearance of eosinophilia and the recurrence of CCRCC without any other apparent potential causes led to the diagnosis of paraneoplastic hypereosinophilia. Despite treating with high doses of corticosteroids, only a transient decrement in eosinophil count was observed along with further deterioration of the patient's condition. The patient succumbed to the disease 6 months following the tumor surgery and 2 months after the diagnosis of hypereosinophilia and tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Our observations are in agreement with the majority of reports showing that the occurrence of eosinophilia following tumor resection may indicate a poor prognosis, tumor recurrence, and rapid disease progression.",,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-03-24,2021,2021-03-24,,11,,639395,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zalewska, Ewa; Obołończyk, Łukasz; Sworczak, Krzysztof","Zalewska, Ewa (Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.); Obołończyk, Łukasz (Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.); Sworczak, Krzysztof (Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.)","Zalewska, Ewa (Medical University of Gdańsk)","Zalewska, Ewa (Medical University of Gdańsk); Obołończyk, Łukasz (Medical University of Gdańsk); Sworczak, Krzysztof (Medical University of Gdańsk)",11,9,0.66,4.96,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.639395/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136618446,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

In this context, purinergic signaling emerges as a promising pathway for intervention due to its known role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. In this work, we explored in more detail the role of purinergic signaling in GC with several experimental approaches. First, we measured extracellular ATP concentrations on GC-derived cell lines (AGS, MKN-45, and MKN-74), finding higher levels of extracellular ATP than those obtained for the non-tumoral gastric cell line GES-1. Next, we established the P2Y2 and P2X4 receptors (P2Y2R and P2X4R) expression profile on these cells and evaluated their role on cell proliferation and migration after applying overexpression and knockdown strategies. In general, a P2Y2R overexpression and P2X4R downregulation pattern were observed on GC cell lines, and when these patterns were modified, concomitant changes in cell viability were observed. These modifications on gene expression also modified transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), showing that higher P2Y2R levels decreased TEER, and high P2X4R expression had the opposite effect, suggesting that P2Y2R and P2X4R activation could promote and suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively. These effects were confirmed after treating AGS cells with UTP, a P2Y2R-agonist that modified the expression patterns towards mesenchymal markers. To further characterize the effects of P2Y2R activation on EMT, we used cDNA microarrays and observed that UTP induced important transcriptional changes on several cell processes like cell proliferation induction, apoptosis inhibition, cell differentiation induction, and cell adhesion reduction. These results suggest that purinergic signaling plays a complex role in GC pathophysiology, and changes in purinergic balance can trigger tumorigenesis in non-tumoral gastric cells.","We are grateful with the Unidad de Microarreglos del Laboratorio Nacional de Apoyo a las Ciencias Genómicas from Instituto de Fisiología Celular-UNAM-México, to Adriana Gonzalez Gallardo for its technical assistance and to Hervis Galleguillos (UCN) for his technical assistance.","Our work was funded by FONDECYT Regular Grant 1161490, FONDEQUIP EQM140100, PAPIIT-UNAM-México IN202620, Intramural grant N° 20210401007 “Núcleo para el estudio del cáncer a nivel básico, aplicado y clínico”, VRIDT, UCN and Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain.

During routine parasitological surveys in the Vaal River system, adult trematodes were collected from the intestine of smallmouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus aeneus (Burchell). The trematodes were confirmed to represent a member of Allocreadium and did not match any existing taxon. Therefore, they are described as a new species, Allocreadium apokryfi sp. n. The morphology of the new species most closely resembles that of Allocreadium aswanense El-Naffar, Saoud et Hassan, 1984, but it differs from it by having a bipartite internal seminal vesicle, wider eggs, a shorter intertesticular distance, an intestinal bifurcation at the ventral sucker level, a ventral sucker that is larger than the oral sucker, and a genital pore near the intestinal bifurcation or the ventral sucker. The surface topology of the new species is notably different from that of other allocreadiids. Papillae were observed in the ventral sucker and surrounding both ventral and oral suckers, but the number and arrangement of the latter were not consistent among specimens. The protruding cirrus of A. apokryfi sp. n. was described using SEM and is the first such observation for the genus. Genetic characterisation showed that the new species was clearly distinct from other Allocreadium spp. using both 18S (nucleotide difference 1.3-9.1%) and 28S (4.7-6.5%) rDNA, forming a well-supported clade in Allocreadium. The presence of A. apokryfi sp. n. in a well-studied river is unexpected, and considering the diet of its host and the scarcity of Allocreadium in Africa, the possible biology of this species is discussed herein.",,,Folia Parasitologica,,,Animals; Biological Evolution; Cyprinidae; Fish Diseases; Host-Parasite Interactions; Life History Traits; Prevalence; South Africa; Trematoda; Trematode Infections,2021-05-25,2021,2021-05-25,,68,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dos Santos, Quinton M; Gilbert, Beric M; Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie; Dumbo, Jose C","Dos Santos, Quinton M (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Gilbert, Beric M (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Spectrum Analytical Facility, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Dumbo, Jose C (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Department of Biological Sciences, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.)",,"Dos Santos, Quinton M (University of Johannesburg); Gilbert, Beric M (University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg); Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie (University of Johannesburg); Dumbo, Jose C (University of Johannesburg; Eduardo Mondlane University)",9,5,1.63,4.92,http://folia.paru.cas.cz/doi/10.14411/fp.2021.013.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138342994,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",

Continuous records of these phenomena are lacking through the Andean region; intense precipitations, sudden snowmelt, increased temperatures on high relief mountain areas, and permafrost degradation are related to violent flow discharges. Documented catastrophic consequences related to these geoclimatic events highlight the need to improve their understanding in order to prepare the Andean communities for this latent danger. An amplified impact is expected not only due to environmental changes potentially linked to climate change but also due to rising exposure linked to urban expansion toward more susceptible or unstable areas. This review highlights as well the need for the implementation of preventive measures to reduce the negative impacts and vulnerability of the Andean communities in the global warming context.","We are grateful to Sr Espejo (Uspallata locality, Argentina) and the Dirección Nacional de Vialidad for providing the historical records of the events documented in the Mendoza valley.","This research was funded by the project 06/ A 711–of the SIIP Secretaría de Investigación, internacionales y postgrado funded by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, and the project PIP 11220150100191CO funded by CONICET.

The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of ethnic identity on the relationship between the experience of racial and ethnic discrimination and psychological well-being in Colombian immigrants living in Chile. A total of 962 immigrants over the age of 18 from three cities in Chile participated. Of these, 50.7% were women. The average age was 35 years (SD = 10.23). Participants were evaluated using Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scales, Phinney's adapted version of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Scale, and Krieger's Discrimination Experience Scale. After the analysis of the measurement models, a mediation model was analyzed using structural equations. The results provide evidence that ethnic and racial discrimination have negative effects on psychological well-being, with the effect of racial discrimination being greater. Likewise, ethnic identity has positive effects on psychological well-being and partially and completely mediates the effects of ethnic and racial discrimination on psychological well-being. The full effect of discrimination on psychological well-being, mediated by ethnic identity, is exercised only by racial discrimination and not by ethnic discrimination.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Carlos María Alcover, Gabriela Nazar",Adult; Chile; Emigrants and Immigrants; Ethnicity; Female; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Racism,2021-02-28,2021,2021-02-28,2021-03-01,18,5,2359,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Henríquez, Diego; Domic, Marcos; Acevedo, Daniel; Ralph, Sebastian; Reyes, Gonzalo; Tang, Diego","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, acaqueo@academicos.uta.cl); Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Domic, Marcos (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Acevedo, Daniel (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Ralph, Sebastian (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Reyes, Gonzalo (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Tang, Diego (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.))","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.))","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Domic, Marcos (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Acevedo, Daniel (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Ralph, Sebastian (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Reyes, Gonzalo (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Tang, Diego (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.))",13,8,2.11,4.85,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/5/2359/pdf?version=1614512833,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135834651,44 Human Society; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Poor quality transport infrastructure implies higher travelling times and costs. This indirectly affects the productivity of a region since transportation costs are directly related to sales prices. Therefore, infrastructure investments become important for improving the competitiveness of a region. The problem with these investments is that they take time and require a large amount of money. Consequently, it is extremely important to prioritise this type of investment. This paper will first explain whether transportation investment or a sustainable transportation method affect the exported freight accessibility and if it also affects regional productivity using a linear regression model with the aid of a data-driven geographical information system. It uses spatial separation, gravity, and cumulative opportunity measures to calculate accessibility. Finally, the paper denotes which regions are highly affected by improvements in road, river, and railway networks using Colombia as a case study. The comparison considers travelling time and costs savings under each scenario. The results indicate that the gravity measure was the most appropriate accessibility measure for analysing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The scenario analyses suggest that zones farthest from the seaports are more sensitive to accessibility changes; consequently, they will receive higher improvements in their regional GDP with a national-level implementation of transport infrastructure investments. Thus, project prioritisation should be performed in regions where the investments lead to a decreased travel cost between regions and ports.",,,Journal of Advanced Transportation,,Chansung Kim,,2021-09-02,2021,,2021-09-02,2021,,1-22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jubiz-Diaz, Maria; Saltarin-Molino, Maria; Arellana, Julian; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos; Yie-Pinedo, Ruben","Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co); Saltarin-Molino, Maria (Sanofi Aventis, Calle 50 Evolution Tower, Panama City, Panama, sanofi-aventis.com); Arellana, Julian (Department of Civil Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co; Department of Management Information Systems, Fowler College of Business, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Dr., San Diego, CA 92182, USA); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia, uninorte.edu.co)","Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Universidad del Norte)","Jubiz-Diaz, Maria (Universidad del Norte); Saltarin-Molino, Maria (Sanofi Aventis, Calle 50 Evolution Tower, Panama City, Panama, sanofi-aventis.com); Arellana, Julian (Universidad del Norte); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos (Universidad del Norte; San Diego State University); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte)",12,10,,4.81,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2021/5530114.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140847086,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The study focused on the Asphalt-Binders' high-temperature rheological properties, namely, the G*, δ, G*/Sin(δ) and G*/(1 - (1/Tan(δ)Sin(δ))) parameters, measured using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) device. The DSR data analyzed in the study were extracted from the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely, the Texas Data Storage System (DSS), covering two Asphalt-Binders (ABs), performance grade (PG) 64-22 and PG 76-22 plant-mix extracted ABs that were treated as rolling thin film oven (RTFO) residue, and sourced from 14 different suppliers. The study findings substantiate that material-source has an effect on the high-temperature rheological properties of ABs. Additionally, it was also concluded that in as much as performance superiority and costs are crucial issues in deciding the AB source/provider, consistency and quality aspects cannot be disregarded. Therefore, material-source effects should be inclusively evaluated from both performance (rheological properties) and quality (consistence) standpoints as well as cost considerations when choosing a supplier. In general, the study contributes to the state-of-the-art enrichment on aspects of material-source effects on RTFO residue ABs' high-temperature rheological properties, consistency, variability, and data quality.","The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for their support, particularly the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database (the Texas DSS) project that valuably served as the data source for the work presented in this paper.

Activates Ubiquitination and Proteasome Degradation of β-catenin to Suppress Metastasis of Hepatitis B-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Compound Phyllanthus urinaria L. (CP) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for cancer treatment in the clinic, particularly during progression of hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-associated HCC). Nevertheless, its anti-metastatic action and mechanisms are not well elucidated. In this study, CP was found to exert remarkable inhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HBV-associated HCC cells. The following network and biological analyses predicted that CP mainly targeted Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) to induce anti-metastatic effects, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway was one of the core mechanisms of CP action against HBV-associated HCC. Further experimental validation implied that Cav-1 overexpression promoted metastasis of HBV-associated HCC by stabilizing β-catenin, while CP administration induced autophagic degradation of Cav-1, activated the Akt/GSK3β-mediated proteasome degradation of β-catenin via ubiquitination activation, and subsequently attenuated the metastasis-promoting effect of Cav-1. In addition, the anti-cancer and anti-metastatic action of CP was further confirmed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments.

Taken together, our study not only highlights the novel function of CP formula in suppressing metastasis of HBV-associated HCC, but it also addresses the critical role of Cav-1 in mediating Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis to control the late-phase of cancer progression.",The authors are grateful to the support of Laboratory of TCM Syndrome Essence and Objectification.

The interplay between emotions and learning is less well understood. Gaining greater insights into learner emotions has potential to guide how best we manage emotions and optimise learning. This study aimed to understand learners’ lived emotional experiences in complex simulation and the perceived impact on learning.MethodsEight final-year medical students participated in the study. Wearing video-glasses, participants took part in a ward-based simulation. Video-footage was used to elicitate exploratory interviews and analysed using Template Analysis reflexively.ResultsAnalysis yielded four main themes: ‘nervous anticipation’: encapsulating the fear, anxiety and uncertainty experienced by learners prior to simulation; ‘shock and awe’: feelings of anxiousness and being overwhelmed at the start of a simulation; ‘in the moment: flowing or buffeting with the emotions’: experiencing fear of being judged as incompetent, but also experiencing positive emotions such as satisfaction; ‘safe-landing?’: whilst debriefing aimed to encourage more positive emotions, negative emotions about the simulation could persist even with debriefing.ConclusionsComplex simulation can evoke intense emotions in students. If students experienced a positive progression, they reported positive emotions and felt competent which was perceived to have a positive impact on learning. If students experienced failure, they reported strong negative emotions which made them question about their future performance and was perceived as negative for learning. Bringing to the surface these complex emotional dynamics, could permit educators to be aware of and adapt the emotional climate within simulation in order to optimise learning.","The authors would like to thank all of the students, faculty staff and SPs who participated in the study.",,Advances in Simulation,,,,2021-07-03,2021,2021-07-03,2021-12,6,1,24,All OA; Gold,Article,"Behrens, Claudia C.; Driessen, Erik W.; Dolmans, Diana H.; Gormley, Gerard J.","Behrens, Claudia C.

We seek to show the experience of parenthood from the perspective of LGBTIQ+ people, considering its particularities and the role that health care services play as a potential support network. We used the biographical method through open-ended interviews, participants were LGBT people, and key informants from Chile, Colombia, and Mexico were selected based on a sociostructural sampling. We found that internalized stigma impacts LGBTIQ+ parenting in five ways: the impossibility of thinking of oneself as a parent, fear of violating children's rights, fear of passing on the stigma, fear of introducing their LGBTIQ+ partner, and the greater discrimination that trans and intersex people suffer. We identified gaps in health care perceptions: the need to guarantee universal access to health care, the need to include a gender perspective and inclusive treatment by health personnel, mental health programs with a community approach, access to assisted fertilization programs, and the generation of collaborative alliances between health services, civil society organizations, and the LGBTIQ+ community.

It requires amino groups to reduce cross-link immobilization risk so that lipase–support interaction increases and the immobilization is attainable. Also, the amino group on the support is expected to increase lipase performance. This study aimed to analyze the effect of amino group addition on immobilized Aspergillus niger lipase by the adsorption-crosslinking using MP-64 macroporous anion resin and XAD-7HP macroporous nonionic resin that has been treated with chitosan. The chitosan-coated resin was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Lipase immobilization was carried out by adding 10 ml lipase solution containing 0.75 g resins and shaken at 25°C for 150 rpm. Adsorption was achieved for 4 h, followed by cross-linking separately (adding 0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and re-reacting for 20 min). Lipase activity was measured with the titrimetric of olive oil emulsion; mixed with Aspergillus niger lipase, emulsion, and a buffer solution (pH 6.5, ionic strength of 0.7); and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The effect of amino-functional groups was investigated based on lipase loading and lipase activity. The best lipase loading and lipase activity of 83.79% and 29.41 U/g support were achieved in the adsorption-crosslinking using MP-64 resin coated with chitosan. After four cycles, biodiesel synthesis was maintained at 70.61% of the initial yield. These results indicated that chitosan as an affordable and readily available source of amino groups could be used to modify support for Aspergillus niger lipase immobilization.",The authors would like to acknowledge the research and publication support provided by the Ministry of Education and Culture Republic of Indonesia and Universitas Indonesia through PUTI Doktor Grant (number NKB-668/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020).,This research was funded by Universitas Indonesia through PUTI Doktor Grant (number NKB-668/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020).,Frontiers in Energy Research,,,,2021-04-22,2021,2021-04-22,,9,,616945,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nuraliyah, Andi; Perdani, Meka Saima; Putri, Dwini Normayulisa; Sahlan, Muhamad; Wijanarko, Anondho; Hermansyah, Heri","Nuraliyah, Andi (Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia); Perdani, Meka Saima (Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia); Putri, Dwini Normayulisa (Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia); Sahlan, Muhamad (Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia); Wijanarko, Anondho (Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia); Hermansyah, Heri (Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia)","Hermansyah, Heri (University of Indonesia)","Nuraliyah, Andi (University of Indonesia); Perdani, Meka Saima (University of Indonesia); Putri, Dwini Normayulisa (University of Indonesia); Sahlan, Muhamad (University of Indonesia); Wijanarko, Anondho (University of Indonesia); Hermansyah, Heri (University of Indonesia)",18,17,,4.61,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2021.616945/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137397172,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,

However, the prognostic values of LIMK1 and correlation with immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma are still not understood. Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic role of LIMK1 and its correlation with immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Transcriptional expression profiles of LIMK1 between lung adenocarcinoma tissues and normal tissues were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The LIMK1 protein expression was assessed by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and the Human Protein Atlas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to differentiate lung adenocarcinoma from adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier method was conducted to assess the effect of LIMK1 on survival. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by the STRING. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using the ""ClusterProfiler"" package. The relationship between LIMK1 mRNA expression and immune infiltrates was determined by tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER) and tumor-immune system interaction database (TISIDB).
RESULTS: The expression of LIMK1 in lung adenocarcinoma tissues was significantly upregulated than those in adjacent normal tissues. Increased LIMK1 mRNA expression was associated with lymph node metastases and high TNM stage. The ROC curve analysis showed that with a cutoff level of 4.908, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for LIMK1 differentiate lung adenocarcinoma from adjacent controls were 69.5, 93.2, and 71.9%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed lung adenocarcinoma patients with high- LIMK1 had a worse prognosis than those with low- LIMK1 (43.1 vs. 55.1 months, P = 0.028). Correlation analysis indicated LIMK1 mRNA expression was correlated with tumor purity and immune infiltrates.
CONCLUSION: Upregulated LIMK1 is significantly correlated with poor survival and immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma. Our study suggests that LIMK1 can be used as a biomarker of poor prognosis and potential immune therapy target in lung adenocarcinoma.",,"Funding.

One of its complications is neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), which is mainly caused by sympathetic hyperactivity. Due to the complexity of the pathophysiological process and the unspecificity of the clinical presentation, it is little known by general practitioners, medical students and other health care workers not directly related to the neurological part, making the management of this chaotic condition difficult. This review aims to present recent evidence on clinical concepts relevant to the identification and management of NPE secondary to SAH.Main body of the abstractNPE is defined as a syndrome of acute onset following significant central nervous system (CNS) injury. Its etiology has been proposed to stem from the release of catecholamines that produce cardiopulmonary dysfunction, with this syndrome being associated with spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disorders, traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, and meningitis. NPE has long been considered a rare event; but it may occur more frequently, mainly in patients with SAH. There are two clinical presentations of NPE: the early form develops in the first hours/minutes after injury, while the late form presents 12–24 h after neurological injury. Clinical manifestations consist of non-specific signs of respiratory distress: dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia, pink expectoration, crackles on auscultation, which usually resolve within 24–48 h in 50% of patients. Unfortunately, there are no tools to make the specific diagnosis, so the diagnosis is by exclusion. The therapeutic approach consists of two interventions: treatment of the underlying neurological injury to reduce intracranial pressure and control sympathetic hyperactivity related to the lung injury, and supportive treatment for pulmonary edema.Short conclusionSAH is a severe condition that represents a risk to the life of the affected patient due to the possible complications that may develop. NPE is one of these complications, which due to the common manifestation of a respiratory syndrome, does not allow early and accurate diagnosis, being a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, in any case of CNS lesion with pulmonary involvement, NPE should be suspected immediately.",Not applicable.,FundingThis study was not funded by any source.

In this work, we explore model-based paleodietary reconstruction of the results of stable isotope analysis of human bone collagen and hydroxyapatite. The results of this modeling are used to explore local phenomena, the nature of the Middle Period, and the interaction between local situations and the larger world in which the oases were enmeshed by identifying the temporal, spatial, and biocultural correlates and dimensions of dietary difference. Our analyses revealed that: 1) over the 600-year period represented by our sample, there were significant changes in consumption patterns that may evince broad diachronic changes in the structure of Atacameño society, and 2) at/near 600 calAD, there was a possible episode of social discontinuity that manifested in significant changes in consumption practices. Additionally, while there were some differences in the level of internal dietary variability among the ayllus, once time was fully considered, none of the ayllus stood out for having a more (or less) clearly internally differentiated cuisine. Finally, sex does not appear to have been a particularly salient driver of observed dietary differences here. While we do not see any de facto evidence for complete dietary differentiation (as there is always overlap in consumption among individuals, ayllus, and time periods, and as isotopic analysis is not capable of pinpointing different foods items or preparations), there are broad aspects of dietary composition changing over time that are potentially linked to status, and foreignness. Ultimately, these stand as the clearest example of what has been termed ""gastro-politics,"" potentially tied to the emergence of social inequality in the San Pedro oases.","WJP received National Science Foundation Grant BCS-1358753, https://www.nsf.gov/.

Our objective was to examine the mediating role of Acculturative Stress in the association between ethnic discrimination and racial discrimination with physical and mental health. This research is a non-experimental, analytical, cross-sectional study. A total of 976 adult Colombian migrants living in Chile were interviewed. We used the Everyday Discrimination Scale, the acculturative stress scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12) for health status; we found that racial and ethnic discrimination had a negative effect on physical and mental health. In the simultaneous presence of both types of discrimination, racial discrimination was completely absorbed by ethnic discrimination, the latter becoming a total mediator of the effect of racial discrimination on mental and physical health.

Invasion of the cornea can cause severe vision loss. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common post-transcriptional modification of eukaryotic mRNA, which can regulate mRNA splicing, stability, nuclear transport, and translation. To our best knowledge, there is no current research on the mechanism of m6A in pterygium.
METHODS: We obtained 24 pterygium tissues and 24 conjunctival tissues from each of 24 pterygium patients recruited from Shanghai Yangpu Hospital, and the level of m6A modification was detected using an m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit. Expression and location of METTL3, a key m6A methyltransferase, were identified by immunostaining. Then we used m6A-modified RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and bioinformatics analyses to compare the differential expression of m6A methylation in pterygium and normal conjunctival tissue.
RESULTS: We identified 2,949 dysregulated m6A peaks in pterygium tissue, of which 2,145 were significantly upregulated and 804 were significantly downregulated. The altered m6A peak of genes were found to play a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway and endocytosis. Joint analyses of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq data identified 72 hypermethylated m6A peaks and 15 hypomethylated m6A peaks in mRNA. After analyzing the differentially methylated m6A peaks and synchronously differentially expressed genes, we searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database and identified five genes related to the development of pterygium (DSP, MXRA5, ARHGAP35, TMEM43, and OLFML2A).
CONCLUSION: Our research shows that m6A modification plays an important role in the development of pterygium and can be used as a potential new target for the treatment of pterygium in the future.",,Funding.

The sparse information available, mainly for seamounts outside Chilean jurisdiction and shallow-water fauna of the Desventuradas Islands, suggests that the area is a hotspot of endemism. This apparent uniqueness of the fauna motivated the creation of the large Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park (NDMP, ~ 300,000 km2) around the small islands San Felix and San Ambrosio in 2015. We report for the first time a detailed description of benthic microhabitats (i.e., centimeter to meter scale), macrohabitats (i.e., meter to kilometer-scale) and associated megafauna within the NDMP. Descriptions were based on analysis of fauna collected by trawling and ROV video observations from ~ 50 to 370 m depth. Rocky, coarse sand and silty sediment bottom habitats were observed at island slopes. In contrast, rocky and coarse sandy bottom habitats with a predominance of rhodoliths, thanatocoenosis, and other biogenic components were observed at seamounts. Mobile fauna and predators dominated the oceanic islands and nearby seamounts, whereas seamounts farther from the islands were dominated by sessile and hemisessile fauna that were mainly suspension and deposit feeders. Based on the register of 118 taxonomic units, our results provide an expanded and updated baseline for the benthic biodiversity of NDMP habitats, which seemed pristine, without evidence of trawling or anthropogenic debris.","We are indebted to the Captain and crew of R/V Cabo de Hornos of the Chilean Navy, and the scientific personnel participating in the CIMAR 22 cruise.

Here, we evaluate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) present in pre-transmission infant and maternal plasma and breast milk (BM) against the contemporaneous maternal HIV-1 variants. HIV-1-exposed uninfected compared with HIV-1-exposed infected infants have higher ADCC and a combination of ADCC and nAb responses against their corresponding mother's strains. ADCC does not correlate with nAbs, suggesting they are independent activities. The infected infants with high ADCC compared with low ADCC, but not those with higher ADCC plus nAbs, have lower morbidity up to 1 year after birth. A higher IgA to IgG ratio, observed in BM supernatants and in a higher proportion of the infected compared with the uninfected infants, associates with lower ADCC. Against the exposure strains, ADCC, more than nAbs, associates with both lower mother-to-child transmission and decreased post-infection infant morbidity.","We thank the participants of the BAN study, without whom none of this work would be possible.

Seismicity, slope sedimentary instabilities, submarine volcanism, fluid flow processes, and bottom currents are considered here because they are the most common hazardous processes; tsunamis are also examined because they are a secondary hazard generated mostly by earthquakes, slope instabilities, or volcanic eruptions. The hazards can co-occur and interact, inducing a cascading sequence of events, especially in certain contexts, such as tectonic indentations, volcanic islands, and canyon heads close to the coast. We analyze the key characteristics and main shortcomings of offshore geological hazards to identify their present and future directions for marine geoscience investigations of their identification and characterization. This review establishes that future research will rely on studies including a high level of multidisciplinarity.

The study was conducted in 2019 at five selected South African universities – University of Johannesburg, University of South Africa, University of Limpopo, University of Venda and Tshwane University of Technology – which offered the language under investigation as an L1 module. In addition, language experts (practitioners) at the Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) and its sub-structures and the National Department of Arts and Culture, including Limpopo and Gauteng Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation, were also involved in the study. Quota sampling was used to select all the 267 participants in the study. The study found that both Sepedi and Sesotho sa Leboa (Northern Sotho) language names are rejected by onomastic principles of naming an official language. An overwhelming majority of the participants opined that this language should be renamed, with the anticipation that the new name will bring peace, unity and solidarity to the L1 speakers of Sepedi.",,,Literator,,,,2021-08-26,2021,2021-08-26,,42,1,14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rakgogo, Tebogo J.; Zungu, Evangeline B.","Rakgogo, Tebogo J.

University teaching is increasingly utilizing these audiovisual, digital and multimedia resources to provide a better learning experience. For the production of these materials, designated spaces have been created, however, there is a lack of consensus regarding the name attributed to them. In this study, we carried out a bibliographical review of the production of educational audiovisual content and the spaces devoted to this end in order to contextualise it prior to the in-depth interviews. With the aim of getting to know and delve deeper into the audiovisual proposals that are taking place in the Ibero-American sphere, we interviewed the people responsible for these innovative spaces in three universities. We concluded that the three institutions dedicated human resources, equipment and specialised spaces for video development; pedagogical support is necessary to outline the educational intention of the materials to be created; and it is necessary to empower both teachers and students in the development and curation of materials. The results may be useful for other universities and centres interested in venturing into video production, as well as for collaboration opportunities to enrich the learning experience and teacher training.",,,RIED Revista Iberoamericana de Educación a Distancia,,,,2021-10-06,2021,2021-10-06,,25,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Toscano-Alonso, María; Aguaded, Ignacio; Salcedo, Edna M.

Multimodal learning is approached in terms of the levels of multimodality and specifically blended learning and the mixing of modes of delivery (contact and distance education). As such, this publication will provide a unique snapshot of multimodal practices within higher education through a self-directed learning epistemological lens. The book covers issues such as what self-directed multimodal learning entails, mapping of specific publications regarding blended learning, blended learning in mathematics, geography, natural science and computer literacy, comparative experiences in distance education as well as situated and culturally appropriate learning in multimodal contexts. This book provides a unique focus on multimodality in terms of learning and delivery within the context of self-directed learning. Therefore, the publication would not only advance the scholarship of blended and open distance learning in South Africa but also contribute to enriching the discourse regarding self-direction.

However, many governments have hesitated to implement them due to their costs. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI program to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia.
METHODS: We developed a Markov simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both the health system and the societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity loss, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
FINDINGS: Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduces COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saves an average of $1,045 and $850 per case when observed from the social and the health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to two times the current health expenditures in Colombia per year.
INTERPRETATION: The TTI program is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Colombia. TTI programs depend on their successful and speedy implementation.

We ascertained whether these predictors are different in women vs. men and between women living with vs. without children. Data were collected through online surveys administered to 1038 participants from two universities (staff and students) in Chile, across five waves (July to October 2020). Participants provided information about their past-week unhealthy food and alcohol consumption and mental health. Using latent growth curve modeling analysis, we found that higher perceived health and interpersonal COVID-19 impact, younger age and lower depression symptoms were associated with more rapid increases over time in unhealthy food consumption. On the other hand, higher perceived COVID-19 economic impact and older age were associated with more rapid diachronic decreases in alcohol consumption. Gender and living with or without children, for women only, were moderators of these trajectories. This longitudinal study provides strong evidence identifying the multiple repercussions of COVID-19 and mental health factors on unhealthy food and alcohol consumption. These findings highlight the need for interventions aimed at minimizing the impact of the pandemic on unhealthy food and alcohol consumption over time.",,"This research was funded by National Research and Development Agency (ANID, Chile), grant number COVID0282.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

Back in 1879, Dr. Wilheim Wundt opened the first experimental psychology lab at the University of Leipzig to study reaction times. To many, this is considered the start of Psychology as a separate scientific discipline and the use of data analysis for data-driven decision making in the field (Flis, 2019; Tweney, 2003).

All participants provided verbal consent prior to completing the survey. A 37-question web-based survey with no personal identifiers was sent to 212 previously identified AD patients. Itching, sleep disturbances, SARS-CoV-2, illness cost, economic dependence, monthly income, and monthly investment in AD before and during the pandemic, were all included in the analysis. A response rate of 73.1% was obtained. The mean age of participants was 30 years-old, and 57% were women. Around 75% reported AD worsening, and 59.4% of the patients reported sleep problems. Uncertainty, anxiety, and pessimism were frequent during the pandemic. Only 1.3% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and it was only significantly associated with comorbidities (p=0.03; Chi2 Test). A significant difference was found in economic dependence and monthly income when compared between before and during the pandemic. This study provides probably the best possible assessment of the clinical, social, and economic effects of the pandemic on patients with an already proven diagnosis of AD.","We thank all the patients for their willingness to participate.

Previous AD epidemiologic studies have been mainly retrospective and/or have been performed through surveys instead of in-person visits. Epidemiological studies concerning AD in Latin American countries are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To describe sociodemographic and clinical features and the economic burden of AD on children and adult patients in Colombia through in-person visits.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 212 patients that included sociodemographic and clinimetric data. The diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka was used and data relating to disease distribution, disease severity (through the BSA: Body surface area; EASI: Eczema Area and Severity Index; SCORAD: Scoring Atopic Dermatitis), Fitzpatrick's skin phototypes, personal and familiar history of allergic diseases, previous treatments, and personal history of comorbidities, was collected.
RESULTS: Patient age range was 12-76, and 52.8% were female. Disease distribution was mainly flexural (19.6%). Early age start, Denni-Morgan fold, and infections tendency were more frequent in adolescents compared to adults. Mean age of diagnosis was 12 years old, AD diagnosis was made mostly by a dermatologist, 48.1% (102 patients) reported alcohol consumption, and 59% of consumers were heavy drinkers. Comorbidities found were: chronic rhinitis (68.9%) food allergy (32.5%), allergic conjunctivitis (29.7%), and asthma (28.8%). Around 81% earned less than $896 US dollars and 59% invested 6-30% of their monthly budget yearly, and 40% had work or school absenteeism. Mean scores of BSA, EASI, and SCORAD involvement were 32.6, 13.7, and 42.4, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds well-supported data through an in-depth clinical and economical characterization of Colombian adolescents and adult patients with atopic dermatitis and shows its high impact and burden on patients and their families. It also contributes to understand the burden of AD in Latin America.","We thank all the patients for their willingness to participate.

Given that the highest viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found in the airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk of infection. As a result, multiple recommendations have emerged regarding protective measures for surgical teams, including suspending non-urgent procedures and surgeries.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology residency training programs nationwide.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey-based study was completed in April 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey, sent by email to all Chilean otolaryngology residents. Demographics, clinical activities, on-call shifts, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to COVID-19 patients, deployment to other specialties, diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and surgeries performed were analyzed. Self-reported surgical data logs from previous years were used to compare results.
RESULTS: Forty-seven residents completed the survey (84% response rate); 64% of residents refer seeing patients ten days or less during April 2020. Commonly performed procedures such as flexible nasolaryngoscopy, rigid nasal endoscopy, and peritonsillar abscess drainage were not performed by over 40% of the residents in that month. Only 38% participated in surgeries, with an average of 0.6 surgeries as a first surgeon, a dramatic decrease in surgical exposure when comparing the data logs from previous years. Most residents refer the following measures taken by their residency program to improve residency training: bibliographic videoconferences (87%), online clinical case seminars (60%), weekly journal clubs (38%), among others.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and surgical opportunities decreased dramatically during April 2020. Adjustments to the regular academic curricula should be considered to decrease the negative impact of this pandemic on residency training.",,,Medwave,,,Adult; COVID-19; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Otolaryngology,2021-02-28,2021,2021-02-28,,21,01,e8097-e8097,All OA; Gold,Article,"Álvarez, Matías L; Waissbluth, Sofia; González, Claudia; Napolitano, Carla; Torrente, Mariela; Délano, Paul H; Alarcón, Ricardo; Fernández, Francisca; Bitrán, Roger","Álvarez, Matías L (Departamento Otorrinolaringología, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

The Peruvian version of the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS-PE) is a BCST that relies minimally on educational attainment and has shown good diagnostic accuracy in an urban illiterate population in Peru, yet its psychometric properties in illiterate populations in rural settings of the country have not been previously investigated. Objectives: To establish the diagnostic accuracy of the RUDAS-PE compared to expert clinical diagnosis using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale in healthy and cognitively impaired illiterate persons living in two culturally and geographically distinct rural communities of Peru. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study of residents ≥ 50 years of age living in the Peruvian rural communities of Santa Clotilde and Chuquibambilla. A total of 129 subjects (76 from Santa Clotilde and 53 from Chuquibambilla) were included in this study. Gold standard diagnostic neurocognitive evaluation was based on expert neurological history and examination and administration of the CDR. Receiver operating characteristics, areas under the curve (AUC), and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the performance of RUDAS-PE compared to expert gold standard diagnosis. Results: Compared to gold standard diagnosis, the RUDAS-PE was better at correctly discriminating between MCI and dementia than discriminating between MCI and controls in both sites (97.0% vs. 76.2% correct classification in Chuquibambilla; 90.0% vs. 64.7% in Santa Clotilde). In Chuquibambilla, the area under the curve (AUC) of the RUDAS to discriminate between dementia and MCI was 99.4% (optimal cutoff at <18), whereas between MCI and controls it was 82.8% (optimal cutoff at <22). In Santa Clotilde, the area under the curve (AUC) of the RUDAS to discriminate between dementia and MCI was 99.1% (optimal cutoff at <17), whereas between MCI and controls it was 75.5% (optimal cutoff at <21). Conclusions: The RUDAS-PE has acceptable psychometric properties and performed well in its ability to discriminate MCI and dementia in two cohorts of illiterate older adults from two distinct rural Peruvian communities.",,"Funding.

Traditionally, many taxa were considered to be widespread and morphologically variable, following broadly circumscribed morphodemes. Among these is the S. weigelii morphodeme, characterized by a cyanobacterial photobiont and rather narrow, flabellate to truncate or tapering lobes producing predominantly marginal isidia. Molecular phylogenetic analyses focusing on the ITS fungal barcoding marker revealed that this morphodeme represents several species, some of which are only distantly related to each other. Here we describe two species and one subspecies of this morphodeme as new to science, based on analysis of 400 specimens, for 344 of which we generated ITS barcoding data. The two new species, S. andina and S. scabrosa, are broadly distributed in the Neotropics and also found in Hawaii, where the latter is represented by the new subspecies, S. scabrosa subsp. hawaiiensis; in the case of S. andina, the species is also found in the Azores. Sticta andina exhibits high phenotypic variation and reticulate genetic diversification, whereas the phenotypically rather uniform S. scabrosa contains two main haplotypes, one restricted to Hawaii. Sticta andina occurs in well-preserved montane to andine forests and paramos, whereas the two subspecies of S. scabrosa are found in tropical lowland to lower montane forests, tolerating disturbance and extending into anthropogenic habitats.

Despite of its apparent generality, a growing body of evidence shows that 'anomalous' LDG (i.e., inverse or hump-shaped trends) are common among marine organisms along the Southeastern Pacific (SEP) coast. Here, we evaluate the shape of the LDG of marine benthic polychaetes and its underlying causes using a dataset of 643 species inhabiting the continental shelf (<200 m depth), using latitudinal bands with a spatial resolution of 0.5°, along the SEP (3-56° S). The explanatory value of six oceanographic (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), SST range, salinity, salinity range, primary productivity and shelf area), and one macroecological proxy (median latitudinal range of species) were assessed using a random forest model. The taxonomic structure was used to estimate the degree of niche conservatism of predictor variables and to estimate latitudinal trends in phylogenetic diversity, based on three indices (phylogenetic richness (PDSES), mean pairwise distance (MPDSES), and variation of pairwise distances (VPD)). The LDG exhibits a hump-shaped trend, with a maximum peak of species richness at ca. 42° S, declining towards northern and southern areas of SEP. The latitudinal pattern was also evident in local samples controlled by sampling effort. The random forest model had a high accuracy (pseudo-r2 = 0.95) and showed that the LDG could be explained by four variables (median latitudinal range, SST, salinity, and SST range), yet the functional relationship between species richness and these predictors was variable. A significant degree of phylogenetic conservatism was detected for the median latitudinal range and SST. PDSES increased toward the southern region, whereas VPD showed the opposite trend, both statistically significant. MPDSES has the same trend as PDSES, but it is not significant. Our results reinforce the idea that the south Chile fjord area, particularly the Chiloé region, was likely the evolutionary source of new species of marine polychaetes along SEP, creating a hotspot of diversity. Therefore, in the same way as the canonical LDG shows a decline in diversity while moving away from the tropics; on this case the decline occurs while moving away from Chiloé Island. These results, coupled with a strong phylogenetic signal of the main predictor variables suggest that processes operating mainly at evolutionary timescales govern the LDG.","Rodrigo A.

A concerning aspect of invasive candidiasis is the emergence of resistant isolates, especially those highly resistant to fluconazole, the first choice of treatment for these infections. Fungal sphingolipids have been considered a potential target for new therapeutic approaches and some inhibitors have already been tested against pathogenic fungi. The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the action of two sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, aureobasidin A and myriocin, against different C. albicans and C. glabrata strains, including clinical isolates resistant to fluconazole. Susceptibility tests of aureobasidin A and myriocin were performed using CLSI protocols, and their interaction with fluconazole was evaluated by a checkerboard protocol. All Candida strains tested were sensitive to both inhibitors.

In addition to food/beverage and cosmetic applications, citrus EOs could also potentially be used as an alternative to antibiotics in food-producing animals. A commercial citrus EO-Brazilian Orange Terpenes (BOT)-was fractionated by vacuum fractional distillation to separate BOT into various fractions: F1, F2, F3, and F4. Next, the chemical composition and biological activities of BOT and its fractions were characterized. Results showed the three first fractions had a high relative amount of limonene (≥10.86), even higher than the whole BOT. Conversely, F4 presented a larger relative amount of BOT's minor compounds (carvone, cis-carveol, trans-carveol, cis-p-Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, and trans-p-Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol) and a very low relative amount of limonene (0.08-0.13). Antibacterial activity results showed F4 was the only fraction exhibiting this activity, which was selective and higher activity on a pathogenic bacterium (E. coli) than on a beneficial bacterium (Lactobacillus sp.). However, F4 activity was lower than BOT. Similarly, F4 displayed the highest antioxidant activity among fractions (equivalent to BOT). These results indicated that probably those minor compounds that detected in F4 would be more involved in conferring the biological activities for this fraction and consequently for the whole BOT, instead of the major compound, limonene, playing this role exclusively.","The authors are grateful to CIENCIACTIVA from the “Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Inovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru; Contract 278-2015-FONDECYT) and to the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES, Brazil) for Carmen M.S.

The first reception spaces were the popular education projects that were being promoted by progressive sectors of the Church and also by the Pedagogical Renewal Movements. Later Freire's ideas were received in the academic field of pedagogy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Freire's trips to Spain between 1984 and 1994, four trips that are studied in detail in this article, are a key historical source for studying of the presence of the Brazilian pedagogue's thought in the Spanish Faculties of Education.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and intensity of occupational burnout among pre-hospital emergency staff in Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data resources included Scientific Information Database (SID), Magiran, Islamic World Science Citation Center (ISC), Irandoc, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.
RESULTS: Initially, 178 articles were extracted, and then 13 articles were finally analyzed. Overall,2034 pre-hospital emergency personnel were examined. Mean of occupational burnout in term of frequency, respectively for emotional exhaustion (16.78, 95% CI = 8.89-24.67, I2 = 62.30%, p = 0.004), depersonalization (11.57, 95% CI = 6.97-16.18, I2 = 68.50%, p = 0.001) and the lack of personal accomplishment (16.11, 95% CI = 8.60 -23.62, I2 = 74.70%, p = 0 <001) were determined. Also, in term of intensity, respectively for emotional exhaustion (17.90, 95% CI = 8.24-27.57, I2 = 64.80, p = 0.004), depersonalization (11.20, 95% CI = 6.80-16.22, I2 = 49.60%, p = 0.044) and the lack of personal accomplishment (23.45, 95% CI = 13.41 -33.49, I2 = 84.80%, p = 0 <001) were determined.
CONCLUSIONS: According to findings, depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment had moderate and high-level, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary health policymakers pay special attention to identifying and resolving the causes of occupational burnout in this population.","The authors thank Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran for the financial support of this research.",,Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research,,,,2021-01-18,2021,2021-01-18,2021-01,26,1,11-17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sahebi, Ali; Golitaleb, Mohamad; Jahangiri, Katayoun","Sahebi, Ali (Department of Health in Disasters and Emergencies, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Golitaleb, Mohamad (Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran); Jahangiri, Katayoun (Department of Health in Disasters and Emergencies, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran)","Jahangiri, Katayoun (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences)","Sahebi, Ali (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences); Golitaleb, Mohamad (Arak University of Medical Sciences); Jahangiri, Katayoun (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences)",7,6,1.36,3.83,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_175_20,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137521640,42 Health Sciences; 4204 Midwifery; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

Mesoamerican societies were multicultural in nature and also experienced significant admixture during Spanish colonization of the region. Despite these facts, Native Mexican Y chromosome diversity has been greatly understudied. To further elucidate their genetic history, we conducted a high-resolution Y chromosome analysis with Chichimecas, Nahuas, Otomies, Popolocas, Tepehuas, and Totonacas using 19 Y-short tandem repeat and 21 single nucleotide polymorphism loci. We detected enormous paternal genetic diversity in these groups, with haplogroups Q-MEH2, Q-M3, Q-Z768, Q-L663, Q-Z780, and Q-PV3 being identified. These data affirmed the southward colonization of the Americas via Beringia and connected Native Mexicans with indigenous populations from South-Central Siberia and Canada. They also suggested that multiple population dispersals gave rise to Y chromosome diversity in these populations.","We thank the enthusiastic participation of the Native American populations represented herein: Chichimecas (Éza&#x27;r), Nahuas, Otomies (Hñähñús), Popolocas, Tepehuas, and Totonacas; their collaboration made this study possible.

During the last decade, a shift in serotype prevalence has occurred as traditionally less prevalent serotypes are increasing in frequency of infections, especially those related to poultry meat contamination. S. Infantis is one of the major emerging serotypes, and these strains commonly display antimicrobial resistance and can persist despite cleaning protocols. Thus, this work aimed to isolate S. Infantis strains from a poultry meat farm in Santiago, Chile and to characterize genetic variations present in them. We determined their genomic and phenotypic profiles at different points along the production line. The results indicate that the strains encompass 853 polymorphic sites (core-SNPs) with isolates differing from one another by 0-347 core SNPs, suggesting variation among them; however, we found discrete correlations with the source of the sample in the production line. Furthermore, the pan-genome was composed of 4854 total gene clusters of which 2618 (53.9%) corresponds to the core-genome and only 181 (3.7%) are unique genes (those present in one particular strain). This preliminary analysis will enrich the surveillance of Salmonella, yet further studies are required to assess their evolution and phylogeny.","Genome sequencing was carried out by MicrobesNG (http://www.microbesng.uk, accessed on 13 February 2021), which is supported by the BBSRC (grant number BB/L024209/1).

With the aim of finding non-toxic and effective P-gp inhibitors, we investigated a panel of quinolin-2-one-pyrimidine hybrids. Among the active compounds, two of them significantly increased intracellular doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 accumulation by inhibiting the efflux mediated by P-gp and restored doxorubicin toxicity at nanomolar range. Structure–activity relationships showed that the number of methoxy groups, an optimal length of the molecule in its extended conformation, and at least one flexible methylene group bridging the quinolinone to the moiety bearing the pyrimidine favored the inhibitory potency of P-gp. The best compounds showed a similar binding pattern and interactions to those of doxorubicin and tariquidar, as revealed by MD and hybrid QM/MM simulations performed with the recent experimental structure of P-gp co-crystallized with paclitaxel. Analysis of the molecular interactions stabilizing the different molecular complexes determined by MD and QTAIM showed that binding to key residues from TMH 4–7 and 12 is required for inhibition.","This work was supported by the Universidad Católica de Córdoba, CONICET (PIP 2014-2016), FONCyT (PICT 2014-1594, PICT 2017-1381 and PICT 2015-1769), the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, project #RTI2018-098560-B-C22, Universidad de Jáen, Consejería de Innovación, Ciencia y Empresa (Junta de Andalucía, Spain).

METHODS: Analytic cross-sectional study conducted with 51 patients hospitalized in the Hemato-Oncology Unit at Hospital Base Valdivia, Chile. A survey containing sociodemographic and clinical information was applied together with the questionnaire on Perception of Behaviors of Humanized Nursing Care 3rd version"" -PBHNC 3v (32 items distributed in the categories: Qualities of nursing work, Openness to nurse-patient communication, and Willingness to care).
RESULTS: Of the participants, 51% were women, with mean age of 46.5±16.6 years; 54.9% were diagnosed with Lymphoma and 78.4% were in the treatment induction stage. In 30 of the 32 items of the instrument, > 90% of the participants evaluated compliance with the behavior of caring at level of ""always"". By categories, it was observed that for ""Willingness to care"" there was significantly lower score among patients from 18 to 49 years of age (p=0.0455). For the category ""Openness to nurse-patient communication"" lower median score existed in patients with Myeloma (p=0.0043) and in patients in the Remission-Consolidation stage (p=0.0084). Days of hospitalization were associated significantly with the category ""Willingness to care"", being lower with 16 days and more (p=0.0242).

However, reanalysis datasets require detailed validation to determine their accuracy and reliability. This paper evaluates the performance of MERRA2 and ERA5 regarding their monthly rainfall products, comparing their areal precipitation averages with estimates based on ground measurement records from 49 rain gauges managed by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) and the Thiessen polygons method in the Sinu River basin, Colombia. The performance metrics employed in this research are the correlation coefficient, the bias, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results show that ERA5 generally outperforms MERRA2 in the study area. However, both reanalyses consistently overestimate the monthly averages calculated from IDEAM records at all time and spatial scales. The negative NSE values indicate that historical monthly averages from IDEAM records are better predictors than both MERRA2 and ERA5 rainfall products.",,,Atmosphere,,,,2021-10-29,2021,2021-10-29,,12,11,1430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vega-Durán, Jean; Escalante-Castro, Brigitte; Canales, Fausto A.; Acuña, Guillermo J.; Kaźmierczak, Bartosz","Vega-Durán, Jean (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 #55-66, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Escalante-Castro, Brigitte (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 #55-66, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Canales, Fausto A.

Methods from the theory of averaging of nonlinear dynamical systems are used to prove that time-dependent systems and their corresponding time-averaged versions have the same late-time dynamics. Therefore, the simplest time-averaged system determines the future asymptotic behavior. Depending on the values of γ$$\gamma $$, the late-time attractors of physical interests are flat quintessence dominated FLRW universe and Einstein-de Sitter solution. With this approach, the oscillations entering the system through the Klein–Gordon (KG) equation can be controlled and smoothed out as the Hubble parameter H – acting as time-dependent perturbation parameter – tends monotonically to zero. Numerical simulations are presented as evidence of such behavior.","The research of Genly Leon, Sebastián Cuéllar and Esteban González was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID through the program FONDECYT Iniciación grant no. 11180126.

Nevertheless, standard protocols generate large volumes of solvent waste. Here, we present a protocol for the multiple Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis in tea bags, where reagent recycling steps are included. Fifty-two peptides with wide amino acid composition and seven to twenty amino acid residues in length were synthesized in less than three weeks. A clustering analysis was performed, grouping the peptides by physicochemical features. Although a relationship between the overall yield and the physicochemical features of the sequences was not established, the process showed good performance despite sequence diversity. The recycling system allowed to reduce N, N-dimethylformamide usage by 25-30% and reduce the deprotection reagent usage by 50%. This protocol has been optimized for the simultaneous synthesis of a large number of peptide sequences. Additionally, a reagent recycling system was included in the procedure, which turns the process into a framework of circular economy, without affecting the quality of the products obtained.",,"This research was funded by grants to F.G.

Recent studies reveal the use of algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, among others, to develop models for predicting product quality. Other studies compare the predictive models developed with these machine learning algorithms in the mining industry as a whole. However, not many copper mining studies published compare the results of machine learning techniques for copper recovery prediction. This study makes a detailed comparison between three models for predicting copper recovery by leaching, using four datasets resulting from mining operations in Northern Chile. The algorithms used for developing the models were Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network. To validate these models, four indicators or values of merit were used: accuracy (acc), precision (p), recall (r), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (mcc). This paper describes the dataset preparation and the refinement of the threshold values used for the predictive variable most influential on the class (the copper recovery). Results show both a precision over 98.50% and also the model with the best behavior between the predicted and the real values. Finally, the obtained models have the following mean values: acc = 0.943, p = 88.47, r = 0.995, and mcc = 0.232. These values are highly competitive when compared with those obtained in similar studies using other approaches in the context.","The authors thank the Franke company for the material support provided and their collaboration in this study, particularly their support for obtaining and storing data from the copper production process using the leaching method, as well as data from the pilot plant (column simulation) and are thankful for the financial support provided by Universidad Católica del Norte.",This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,Jongmyon Kim,,2021-03-17,2021,2021-03-17,,21,6,2119,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores, Victor; Leiva, Claudio","Flores, Victor (Department of Computer and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Leiva, Claudio (Department of Chemical Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, cleiva01@ucn.cl)","Flores, Victor (Catholic University of the North)","Flores, Victor (Catholic University of the North); Leiva, Claudio (Catholic University of the North)",15,10,,3.71,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/6/2119/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136492037,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Celery slices of 2 mm thick were pretreated for 5 min using ultrasound (32 W/L, 40 kHz), vacuum (75 kPa vacuum pressure) and ethanol (99.8% v/v, as drying accelerator) applied individually or in combination. To evaluate individual effects of ultrasound and vacuum, the treatments were also performed with distilled water or air medium, respectively. Moreover, the cavitational level was characterized in each condition. Drying kinetics was evaluated tending into account the drying time required by each treatment and the Page's model parameters. In addition, microstructural effects and shrinkage were evaluated. As results, ethanol combined with ultrasound significantly improved drying kinetics reducing drying time by around 38%. However, vacuum pretreatment did not affect drying kinetics even in combination with ethanol and/or ultrasound. Microstructural evaluation did not evidence cell disruption, suggesting changes in intercellular spaces, pores and/or cell wall permeability. The use of ethanol and vacuum showed a greater effect on shrinkage after pretreatment and after drying, respectively. In conclusion, at the studied conditions, the drying acceleration by vacuum and ultrasound is lower compared to the effect produced using ethanol.","The authors are grateful to the Programa Nacional de Investigación Científica y Estudios Avanzados (PROCIENCIA) from the ‘‘Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT, to the Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN, Peru) for funding the project n° 20201005, to the São Paulo Research foundation (FAPESP, Brazil), for funding the project n° 2019/05043-6, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil), for funding the productivity grant of PED Augusto (310839/2020-3).",,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,,,Apium; Desiccation; Ethanol; Vacuum; Vegetables,2021-10-08,2021,2021-10-08,2021-11,79,,105779,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miano, Alberto Claudio; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Augusto, Pedro E D","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru.); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru.); Augusto, Pedro E D (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North); Augusto, Pedro E D (Universidade de São Paulo)",27,17,1.94,3.69,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105779,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141720456,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Millions of people left Venezuela, with Colombia as their main destination. This means a challenge for integration, where women have been those who have been in a more precarious condition. This research aims to determine how the living conditions of Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia have changed in the context of the pandemic. This work is based on a mixed methodology that uses data from the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, February and December 2020, and interviews with fourteen women in Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla. From this information, it is inferred that the Venezuelan migrant status and gender are factors that strongly condition access to employment and social rights, with women in an irregular migratory situation being the most affected.

Changes in S100B biomarker levels are associated with TBI severity and patient outcome. The S100B quantification is often difficult since standard immunoassays are time-consuming, costly, and require extensive expertise. A zero-length cross-linking approach on a cysteamine self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was performed to immobilize anti-S100B monoclonal antibodies onto both planar (AuEs) and interdigitated (AuIDEs) gold electrodes via carbonyl-bond. Surface characterization was performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and specular-reflectance FTIR for each functionalization step. Biosensor response was studied using the change in charge-transfer resistance (Rct) from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in potassium ferrocyanide, with [S100B] ranging 10-1000 pg/mL. A single-frequency analysis for capacitances was also performed in AuIDEs. Full factorial designs were applied to assess biosensor sensitivity, specificity, and limit-of-detection (LOD). Higher Rct values were found with increased S100B concentration in both platforms. LODs were 18 pg/mL(AuES) and 6 pg/mL(AuIDEs). AuIDEs provide a simpler manufacturing protocol, with reduced fabrication time and possibly costs, simpler electrochemical response analysis, and could be used for single-frequency analysis for monitoring capacitance changes related to S100B levels.","We thanks to the GNano group in the São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC)-USP, Brazil, for facilitate some of the necessary materials and equipment for all the surface characterization experiments.","This research was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757–2016 and by Gobernación del Atlántico call number 809–2018.

This article reports the results of a qualitative study that explored how a rural-school teacher of efl used this model to support ninth graders’ understanding and production of spoken biographical recounts. Findings revealed that learners’ spoken meaningmaking potential increased during the R2L lessons, both in terms of the amount of new content students conveyed throughout the stages and phases of the genre and in connection with the variety of lexico-grammatical resources learners used.

This research work focuses on the reduction of the thermal signature transmitted by the UUV hull, where the use of phase change materials (PCM) is proposed as thermal insulation, placing it between the internal heat source of the UUV and the pressure hull, with the aim of drastically increasing the time in which the external face of the hull of the UUV is within a range of 3 °C and 5 °C temperature increase, allowing it to perform its mission without being detected by the thermal sensors of current naval mines. The simulation will be carried out using the Network Simulation Method for the resolution of the governing equations, which will allow the optimization of the necessary insulation thickness according to the required mission profile. In addition, it is proposed an expression that relates the PCM thickness and the time needed to reach a certain temperature increase.",Not applicable.,,Alexandria Engineering Journal,,,,2021-10,2021,,2021-10,60,5,4627-4637,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco; Mascaraque-Ramírez, Carlos; Nicolás, Jose Andrés Moreno; Castro, Enrique; Cánovas, Manuel","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Applied Physics and Naval Technology Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Paseo Alfonso XIII, 30203 Cartagena, Spain); Mascaraque-Ramírez, Carlos (Applied Physics and Naval Technology Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Paseo Alfonso XIII, 30203 Cartagena, Spain); Nicolás, Jose Andrés Moreno (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Paseo Alfonso XIII, 52 (30203) Cartagena, Spain); Castro, Enrique (Applied Physics and Naval Technology Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Paseo Alfonso XIII, 30203 Cartagena, Spain); Cánovas, Manuel (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Polytechnic University of Cartagena)","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Mascaraque-Ramírez, Carlos (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Nicolás, Jose Andrés Moreno (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Castro, Enrique (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)",10,7,,3.6,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2021.03.058,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136916036,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,

These effects are particularly relevant in the lung context, given the dynamic nature of cyclic stretch that the ECM is continuously subjected to during breathing. This work uses an in vivo model of pulmonary fibrosis to characterize the macro- and micromechanical properties of lung ECM subjected to stretch. To that aim, we have compared the micromechanical properties of fibrotic ECM in baseline and under stretch conditions, using a novel combination of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and a stretchable membrane-based chip. At the macroscale, fibrotic ECM displayed strain-hardening, with a stiffness one order of magnitude higher than its healthy counterpart. Conversely, at the microscale, we found a switch in the stretch-induced mechanical behaviour of the lung ECM from strain-hardening at physiological ECM stiffnesses to strain-softening at fibrotic ECM stiffnesses. Similarly, we observed solidification of healthy ECM versus fluidization of fibrotic ECM in response to stretch. Our results suggest that the mechanical behaviour of fibrotic ECM under stretch involves a potential built-in mechanotransduction mechanism that may slow down the progression of PF by steering resident fibroblasts away from a pro-fibrotic profile.",,"This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PID2020-113910RB-I00-AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SAF2017-85574-R, and PID2020-116808RB-I00 AEI-Retos) and SEPAR (900-2019).

For achieving an agreement among different stakeholders, a commonalty scope must be understood and committed to. However, gathering this knowledge from stakeholders with individual interests is a complex task. This paper reports the experience of scoping the SPL of a small Colombian software company, applying and evaluating a collaborative method called CoMeS-SPL. The company was looking to develop a set of products from a product previously developed with great potential to be adapted and sold to different customers. From a collaborative relationship university–enterprise model, the research groups that developed CoMeS-SPL proposed to use it answering to the company needs for defining an organization-suitable reuse scope around its platform called CORA. Both parties joined in the scoping co-production of the first SPL of the company. This method implied that the company would perform new tasks and involve other roles different for those who are used to defining the scope of a single product. The company actors considered that they obtained a useful scope and perceived the collaboration as valuable because they shared different knowledge and perspectives. The researchers were able to provide feedback on their proposed model, identifying successes and aspects to improve. The experience allowed strengthening the ties of cooperation with the company, and new projects and consultancies are being carried out.",,"This work was partially funded by the projects “Network of training of human talent for social and productive innovation in the department of Cauca” (INNOVACCIÓN CAUCA), which is executed by the University of Cauca under code 3848, and the project ""Domain Analysis for Software Product Lines of Serious Games"" under code 4514 funded.

Dextral strikes-slip is expressed in NW–SE striking faults of the Atacama Fault System, and reverse displacement dominates in E–W faults. This deformation results of the convergence in a concave-seaward continental margin. On September 11th, 2020, a Mw 6.3 earthquake and its subsequent aftershocks took place in the coastal region of northern Chile, revealing the reactivation of the deepest segment of a WNW–ESE striking upper plate fault. The reactivation of this fault occurred after the Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake, and it seems to be connected to a N–S interplate locking segmentation of the plate margin, which is clearly shown by the locking pattern before the Iquique earthquake. This poses the question of how heterogeneous locking influences upper plate seismicity and how it relates to trench-parallel shortening.","This work was supported by the FONDECYT project 1200170 and the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN) CONICYT/FONDAP project 15110017.

946,pub.1138921473,10.1109/access.2021.3089697,,,Design and Application of a Self-Powered Dual-Stage Circuit for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Systems,"This paper describes the design and practical application of a dual-stage H-Bridge (DSHBR) circuit to reduce the rectification losses and mitigate ripples in piezoelectric energy harvesting. The proposed DSHBR circuit integrates both AC-DC and DC-DC conversion processes using bidirectional switches and a step-up DC-DC converter, which applies to both positive and negative half cycles. One additional feature is that it does not require external power to turn on the bidirectional switches ($\text{V}_{\mathrm {th}} < 0.3$ V). Such feature facilitates active rectification at very low AC voltages ($\text{V}_{\mathrm {ac}} < 0.5$ ) generated by the piezoelectric device (PD). To validate the performance of the proposed circuit, a series of experimental tests were conducted. Firstly, the performance of circuit on rectifying the PD output was investigated using a shaker to generate high and low frequency excitations. Next, real-life testing was conducted with human arm motion as the source of excitation. Then, the ability of the entire system to charge solar batteries was investigated. The outcome shows that the DSHBR circuit prominently increased the rectified voltage and the output power while stabilising the DC voltage when compared with the conventional H-Bridge circuit.","This work was supported in part by Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, Australia.",,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-06-16,2021-01-01,9,,86954-86965,All OA; Gold,Article,"Edla, Mahesh; Lim, Yee Yan; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Mikio, Deguchi","Edla, Mahesh (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, East Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Lim, Yee Yan (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, East Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, East Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Mikio, Deguchi (Department of Electronics and Control Engineering, Niihama College, National Institute of Technology, Niihama, 790-8570, Japan)","Edla, Mahesh (Southern Cross University)","Edla, Mahesh (Southern Cross University); Lim, Yee Yan (Southern Cross University); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Southern Cross University); Mikio, Deguchi (National Institute of Technology)",11,5,,3.49,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09456953.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138921473,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy
170,pub.1140402338,10.3389/fmars.2021.702051,,,High-Frequency Variability of the Surface Ocean Properties Off Central Chile During the Upwelling Season,"The ocean off south-central Chile is subject to seasonal upwelling whose intensity is mainly controlled by the latitudinal migration of the southeast Pacific subtropical anticyclone. During austral spring and summer, the mean flow is equatorward favoring coastal upwelling, but periods of strong southerly winds are intermixed with periods of relaxed southerlies or weak northerly winds (downwelling favorable). This sub-seasonal, high-frequency variability of the coastal winds results in pronounced changes in oceanographic conditions and air-sea heat and gas exchanges, whose quantitative description has been limited by the lack of in-situ monitoring. In this study, high frequency fluctuations of meteorological, oceanographic and biogeochemical near surface variables were analyzed during two consecutive upwelling seasons (2016–17 and 2017–18) using observations from a coastal buoy located in the continental shelf off south-central Chile (36.4°S, 73°W), ∼10 km off the coast. The radiative-driven diel cycle is noticeable in meteorological variables but less pronounced for oceanographic and biogeochemical variables [ocean temperature, nitrate (NO3−), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2sea), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO)]. Fluorescence, as a proxy of chlorophyll-a, showed diel variations more controlled by biological processes. In the synoptic scale, 23 active upwelling events (strong southerlies, lasting between 2 and 15 days, 6 days in average) were identified, alternated with periods of relaxed southerlies of shorter duration (4.5 days in average). Upwelling events were related to the development of an atmospheric low-level coastal jet in response to an intense along-shore pressure gradient. Physical and biogeochemical surface seawater properties responded to upwelling favorable wind stress with approximately a 12-h lag. During upwelling events, SST, DO and pH decrease, while NO3−, pCO2sea, and air-sea fluxes increases. During the relaxed southerly wind periods, opposite tendencies were observed. The fluorescence response to wind variations is complex and diverse, but in many cases there was a reduction in the phytoplankton biomass during the upwelling events followed by higher values during wind relaxations. The sub-seasonal variability of the coastal ocean characterized here is important for biogeochemical and productivity studies.","We appreciate the advice and loan of the SAMI instrument from Mike DeGrandpre (University of Montana, United States).","Funding.

Thus, the present study aims to assess depression levels and their relationship with sleep quality in institutionalized and community older adults.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 220 older people of both sexes, divided into two groups, institutionalized older adults, and community older adults. The older adults were monitored by Community Health Agents (CHA), through identification of everyone in their micro area using a method of random name generation, based on geographic location. Due to the small number of institutionalized older adults, all residents in the institutions were recruited, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess depression and sleep quality.ResultsAmong the 220 older adults, 175 were community members and 45 were institutionalized. The survey revealed that institutionalized older adults had a higher percentage of severe depression compared to community dwelling older adults (p <  0.039).ConclusionOlder adults in the community present greater symptoms of depression and better sleep than institutionalized older adults. There was a direct association between sleep quality and depression. In our sample, being institutionalized and female positively influenced and feeling alone negatively influenced depressive symptoms.",We thank Faculdade de Medicina do ABC for providing support and Acre State Government.,FundingInstitutional Agreement number 007/2015 between Faculdade de Medicina do ABC and Acre State Government.

During the Pisagua earthquake, the TEC changes were detected at the GPS sites located to the north and south of the earthquake epicenter, whereas during the Illapel earthquake, we registered the changes only in the northward direction. Tide-gauge sites mimicked the propagation direction of tsunami waves similar to the TEC change pattern during both earthquakes. The TEC changes were represented by three signals. The initial weaker signal correlated well with Acoustic Rayleigh wave (AWRayleigh), while the following stronger perturbation was interpreted to be caused by Acoustic Gravity wave (AGWepi) and Internal Gravity wave (IGWtsuna) induced by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis respectively. Inevitably, TEC changes can be utilized to evaluate earthquake occurrence and tsunami propagation within a framework of multi-parameter early warning systems.","We thank the one anonymous reviewer and the second reviewer Dr. Giovanni Occhipinti for their constructive comments to improve the quality of the manuscript.

According to Greenpeace International (2018), the packaging “use-and-throw-away” lifestyle has unleashed an emergency that has struck the health of ecosystems and living beings due to the use of plastic. Industries need to speed up their migration from a “linear economy” model, which implies producing, using, and disposing of goods, towards a “circular economy” that maximizes the use of resources and converts their waste into new materials (WEF, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and McKinsey and Company, 2016). A descriptive methodology coupled with content analysis and in-depth interview was applied to characterize the use of PET bottles in the beverage industry in Colombia. The research identified the logistics chain (recycling - warehousing - transformer - producer - distributor - customer - consumption) and found problems in the recycling stage.

The last, not genetically validated, was described as a pygmy-type sub-species, found in low to mid latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Genetic analyses across hemispheres show strong phylogeographic structure, yet low geographic coverage in middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere impeded an assessment within the area, as well as evaluating the validity of B. p. patachonica. New mtDNA sequences from the Southeastern Pacific allowed an improved coverage of the species’ distribution. Our phylogenetic analyses showed three main lineages and contrasting phylogeographic patterns between Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Absence of recurrent female mediated gene flow between hemispheres was found; however, rare dispersal events revealing old migrations were noted. The absence of genetic structure suggests the existence of one single taxa within the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, until further evidence supporting this subspecies can be produced, such as genetic, ecological, behavioral, or morphological data, we propose that all fin whales from the Southern Hemisphere, including those from middle latitudes of the Southeastern Pacific belong to B. p. quoyi subspecies. This information is important for the current assessment of fin whales, contributing to the evaluation of the taxonomic classification and the conservation of the species.","We thank the following people for help with fieldwork Paula López, Aurelio Aguirre, Patricio Ortiz, and Marinella Maldonado.

Although Grade group (GG) is widely accepted as an indicator of prostate cancer grade, there are malignancies that cannot be defined by GG alone. Moreover, the relationship between GG and other parameters remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore the biological characteristics of prostate cancer.
METHODS: This study included 299 radical prostatectomy cases. The Chi-square test and analysis of variance were used to analyze the association of GG with binary and continuous variables. We then conducted morphological analyses. Multivariate analyses were performed to extract the data on risk factors for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and lymph node metastasis.
RESULTS: The lymphatic, venous, perineural, and seminal vesicle invasion rates were 37/299 (12.4%), 25/299 (8.4%), 280/299 (93.6%), and 23/299 (7.7%), respectively. The extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive surgical margin, tertiary Gleason pattern 5, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate gland, and lymph node metastasis rates were 89/299 (29.8%), 106/299 (35.5%), 33/260 (12.7%), 56/299 (18.7%), and 23/299 (7.7%), respectively. As GG increased, various parameters became easier to visualize; however, there were differences between the parameters. Postoperative BCR was observed in 31/242 (12.8%) cases without preoperative hormone therapy; GG2, GG3, GG4, and GG5 accounted for 4, 7, 7, and 13 cases, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that GG and tumor diameter were significant risk factors for early BCR, whereas lymphatic invasion, EPE, and seminal vesicle invasion were significant risk factors for lymph node metastasis. For BCR, the odds ratios (ORs) for GG and tumor diameter were 2.253 (95% confidence interval (CI]): 1.297-3.912; P=0.004) and 1.074 (95% CI: 1.011-1.142; P=0.022), respectively. For lymph node metastasis, ORs for the presence of lymphatic invasion, EPE, and seminal vesicle invasion were 7.425 (95% CI: 1.688-22.583; P=0.004), 4.391 (95% CI: 1.037-18.589; P=0.044), and 5.755 (95% CI: 1.308-25.316; P=0.021), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We summarized various parameters correlating with each GG. Through multivariate analyses, we established the independent risk factors for early BCR and lymph node metastasis. In addition to GG, other important indices of malignancy were determined and weighted to provide a basis for future investigations.",We would like to thank Sachie Osanai and Mitsuyo Yoshihara for their excellent technical support.

Seventy-three women (36.9 ± 13.6 years) who had been victims of domestic violence participated. The analysis was based on their coping strategies, early maladaptive schemes, and their decisions in response to vignettes describing the following domestic violence situations: humiliation to women's maternal identity with children as witnesses and body shaming. We used Student's t and Mann-Whitney tests to compare the results between groups. The participants presented some coping strategies (social support seeking, wishful thinking, and professional support seeking) and several early maladaptive schemes (emotional deprivation, defectiveness/shame, social isolation/alienation, failure to achieve, attachment, and subjugation) associated with their reactions facing a situation of humiliation with children as witnesses. When the humiliation was against the body image, their reactions were associated with some coping strategies (wishful thinking, professional support seeking, autonomy, negative auto-focus coping, and positive reappraisal) and one maladaptive scheme (defectiveness/shame). Women who reacted avoidantly showed higher social and professional support seeking but experienced higher indicators of discomfort and deterioration of self-esteem than those who opted for assertive decisions. The presence of children as witnesses seems to be a factor of stress in the configuration of coping strategies and maladaptive schemes in female victims of domestic violence. The evolution of early maladaptive schemes and coping strategies requires observation to avoid the risk of isolation and permanence in victimizing relationships.",,"The research was funded by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación of the Republic of Colombia in call 761 for “Jóvenes Investigadores e Innovadores, 2016.

Though illegal logging has continued, frames about Brazil's forest policy and management have changed since that time. While until 2010 the successful implementation of forest policies and the resulting decline in deforestation rates were there for all to see and appreciate, the increase in the deforestation rate since then has become the focus of international criticism. With the help of a structured review of international scientific literature, newspaper articles, and programmes initiated by non-governmental organizations' (NGO) and international organizations' (IO), this paper aims to analyse the frames of illegal logging and its governance responses in Brazil since 2012. The review is guided by the framework of diagnostic (What is the problem? Who is to blame?) and prognostic framing (proposed policy and governance solutions). The main findings revealed a master frame of environmental justice that combines injustice toward indigenous people with the victimization of forest and environment at large. Embedded in this master frame, specific frames that follow the institutional logic of the single policy discourses have been identified. Finally, the results show a strong national focus of governance with continued emphasis on command and control instruments.",,"Funding.

One of these SDGs tries to achieve the sustainability of cities, for which we have verified that their resilience is necessary against natural hazards (NH). For the persistence of NH through time on a world scale, it is crucial to train expert technicians in the prevention and control of these risks. For this research, two studies have been made, one focused on research into the training of environmentalists by means of gamification, and the other to verify the potential of this same tool in the NH analysis and management. With this work we have been able to verify that the model of city designed can be an alternative and more sustainable model to the current solutions, also corroborating the usefulness of simulation in their design and its role in the resilience against NH.

Therefore, the ability to predict donor flow has become relevant for hospitals. Although it is possible to predict this behaviour intention from donor questionnaires, the need to reduce social contact in pandemic settings leads to decreasing the extension of these surveys with the minimum loss of predictivity. In this context, this study aims to predict the intention to give blood again, among donors, based on a limited number of attributes. This research uses data science and learning concepts based on symmetry in a particular classification to predict blood donation intent. We carried out a face-to-face survey of Chilean donors based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. These data, including control variables, were analysed using the decision tree technique. The results indicate that it is possible to predict the intention to donate blood again with an accuracy of 84.17% and minimal variables. The added scientific value of this article is to propose a more simplified way of measuring a multi-determined social phenomenon, such as the intention to donate blood again and the application of the decision tree technique to achieve this simplification, thereby contributing to the field of data science.",,"This research was partially funded by Universidad Austral de Chile (CHILE) and Universidad Católica del Norte (CHILE) and supported by ANID-Chile, through the FONDECYT program, grant no. 1210130.",Symmetry,,,,2021-08-10,2021,2021-08-10,,13,8,1460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salazar-Concha, Cristian; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio","Salazar-Concha, Cristian (Administration Institute, Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Universidad Austral de Chile, Independencia 631, Valdivia 5110566, Chile;, cristiansalazar@uach.cl); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile)","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)","Salazar-Concha, Cristian (Austral University of Chile); Ramírez-Correa, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)",9,6,,3.24,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/8/1460/pdf?version=1628574261,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140335478,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Issues related to flora, fauna, and the environment are revised. In the first instance, the origin of the treatment and disposal of marine mining waste in Chile and other countries is studied. The importance of tailings’ valuable elements is analyzed through mineralogy, chemical composition, and oceanographic interactions. Several tailings’ treatments seek to recover valuable minerals and mitigate environmental impacts through leaching, bioleaching, and flotation methods. The analysis was complemented with the particular legislative framework for every country, highlighting those with formal regulations for the disposal of tailings in a marine environment. The available registry on flora and fauna affected by the discharge of toxic metals is explored. As a study case, the “Playa Verde” project is detailed, which recovers copper from marine tailings, and uses phytoremediation to neutralize toxic metals. Countries must regularize the disposal of marine tailings due to the significant impact on the marine ecosystem.

We utilize public data for the consumer price index, the gross domestic product, and the employee and per capita income distributions as inputs for a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation, the solutions to which provide an in-depth analysis of the population dynamics. Specifically, the per capita income distribution stands out as a solution to the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. According to our results, the concavity of employee income distribution is a decisive input parameter and, in contrast to the distributions typically observed for Chile and other countries in Latin America, should ideally be non-negative. Based on the results of our model, we advocate for the implementation of social policies designed to stimulate social mobility by broadening the distribution of higher salaries.","We would like to acknowledge partial financial support from Fondecyt grants 1181558 and 11150182, and Beca de postdoctorado Universidad Católica del Norte No 004/2019&quot;.

The history of tachinid collectors in Chile and authors who have contributed to the systematic knowledge of Chilean tachinids is extensively reviewed. The classification has been updated and 122 genera and 264 species are recognised in Chile. There is a significant amount of endemism with 28 genera and 100 species known only from Chile. There are also 113 species with distributions shared only between Chile and Argentina, particularly in the southern portions of these countries comprising Patagonia. The catalogue is based on examination of the original descriptions of all nominal species and all other references known to us containing relevant taxonomic and distributional information, for a total of approximately 450 references. Many of the name-bearing types and other Chilean specimens housed in collections were examined. Taxa are arranged hierarchically and alphabetically under the categories of subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus (where recognised), and species. Nomenclatural information is provided for genus-group and species-group names, including lists of synonyms (mostly restricted to Neotropical taxa) and name-bearing type data. Species distributions are recorded by country within the New World and by larger geographical divisions in the Old World. Additional information is given in the form of notes and references under valid names at the level of tribe, genus, and species. Two genera are newly recorded from Chile: Chaetoepalpus Vimmer & Soukup, 1940 (Tachinini) (also newly recorded from Argentina) and Patelloa Townsend, 1916 (Goniini). Four species are newly recorded from Chile or other countries: Lyphaornata Aldrich, 1934 (Chile); Chaetoepalpuscoquilleti Vimmer & Soukup, 1940 (Argentina and Chile); Phytomypteraevanescens (Cortés, 1967) (Argentina); and Xanthobasisunicolor Aldrich, 1934 (Chile). Eight species previously recorded from Chile are deemed to have been misidentified or misrecorded from Chile (known distributions in parentheses): Archytasincertus (Macquart, 1851) (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay); Archytasseminiger (Wiedemann, 1830) (Brazil, Colombia); Goniacrassicornis (Fabricius, 1794) (Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Middle America, West Indies, Nearctic); Lespesiaandina (Bigot, 1888) (Cuba); Lespesiaarchippivora (Riley, 1871) (widespread Nearctic and most of Neotropical); Neoethillaignobilis (van der Wulp, 1890) (Mexico, United States); Siphona (Siphona) geniculata (De Geer, 1776) (Palaearctic, Nearctic [introduced]); and Winthemiaquadripustulata (Fabricius, 1794) (Palaearctic, Nearctic, Oriental].

Some of the oceanographic processes at small (<1 km) and submeso (1–10 km) scales manifest themselves as slicks at the sea surface, which might have the potential to concentrate organisms and particles (such as positively buoyant plastics), putting species that feed in these areas at risk of ingesting plastics. Slicks can be filaments, lines, meanders, or patches, which are lighter in color and smoother in surface roughness compared to the surrounding area. Here we tested the hypothesis that passive particles (including plastics) and organisms are aggregated in the surface waters within these slicks. According to their main features (orientation to coast and/or wind), the studied slicks were most likely generated by oceanographic processes such as topographically controlled fronts, other types of fronts and internal waves. Neuston samples were collected from the sea surface inside and outside of slicks (n = 11 sites with slicks) in the coastal waters of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) during two campaigns in austral summer (January 2018) and autumn (April 2019). In general, passive particles, including plastics, exuviae, eggs and foraminiferans, were found more frequently inside than outside the slicks. In some cases, motile zooplankton organisms such as chaetognaths, vertically migrating crustaceans and early developmental stages (EDS) of fish were also more common within the slicks. In addition, a positive relationship was found between plastics and planktonic organisms such as foraminiferans, snails and jellyfish (e.g., Velella velella), although a strong correlation was also found with fish EDS and chaetognaths. These results suggest that surface slicks are areas of aggregation for both passive particles and active organisms, thus playing an important ecological role in food retention and particle concentration where the risk of plastic ingestion by fish and seabirds is enhanced.",We thank Abril Sanchez and Benjamin Aguila for their support in the 2018 samplings in Rapa Nui. We are especially grateful to Friederike Wölke from DAAD RISE Research Internship Program and Sami Jai Wagner Beaulieu from Université Laval for their help in the analysis of zooplankton samples.

Specifically, people at risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have shown to benefit from being physically active. The objective of this study was to explore what factors were associated with low physical activity in people at high risk of T2D living in Bogota and Barranquilla, Colombia. Methodology: Cross-sectional study using baseline data from a quasi-experimental clinical trial (PREDICOL Project). The study included 1,135 participants of Bogota and Barranquilla that presented a high risk of developing T2D according to the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (>12 points) and who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. The main outcome variable was the level of physical activity assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In total, 72.5% of the study participants had low level of physical activity. Participants in the age group between 45 and 54 years showed 74% greater odds of having low physical activity compared with the youngest age group (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.1 -2.8). People living in Barranquilla were eight times more likely to have low physical activity compared with those in Bogotá D.C. (OR 8.1, 95% CI 5.7 to 11.4). Conclusion: A large proportion of the population at risk of developing D2T in two large cities of Colombia have a sedentary lifestyle. Interventions should be designed and implemented in order to increase physical activity in these populations.",,"Funding.

The semaphorin 6B (SEMA6B) gene has been recently reported a causal gene of PME. Independent studies are warranted to further support these findings. Here we report that one nonsense variant in NM_032108.3 exon17 c.2056C > T (p.Gln686∗) and one missense variant in exon14 c.1483G > T (p.Gly495Trp) of SEMA6B, both occurring de novo, underlie early-onset epilepsy with variable severity and different response to treatment in two patients. In vitro analyses have demonstrated that the nonsense variant, p.Gln686∗, results in a truncated protein with remarkably increased expression compared to that of the wild type. The truncated protein presented more homogeneous and failed to locate in the plasma membrane. The missense variant p.Gly495Trp affects evolutionarily conserved amino acid and is located in the sema domain, a key functional domain of SEMA6B. It was predicted to perturb the SEMA6B function by altering the tertiary structure of mutant protein, although neither change of protein length and expression nor difference of cellular distribution was observed. Co-immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated that both variants influence protein binding of SEMA6B and PlxnA2 with varying degrees. Our results provide further evidence to support the initial findings of SEMA6B being causal to epilepsy and indicate that mediating Semaphorin/Plexin signaling is the potential mechanism of the SEMA6B-related disease.",,"Funding.

However, the mechanistic role of lncRNA in glioma progression and tumor immunology remains largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the prognosis of and its immune-related roles in gliomas. The expression levels of MEG3 were analyzed using Oncomine and TIMER database. As an important imprinted gene, the copy number variation (CNV) of MEG3 in both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) were analyzed using GSCALite database, whereas its prognostic significance was assessed using PrognoScan and GEPIA databases. The relationship between MEG3 and tumor-infiltrated immune cells was analyzed using TIMER. Results showed that MEG3 expression was lower in most of the human cancer tissues than in the normal tissues. We also found that heterozygous deletion of MEG3 occurred more frequent than heterozygous amplification in gliomas, and mRNA expression of MEG3 was significantly positively correlated with its CNV in both the GBM and LGG group. Survival analysis showed that the CNV level of MEG3 had significant correlation with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with wild type in LGG. Lower MEG3 expression was related with poor prognosis. Further analysis showed that in GBM, MEG3 expression level was significantly positively correlated with that of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and significantly negatively correlated with that of infiltrating dendritic cells. In LGG, MEG3 expression level was significantly negatively correlated with levels of infiltrating B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Univariate Cox survival analysis demonstrated that only the level of infiltrating dendritic cells significantly affected the survival time of patients with GBM, while all six types of immune cells had a significant effect on the survival time of patients with LGG. Furthermore, MEG3 expression showed strong correlations with multiple immune markers in gliomas, especially in LGG. The current findings suggest that MEG3 expression might serve as a possible prognostic marker and potential immunotherapeutic target for gliomas.",We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.,Funding.

The objective of this review is to evaluate recent findings on the use of RSM in the extraction of compounds from agri-food products. First, the steps for the application of RSM were briefly detailed. According to the analysis performed, RSM is suitable because it evaluates the effects of the independent variables and their interactions on the responses, which is ideal for the optimization of different techniques for the extraction of multiple bioactive compounds and therefore, in the various studies, has allowed to significantly increase the yield and even the biological activities of the extracts; however, RSM has limitations and considering the complexity and dynamics of foods, the challenge is much greater. In this sense, it was determined that simultaneous use with other techniques is necessary in order to optimally describe the process and obtain more accurate results.",,,Current Research in Nutrition and Food Science Journal,,,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2021-12-31,9,3,745-754,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tirado-Kulieva, Vicente Amirpasha; Sánchez-Chero, Manuel; Yarlequé, Mario Villegas; Villegas Aguilar, Gretell Fiorela; Carrión-Barco, Gilberto; Ygnacio Santa Cruz, Abraham Guillermo; Sánchez-Chero, José","Tirado-Kulieva, Vicente Amirpasha (1Facultad de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.); Sánchez-Chero, Manuel (1Facultad de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.); Yarlequé, Mario Villegas (2Facultad de Ingeniería Económica, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.); Villegas Aguilar, Gretell Fiorela (3Facultad de Negocios, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú.); Carrión-Barco, Gilberto (4Carrera de Ingeniería de Sistemas e Informática, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Chiclayo, Peru.); Ygnacio Santa Cruz, Abraham Guillermo (5Escuela Profesional de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru.); Sánchez-Chero, José (2Facultad de Ingeniería Económica, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Sullana, Perú.)",,"Tirado-Kulieva, Vicente Amirpasha (Universidad Nacional de Frontera); Sánchez-Chero, Manuel (Universidad Nacional de Frontera); Yarlequé, Mario Villegas (Universidad Nacional de Frontera); Villegas Aguilar, Gretell Fiorela (Private University of the North); Carrión-Barco, Gilberto (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Ygnacio Santa Cruz, Abraham Guillermo (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo); Sánchez-Chero, José (Universidad Nacional de Frontera)",18,14,,3.13,https://doi.org/10.12944/crnfsj.9.3.03,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144091232,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering",

For greater control of these variables, the use of simulators arises as an alternative. Cooja is a WSN simulator/emulator which handles the devices’ controllers and multiple communication protocol implementations, such as RPL (RPL is one of the most used protocol in IoT). However, Cooja does not consider either the implementation of an energy model (it has infinite energy consumption) nor the visual behavior of the topology construction, although these aspects are crucial for effective network analysis and decision taking. This paper presents the design and the implementation of ViTool-BC, a software built on top of Cooja, which allows the creation of different energy estimation models and also to visualize in real time the behavior of WSN topology construction. In addition, ViTool-BC offers a heat map of energy consumption traces. Therefore, this tool helps researchers to monitor in real time the topology construction, node disconnection, and battery depletion, aspects to be considered in the analysis of the available routing protocols in Cooja.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-08-20,2021,2021-08-20,,11,16,7665,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jabba, Daladier; Acevedo, Pedro","Jabba, Daladier (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Acevedo, Pedro (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia)","Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte)","Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte); Acevedo, Pedro (Universidad del Norte)",9,8,,3.1,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/16/7665/pdf?version=1629461715,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140566228,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This perspective is problematized here. It is suggested that the different formulations of it, though varied, obeyed a similar argument and dependence on closely related theoretical foundations. This approach is compared with that of ontological personalism and the results of the so-called ""post-metaphysical"" attempt to achieve a philosophy of communion that overcomes humanism.

Combining X-ray diffraction analyses, scanning electron microscopy and molecular diversity studies, we have characterized twenty previously unexplored Andean microbial ecosystems in eight different lakes and wetlands from the middle-east and south-east regions of this salt flat. The mats and microbialites studied are mainly formed by calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite) and halite, whereas the endoevaporites are composed predominantly of gypsum and halite. The carbonate-rich mats and microbialites are dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, the most abundant classes are Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. While in the phylum Bacteroidetes, the most abundant classes are Bacteroidia and Rhodothermia. Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia phyla are also well-represented in the majority of these systems. Gypsum endoevaporites, on the contrary, are dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Euryarchaeota phyla. The Cyanobacteria phylum is also abundant in these systems, but it is less represented in comparison to mats and microbialites. Regarding the eukaryotic taxa, diatoms are key structural components in most of the microbial ecosystems studied. The genera of diatoms identified were Achnanthes, Fallacia, Halamphora, Mastogloia, Navicula, Nitzschia, and Surirella. Normally, in the mats and microbialites, diatoms form nano-globular carbonate aggregates with filamentous cyanobacteria and other prokaryotic cells, suggesting their participation in the mineral precipitation process.

Despite the vast literature on the subject, some important aspects, including the sensory and hedonic perception of consumers towards this technology have not been properly addressed. In this study, consumer attitudes toward expected acceptance, pricing and purchase intention of guava juice processed with ultrasound technology were analyzed by using the conjoint analysis. The holistic perception of guava juice using projective mapping was also evaluated. The results indicate that consumers have greater acceptance and purchase intention for products that inform them of the benefits of the ultrasound process, while purchase intention was mainly influenced by the lowest price. Moreover, the product information regarding the ultrasound technology -displayed on individual packages- was a predominant factor which also served as a criterion for grouping the stimuli.

Fruits: An Atlas of Metabolites With Biotechnological Significance,"The whole genome of Weissella cibaria strain UTNGt21O isolated from wild fruits of Solanum quitoense (naranjilla) shrub was sequenced and annotated. The similarity proportions based on the genus level, as a result of the best hits for the entire contig, were 54.84% with Weissella, 6.45% with Leuconostoc, 3.23% with Lactococcus, and 35.48% no match. The closest genome was W. cibaria SP7 (GCF_004521965.1) with 86.21% average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 3.2% alignment coverage. The genome contains 1,867 protein-coding genes, among which 1,620 were assigned with the EggNOG database. On the basis of the results, 438 proteins were classified with unknown function from which 247 new hypothetical proteins have no match in the nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) database. It also contains 78 tRNAs, six copies of 5S rRNA, one copy of 16S rRNA, one copy of 23S rRNA, and one copy of tmRNA. The W. cibaria UTNGt21O strain harbors several genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, cellular process, general stress responses, cofactors, and vitamins, conferring probiotic features. A pangenome analysis indicated the presence of various strain-specific genes encoded for proteins responsible for the defense mechanisms as well as gene encoded for enzymes with biotechnological value, such as penicillin acylase and folates; thus, W. cibaria exhibited high genetic diversity. The genome characterization indicated the presence of a putative CRISPR-Cas array and five prophage regions and the absence of acquired antibiotic resistance genes, virulence, and pathogenic factors; thus, UTNGt21O might be considered a safe strain. Besides, the interaction between the peptide extracts from UTNGt21O and Staphylococcus aureus results in cell death caused by the target cell integrity loss and the release of aromatic molecules from the cytoplasm. The results indicated that W. cibaria UTNGt21O can be considered a beneficial strain to be further exploited for developing novel antimicrobials and probiotic products with improved technological characteristics.","The authors are thankful to the Centre of Research (CUICYT), Technical University of the North, Ecuador, for funding the work.

Fecundity as a trait does not evolve independently, and rather interacts with other traits such as body and egg size. Here, our aim was to correctly infer the macroevolutionary trade-offs between body length, egg length, and potential fecundity, using cephalopods as study model. The correlated evolution among those traits was inferred by comparative phylogenetic methods. Literature data on biological and reproductive traits (body length, egg length, and potential fecundity) was obtained for 90 cephalopod species, and comparative phylogenetic methods based on a previous molecular phylogeny were used to test the correlated evolution hypothesis. Additionally, we estimated the phylogenetic signal and fitted five different evolutionary models to each trait. All traits showed high phylogenetic signal, and the selected model suggested an evolutionary trend toward increasing body length, egg length, and fecundity in relation to the ancestral state. Evidence of correlated evolution between body length and fecundity was observed, although this relationship was not detected between body length and egg length. The robust inverse relationship between fecundity and egg length indicates that cephalopods evolved a directional selection that favored an increase of fecundity and a reduction of egg length in larger species, or an increase in egg length with the concomitant reduction of fecundity and body length in order to benefit offspring survival. The use of phylogenetic comparative methods allowed us to properly detect macroevolutionary trade-offs.","Thanks to Annie Lindgren for providing her published phylogenetic tree.

To design and implement more effective and democratic risk reduction programs, calls for transdisciplinary approaches have recently increased. However, little attention has been paid to the actual articulation of transdisciplinary methods and their associated challenges. To fill this gap, we draw on the case of the 1993 Quebrada de Macul disaster, Chile, to propose what we label as the Geo-Social Model. This experimental methodology aims at integrating recursive interactions between geological and social factors configuring landslide for more robust and inclusive analyses and interventions. It builds upon three analytical blocks or site-specific environments in constant co-determination: (1) The geology and geomorphology of the study area; (2) the built environment, encompassing infrastructural, urban, and planning conditions; and (3) the sociocultural environment, which includes community memory, risk perceptions, and territorial organizing. Our results are summarized in a geo-social map that systematizes the complex interactions between the three environments that facilitated the Quebrada de Macul flow-type landslide. While our results are specific to this event, we argue that the Geo-Social Model can be applied to other territories. In our conclusions, we suggest, first, that landslides in urban contexts are often the result of anthropogenic disruptions of natural balances and systems, often related to the lack of place-sensitive urban planning. Second, that transdisciplinary approaches are critical for sustaining robust and politically effective landslide risk prevention plans. Finally, that inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches to landslide risk prevention need to be integrated into municipal-level planning for a better understanding of—and prevention of—socio-natural hazards.","We thank the generosity of our collaborators and territorial organizations that actively work on the study area: Volunteer Forestry Brigade Alto La Florida (BEAF), National Forestry Corporation (CONAF), Defense Movement for access to Water, Land and the Protection of the Environment (MODATIMA), Alluvion Territorial Assembly (ATA), Intercultural Center Quebrada de Macul (CIQMA), Neighborhood Council “El Esfuerzo”, Exclusion Zone leaderships, MAPUCHE community of Quebrada de Macul and the inhabitants of “Toma Dignidad”.

Service infrastructure support for e-learning has moved to the cloud. For this reason, the efficient provisioning of resources for such platforms, which is achieved through prediction, is very relevant. The existing techniques for predicting the use of resources in the cloud are not designed with e-learning’s specific requirements. This paper presents a neural network-based model for predicting the usage of computational resources for e-learning platforms. This model consists of a series of interconnected neural networks used to predict values for variables of interest, such as Random Access Memory (RAM) usage and Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage. Using data collected from a high school real scenario, we analyzed and used it to train and validate our neural network-based model. This scenario consisted of a Moodle server deployed in a Google Virtual Machine with a configured course and its contents. Each student performed a series of activities while connected to it.

Currently, the standards and guidelines (existing) do not adequately standardize the production process (molding procedures) under laboratory conditions. This fact hinders its correct application in the field since it does not have enough parameters to verify at least the compacting of the material (unit weight in the field). Compaction has a great influence on pervious concrete (PC) properties: porosity, permeability, and consequently, mechanical strength. Thus, this study aims to propose procedure standardization for molding cylindrical and prismatic specimens of PC (in laboratory conditions) using the unit weight like control parameter. The standard procedure chosen was the proctor hummer (2.5 kg and 305 mm of heigh fall), due to its ease and good results (low variability), both in the cylindrical specimens and in the prismatic ones where the point of application of the compaction blows was also defined. Finally, an experimental program was carried out to verify the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the produced PC, and the compliance of the standards was verified. Then it was verified that the proposed molding procedure produces PC within the standard parameters. Additionally, a control abacus related to the unit weight and the porosity (input data) was proposed to determine the number of blows to compact the PC, giving the opportunity to choose a porosity, and as a consequence, a prediction of the strength, facilitating the production process, depending on the final application of the material.",The authors acknowledge the State University of Londrina (UEL); the CAPES for the financial support; the CNPQ for the productivity scholarship; the Paraná Federal Institute – IFPR – Foz do Iguaçu Campus; the UDC University Center; and the ITAIPU BINACIONAL for the laboratories and for the technical support.,,Case Studies in Construction Materials,,,,2021-12,2021,,2021-12,15,Constr.

From the Positive Youth Development approach, the promotion of personal protective factors takes on special importance against some risks, such as the consumption of addictive substances. (2) Methods: This research is one of the first to study the role of trait and ability emotional intelligence in relation to cannabis use and with respect to other personal variables of protection, such as coping styles and assertiveness. For this purpose, a final sample of 799 schoolchildren was obtained. (3) Results: After controlling for age and gender, the results of the regression analyses revealed that emotional perception, emotional facilitation, emotional clarity, emotional repair, active coping style, and assertiveness were inversely and significantly associated with cannabis use behaviors. On the other hand, the emotional attention and avoidant coping style factors were positively and significantly associated with these behaviors. (4) Conclusions: These findings provide new evidence that could be useful in terms of guiding health-promoting clinical and educational interventions at an early age.",Our most sincere thanks to all the students and teaching staff who have collaborated with their efforts in this study.,This study received external funding by the University of Cantabria Program for Research Staff in Predoctoral Training (CVE-2016-11670).,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Albert Espelt, Marina Bosque-Prous, Paul B.

Un estudio experimental,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the world, a problem that has been steadily increasing in recent years for the adolescent population. In particular, suicidal ideation has been strongly associated with suicide attempt, a direct predictor of suicide; however, few strategies to decrease suicidal ideation designed primarily for depression are found. Considering the therapeutic possibilities of Zimbardo's theory on balanced time perspective, in the present study a brief intervention for adolescents based on that theory was designed with the aim of evaluating the effect of a time perspective intervention on the modification of indicators of suicidal ideation and behavior in adolescents. Thus, an experimental study was conducted, where 82 participants aged 15 to 19 were assigned to either an experimental intervention or a control group. The participants of the experimental group (n = 43) engaged in eight sessions of the time perspective intervention program called ""Serenity"". Pre-post measurements were made on the variables of suicidal ideation (Okasha), time profile (ZTPI) and quality of life (SF36). Results show that the intervention reduces suicidal ideation by 41%; and that, possibly, it improves the physical health of those who receive this type of treatment. The results are a promising advance for preventive purposes in educational and health contexts.",,,Acta Colombiana de Psicología,,,,2021-02-17,2021,2021-02-17,,24,1,63-71,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oyanadel, Cristián; Carrasco-Correa, Héctor; Latorre-Nanjarí, Javier; Peñate-Castro, Wenceslao; Sepúlveda-Queipul, Camilo","Oyanadel, Cristián (Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile); Carrasco-Correa, Héctor (Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Latorre-Nanjarí, Javier (Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile); Peñate-Castro, Wenceslao (Universidad de La Laguna, La Laguna, España); Sepúlveda-Queipul, Camilo (Hospital de La Serena, La Serena, Chile)",,"Oyanadel, Cristián (University of Concepción); Carrasco-Correa, Héctor (Catholic University of the North); Latorre-Nanjarí, Javier (University of La Serena); Peñate-Castro, Wenceslao (University of La Laguna); Sepúlveda-Queipul, Camilo (Hospital la Serena)",8,4,,2.98,https://actacolombianapsicologia.ucatolica.edu.co/article/download/2794/3567,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135432425,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The major functions of HSP27 include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides and protecting cells from toxic stress. Dysregulation of stress proteins is associated with many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by the presence of aggregates of α-synuclein in the central and peripheral nervous system, which induces the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and in the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic dysfunction is an important non-motor phenotype of PD, which includes cardiovascular dysregulation, among others. Nowadays, the therapies for PD focus on dopamine (DA) replacement. However, certain non-motor symptoms with a great impact on quality of life do not respond to dopaminergic drugs; therefore, the development and testing of new treatments for non-motor symptoms of PD remain a priority. Since small HSP27 was shown to prevent α-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, this protein might constitute a suitable target to prevent or delay the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. In the first part of our review, we focus on the cardiovascular dysregulation observed in PD patients. In the second part, we present data on the possible role of HSP27 in preventing the accumulation of amyloid fibrils and aggregated forms of α-synuclein. We also include our own studies, highlighting the possible protective cardiac effects induced by L-DOPA treatment through the enhancement of HSP27 levels and activity.",,"This research was funded by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Science (SAF/FEDER2013-49076-P, FIS PI10 02827) and Fundación Séneca (20847/PI/18).",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,Nikolai B.

To explore the association between metal exposure and alterations in glucose metabolism, inflammatory status, and oxidative stress in individuals with chronic exposure to metals, a cross-sectional study was performed with 25 volunteers, between 45-65 years old. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure urinary levels of total arsenic (As) and its metabolites, cooper, nickel, chromium, and lead. Lipid profile, glucose, and insulin were measured in blood, as well as inflammation (interleukin-6, IL-6) and oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) markers. Increased levels of Low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol and 8-OHdG, and the index for homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were observed in 72%, 60%, and 56% of the volunteers, respectively. Blood-glucose levels were correlated with dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.019), inorganic As (Asi) (R2 = 0.40, p = 0.012), and Ni (R2 = 0.56; p = 0.044). The models with these compounds explained 72% of the glycemia variability (βDMA = -6.47; βAsi = 6.68; βNi = 6.87). Ni showed a significantly influence on IL-6 variability (β = 0.85: R2 = 0.36). Changes in glycemia could be related to exposure to low levels of Asi and Ni, representing risk factors for metabolic diseases. Body mass index would confuse the relation between IL-6 and Ni levels, probably due to known chronic inflammation present in obese people.","We are grateful to the Chañaral community for their participation.

251,pub.1141292067,10.3390/min11091023,,,Incorporation of Geometallurgical Input into Gold Mining System Simulation to Control Cyanide Consumption,"The Alhué deposit (Melipilla, Chile) is an example of a hydrothermal Au-Ag-Zn(-Pb) vein system hosted within the volcanic rocks of the Las Chilcas Formation. The dominant ore minerals observed are free electrum and native gold associated with silver sulfosalts, and with magnetite and base metal sulphides, including pyrite +/− sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite. The alteration assemblage in the veins mainly consists of quartz epidote-chlorite-actinolite with lesser smectite, amphibole, and calcite-kaolinite-garnet. Mineralized veins also contain variable amounts of base metals, some of which (e.g., copper and iron) are considered harmful to the extraction of precious metals. Iron and especially copper minerals are known cyanide consumers; ore type classification schemes that do not consider the detrimental effects of such mineralogy or process elements can ultimately result in metal losses from ore feed restrictions, as well as spikes in cyanide consumption and higher operating costs. Mineralogical and geological variation can nonetheless be managed by applying alternating modes of operation as demonstrated in this paper; the decision to switch between modes is governed by current and forecasted stockpile levels feeding into the process. Simulations based on experiences at the Alhué deposit are provided that demonstrate the importance of standardized operational modes and their potential impact on cyanide consumption control.","The authors thank the staff at the Florida Mine (Alhué, Chile) for their assistance and support in conceptualizing and describing their operational problems and providing preliminary data.

These companies reported their financial statements to the Superintendency of Companies during 2019. Out of the total sample, 65 companies comply with the ongoing business hypothesis. A logistic regression model was applied. This model considered 9 indicators that were classified in liquidity, profitability and indebtedness Results y discussion: that the main result of this study was that the financial ratios used are assertive and manage to evaluate the ongoing concern assumption, showing statistical significance in 7 of the 9 established indicators. These results allow companies not only to detect shortcomings in their continuity, but also determine in which variables they must have continuous control in order to avoid the possibility of not fulfilling the ongoing concern assumption Conclusions: It was concluded that the indicators used help to determine whether or not a company complies with the ongoing concern assumption and thus identify the accounting framework that should be applied",,,Desarrollo Gerencial,,,,2021-12-17,2021,2021-12-17,,13,2,1-24,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mejía, Diego Andrés Correa; Palacios, María Camila Murillo; Cardona, Natalia Vélez","Mejía, Diego Andrés Correa (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Palacios, María Camila Murillo (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Cardona, Natalia Vélez (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia)",,"Mejía, Diego Andrés Correa (University of Antioquia); Palacios, María Camila Murillo (University of Antioquia); Cardona, Natalia Vélez (University of Antioquia)",5,3,,2.9,https://doi.org/10.17081/dege.13.2.4882,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143985055,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",

Introducing novel dynamical variables, and a dimensionless time variable, the resulting dynamical system is studied. The main difficulties arising in the standard dynamical systems approach, where expansion normalized dynamical variables are usually adopted, are due to the oscillations entering the nonlinear system through the Klein–Gordon (KG) equations. This motivates the analysis of the oscillations using methods from the theory of averaging nonlinear dynamical systems. We prove that time-dependent systems, and their corresponding time-averaged versions, have the same late-time dynamics. Then, we study the time-averaged system using standard techniques of dynamical systems.

We use methods from non-linear dynamical systems theory and averaging theory considering a time-dependent perturbation function D. We define a regular dynamical system over a compact phase space, obtaining global results. That is, for KS metric the global late-time attractors of full and time-averaged systems are two anisotropic contracting solutions, which are non-flat locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Kasner and Taub (flat LRS Kasner) for 0≤γ≤2$$0\le \gamma \le 2$$, and flat FLRW matter-dominated universe if 0≤γ≤23$$0\le \gamma \le \frac{2}{3}$$. For closed FLRW metric late-time attractors of full and averaged systems are a flat matter-dominated FLRW universe for 0≤γ≤23$$0\le \gamma \le \frac{2}{3}$$ as in KS and Einstein–de Sitter solution for 0≤γ<1$$0\le \gamma <1$$. Therefore, a time-averaged system determines future asymptotics of the full system. Also, oscillations entering the system through Klein–Gordon (KG) equation can be controlled and smoothed out when D goes monotonically to zero, and incidentally for the whole D-range for KS and closed FLRW (if 0≤γ<1$$0\le \gamma < 1$$) too. However, for γ≥1$$\gamma \ge 1$$ closed FLRW solutions of the full system depart from the solutions of the averaged system as D is large.

Here, we present a new approach to unravel the bacterial phylogeographic patterns combining community-wide survey by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and intra-species resolution through the oligotyping method, allowing robust estimations of genetic and phylogeographic indices, and migration parameters. As a proof-of-concept, we focused on the bacterial genus Spirochaeta across three distant biogeographic provinces of the Southern Ocean; maritime Antarctica, sub-Antarctic Islands, and Patagonia. Each targeted Spirochaeta operational taxonomic units were characterized by a substantial intrapopulation microdiversity, and significant genetic differentiation and phylogeographic structure among the three provinces. Gene flow estimations among Spirochaeta populations support the role of the Antarctic Polar Front as a biogeographic barrier to bacterial dispersal between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic provinces. Conversely, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current appears as the main driver of gene flow, connecting sub-Antarctic Islands with Patagonia and maritime Antarctica. Additionally, historical processes (drift and dispersal limitation) govern up to 86% of the spatial turnover among Spirochaeta populations. Overall, our approach bridges the gap between microbial and macrobial ecology by revealing strong congruency with macroorganisms distribution patterns at the populational level, shaped by the same oceanographic structures and ecological processes.","We thank Peter Beerli and Franz-Sebastian Krah for their technical supports.

For the service sector and, particularly for the retail industry, we initially propose a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model that determines how many employees should be multiskilled, in which and how many departments they should be trained, and how their weekly working hours will be assigned. Then, the deterministic model is reformulated using a two-stage stochastic optimization (TSSO) model to explicitly incorporate the uncertain personnel demand. The methodology is tested for a case study using real and simulated data derived from a Chilean retail store. We also compare the TSSO approach solutions with the myopic approaches' solutions (i.e., zero and total multiskilling). The case study is oriented to answer two key questions: how much multiskilling to add and how to add it. Results show that TSSO approach solutions always report maximum reliability for all levels of demand variability considered. It was also observed that, for high levels of demand variability, a k-chaining policy with k≥2 is more cost-effective than a 2-chaining policy. Finally, to evaluate the conservatism level in the solutions reported by the TSSO approach, two truncation types in the probability density function (pdf) associated with the personnel demand were considered. Results show that, if the pdf is only truncated at zero (more conservative truncation) the levels of required multiskilling are higher than when the pdf is truncated at 5th and 95th percentiles (less conservative truncation).",,,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,,,Cost-Benefit Analysis; Policy; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,2021,19,1,892-917,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mercado, Yessica Andrea; Henao, César Augusto; González, Virginia I.","Mercado, Yessica Andrea (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

Explorations of deep-water ecosystems have been limited in this region, and elsewhere globally. To characterize community composition of mesophotic and deep-sea demersal fauna at seamounts in the region, we conducted expeditions to Rapa Nui (RN) and Salas y Gómez (SyG) islands in 2011 and Desventuradas Islands in 2013. Remote autonomous baited-cameras were used to conduct stationary video surveys between 150-1,850 m at RN/SyG (N = 20) and 75-2,363 m at Desventuradas (N = 27). Individual organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and relative abundance was quantified with the maximum number of individuals per frame. Deployments were attributed with associated environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, seamount age, and bathymetric position index [BPI]).

For fishes, dogfish sharks (Squalidae) accounted for the greatest dissimilarity between subregions (18.27%), with mean abundances of 2.26 ± 2.49 at Desventuradas, an order of magnitude greater than at RN/SyG (0.21 ± 0.54). Depth, seamount age, broad-scale BPI, and nitrate explained most of the variation in both invertebrate (R2 = 0.475) and fish (R2 = 0.419) assemblages. Slightly more than half the deployments at Desventuradas (N = 14) recorded vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa such as corals and sponges. Our study supports mounting evidence that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are areas of high biodiversity and high conservation value. While Chile and Peru have recently established or proposed marine protected areas in this region, the majority of these ridges lie outside of national jurisdictions and are under threat from overfishing, plastic pollution, climate change, and potential deep-sea mining. Given its intrinsic value, this region should be comprehensively protected using the best available conservation measures to ensure that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges remain a globally unique biodiversity hotspot.","The expeditions were funded by the National Geographic Society and Pristine Seas donors with support to AMF.

The architecture includes the function SIGMA, an objective function used in IoT applications to take routing decisions. This research represents an effort to relate IoT and SDN. This association was developed using RPL-SIGMA to solve various IoT and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) problems. At the end, a comparison between SBR (SDN-RPL with SIGMA) and SDN-RPL (without SIGMA) was included. The simulations show that SBR has a better performance concerning packet loss, latency, and energy consumption over an architecture based on IoT without SIGMA. The simulation also demonstrates that SDN can be used to manage the IoT network efficiently.",This work was supported by Universidad del Norte and Universidad Simón Bolívar.,,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-08-24,2021-01-01,9,,119977-119986,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sanmartin, Paul; Avila, Karen; Valle, Sebastian; Gomez, Javier; Jabba, Daladier","Sanmartin, Paul (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080002, Colombia; System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Avila, Karen (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Valle, Sebastian (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Gomez, Javier (Department of Telecomunication Engineering, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Coyoacan, Ciudad de México, D.F. 04510, Mexico); Jabba, Daladier (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia)","Sanmartin, Paul (Universidad Simón Bolívar; Universidad del Norte)","Sanmartin, Paul (Universidad Simón Bolívar; Universidad del Norte); Avila, Karen (Universidad del Norte); Valle, Sebastian (Universidad del Norte); Gomez, Javier (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Jabba, Daladier (Universidad del Norte)",8,6,,2.75,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09521214.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140660434,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

It focused on the qualitative analysis component of the Chemistry course, which for students has been perceived as being the most difficult aspect of their mastery of the subject. Methodology – The study involved 120 secondary four science stream students from two local fully residential schools. In a quasi-experiment, participants studied the topic of qualitative analysis of salt, using one of the following three instructional methods: Experiment, DARTs, and Combination of Experiment and DARTs. The participants in the three groups were then tested on their knowledge about salt. Findings – Results of a two-way independent ANOVA performed on the experiment data revealed a significant main effect corresponding to the type of instructional method that the three groups were treated to — the mean scores for the Combined method group was the highest, followed by the DARTs group, and then the Experiment group. Further analysis using an independent t-test showed that the difference in mean scores between the DARTs and Experiment groups was significant. It is argued that participants’ learning in the Combined method group might have been enhanced by the DARTs instructional method. The effect of gender and the interaction effect between the variables were not significant. Significance – The findings of the study has provided clear experimental evidence regarding the role of the DARTs instructional method in enhancing qualitative analysis learning in chemistry. These findings also provided important insights to educators on DARTs as an alternative method of teaching and learning the topic on qualitative analysis in chemistry.",,,Malaysian Journal of Learning and Instruction,,,,2021-01-31,2021,2021-01-31,,18,Number 1,157-181,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shamsulbahri, Mohamad Mahathir; Zulkiply, Norehan","Shamsulbahri, Mohamad Mahathir (Faculty of Cognitive Sciences and Human Development, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia); Zulkiply, Norehan (Faculty of Cognitive Sciences and Human Development, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia)",,"Shamsulbahri, Mohamad Mahathir (Universiti Malaysia Sarawak); Zulkiply, Norehan (Universiti Malaysia Sarawak)",3,3,,2.75,https://e-journal.uum.edu.my/index.php/mjli/article/download/mjli2021.18.1.7/2919/38207,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134777963,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

In addition, there are delay-sensitive applications that require establishing communication paths as soon as possible to mitigate low network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, reducing, at the same time, the energy consumption of the network. For this reason, we propose a multiobjective mathematical optimization model for finding the optimal communication path between a source node and a sink (base station) considering hard scenarios where all network nodes are mobile and minimizing end-to-end delay and energy consumption. This mathematical model would offer significant advantages to evaluate new algorithms due to we could know how far or close are the algorithm results from the optimal values given by the mathematical model. In addition, we propose a prediction distributed routing algorithm based on Markov Chains that takes into account the network mobility in order to find as fast as possible a communication path between a source node and a sink with minimal energy consumption. We also propose a deep learning approach to predict future nodes’ distances in a mobile network to determine if future movements of nodes will cause communication disruptions in paths. Significant findings were obtained when the Markov Chains and Deep Learning approaches were compared in terms of predicting nodes mobility and reducing the delay and the energy consumption in the network. The performance of our prediction algorithms (Markov Chains and Deep Learning approaches) is evaluated against the mathematical model to determine how good it is. Finally, to analyze our prediction algorithms considering real online scenarios, we compared it against typical routing algorithms, obtaining promising results in terms of delay and energy consumption in all mobile node scenarios.","This work was supported by the Vice Presidency for Research and Creation Publication fund at the Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.",,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-11-02,2021-01-01,9,,153382-153400,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montoya, Germán A.; Lozano-Garzon, Carlos; Donoso, Yezid","Montoya, Germán A.

194,pub.1138415728,10.3390/met11060873,,,The Effects of Sulphuric Acid and Sodium Chloride Agglomeration and Curing on Chalcopyrite Leaching,"An option to improve the leaching efficiency of chalcopyrite is pretreatment prior to leaching. Pretreatment variables, such as the curing time and the addition of chloride, can increase the kinetics of copper extraction, particularly for sulphide ores. However, there has been little research on the topic. The reactions that govern this phenomenon have not been clearly identified. In this study, the effects of sulphuric acid and sodium chloride agglomeration and curing on chalcopyrite leaching were evaluated at various temperatures: 25, 50, 70, and 90 °C. The pretreated ore and leach residues were characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and reflected light microscopy. Under the conditions of 15 kg/t of H2SO4, 25 kg/t of NaCl, and 15 days of curing time (as pretreatment), the following products were identified: CuSO4, NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6, Cu2Cl(OH), and S0. Increasing the curing time and leaching temperature increased copper leaching. The copper extraction was 94% when leaching at 90 °C after pretreatment with 50 g/L of Cl− and 0.2 M of H2SO4. Elemental sulphur, jarosite, and copper polysulphide (CuS2) were detected in the leaching residues.","The authors thank the Universitat de Barcelona and the Universidad Católica del Norte for the opportunity and funding provided to conduct this research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: This was a retrospective cohort, that used information collected from clinical records and official epidemiological surveillance systems (NOTIWEB, SISCOVID and SINADEF), on hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Information was collected on sociodemographic and clinical factors, considering discharge (death/survival) and days of hospitalization as outcomes.
RESULTS.: The in-hospital fatality rate was 39.6%, and significant differences were found between hospitalization time and status at discharge in people over 60 years of age (p<0.001). Age older than 60 years (HR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.76-4.68),) unattended ICU bed request (HR: 3.49; 95% CI: 2.02-6.05), oxygen saturation less than 80% at admission (HR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.35-5.53) and the use of ivermectin (HR: 1.68; 95%CI 1.06-2.68) were factors associated with lethality. The chosen ML model considered that the most important variables were oxygen saturation, age over 60 years, time of hospitalization and time of the onset of symptoms.
CONCLUSION.: The factors that could increase lethality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were age, oxygen saturation less than 80%, use of ivermectin as part of hospital treatment and unattended request for ICU beds.

The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines produced during immunological responses contributes to disease prognosis and progression. Parasite tissue persistence can induce chronic inflammatory stimuli, which can cause long-term tissue injury and fibrosis. Chronic Chagas' patients exhibit increased levels of interleukin (IL)-9, an important cytokine in the regulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic processes. Data on the role of IL-9 in other pathologies are sometimes contradictory, and few studies have explored this cytokine's influence in Chagas' disease pathology. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of IL-9 in the progression of T. cruzi infection in vivo and in vitro. In vitro infection demonstrated that IL-9 reduced the number of infected cells and decreased the multiplication of intracellular amastigotes in both C2C12 myoblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages. In myoblasts, the increased production of nitric oxide (NO) was essential for reduced parasite multiplication, whereas macrophage responses resulted in increased IL-6 and reduced TGF-β levels, indicating that parasite growth restriction mechanisms induced by IL-9 were cell-type specific. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice with T. cruzi trypomastigotes of the Y strain implicated a major role of IL-9 during the chronic phase, as increased Th9 and Tc9 cells were detected among splenocytes; higher levels of IL-9 in these cell populations and increased cardiac IL-9 levels were detected compared to those of uninfected mice. Moreover, rIL9 treatment decreased serum IL-12, IL-6, and IL-10 levels and cardiac TNF-α levels, possibly attempting to control the inflammatory response. IL-9 neutralization increased cardiac fibrosis, synthesis of collagens I and III, and mastocyte recruitment in BALB/c heart tissue during the chronic phase. In conclusion, our data showed that IL-9 reduced the invasion and multiplication of T. cruzi in vitro, in both myoblasts and macrophages, favoring disease control through cell-specific mechanisms. In vivo, IL-9 was elevated during experimental chronic infection in BALB/c mice, and this cytokine played a protective role in the immunopathological response during this phase by controlling cardiac fibrosis and proinflammatory cytokine production.",We thank Wiley Editing Services for the careful English review and Daniela Teixeira for the flow cytometry critical help and analysis.,"This work was supported by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) (2016/15000-4 and 2017/17103-8), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,,"Animals; Chagas Disease; Cytokines; Humans; Interleukin-9; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Trypanosoma cruzi",2021-10-15,2021,2021-10-15,,11,,756521,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva; Orikaza, Cristina Mary; de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues; dos Santos, Luana Aguiar; Salu, Bruno Ramos; Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela; de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita; Mortara, Renato Arruda","de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); dos Santos, Luana Aguiar (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Salu, Bruno Ramos (Biochemistry Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela (Biochemistry Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita (Electronic Microscopy Center, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil)","Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Federal University of São Paulo); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Federal University of São Paulo)","de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva (Federal University of São Paulo); Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Federal University of São Paulo); de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues (Federal University of São Paulo); dos Santos, Luana Aguiar (Federal University of São Paulo); Salu, Bruno Ramos (Federal University of São Paulo); Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela (Federal University of São Paulo); de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita (Federal University of São Paulo); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Federal University of São Paulo)",6,3,0.62,2.71,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.756521/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141910784,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In the light of current discussions on the vaccinations of children it seems necessary to better identify children who are immune against SARS-CoV-2 due to a previous infection and to better understand COVID-19 related immune reactions in children. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, children aged 1-17 were recruited through primary care pediatricians for the study (a) randomly, if they had an appointment for a regular health check-up or (b) if parents and children volunteered and actively wanted to participate in the study. Symptoms were recorded and two antibody tests were performed in parallel directed against S (in house test) and N (Roche Elecsys) viral proteins. In children with antibody response in either test, neutralization activity was determined. Results: We identified antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 162 of 2,832 eligible children (5.7%) between end of May and end of July 2020 in three, in part strongly affected regions of Bavaria in the first wave of the pandemic. Approximately 60% of antibody positive children (n = 97) showed high levels (>97th percentile) of antibodies against N-protein, and for the S-protein, similar results were found. Sufficient neutralizing activity was detected for only 135 antibody positive children (86%), irrespective of age and sex. Initial COVID-19 symptoms were unspecific in children except for the loss of smell and taste and unrelated to antibody responses or neutralization capacity. Approximately 30% of PCR positive children did not show seroconversion in our small subsample in which PCR tests were performed. Conclusions: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are unspecific in children and antibody responses show a dichotomous structure with strong responses in many and no detectable antibodies in PCR positive children and missing neutralization activity in a relevant proportion of the young population.","We are grateful to all participants for their bravery in giving blood and their parents for their great support, the Bavarian red cross for support in Tirschenreuth and especially Mr. Schedel; the students who helped organizing the study, packing study sets, transporting sets and samples across the study areas; the assistants and helpers in all pediatric outpatient clinics who did a tremendous job on top of their routine work; all lab personal in the involved laboratories for extra and weekend hours; and Birgit Kulawik for providing graphic design.

These textile samples have been subjected to treatment by the exhaustion method using zinc oxide nanoparticles (NP ZnO) (textile functionalization) with the aim of improving their efficiency in blocking UV radiation. The ZnO nanoparticles have been obtained by two methods: The green or also called biosynthesis (using the extract of Coriandrum sativum as an organic reducing agent), and the chemical method (using NaOH as an inorganic reducing agent). The results related to the green method show having achieved a defined geometric configuration with an average size of 97.77 nm (SD: 9.53). On the contrary, the nanostructures obtained by the chemical method show pentagonal configurations with average sizes of 113 nm (SD: 6.72).

Currently, the greatest limitation for the culture is the low survival in the paralarval phase. One of the causes of mortality is cannibalism, which is triggered by overcrowding and lack of food. The objective of this study was to determine the balance point between food availability and paralarvae density for reducing cannibalism in the first 30 days of culture, where the highest mortality rates have been observed for E. megalocyathus. For this, densities of 1, 5, 10 and 15 paralarvae L−1 combined with the availability of 0, 2, 5 and 10 preys paralarvae−1 day−1 were tested, evaluating both performance and cannibalism. The results showed no effect of paralarval culture density on the variables studied, but there was a significant effect of prey availability on paralarvae survival, as on cannibalism and food intake of them. The cannibalism was minimized both in low and high paralarvae densities, when the prey availability was increased, reducing cannibalism to values lower than 5% of the total mortality.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo ANID‐Chile, the doctoral grant CONICYT 21140393 of V.

Bouyant eggs, from natural spawning, were collected from the conditioning rearing tank where wild-broodstocks were stocked for over a year in a recirculation system. The viable eggs were distributed among three aquariums to investigate the morphological and morphometric characteristics of the larval development periods that were unknown before this investigation. We described that the larval development periods extended to 519 h for the pre-juvenile stages and from 519 to 591 h for the juvenile stage. The total reabsorption of the oil globule occurred between 81 and 108 h, and this description corresponds to a differentiating characteristic of S. chiliensis chiliensis since it would now be one of the three Sarda species that presents a single oil globule in the larval period. Allometric growth patterns showed that the eyes, mouth, and head developed faster than other bodily characters. Therefore, the larvae are prioritizing for a fully-functional mouth when they enter the exogenous feeding stage. It was also observed that the visual development of the larvae was closely related to the height and length of the head and with the height and length of the eyes. Finally, and in accordance with the morphological and morphometric characteristics of the observed larvae, in this research six post-embryonic stages were described: larval stages 1 to 4, pre-juvenile and juvenile.","The present investigation was carried out under the framework of the FIC P80 project code BIP 30110573-0, titled ‘Innovation in the Sustainable Development of Aquaculture in the Region of Arica and Parinacota, Recirculation System (SAR) for the Maintenance and Conditioning of Marine Fishes.&quot; The authors thank the Regional Government of Arica and Parinacota for the funds provided for this investigation.",,Aquaculture Reports,,,,2021-03,2021,,2021-03,19,,100576,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pepe-Victoriano, Renzo; Miranda, Loreto; Ortega, Aurelio; Merino, Germán E.","Pepe-Victoriano, Renzo (Facultad de Recursos Naturales Renovables, Universidad Arturo Prat, Avenida Santa María 2998, Arica, Chile; Programa de Doctorado en Acuicultura Sostenible y Ecosistemas Marinos.

This study aims to evaluate some factors that facilitate and hinder the pedagogical use of ICT in the context of learning English as a second language (L2) at preschool education levels. Through the methodology of Design Thinking, it is possible to structure the characteristics that a playful interface should have in order to support this educational process and, especially, to satisfy the needs of an environment that intends to make the most of the technological resources it has. To this end, this methodology takes into account the experience of direct users (children), indirect users (teachers) and the socio-economic dimension of educational centres, headed by managers. In this sense, two ad hoc questionnaires were completed by the school executives and teachers, respectively, in a specific educational context of Barranquilla, Colombia. The questionnaires were administered to 25 schools. Data analysis showed the importance of ICT in improving the teaching and assessment process.

Abstract  Background Leptospirosis is included in the list of diseases of compulsory notification in Brazil.  Objective To evaluate the leptospirosis epidemiological surveillance system in the municipality of Campinas, state of São Paulo, Brazil, between 2007 and 2014.  Method A study on the prevalence of leptospirosis cases was carried out in the epidemiological surveillance system. A total of 2949 reported cases were analyzed considering the attributes of the Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems and the parameters proposed by Souza et al. (2010) for the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The following attributes were assessed: completeness, acceptability, sensitivity, positive predictive value, representativeness, and timeliness.  Results The following percentages were found for the respective attributes: completeness (94.1%), acceptability (68.3%), positive predictive value (10.7%), representativeness (98.4%) and timeliness (71.4%).  Conclusion The leptospirosis epidemiological surveillance system in Campinas presented acceptable completeness and good positive predictive value of disease suspicion. Delays in the notification and investigation of cases and poor integration between the information systems were observed. The evaluation of the surveillance system provides important information for the organization of health services and should be part of the routine of actions provided for in the system.

This work aims to measure the enzymatic activity and non-enzymatic activity of two microalgae species in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and carotenoids, respectively, in response to static magnetic fields-induced stress. Two magnet configurations (north and south) and two exposure modes (continuous and pulse) were applied. Two microalgae species were considered, the Scenedesmus obliquus and Nannochloropsis gaditana. The SOD activity increased by up to 60% in S. obliquus under continuous exposure. This trend was also found for CAT in the continuous mode. Conversely, under the pulse mode, its response was hampered as the SOD and CAT were reduced. For N. gaditana, SOD increased by up to 62% with the south configuration under continuous exposure. In terms of CAT, there was a higher activity of up to 19%. Under the pulsed exposure, SOD activity was up to 115%. The CAT in this microalga was increased by up to 29%. For N. gaditana, a significant increase of over 40% in violaxanthin production was obtained compared to the control, when the microalgae were exposed to SMF as a pulse. Depending on the exposure mode and species, this methodology can be used to produce oxidative stress and obtain an inhibitory or enhanced response in addition to the significant increase in the production of antioxidant pigments.",The authors would like to thank the Universidad de Antofagasta for their support in performing this study.,"This research was funded by ANID/FONDEF/IDEA, grant number ID15I10487, and in part by the Programa Semilleros de Investigación: “Caracterización de una línea base para el análisis y determinación de los components celulares”, by the Fondo para el Desarrollo en investigación científica y/o tecnológica de actividades de titulación de pregrado 2018: “Producción de metabolitos de alto valor económico mediante exposición a un campo magnético estático tipo continuo y tipo pulso en las microalgas Scenedesmus obliquus y Nannochloropsis gaditana”, and by Programa Asignación año 2021 de Asistentes de investigación de la Universidad de Antofagasta código ANT20992.",Marine Drugs,,Carlos Almeida,Animals; Magnetic Fields; Microalgae; Oxidative Stress,2021-09-21,2021,2021-09-21,,19,9,527,All OA; Gold,Article,"Serrano, Génesis; Miranda-Ostojic, Carol; Ferrada, Pablo; Wulff-Zotelle, Cristian; Maureira, Alejandro; Fuentealba, Edward; Gallardo, Karem; Zapata, Manuel; Rivas, Mariella","Serrano, Génesis (Laboratorio de Biotecnología Ambiental Aplicada, Departamento de Biotecnología, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

Mobile learning creates an opportunity for growth and the application of innovative practices in educational settings. The Colombian government has implemented investment strategies to improve educational quality and provided schools throughout the country with mobile devices. However, the mobile applications contained in these devices lack contents in accordance with student’s context and educational level and UX/UI design; moreover, they do not promote an improvement in the teaching-learning process. This study presents a model that non-programming teachers can use to develop educational mobile applications, which integrates didactic and methodological strategies aimed at academic improvement. Descriptive research with a mixed-methods approach was employed here to interpret the results obtained and analyze the mediation of the mobile applications created adopting this model to support the teaching-learning process. Teachers from ten public educational institutions, who exhibited little appropriation and ignorance of mobile learning, participated in this study. As a result, a model to develop educational mobile applications was created, which represents a contribution to the existing literature in the field of mobile learning and the development of innovative teaching practices. It was concluded that the development model proposed in this paper can be used by non-developer teachers to implement educational mobile applications that serve as a mediating didactic tool in the teaching-learning process in primary and secondary education.",,,TecnoLógicas,,,,2021-12-16,2021,2021-12-16,,24,52,e2065-e2065,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escobar-Reynel, Jorge Luis; Baena-Navarro, Rubén; Giraldo-Tobón, Beatriz; Macea-Anaya, Mario; Castaño-Rivera, Samir","Escobar-Reynel, Jorge Luis (Universidad de Santander, Colombia); Baena-Navarro, Rubén (Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Colombia); Giraldo-Tobón, Beatriz (Universidad de Santander, Colombia); Macea-Anaya, Mario (Universidad de Córdoba, Colombia); Castaño-Rivera, Samir (Universidad de Córdoba, Colombia)",,"Escobar-Reynel, Jorge Luis (University of Santander); Baena-Navarro, Rubén (Cooperative University of Colombia); Giraldo-Tobón, Beatriz (University of Santander); Macea-Anaya, Mario (University of Córdoba); Castaño-Rivera, Samir (University of Córdoba)",3,0,,2.61,https://revistas.itm.edu.co/index.php/tecnologicas/article/download/2065/2206,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144041102,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

One of the leading causes is the expansion of large-scale operations that exploit natural resources for world market exportation with low processing. In this paper, we study the changes in agricultural activities, livestock, and land use in the Calama oasis (the Atacama Desert, northern Chile) in relation to the growth of large-scale copper mining and other chained processes (urbanization and increased demand for water resources); based on a mixed methodology combining descriptive statistics, archival and bibliographic review, ethnography, and spatial analysis. We present the results through a historical reconstruction of the analyzed dimensions and their relationships, accounting for contradictory dynamics in time and space. We identify how mining and urban growth promote some agricultural and livestock activities under certain economic and political conditions, while in other contexts, these activities have been severely weakened, seeing increasing urbanization of rural land, rural-urban pluriactivity, and a growing deagrarianization.","We acknowledge support from Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID), Fondecyt 1201527.

Although affected males with WAS usually manifest severe symptoms, female carriers have no significant clinical manifestations. Here, we describe a Chinese girl diagnosed with WAS carrying a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 2 of the WAS gene. The patient presented with persistent thrombocytopenia with small platelets and decreased WAS protein detected by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The methylation analysis of the HUMARA gene displayed an extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation (SXCI) pattern, where the X-chromosomes bearing normal WAS gene were predominantly inactivated, leaving the mutant gene active. Hence, our results suggest that completely inactivating the unaffected paternal X-chromosomes may be the reason for such phenotype in this female patient. SXCI has important implications for genetic counseling of female carriers with a family history of WAS.","We would like to thank all members of the study team, the patient and her family.",Funding.

An important assumption when comparing values across gender in dyadic research is that both partners conceptualize the construct under investigation in the same way. Thus, issues of measurement invariance should be considered when working with dyadic data. The aim of the present study was to test the dyadic invariance of the Positive Sexuality Scale (PSS) to assess an individual's sense of happiness and fulfillment with his/her sexual expression. The PSS was completed by 166 Chilean heterosexual couples, and measurement invariance was tested using confirmatory factor analysis within a dyadic framework. Configural, metric, scalar, and partial strict measurement invariance were supported for the PSS original one-factor model. No between-partner difference was found in the PSS latent factor mean. The functioning of the PSS and the meaning attributed to positive sexuality were the same for both partners. Hence, variations in the PSS levels between both partners in heterosexual couples can be interpreted as true mean differences rather than measurement artifacts.",,"This research was funded by the National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development of Chile, FONDECYT 1190240.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Chile; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Happiness; Heterosexuality; Male; Personal Satisfaction",2021-01-29,2021,2021-01-29,2021-02-01,18,3,1190,All OA; Gold,Article,"Casu, Giulia; Guzmán-González, Mónica; Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo; Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia; Barrientos, Jaime; Gómez, Fabiola","Casu, Giulia (Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, 40127 Bologna, Italy;, giulia.casu3@unibo.it); Guzmán-González, Mónica (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile;, respinoza@ucn.cl); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile;, respinoza@ucn.cl); Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia (Department of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Maule, 3460000 Talca, Chile;, lgarrido@ucm.cl); Barrientos, Jaime (Faculty of Psychology, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, 8340575 Santiago, Chile;, jbarrientos@uahurtado.cl); Gómez, Fabiola (School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, 7691043 Santiago, Chile;, fagomez3@uc.cl)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)","Casu, Giulia (University of Bologna); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Catholic University of the North); Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia (Catholic University of the Maule); Barrientos, Jaime (Alberto Hurtado University); Gómez, Fabiola (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",3,2,0.25,2.57,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/3/1190/pdf?version=1612166467,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134999492,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

The results show the absence of an idea of gender violence in the interviewees, a high personal and institutional impact from the 1973 coup d'état and the subsequent dictatorship and a critical vision about the current development of the discipline.",,,Revista Chilena de Antropología,,,,2021-07-26,2021,2021-07-26,,,43,1-18,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brinck, Adriana; Dávila, Cristian; Fuenzalida, Nicole; Moya, Francisca","Brinck, Adriana (Investigadora Independiente); Dávila, Cristian (Centro de Estudios Arqueológicos e Históricos Aikén); Fuenzalida, Nicole (Centro de Estudios Arqueológicos e Históricos Aikén); Moya, Francisca (Universitat de Barcelona)",,"Brinck, Adriana (Investigadora Independiente); Dávila, Cristian (Centro de Estudios Arqueológicos e Históricos Aikén); Fuenzalida, Nicole (Centro de Estudios Arqueológicos e Históricos Aikén); Moya, Francisca (University of Barcelona)",3,2,,2.57,https://revistadeantropologia.uchile.cl/index.php/RCA/article/download/64431/67751,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152714161,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies",5 Gender Equality

We create a new predictive model so it served us to be used as a diagnostic method for the tourism system. Ancon district is a coastal town of Peru, it is the second-largest and oldest of Metropolitan Lima district. The study analyzed all tourist attractions and local resources including reserved zone Lomas de Ancón, with 10,962 hectares. It used a qualitative method and its design is grounded theory and phenomenological. The research covers the period from May 2018 to March 2019, where it was possible to appreciate the high tourist demand and wild flora and fauna of the Lomas de Ancón in its two seasons: winter season (2018) and summer 2019 (dry season). The study concludes that the new analysis model allows us identifying and understanding the dynamic and potential of sun and beach tourist destinations in the growth phase. The Ancón district has resources and attractions that would allow it to develop new tourist products and diversify the local tourist offer.",This paper was possible because of the fact that the research team obtained funding from the Cesar Vallejo University and thanks to the internationalization of the Universidad Privada del Norte together with the Universidad Europea de Canarias.,"The material in this paper is based upon work supported by the private Cesar Vallejo university under grant No. RVI 034-2019-VI-UCV.

Traditional centralized, top-down and sectoral approaches to governance of single-issue areas or species within social-ecological systems often have limited potential to alleviate issues that go beyond their jurisdiction. As a result, collaborative governance approaches have come to the forefront. A great deal of past research has examined the conditions under which collaborative efforts are likely to achieve desired outcomes. However, few studies have analyzed how the means to achieve successful collaborative outcomes differ based on context when examined across multiple studies. In this research, we begin to chart a means for doing this. Building onto a Context-Mechanism-Outcome (CMO) Framework, we provide a coding manual to analyse how contextual variables mediate the effects of mechanism variables on outcomes of the collaborative governance of social-ecological systems. Through the examination of four cases, we provide a proof-of-concept assessment and show the utility of the CMO framework and coding manual to draw comparisons across cases for understanding how collaborative outcomes are contingent on the social-ecological context in which they occur.",,,Ecosystems and People,,,,2021-08,2021,2021-08,2021-12-31,17,1,383-399,All OA; Gold,Article,"Schoon, Michael; Chapman, Mollie; Loos, Jacqueline; Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika; Kelman, Candice Carr; Aburto, Jaime; Alexander, Steve; Baggio, Jacopo; Brady, Ute; Cockburn, Jessica; Cundill, Georgina; Lopez, Gustavo Garcia; Hill, Rosemary; Robinson, Catherine; Thondhlana, Gladman; Trimble, Micaela; Whittaker, Dane","Schoon, Michael (School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA; Center for Behavior, Institutions, and the Environment, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA); Chapman, Mollie (Department of Geography and University Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity, University of Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland); Loos, Jacqueline (Institute of Ecology, Leuphana University, Lüneburg, Germany); Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika (Institute of Geography, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland); Kelman, Candice Carr (School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA); Aburto, Jaime (Departamento De Biología Marina, Facultad De Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica Del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Alexander, Steve (Environmental Change and Governance Group, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada); Baggio, Jacopo (School of Politics, Security, and International Affairs and National Center for Integrated Coastal Research, University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA); Brady, Ute (Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, Syracuse, USA); Cockburn, Jessica (Department of Environmental Sciences, Rhodes University, Makhanda, South Africa); Cundill, Georgina (International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada); Lopez, Gustavo Garcia (Centre for Social Studies, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal); Hill, Rosemary (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Land and Water, Cairns, Australia); Robinson, Catherine (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) EcoSciences Precinct, Brisbane, Australia); Thondhlana, Gladman (Department of Environmental Sciences, Rhodes University, Makhanda, South Africa); Trimble, Micaela (South American Institute for Resilience and Sustainability Studies (SARAS), Bella Vista, Uruguay); Whittaker, Dane (School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA; Center for Behavior, Institutions, and the Environment, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA)","Schoon, Michael (Arizona State University; Arizona State University)","Schoon, Michael (Arizona State University; Arizona State University); Chapman, Mollie (University of Zurich); Loos, Jacqueline (Leuphana University of Lüneburg); Speranza, Chinwe Ifejika (University of Bern); Kelman, Candice Carr (Arizona State University); Aburto, Jaime (Catholic University of the North); Alexander, Steve (University of Waterloo); Baggio, Jacopo (University of Central Florida); Brady, Ute (Syracuse University); Cockburn, Jessica (Rhodes University); Cundill, Georgina (International Development Research Centre); Lopez, Gustavo Garcia (University of Coimbra); Hill, Rosemary (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Land and Water, Cairns, Australia); Robinson, Catherine (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation); Thondhlana, Gladman (Rhodes University); Trimble, Micaela (South American Institute for Resilience and Sustainability Studies (SARAS), Bella Vista, Uruguay); Whittaker, Dane (Arizona State University; Arizona State University)",14,8,,2.57,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26395916.2021.1946593?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140525433,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,15 Life on Land

The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) was used to detect participants at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals CI).ResultsModerate or extreme problems appeared more frequently in the dimensions of Pain/Discomfort (60.8%) and Anxiety/Depression (30.8%). The mean score of the EQ-VAS was 74.3 (± 17.3), significantly larger in the state of complete health (11111) compared with those with problems in more than one of the quality-of-life dimensions. Being female and living in Bogota D.C., were associated with greater odds of reporting problems in the Pain (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.2) and Discomfort dimensions (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.0) respectively and Anxiety/Depression (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3–2.7), (OR 9.1; 95% CI 6.6–12.4), respectively.ConclusionsAs living place and sex were associated with dimensions of Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression in the HRQoL in people at risk of T2D, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQoL to design and reorient strategies with a territorial and gender perspective to achieve better health outcomes.Plain English summaryDiabetes is one of the four non-communicable diseases with increasing prevalence in the world, which has made it a serious public health problem. In Colombia, in 2019 diabetes affected 8.4% of the Colombian adult population and more than one million Colombian adults of this age group have hidden or undetected diabetes. This disease is not only characterized by increased premature mortality, loss of productivity, and economic impact, but it also involves a deterioration in the quality of life of people with diabetes with their respective families. However, very Little is known about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a population at risk or with prediabetes. This study has evaluated the quality of life in patients at risk of diabetes and their behavior with some variables as sociodemographic, lifestyle, history, and established their difference in two territories of the Colombian Caribbean. The results of this study indicate that the HRQoL of people at risk of type 2 diabetes is affected by factors such as gender, city, dysglycemia, medication for hypertension and education level. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQL to design and implement strategies that reduce this risk of developing type 2 diabetes, prevent prediabetes and improve the quality of life in prediabetic or diabetic patients.",Not applicable.,"FundingThis project was financed by the Colombian National Program for Science, Technology, and Health Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) in line with the theme focused on chronic non-transmutable diseases.

This paper examines the pedagogies of such networks by focusing on the experiences nurtured within Habitat International Coalition in Latin America (HIC-AL), identified as a ‘School of Grassroots Urbanism’ (Escuela de Urbanismo Popular). Although HIC-AL follows foremost activist rather than educational objectives, members of HIC-AL identify and value their practices as a ‘School’, whose diverse pedagogic logics and epistemological arguments are examined in this paper. The analysis builds upon a series of in-depth interviews, document reviews and participant observation with HIC-AL member organisations and allied grassroots networks. The discussion explores how the values and principles emanating from a long history of popular education and popular urbanism in the region are articulated through situated pedagogies of resistance and transformation, which in turn enable generative learning from and for the social production of habitat.",,,plaNext - Next Generation Planning,,,,2021-07-01,2021,2021-07-01,,11,,26-43,All OA; Gold,Article,"Weesley, Julia; Allen, Adriana; Zárate, Lorena; Emanuelli, María Silvia","Weesley, Julia (University College London); Allen, Adriana (University College London); Zárate, Lorena (Global Platform for the Ritght to the City); Emanuelli, María Silvia (Habitat International Coalition – América Latina (HIC-AL), Mexico)",,"Weesley, Julia (University College London); Allen, Adriana (University College London); Zárate, Lorena (Global Platform for the Ritght to the City); Emanuelli, María Silvia (Habitat International Coalition – América Latina (HIC-AL), Mexico)",5,1,,2.51,https://journals.aesop-planning.eu/index.php/planext/article/download/13/9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138490981,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education

Nevertheless, regardless of much development since it was first used, the process advantages are restricted by low recoveries and long extraction times. It is becoming progressively clear that the selection of heap leaching as an appropriate technology to process a specific mineral resource that is both environmentally sound and economically feasible very much relies on having an ample understanding of the essential underlying mechanisms of the processes and how they interrelate with the specific mineralogy of the ore body under concern. This paper provides a critical overview of the role of gangues and clays minerals as rate-limiting factors in copper heap leaching operations.

How these dimensions correlate among them is focus of recent ecological research, but empirical evidence at regional scales, at which conservation decisions are usually made, remains absent. Using a field-based manipulative experiment conducted in two marine intertidal regions, we analyze the correlations among different aspects of stability in functioning (community cover) and composition of local communities facing a press disturbance. The experiment involved the removal of the local space-dominant species for 35 months in eight sites under different environmental regimes in northern- and southern-central Chile (ca. 30 and 40°S, respectively). After the disturbance, the magnitude of the initial responses and the recovery patterns were similar among communities dominated by different species, but varied between the functional and compositional response variables, and among four dimensions of stability. The recovery trajectories in function and composition remained mostly uncorrelated across the system. Yet, larger initial functional responses were associated with faster recovery trajectories—high functional resilience, in turn, was associated with both, high and low variability in the pattern of recovery. Finally, the compositional stability dimensions were independent from each other. The results suggest that varying community compositions can perform similar levels of functioning, which might be the result of strong compensatory dynamics among species competing for space in these communities. Knowledge of several, and sometimes independent, aspects of stability is mandatory to fully describe the stability of complex ecological systems.","We thank all the enthusiastic undergraduate interns (Biología Marina; UACH), members of the Coastal Ecology Lab (Lafkenchelab, UACH), and the Changolab (CEAZA-UAI) who provided invaluable help during the fieldwork.

Location South America, sub‐Antarctic islands, maritime Antarctica, continental Antarctica and Australasia.   Methods  To reconstruct phylogenetic patterns of Boeckella , we used molecular sequence data collected from 12 regions and applied Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses using multiple loci. We also estimated divergence times and reconstructed ancestral ranges using two different models of species evolution.    Results  Phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimates suggested that Boeckella originated on the Gondwanan supercontinent and initially split into two main clades during the late Cretaceous ( ca . 80 Ma). The first clade diversified in Australasia, and the second clade is currently distributed in South America, various sub‐Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Dispersal from South America to the Kerguelen and Crozet archipelagos occurred during the Eocene/Oligocene ( B .  vallentini ) and in the late Pliocene ( B .  brevicaudata ), while South Georgia and the maritime Antarctic were likely colonized during the late Pleistocene ( B .  poppei ).    Main conclusions  Boeckella has a Gondwanan origin, with further diversifications after the physical separation of the continental landmasses. Extant populations of Boeckella from the Scotia Arc islands and Antarctic Peninsula originated from South America during the Pleistocene, suggesting that original Antarctic Gondwanan lineages did not survive repeated glacial cycles during the Quaternary ice ages. A continuous decline in the species accumulation rate is apparent within the genus as the early Eocene, suggesting that Boeckella diversification may have decreased due to progressive cooling throughout the Cenozoic era.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding was obtained from PIA CONICYT ACT172065 to CSM, SR, JN, EP, CGW and AD.

In 2019, five QPP F1 hybrids were selected for further evaluation due to superior agronomics, endosperm protein quality, and popping quality traits. Though these BC2F5 QPP hybrids were phenotypically similar to their popcorn parents, the QPP cultivars conveyed slightly inferior popping characteristics when compared to the original popcorn germplasm. The objective of this study was twofold. First, BC2F5 inbred lines were crossed to their popcorn parents and BC3F4 inbred lines were produced for hybridization to test the agronomic, protein, and popping trait effects from an additional QPP by popcorn backcross. Second, BC2- and BC3-hybrids were simultaneously evaluated alongside ConAgra Brands® elite cultivars and ranked for potential commercialization in the spring of 2020. These 10 QPP hybrids were grown alongside five ConAgra Brands® elite popcorn cultivars in three locations and agronomic, protein quality, and popping quality traits were evaluated. Significant improvements in popcorn quality traits were observed in the QPP BC3 cultivars compared to their BC2 counterparts, and yield averages were significantly lower in BC3-derived QPP hybrids compared to the BC2 population. Protein quality traits were not significantly different between QPP backcrossing populations and significantly superior to ConAgra elite popcorn varieties. Utilizing a previously published ranking system, six QPP hybrids, three from the BC2F5 population and three from the BC3F4 population, were evaluated as candidates for final selection. The successful evaluation and ranking system methodology employed is transferable to other hybrid production and testing programs. Incorporating this analysis with concurrent sensory studies, two QPP hybrids were chosen as premier cultivars for potential commercialization.","We offer appreciation to ConAgra Brands® for continued funding, cooperation, and providing popcorn germplasm.

The objective of this study was to determine the body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (% BF), waist circumference (WC), and anemia in university students. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2,285 university students from Lima, Peru. The sample was selected by nonprobability convenience sampling. Anthropometric data and hemoglobin levels were measured. The Chi-square test was used. The analysis of the associated factors was done using binary logistic regression. A significance level of 5% was considered. There were no significant differences between men and women in BMI (p > 0.05).

It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","We thank students of “Colegio Inglés de Talca” for their help in the fieldwork.

On one hand, the framework aims at computing the greening factor based on the impacts of resources exploitation and products generation. Additionally, the greening factor computation was designed based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of economic, social, and environmental mainstays. On the other hand, this paper presents a general application of the framework on the five biggest Chilean industries, i.e., mining, wine, forest, agriculture, and aquaculture. Based on the presented generalized application, it is possible to foresee the potentiality of Chile becoming a green country in spite of its productive matrix being mainly based on primary industries.",The authors want to thank the relevant contribution of Rocío Rivera Cid and Ronald Dotte Zuñiga on improving the manuscript writing.,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2021-12-08,2021,2021-12-08,,13,24,13575,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tapia-Ubeda, Francisco J.; Muga, José A.

However, paraffin particles have been observed to escape from the silica matrix when water is added. There are only limited data on how the use of such PCM affects the behaviour of mortars. To evaluate the effect of this PCM addition, Portland mortar mixtures were elaborated with 5%, 10% and 15% of PCM content, and using CEM 42.5 I R and CEM I 52.5 R cement types. Physical properties such as density, open porosity, air content and water absorption were analysed for fresh and dry samples. The results obtained show that the PCM-added mixtures require greater water and cement amounts than the standard mortar mixtures to achieve similar compressive strengths. Compared to non-PCM mixtures the PCM-added mortars present a density lowering of 37% for fresh mixtures and near 45% for dry state forms. A maximum compressive strength of 15.9 MPa was reached for 15% PCM mixtures, while values beyond 40 MPa were achieved for 5% PCM mixtures. Thus, the proposed study contributes to broad the available knowledge of PCM cement mortar mixtures behaviour and their mix design.",,"The research of Vicente Zetola Vargas was partially supported by the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT) through the Programa Becas Chile, Ministerio de Educación, Gobierno de Chile.",Materials,,,,2021-02-15,2021,2021-02-15,,14,4,921,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zetola, Vicente; Claros-Marfil, Luis J.; Santos, Alfonso García; González, Fco.

Gut mycobiota can be a source of novel yeasts with the potential to be used as probiotics or have industrial applications. In this work, we characterized two as-yet unexplored yeast communities from the intestinal content of the cultured marine Chilean fishes Genypterus&nbsp;chilensis (G. chilensis) and Seriolella violacea (S.&nbsp;violacea). Yeasts were isolated through culture, identified by sequencing their ITS region, and characterized their enzymatic profile with API®ZYM. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was identified in both fish species. For the first time, Candida palmioleophila, Candida pseudorugosa, Cystobasidium slooffiae, and a member of the Yamadazyma genus were also identified and described as part of the normal fish gut-microbiota. Furthermore, the diverse enzymatic profile exhibited by some of these isolates suggests that it may be possible to develop novel applications for them, such as new probiotics and other biotechnological applications.",We would like to gratefully acknowledge Colorado Chile S.A for the kind donation of the G. chilensis fish.

The totality path with eclipse magnitude 1.012 passed through the Villarrica (Lon. 72.2308°W and Lat. 39.2820°S) in south Chile during 14:41:02.0 UTC to 17:30:58.1 UTC and maximum occurred ~ 16:03:49.5 UTC around the local noon. The vertical total electron content (VTEC) derived by GPS sites across the totality path for two PRN’s 29 and 31 show almost 20–40% of reduction with reference to ambient values. The percentage reduction was maximum close to totality site and decreases smoothly on both sides of totality sites. Interestingly, the atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) with a period ~ 30–60 min obtained using wavelet analysis of VTEC timeseries show the presence of strong AGWs at the GPS sites located north of the totality line. But the AGWs do not show any significant effect on the VTEC values to these sites. Our analysis suggests, possibly an interplay between variability in the background plasma density and eclipse-generated AGWs induced plasma density perturbation could explain the observations.","The study was supported by the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN), CONICYT/FONDAP/15110017 and Fondecyt Initiation Project 11200558.

Validation of the Content of the Diagnostic Label Professional Traumatic Grief,"(1) Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has put our healthcare systems to the test, exposing their vulnerability and demanding a high degree of commitment and dedication from healthcare teams to confront and contain the disease. In this sense, nursing professionals have played a prominent role in the treatment of complex cases that have required hospitalisation and have manifested pre-existing health complications or mortality. This unprecedented situation made it difficult to regulate the emotional impact and manage grief, often turning it into a traumatic grief whose psychological and emotional manifestations are increasingly evident but very little researched in the current context. (2) Purpose: Validation of the definition, defining characteristics and related factors for the proposal of the nursing diagnosis of professional traumatic grief. (3) Method: Based on Fehring's content validation model, the label name, defining characteristics and other related factors were agreed upon by Spanish experts. (4) Results: The content validity index was 0.9068. A total of 21 defining characteristics were validated by the experts, as all of them scored above 0.6. With respect to the related factors of the proposed 10, all were validated. (5) Conclusion: The present study supports the proposal to develop a nursing diagnosis for professional traumatic grief.

ABSTRACT Background and aim: Breastfeeding (BF) is a protective factor against childhood obesity; however, the mechanisms associated with this effect have not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to describe the mechanisms related to the protective effect of breastfeeding against childhood obesity. Methods: A search on PUBMED, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library and SCIELO databases was carried out to develop a descriptive review of the scientific evidence. The key words were breastfeeding; obesity; mechanism and diet. Articles were reviewed in Spanish and English from 1977 to 2020. Results: The protective effect of BF against childhood obesity is given by a combination of several mechanism. Its nutritional composition and the contribution of bioactive substances stand out, some of them regulated by the energy intake. Infants who are breastfed choose healthier foods in preschool, regardless of sociodemographic factors. Effects on adiposity, control of body weight and energy intake have also been described by epigenetic regulation programming and the intestinal microbiota. Conclusion: BF is a unique process that interacts in a complex way with infants and preschoolers’ growth and developmental factors Its protective role against childhood obesity has been associated with various mechanisms.

However, an accurate biomarker for ccRCC is lacking. This study identified 356 differentially expressed genes in ccRCC tissues compared with normal kidney tissues by integrative analysis of eight ccRCC datasets. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes unveiled improved adaptation to hypoxia and metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells. Aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene was identified as a biomarker for ccRCC among all the differentially expressed genes. ccRCC tissues expressed significantly lower AOX1 than normal kidney tissues, which was further validated by immunohistochemistry at the protein level and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data mining at the mRNA level. Higher AOX1 expression predicted better overall survival in ccRCC patients. Furthermore, AOX1 DNA copy number deletion and hypermethylation were negatively correlated with AOX1 expression, which might be the potential mechanism for its dysregulation in ccRCC. Finally, we illustrated that the effect of AOX1 as a tumor suppressor gene is not restricted to ccRCC but universally exists in many other cancer types. Hence, AOX1 may act as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for ccRCC.","We thank the people who devoted their own tissue samples to the databases (TCGA, GTEx, and so on), which makes it possible for scientists to investigate and unveil the mechanisms of cancers.

We tested the hypothesis that Tibetans display better muscle and brain tissue oxygenation during exercise in hypoxia. Using near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) to provide indices of tissue oxygenation, we measured oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin ([O2Hb] and [HHb], respectively) responses of the vastus lateralis muscle and the right prefrontal cortex in ten Han Chinese and ten Tibetans during incremental cycling to exhaustion in a pressure-regulated chamber at simulated sea-level (air at 1 atm: normobaric normoxia) and 5,000 m (air at 0.5 atm: hypobaric hypoxia). Hypoxia reduced aerobic capacity by ∼22% in both groups (d = 0.8, p < 0.001 vs. normoxia), while Tibetans consistently outperformed their Han Chinese counterpart by ∼32% in normoxia and hypoxia (d = 1.0, p = 0.008). We found cerebral [O2Hb] was higher in Tibetans at normoxic maximal effort compared Han (p = 0.001), while muscle [O2Hb] was not different (p = 0.240). Hypoxic exercise lowered muscle [O2Hb] in Tibetans by a greater extent than in Han (interaction effect: p < 0.001 vs. normoxic exercise). Muscle [O2Hb] was lower in Tibetans when compared to Han during hypoxic exercise (d = 0.9, p = 0.003), but not during normoxic exercise (d = 0.4, p = 0.240). Muscle [HHb] was not different between the two groups during normoxic and hypoxic exercise (p = 0.778). Compared to Han, our findings revealed a higher brain tissue oxygenation in Tibetans during maximal exercise in normoxia, but lower muscle tissue oxygenation during exercise in hypoxia. This would suggest that the Tibetans privileged oxygenation of the brain at the expense of that of the muscle.","We thank the participants for their participation, the technical support personnel of the hypobaric chamber at the National Key Laboratory of High Altitude Medicine in Xining for their expert help and the doctors and nurses at the Qinghai People’s Hospital in Xining for their assistances.",Funding.

For this, an approach that integrates the decision-making tool of the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used. To identify the selection criteria, the existing literature and the renewable resources available in the study area were considered. Seven sub-criteria were identified (solar irradiation, wind speed, protected areas, armed conflict, indigenous reservations, populated zones and roads), which were weighted with the AHP by 15 experts with experience in projects with renewable energies. After performing a consistency analysis, it was found that 5 experts were consistent, while another 5 were discarded for being highly inconsistent. A consistency correction method was implemented for the remaining 5 experts, in order to have 10 experts for the weighting process. Each sub-criterion represents a map of the study area, which were superimposed in a GIS environment to implement the weighting obtained with the experts. A global map for the implementation of renewable energy projects, considering environmental, social and local infrastructure criteria was obtained. The map was classified into five categories: not suitable, marginally suitable, moderately suitable, highly suitable and optimally areas.Keywords: Renewable Energy, Analytical Hierarchical Process, Energy Planning, Geographic Information SystemsJEL Classifications: Q20, D70, Q42, D81DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijeep.11266",,,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,,,,2021-08-20,2021,2021-08-20,,11,5,211-223,All OA; Gold,Article,"Olivero-OrtÃ­z, VÃ­ctor; Robles-AlgarÃ­n, Carlos; Viloria-Porto, Julie","Olivero-OrtÃ­z, VÃ­ctor (Universidad del Magdalena); Robles-AlgarÃ­n, Carlos (Universidad del Magdalena); Viloria-Porto, Julie (Universidad del Magdalena)",,"Olivero-OrtÃ­z, VÃ­ctor (University of Magdalena); Robles-AlgarÃ­n, Carlos (University of Magdalena); Viloria-Porto, Julie (University of Magdalena)",4,3,,2.3,https://econjournals.com/index.php/ijeep/article/download/11266/6018,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137177586,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Phytoplankton production provides food for fish, mammals, mollusks and birds. This trophic network is affected by the presence of toxic phytoplankton species. In July 2017, samples of phytoplankton were obtained from Paracas Bay, an important zone for scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) aquaculture in Peru. Morphological analysis revealed the presence of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, which was isolated and cultivated in laboratory conditions. Subsequently, the monoclonal cultures were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and identified as P. multistriata, based on both the morphological characteristics, and internal transcribed spacers region (ITS2) sequence phylogenetic analysis. Toxin analysis using liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed the presence of domoic acid (DA) with an estimated amount of 0.004 to 0.010 pg cell-1. This is the first report of DA from the coastal waters of Peru and its detection in P. multistriata indicates that it is a potential risk.

The genome of PRV consists of about 23,600 bp, with 10 segments of double-stranded RNA, classified as small (S1 to S4), medium (M1, M2 and M3) and large (L1, L2 and L3); these range approximately from 1000 bp (segment S4) to 4000 bp (segment L1). How the genetic variation among PRV strains affects the virulence for salmonids is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to describe the molecular phylogeny of PRV based on an extensive sequence analysis of the S1 and M2 segments of PRV available in the GenBank database to date (May 2020). The analysis was extended to include new PRV sequences for S1 and M2 segments. In addition, subgenotype classifications were assigned to previously published unclassified sequences. It was concluded that the phylogenetic trees are consistent with the original classification using the PRV genomic segment S1, which differentiates PRV into two major genotypes, I and II, and each of these into two subgenotypes, designated as Ia and Ib, and IIa and IIb, respectively. Moreover, some clusters of country- and host-specific PRV subgenotypes were observed in the subset of sequences used.

However, few studies have analyzed the relationship between identity from different theoretical perspectives, and the mental health of migrants in the Latin-American context. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between several identity indicators such as ethnic identity, collective self-esteem, identity fusion (with the country of origin and the host country) simultaneously, and different dimensions of psychological well-being of Colombian migrants living in Chile. The sample consisted of 887 Colombian migrants, of whom 435 (49%) were men and 452 (51%) were women. Participants were residents of the cities of Arica (n=204; 23%), Antofagasta (n=469; 52.9%), and Santiago (n=214; 24.1%) in Chile. The results revealed by structural equation modeling indicate that collective self-esteem and ethnic identity show positive relationships with almost all dimensions of psychological well-being, while identity fusion with Colombia only showed a positive relationship with the dimension positive relationships and identity fusion with Chile only showed a positive relationship with the dimension autonomy.

Similarly, as in the Euclidean case we establish a relationship between the duality of these families of codes. For this we introduce the concept of $q^{m}$ -duality between bases of $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ and prove that a $q^{m}$ -self dual basis exists if and only if $m$ is an odd integer. We obtain connections on the dual codes in $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}^{n}$ and $(\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}})_{n,m}$ with the corresponding inner products. In particular, we study Hermitian linear complementary dual, Hermitian self-dual and Hermitian self-orthogonal codes in $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}^{n}$ and $(\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}})_{n,m}$ .

Among emerging contaminants, antimicrobials have received particular attention in recent decades, mainly due to the concerning development of antibiotic resistance observed in bacteria, but little is known about the toxicological and ecological impact that antimicrobials can have on aquatic ecosystems. Their high consumption in human and veterinary medicine, food-producing animals and aquaculture, as well as persistence and poor absorption have caused antimicrobials to be discharged into receiving waters, with or without prior treatment, where they have been detected at ng-mg L−1 levels with the potential to cause effects on the various organisms living within aquatic systems. This review presents the current knowledge on the occurrence of antimicrobials in aquatic ecosystems, emphasizing their occurrence in different environmental matrixes and the effects on aquatic organisms (cyanobacteria, microalgae, invertebrates and vertebrates).","This work was supported by a fellowship of the Latin American Association of Postgraduates (AUIP) in agreement with the Simón Bolívar University of Colombia, the PROPLAYAS Network, the Caribbean Marine and Limnological Research Center CICMAR and the University of Cadiz in Spain.

This paper proposes a method for modeling, sensitizing, and optimizing the mineral recovery in rougher cells using a discrete event simulation (DES) framework and the fitting of analytical models on the basis of operational data from a concentration pilot plant. A sensitivity analysis was performed for low, medium, and high levels of the operative variables and/or parameters. The outcomes of the modeling indicate that the optimum mineral recovery is reached at medium levels of the flow rate of gas, bubble size, turbulence dissipation rate, surface tension, Reynolds number of bubble, bubble–particle contact angle, superficial gas velocity and gas hold-up in the froth zone. Additionally, the optimal response is reached at maximum levels of particle size and density and at minimum levels of bubble speed, fluid kinematic viscosity and fluid density in the sampled range. Finally, the recovery has an asymptotic behavior over time; however, the optimum recovery depends on an economic analysis, examining the marginalization of the response over time in an operational context.",Pedro Robles thanks the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for the support provided.,This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2021-09-14,2021,2021-09-14,,11,9,1454,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saldaña, Manuel; Neira, Purísima; Flores, Víctor; Moraga, Carlos; Robles, Pedro; Salazar, Iván","Saldaña, Manuel (Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos Av. 0610, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, vflores@ucn.cl); Neira, Purísima (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Avda.

The proposed solution uses machine learning models trained on a subset of possible exploration tasks but able to make predictions on untested scenarios. Additionally, the proposed model does not use any kinematic or dynamic models of the robot, which are not always available. The method is based on a neural network with hyperparameter optimization to improve performance. Tabu List optimization strategy is used to determine the hyperparameter values (number of layers and number of neurons per layer) that minimize the percentage relative absolute error (%RAE) while maximize the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between predicted data and actual data measured under a number of experimental conditions. Once the optimized artificial neural network is trained, it can be used to predict the performance of an exploration algorithm on arbitrary variations of a grid map scenario. Based on such prediction, it is possible to know the energy needed for the robot to complete the exploration task. A total of 128 tests were carried out using a robot executing two exploration algorithms in a grid map with the objective of locating a target whose location is not known a priori by the robot. The experimental energy consumption was measured and compared with the prediction of our model. A success rate of 96.093% was obtained, measured as the percentage of tests where the energy budget suggested by the model was enough to actually carry out the task when compared to the actual energy consumed in the test, suggesting that the proposed model could be useful for energy budgeting in actual mobile robot applications.",,This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2021-04-13,2021,2021-04-13,,10,8,920,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caballero, Liesle; Perafan, Álvaro; Rinaldy, Martha; Percybrooks, Winston","Caballero, Liesle (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad ITSA, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Perafan, Álvaro (Biomedical Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory BSPAI, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia;, perafana@uninorte.edu.co, (Á.P.);, mrinaldy@uninorte.edu.co, (M.R.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.)); Rinaldy, Martha (Biomedical Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory BSPAI, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia;, perafana@uninorte.edu.co, (Á.P.);, mrinaldy@uninorte.edu.co, (M.R.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.)); Percybrooks, Winston (Biomedical Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory BSPAI, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia;, perafana@uninorte.edu.co, (Á.P.);, mrinaldy@uninorte.edu.co, (M.R.);, wpercyb@uninorte.edu.co, (W.P.))","Caballero, Liesle (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad ITSA, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia)","Caballero, Liesle (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad ITSA, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Perafan, Álvaro (Universidad del Norte); Rinaldy, Martha (Universidad del Norte); Percybrooks, Winston (Universidad del Norte)",7,5,,2.22,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/8/920/pdf?version=1618290946,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137179144,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Essential oils (EOs) from propolis residues could be a potential source of natural bioactive compounds to replace antibiotics and synthetic antioxidants in pig production. In this study, we determined the antibacterial/antioxidant activity of EOs from crude organic propolis (EOP) and from propolis residues, moist residue (EOMR), and dried residue (EODR), and further elucidated their chemical composition. The EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation, and their volatile profile was tentatively identified by GC-MS. All EOs had an antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum as they caused disturbances on the growth kinetics of both bacteria. However, EODR had more selective antibacterial activity, as it caused a higher reduction in the maximal culture density (D) of E. coli (86.7%) than L. plantarum (46.9%). EODR exhibited mild antioxidant activity, whereas EOMR showed the highest antioxidant activity (ABTS = 0.90 μmol TE/mg, FRAP = 463.97 μmol Fe2+/mg) and phenolic content (58.41 mg GAE/g). Each EO had a different chemical composition, but α-pinene and β-pinene were the major compounds detected in the samples. Interestingly, specific minor compounds were detected in a higher relative amount in EOMR and EODR as compared to EOP.

We analyzed testimonies from men and women living in Antofagasta, which is considered to be one of the world's three largest mining regions. Among the main findings, power relations based on the hegemonic gender model supported by the sexual division of labor were identified, which persist in this mining area, despite progress in gender equality issues in Chile. Although there are differences between the discourses of men and women and their subjective positioning, we propose that both actively collaborate with the reproduction of social gender relations marked by male domination. We propose that the way in which couples live is associated with the organization of mining work and especially the shift system, which is central to the reproduction of the gender order with a heteropatriarchal tone.",The authors acknowledge FONDECYT 1180079.,"This research was funded by the National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development of Chile, FONDECYT 1180079.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Pasquale Caponnetto, Albert Nienhaus",Chile; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners,2021-02-01,2021,2021-02-19,2021-02-01,18,4,2027,All OA; Gold,Article,"Segovia, Jimena Silva; Pastor, Pablo Zuleta; Ravanal, Estefany Castillo; Segovia-Chinga, Tarut","Segovia, Jimena Silva (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

Our aim was to explore the optimal chemotherapy regimens for relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 24 adult patients with relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma from January 2014 to September 2020 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. We summarized the chemotherapy regimens and classified them as fluorouracil based, platinum based, and paclitaxel based. Nine patients received XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimens, seven patients received TX (paclitaxel and capecitabine) regimens, and eight of them received chemotherapy including GP (gemcitabine and cisplatin), TP (paclitaxel and cisplatin), TN (paclitaxel and nedaplatin), and tislelizumab.
RESULTS: The disease control rate was 75%. Among all patients, one patient treated with XELOX achieved partial remission (PR), while 17 patients showed stable disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in all treated patients was 7.43 and 29.7 months, respectively. The patients receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy presented better PFS than those without platinum (median PFS 8.23 vs. 3.80 months, p = 0.032), but not significant for OS between two groups. There is no significant difference in PFS and OS for fluorouracil-based and paclitaxel-based groups as first-line regimen. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed TP53 mutation and low tumor mutational burden in five out of seven cases.
CONCLUSION: The platinum-based chemotherapy regimen is effective for relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma.","The authors thank all the patients, their families, and the institutions for supporting this study.

Survey Results of the European PROspective Penile Cancer Study (E-PROPS),"BACKGROUND: Penile cancer represents a rare malignant disease, whereby a small caseload is associated with the risk of inadequate treatment expertise. Thus, we hypothesized that strict guideline adherence might be considered a potential surrogate for treatment quality. This study investigated the influence of the annual hospital caseload on guideline adherence regarding treatment recommendations for penile cancer.
METHODS: In a 2018 survey study, 681 urologists from 45 hospitals in four European countries were queried about six hypothetical case scenarios (CS): local treatment of the primary tumor pTis (CS1) and pT1b (CS2); lymph node surgery inguinal (CS3) and pelvic (CS4); and chemotherapy neoadjuvant (CS5) and adjuvant (CS6). Only the responses from 206 head and senior physicians, as decision makers, were evaluated. The answers were assessed based on the applicable European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines regarding their correctness. The real hospital caseload was analyzed based on multivariate logistic regression models regarding its effect on guideline adherence.
RESULTS: The median annual hospital caseload was 6 (interquartile range (IQR) 3-9). Recommendations for CS1-6 were correct in 79%, 66%, 39%, 27%, 28%, and 28%, respectively. The probability of a guideline-adherent recommendation increased with each patient treated per year in a clinic for CS1, CS2, CS3, and CS6 by 16%, 7.8%, 7.2%, and 9.5%, respectively (each p < 0.05); CS4 and CS5 were not influenced by caseload. A caseload threshold with a higher guideline adherence for all endpoints could not be perceived. The type of hospital care (academic vs. non-academic) did not affect guideline adherence in any scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence for most treatment recommendations increases with growing annual penile cancer caseload. Thus, the results of our study call for a stronger centralization of diagnosis and treatment strategies regarding penile cancer.",We would like to thank all participating clinics and physicians for supporting the E-PROPS project.,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-29,2021,2021-11-29,,11,,759362,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lebentrau, Steffen; Wakileh, Gamal Anton; Schostak, Martin; Schmid, Hans-Peter; Suarez-Ibarrola, Rodrigo; Merseburger, Axel S.; Hutterer, Georg C.; Necknig, Ulrike H.; Rink, Michael; Bögemann, Martin; Kluth, Luis Alex; Pycha, Armin; Burger, Maximilian; Brookman-May, Sabine D.; Bründl, Johannes; May, Matthias","Lebentrau, Steffen (Department of Urology, Werner Forßmann Hospital, Eberswalde, Germany); Wakileh, Gamal Anton (Department of Urology, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany); Schostak, Martin (Department of Urology and Urooncology, University Medical Center Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany); Schmid, Hans-Peter (Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland); Suarez-Ibarrola, Rodrigo (Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany); Merseburger, Axel S.

Several studies have detected the presence of leptospiral antibodies in captive Neotropical primates, suggesting that they are asymptomatic carriers. However, the presence of antibodies in free-ranging primates and their potential role as reservoirs for this pathogen is not known. In this study, we used the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to screen two species of free-ranging tamarins for the presence of Leptospira antibodies using a panel of 21 serogroups. A total of 56 primates (26 Leontocebus weddelli and 30 Saguinus imperator) were screened at the Estación Biológica Río Los Amigos in Madre de Dios, Peru. MAT results with titres of ≥100 in single samples were considered seropositive. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated for age group, sex and host species identity. Overall, 51.8% (29/56) of animals were reactive for at least one Leptospira serogroup. Serogroups were distributed as follows: Iquitos (41.1%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (14.3%), Sejroe (3.6%), Autumnalis (1.8%) and Bataviae (1.8%). No significant differences (p > .05) were found for seropositivity frequencies among categories within assessed variables. These results suggest that free-ranging L. weddelli and S. imperator might serve as reservoirs for pathogenic Leptospira serogroups. Given increasing human-wildlife contact, future studies that test for active infection are required to determine potential transmission risks to humans.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was financially supported by the EROL Scholarship 2017‐II provided by Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica and the Undergraduate Thesis Student Fund code A18080254 granted by Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

It plays a critical role in the development of Chile, so process planning is an essential task in achieving high performance. This task involves considering mineral resources and operating conditions to provide an optimal and realistic copper extraction and processing strategy. Performing planning modes of operation requires a significant effort in information generation, analysis, and design. Once the operating mode plans have been made, it is essential to select the most appropriate one. In this context, an intelligent system that supports the planning and decision-making of the operating mode has the potential to improve the copper industry’s performance. In this work, a knowledge-based decision support system for managing the operating mode of the copper heap leaching process is presented. The domain was modeled using an ontology. The interdependence between the variables was encapsulated using a set of operation rules defined by experts in the domain and the process dynamics was modeled utilizing an inference engine (adjusted with data of the mineral feeding and operation rules coded) used to predict (through phenomenological models) the possible consequences of variations in mineral feeding. The work shows an intelligent approach to integrate and process operational data in mining sites, being a novel way to contribute to the decision-making process in complex environments.","M.S. and V.F. thank the consortium HEUMA 16ENI2-71940 for supporting the development of this research.

253,pub.1136619849,10.1515/geo-2020-0240,,,Stability of an abandoned siderite mine: A case study in northern Spain,"Abstract Bodovalle is an iron carbonate mine located in Gallarta (near Bilbao, northern Spain), which is currently in the closure stage. The deposit was first exploited as an open-pit mine and later as an underground mine. The underground mine currently has 40 large rooms with rib pillars, occupying an area of 2,000 m long by 600 m wide. Room depth is around 200 m. The main geotechnical incident occurred in the NW1N zone, where an over-exploited rib pillar in poor condition was partially removed, leaving a 70-m roof span that eventually collapsed in 1999, resulting in a surface crater measuring 60 m in diameter. The collapse was preceded by noises and movements detected outside the mine. The subsidence was improved by means of infilling and monitoring. In 2014, residents living in homes built over the abandoned mine rooms detected very loud noises similar to those of 1999. The article describes a stability review carried out using advanced numerical methods (finite element method and boundary element method) and the geomechanical parameters obtained from a back analysis of the 1999 collapse.",,,Open Geosciences,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-03-23,2021-01-01,13,1,359-376,All OA; Gold,Article,"Trigueros, Emilio; Cánovas, Manuel; Arzúa, Javier; Alcaraz, Manuel","Trigueros, Emilio (Mining and Civil Engineering Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, 30203 Cartagena, España); Cánovas, Manuel (Metallurgical and Mining Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile); Arzúa, Javier (Metallurgical and Mining Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile); Alcaraz, Manuel (Mining and Civil Engineering Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, 30203 Cartagena, España)","Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)","Trigueros, Emilio (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Arzúa, Javier (Catholic University of the North); Alcaraz, Manuel (Polytechnic University of Cartagena)",7,5,,2.17,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/geo-2020-0240/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136619849,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

A business model canvas was adapted to allow sustainability in an off-grid Colombian microgrid by integrating distributed energy resources with voltage and frequency control as ancillary services; support services that maintain the stability and security of energy supply in isolated rural electrification. The business model canvas was studied with government funds, who cover all the costs associated with making the model attractive and sustainable in a Colombian context, and some proposed technical incentives to analyze the profitability and guarantee the sustainability of rural electrification. The proposed modified business model canvas offers a useful tool for supporting microgrid market scheme development to include distributed energy resources in a Colombian case. The model showed the importance of motivating investors and increasing profitability by including a value proposition based on technical contributions that benefit the microgrid operation; by around 80%. These benefits can solve some stability problems, including ancillary services, like frequency and voltage support, using distributed energy resources. Finally, integrating rural electrification in off-grid zones into the national energy regulation system is vital for incentivizing sustainable projects in rural zones, such as microgrids.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2021-04-13,2021,2021-04-13,,13,8,4308,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arango-Manrique, Adriana; López-García, Dahiana; Arango-Lemoine, César; Carvajal-Quintero, Sandra Ximena","Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); López-García, Dahiana (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales 170003, Colombia;, dahlopezgar@unal.edu.co, (D.L.-G.);, carangol@unal.edu.co, (C.A.-L.);, sxcarvajalq@unal.edu.co, (S.X.C.-Q.)); Arango-Lemoine, César (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales 170003, Colombia;, dahlopezgar@unal.edu.co, (D.L.-G.);, carangol@unal.edu.co, (C.A.-L.);, sxcarvajalq@unal.edu.co, (S.X.C.-Q.)); Carvajal-Quintero, Sandra Ximena (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Manizales 170003, Colombia;, dahlopezgar@unal.edu.co, (D.L.-G.);, carangol@unal.edu.co, (C.A.-L.);, sxcarvajalq@unal.edu.co, (S.X.C.-Q.))","Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)","Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); López-García, Dahiana (National University of Colombia); Arango-Lemoine, César (National University of Colombia); Carvajal-Quintero, Sandra Ximena (National University of Colombia)",6,3,,2.16,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/8/4308/pdf?version=1618300914,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137179793,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy
213,pub.1143009705,10.3390/min11111197,,,Leaching Chalcocite in Chloride Media—A Review,"Chalcocite is the most abundant secondary copper sulfide globally, with the highest copper content, and is easily treated by conventional hydrometallurgical processes, making it a very profitable mineral for extraction. Among the various leaching processes to treat chalcocite, chloride media show better results and have a greater industrial boom. Chalcocite dissolution is a two-stage process, the second being much slower than the first. During the second stage, in the first instance, it is possible to oxidize the covellite in a wide range of chloride concentrations or redox potentials (up to 75% extraction of Cu). Subsequently, CuS2 is formed, which is to be oxidized. It is necessary to work at high concentrations of chloride (>2.5 mol/L) and/or increase the temperature to reach a redox potential of over 650 mV, which in turn decreases the thickness of the elemental sulfur layer on the mineral surface, facilitating chloride ions to generate a better porosity of this. Finally, it is concluded that the most optimal way to extract copper from chalcocite is, during the first stage, to work with high concentrations of chloride (50–100 g/L) and low concentrations of sulfuric acid (0.5 mol/L) at a temperature environment, as other variables become irrelevant during this stage if the concentration of chloride ions in the system is high. While in the second stage, it is necessary to increase the temperature of the system (moderate temperatures) or incorporate a high concentration of some oxidizing agent to avoid the passivation of the mineral.",Kevin Pérez acknowledges the infrastructure and support of Doctorado en Ingeniería de Procesos de Minerales of the Universidad de Antofagasta.

Although this phenomenon has been previously mentioned and deep-water emergent species have been described from the fjord regions of North America, Scandinavia, and New Zealand, local or global hypotheses to explain this phenomenon have rarely been tested. This publication includes the first literature review on DWE. Our knowledge of distribution patterns of Chilean marine invertebrates is still very scarce, especially from habitats below SCUBA diving depth. In our databases, we have been gathering occurrence data of more than 1000 invertebrate species along the Chilean coast, both from our research and from the literature. We also distributed a list of 50 common and easily in situ-identifiable species among biologically experienced sport divers along the Chilean coast and recorded their sighting reports. Among other findings, the analysis of the data revealed patterns from 28 species and six genera with similar longitudinal and bathymetric distribution along the entire Chilean coast: along the Chilean coast these species are typically restricted to deep water (>200 m) but only in some parts of Chilean Patagonia (>39°S–56°S), the same species are also common to locally abundant at diving depths (<30 m). We found 28 of these ‘deep’ species present in shallow-water of North Patagonia, 32 in Central Patagonia and 12 in South Patagonia. The species belong to the phyla Cnidaria (six species), Mollusca (four species), Arthropoda (two species) and Echinodermata (16 species). We ran several analyses comparing depth distribution between biogeographic regions (two-way ANOVA) and comparing abiotic parameters of shallow and deep sites to search for correlations of distribution with environmental variables (Generalized Linear Models). For the analyses, we used a total of 3328 presence points and 10635 absence points. The results of the statistical analysis of the parameters used, however, did not reveal conclusive results. We summarize cases from other fjord regions and discuss hypotheses of DWE from the literature for Chilean Patagonia.","Many thanks to all the former assistants, volunteers, and employees who supported the work at Huinay Scientific Field Station, and to the Huinay Foundation.","This research was supported by the Fondecyt project 1201717 to GF, Fondecyt project 1161699 to VH, and Fondecyt project 1181153 to JS and CI.

For this specific theory there is a valid minisuperspace description which we use to quantize. For a particular relation between the two free functions entering the reduced Lagrangian the solution to the Wheeler–DeWitt equation as also the generic classical solution are presented for any given arbitrary potential function.","AP and GL were funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID through the program FONDECYT Iniciación Grant no. 11180126.

However, national-level action plans that bring together diverse scientific experts, non-governmental organizations, and governmental agencies to focus on improving the status of endangered species are generally rare. Here, we highlight one such plan published a decade ago, the Brazilian National Action Plan for the Conservation of Muriquis, which promoted the integration of scientific findings about the behavioral ecology, demography, and genetics of northern muriquis with conservation measures supported by the Brazilian government. This plan provided a holistic framework for the development of an effective national strategy that has contributed to significant advances in research and management applied to the conservation of this Critically Endangered species. We hope that this model for muriquis will stimulate conservationists around the world to pursue integrative national-level sponsorship of action plans on behalf of other endangered species.","We are grateful to Marcelo Marcelino de Oliveira and Juliana G.

Given this concept, this review aims to identify scientific publications related to developing technologies for women’s health in Brazil. Materials and Methods: An integrative descriptive review was conducted through database consultations in the Brazilian Nursing Database (BDENF), Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) in 2009-2019. Results: 46 studies were identified in the BDENF database, 280 in LILACS and 55 in SciELO, for a total of 381 studies retrieved by using cross-references in these databases. The final selection was refined to 23 studies by applying search filters. Discussion: The results analysis showed that the most cited topic was the development of soft-hard technologies. In analyzing the approach of these technologies, it was found that one of the topics that greatly benefited from the development of health technologies was the education in women’s health during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Conclusion: This review indicated the need to continue developing, validating and applying these technologies as their technical and conceptual quality will be analyzed and verified by professionals who understand the actual needs of the target audience.

To this end, a press review was conducted using the Google News archive, the speeches of delegations during the decision-making moments of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were analyzed, and the process of including the right to food within this international document was reconstructed. The authors conclude that the role of Latin American delegations in the construction of the international human rights regime was crucial and, therefore, question the idea that its origin was in the matrix of the hegemonic countries of the international system. Likewise, they question the sequential vision of the stages of creation of a norm and the impossibility of observing trajectories after its process of creation. In this sense, this article, through a case study, not only contributes to the understanding of the right to food, but also works to question the dominant theory on the emergence of norms and both realistic and critical visions of human rights.",,,Revista Derecho del Estado,,,,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,,,51,359-387,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valbuena Latorre, Paola; Badillo Sarmiento, Reynell","Valbuena Latorre, Paola (); Badillo Sarmiento, Reynell ()",,"Valbuena Latorre, Paola (); Badillo Sarmiento, Reynell ()",1,1,,2.1,https://revistas.uexternado.edu.co/index.php/derest/article/download/7600/11757,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143697329,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Material and methods: The study had a quantitative, cross-sectional and predictive approach. The population consisted of 445 doctors. The type of sampling was non-probabilistic for convenience, since the doctors who work in the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMMSS) Bienestar, in the state of Chiapas, were selected. The sample consisted of 169 physicians who represent 37.97% of the population. A simple linear regression analysis was carried out by the method of successive steps. Results: It was found that the variable level of working life described 64.9% of the variance of the dependent variable level of job performance. Similarly, it was determined that there is a positive and significant linear influence between the variables. The quality of work life variable was found to be a significant predictor of work performance in a very important way (β = .806). Conclusions: It was found that the quality of work life influences the work performance of the doctors who work in the Mexican Institute of Social Security of Well-being, in the state of Chiapas in a very important way.

Originality/support: This work identifies the lines of interest that emerged in educational research as a consequence of covid-19 during 2020 and its influence, if any, in the generation of international policies and in Latin America. Method: A study of scientific publications on the topic ""education in covid-19 pandemic"" in two international databases, Web of Science and Dialnet. The former containing data from American and European publications and the latter with data from Latin America and the Caribbean. The documentary search is complemented by guidelines and directives on educational policies issued by international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNICEF, among others. The methodology used here follows a mixed approach. Strategies/information collection: by using bibliometric techniques with the metadata of the 2020 publications and relying on documentary analysis from a semiotic perspective, Conclusions: it was found that the publications in WoS essentially focus on concerns about students, education and technologies, while the publications on Dialnet focus on questions and reflections on the effect of covid-19 on students from a social and educational perspective.

We study changes in the configurations of different technology fields via the power-law, small-world, preferential attachment, shrinking diameter, densification law, and gelling point hypotheses. Similar to the existing literature, we obtain mixed results. Based on network statistics, we argue that the sudden rise of large networks in six technology sectors can be understood as a phase transition in which small, isolated networks form one giant component. In two other technology sectors, such a transition occurred much later and much less dramatically. The examination of inventor networks over time reveals the increased complexity of all technology sectors, regardless of the individual characteristics of the network. Therefore, we introduce ideas associated with the technological diversification of inventors to complement our analysis, and we find evidence that inventors tend to diversify into new fields that are less mature. This behavior appears to be correlated with the compliance of some of the expected network rules and has implications for the emerging patterns among the different collaboration networks under consideration here.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Petter Holme,Humans; Intellectual Property; Interprofessional Relations; Inventions; Inventors; Patents as Topic; Social Interaction; Social Network Analysis,2021-09-02,2021,2021-09-02,,16,9,e0256956,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pinto, Pablo E.; Honores, Guillermo; Vallone, Andrés","Pinto, Pablo E.

Here we evaluate TP measures as potential endophenotypes in Caribbean families ascertained from probands affected by ADHD. A total of 232 individuals were recruited and clinically evaluated using an extensive battery of neuropsychological tasks and reaction time (RT)-based task paradigms. Further, the heritability (genetic variance underpinning phenotype) was estimated as a measure of the genetics apportionment. A predictive framework for ADHD diagnosis was derived using these tasks. We found that individuals with ADHD differed from controls in neuropsychological tasks assessing mental control, visual-verbal memory, verbal fluency, verbal, and semantic fluency. In addition, TP measures such as RT, errors, and variability were also affected in individuals with ADHD. Moreover, we determined that only omission and commission errors had significant heritability. In conclusion, we have disentangled omission and commission errors as possible TP endophenotypes in ADHD, which can be suitable to assess the neurobiological and genetic basis of ADHD. A predictive model using these endophenotypes led to remarkable sensitivity, specificity, precision and classification rate for ADHD diagnosis, and may be a useful tool for patients' diagnosis, follow-up, and longitudinal assessment in the clinical setting.","We express our highest appreciation to the families enrolled in this study.

213,pub.1140121499,10.3389/fenvs.2021.701970,,,Differentiation of Diatom Guilds in Extreme Environments in the Andean Altiplano,"The Andean Altiplano is characterized by its isolation, high altitude (>3,600 m a.s.l.), and a unique biodiversity, containing water systems such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and salt flats. Near the southernmost area of the Andean Altiplano are two salt flats, Carcote and Ascotán, the former almost undisturbed by human intervention and the latter historically intervened with by brine mining. These mining activities deplete, pollute, and alter water flow, suggesting a significant threat to ecosystem functions. With regard to identifying the main factors promoting biotic community differentiation in these salt flats at different levels of human intervention, the aim of this study was to compare diatom community indices by guild (high-profile, low-profile, and motile) between these systems with a functional perspective, their relationship to environmental conditions, and the potential anthropic impact on their community structures. Diatom guilds were compared between salt flats based on their diversity, species richness, and abundance relative to ionic concentrations and granulometry. Beta diversity and the percentages of nestedness and turnover for each guild were also estimated. Results showed significant differences in ecological variables between the two salt flats. The largest values of species abundance, richness, and diatom diversity were measured in Carcote, suggesting greater primary productivity and diversity. The results also showed that the species composition of the motile guild was more differentiated between salt flats than those of other guilds (with the greatest diversity and richness), suggesting that motile diatoms are a key guild in maintaining the diatom community and that species from this guild are more sensitive to local conditions from each salt flat. Additionally, beta diversity in all guilds was mainly explained by turnover rather than nestedness, and the turnover was the highest for the motile and low-profile guilds. A more heterogeneous community was observed in Ascotán, showing that the mechanisms of diversity maintenance, such as dispersion abilities, were salt flat dependent. This suggests that the highest diversity could be related to human use, which challenges us to reexamine the effectiveness of past conservation activities in the area and to develop future strategies including both connected basins.",,"This study was supported by authorities of I.

The influence of the processing parameters on the physical, microstructural, and mechanical properties was investigated. The bimodal microstructure was achieved from the blends of powder particles with different sizes, while the porous structure was obtained using the space-holder technique (50 vol.% of ammonium bicarbonate). Mechanically milled powders (10 and 20 h) were mixed in 50 wt.% or 75 wt.% with c.p. titanium. Four different mixtures of powders were precompacted via uniaxial cold pressing at 400 MPa. Then, the specimens were sintered at 750 °C via hot pressing in an argon gas atmosphere. The presence of a bimodal microstructure, comprised of small-grain regions separated by coarse-grain ones, was confirmed by optical and scanning electron microscopies. The samples with a bimodal microstructure exhibited an increase in the porosity compared with the commercially available pure Ti. In addition, the hardness was increased while the Young's modulus was decreased in the specimens with 75 wt.% of the milled powders (20 h).","The authors thank the laboratory technicians Jesus Pinto at Universidad de Sevilla (Spain), Claudio Aravena and Gabriel Cornejo at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (Chile) for their support carrying out the microstructure characterization and mechanical testing.","This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of Chile government [grant number Fondecyt 11160865, and FONDEQUIP EQM130103 and EQM150101, and Scholarship Program/DOCTORADO/2021-21211274], and the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain under the grant PID2019-109371GB-I00.",Materials,,Javier Gil,,2021-12-25,2021,2021-12-25,,15,1,136,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chávez-Vásconez, Ricardo; Lascano, Sheila; Sauceda, Sergio; Reyes-Valenzuela, Mauricio; Salvo, Christopher; Mangalaraja, Ramalinga Viswanathan; Gotor, Francisco José; Arévalo, Cristina; Torres, Yadir","Chávez-Vásconez, Ricardo (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Lascano, Sheila (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Sauceda, Sergio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Reyes-Valenzuela, Mauricio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Salvo, Christopher (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Bío-Bío, Avda.

Our goal was to assess the genetic diversity and the degree of differentiation among groups of Prosopis individuals of different species from Section Algarobia and putative hybrids (hereafter populations) co-occurring in these isolated oases from the Atacama Desert and determine whether genetic patterns are associated with dispersal barriers. Thirteen populations were sampled from oases located on three hydrographic basins (Pampa del Tamarugal, Rio Loa, and Salar de Atacama; northern, central, and southern basins, respectively). Individuals genotyped by eight SSRs show high levels of genetic diversity (H O = 0.61, A r = 3.5) and low but significant genetic differentiation among populations (F ST = 0.128, F ST-ENA = 0.129, D JOST = 0.238). The AMOVA indicates that most of the variation occurs within individuals (79%) and from the variance among individuals (21%); almost, the same variation can be found between basins and between populations within basins. Differentiation and structure results were not associated with the basins, retrieving up to four genetic clusters and certain admixture in the central populations. Pairwise differentiation comparisons among populations showed inconsistencies considering their distribution throughout the basins. Genetic and geographic distances were significantly correlated at global and within the basins considered (p < .02), but low correlation indices were obtained (r < .37). These results are discussed in relation to the fragmented landscape, considering both natural and non-natural (humans) dispersal agents that may be moving Prosopis in the Atacama Desert.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, Chile (FONDECYT 11180805, 1160045; Anillo SOC1405), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCYT (PICT2016‐0388), and Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, UBA (UBACYT 20020190200106BA).

1186,pub.1137649798,10.3390/en14092550,,,A Planning Method for Partially Grid-Connected Bus Rapid Transit Systems Operating with In-Motion Charging Batteries,"This paper presents an electrical infrastructure planning method for transit systems that operate with partially grid-connected vehicles incorporating on-board batteries. First, the state-of-the-art of electric transit systems that combine grid-connected and battery-based operation is briefly described. Second, the benefits of combining a grid connection and battery supply in Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems are introduced. Finally, the planning method is explained and tested in a BRT route in Medellin, Colombia, using computational simulations in combination with real operational data from electric buses that are currently operating in this transit line. Unlike other methods and approaches for Battery Electric Bus (BEB) infrastructure planning, the proposed technique is system-focused, rather than solely limited to the vehicles.

The causes of acculturation stress are diverse, but most are similar in the migrant population. Despite the importance of evaluating this variable, few studies have reported culturally adapted and validated instruments for specific populations. Based on this, the aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a short scale for the evaluation of acculturation stress (EBEA).MethodsTwo studies were conducted, involving 1725 first-generation Colombian and Peruvian migrants living in Chile, between the ages of 18 and 60 years. In addition to the EBEA and as evidence of validity, the Beck Anxiety Scale and the WHOQOL-BREF psychological health domain were applied. A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out, and the reliability and nomological validity were evaluated.ResultsThe results in both studies indicated that the scale presents a factorial structure of three dimensions: (a) the stress derived from the preparation and departure from the country of origin, (b) the stress produced by socioeconomic concerns in the host country, and (c) the tensions typical of adaptation to sociocultural changes or Chilean society. The reliability coefficients and the analysis of their nomological validity were very good.ConclusionsThe EBEA is a measure that offers quick, useful screening for researchers who need a short measure for research among migrants.

Relative Importance of Geographic Distribution and Interannual Variation in Three Lineages of the Ascidian Pyura chilensis in the Southeast Pacific Coast,"Spatial and temporal variation of environmental parameters can affect dispersal, recruitment and population persistence of marine benthic species. Studies including inter-annual comparisons of genetic structure often indicate high/moderate temporal heterogeneity in marine invertebrates, which may be a prevailing pattern. This suggests that temporal studies are necessary to understand the dynamics of marine metapopulations. In this study, we analyzed the spatio-temporal genetic structure of the ascidian Pyura chilensis, a low dispersal sessile marine species endemic from the Southeast Pacific coast and highly demanded for human consumption. We sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) from 1,005 individuals of six locations (30–40 individuals per site and year) spanning a wide latitudinal range (24°–42°S) and sampled over 5 years (2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017). The genetic structure of COI indicates the presence of three monophyletic lineages (haplogroups 1–3) previously described for the species, being one of them highly divergent and geographically restricted (~39°S, Los Molinos). Considering the whole dataset, a picture of strong spatial differentiation but temporal stability emerged in Pyura chilensis. However, detailed studies of the two main lineages revealed important differences in the extent of spatio-temporal variation. Analyses using haplotype frequencies sorted by site and year showed that, for haplogroup 1, genetic variation was explained mainly by differences between sites, while for haplogroup 2 differences between years were prevailing. Haplogroup 3 was restricted to the most southern sites, and also showed inter-annual variability in its frequency. These results point to disparate patterns of genetic differentiation, which may reflect different adaptive scope or variation in reproductive and dispersal features and could be a response to extreme events such as El Niño (2015–2016). This work calls for caution when obtaining general trends in species clearly differentiated in lineages, and prompts instead for separate analyses of sub-specific genetic lineages whenever possible.","We thank Natalia Muñoz, Raúl Vera, Francisca Gálvez, Diana Coral, and Katherine Ramírez for help with sampling and laboratory procedures.

However, the clinical significance of CAV1 expression in penile cancer remains largely unknown. Here the expression patterns of CAV1 were analyzed in a retrospective cohort (n=43) of penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Upon penile cancer progression, significantly increased CAV1-levels were determined within the malignant epithelium, whereas within the tumor stroma, namely the fibroblastic tumor compartment harboring activated and/or cancer associated fibroblasts, CAV1 levels significantly decline. Concerning the clinicopathological significance of CAV1 expression in penile cancer as well as respective epithelial-stromal CAV1 distributions, high expression within the tumor cells as well as low expression of CAV1 within the stromal compartment were correlated with decreased overall survival of penile cancer patients. Herein, CAV1 expressions and distributions at advanced penile cancer stages were independent of the immunohistochemically proven tumor protein p53 status. In contrast, less differentiated p16-positive tumor epithelia (indicative for human papilloma virus infection) were characterized by significantly decreased CAV1 levels. Conclusively, we provide further and new evidence that the characteristic shift in stromal-epithelial CAV1 being functionally relevant to tumor progression even occurs in penile SCC.",We thank Mohamed Benchellal and Eva Gau for their excellent technical assistance.

Such attributes are of great importance for use in industrial purposes. Understanding how these characteristics are affected is still complex, but with the help of molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum calculations (QM), it is possible to understand the behavior of polymers at the molecular level with great consistency. This study was applied to polymers derived from polyacrylamide (PAM) due to its great use in various industries. The polymers studied include hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) (PAMPS), polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylene oxide polymer (PEO), and guar gum polysaccharide (GUAR). Each one has different attributes, which help in understanding the effects on the polymer and the medium in which it is applied along a broad spectrum. The results include the conformation, diffusion, ion condensation, the structure of the water around the polymer, and interatomic polymer interactions. Such characteristics are important to selecting a polymer depending on the environment in which it is found and its purpose. The effect caused by salinity is particular to each polymer, where polymers with an explicit charge or polyelectrolytes are more susceptible to changes due to salinity, increasing their coiling and reducing their mobility in solution. This naturally reduces its ability to form polymeric bridges due to having a polymer with a smaller gyration radius. In contrast, neutral polymers are less affected in their structure, making them favorable in media with high ionic charges.","G.R.Q., J.S. and R.I.J. thank the Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/Fondap/15130015 for financial support.

Here, we aimed to develop an m6A-related risk signature to improve prognostic and immunotherapy responder prediction performance in the context of melanoma. We comprehensively analyzed the m6A cluster and immune infiltration phenotypes of public datasets. The TCGA (n = 457) and eleven independent melanoma cohorts (n = 758) were used as the training and validation datasets, respectively. We identified two m6A clusters (m6A-clusterA and m6A-clusterB) based on the expression pattern of m6A regulators via unsupervised consensus clustering. IGF2BP1 (7.49%), KIAA1429 (7.06%), and YTHDC1 (4.28%) were the three most frequently mutated genes. There was a correlation between driver genes mutation statuses and the expression of m6A regulators. A significant difference in tumor-associated immune infiltration between two m6A clusters was detected. Compared with m6A-clusterA, the m6A-clusterB was characterized by a lower immune score and immune cell infiltration but higher mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi). An m6A-related risk signature consisting of 12 genes was determined via Cox regression analysis and divided the patients into low- and high-risk groups (IL6ST, MBNL1, NXT2, EIF2A, CSGALNACT1, C11orf58, CD14, SPI1, NCCRP1, BOK, CD74, PAEP). A nomogram was developed for the prediction of the survival rate. Compared with the high-risk group, the low-risk group was characterized by high expression of immune checkpoints and immunophenoscore (IPS), activation of immune-related pathways, and more enriched in immune cell infiltrations. The low-risk group had a favorable prognosis and contained the potential beneficiaries of the immune checkpoint blockade therapy and verified by the IMvigor210 cohort (n = 298). The m6A-related signature we have determined in melanoma highlights the relationships between m6A regulators and immune cell infiltration.

These conditions can be mild to severe, affecting the subject’s quality of life. An earlier diagnosis of FASD is crucial for an improved quality of life of children by allowing a better inclusion in the educational system. New trends in computer-based diagnosis to detect FASD include using Machine Learning (ML) tools to detect this syndrome. However, most of these studies rely on children’s images that can be invasive and costly. Therefore, this paper presents a study that focuses on evaluating an ANN to classify children with FASD using non-invasive and more accessible data. This data used comes from a battery of tests obtained from children, including psychometric, saccade eye movement, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We study the different configurations of ANN with dense layers being the psychometric data that correctly perform the best with 75% of the outcome. The other models include a feature layer, and we used it to predict FASD using every test individually. Model obtained obtained an accuracy of 88.46% (psychometric, 74.07% (Antisaccadic), 72.24% (Prosaccadic), 88% (Memory guide saccade), and 75% (DTI).

A number of previous studies have revealed potential regulatory mechanisms by which epigenetics regulate pigmentation. However, the genome-wide DNA methylation involved in animal coat color dilution remains unknown. Results: We compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in Rex rabbit hair follicles in a Chinchilla group (Ch) and a diluted Chinchilla group (DCh) through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Approximately 3.5% of the cytosine sites were methylated in both groups, of which the CG methylation type was in greatest abundance. In total, we identified 126,405 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the two groups, corresponding to 11,459 DMR-associated genes (DMGs). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that these DMGs were principally involved in developmental pigmentation and Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, two DMRs were randomly selected to verify that the WGBS data were reliable using bisulfite sequencing PCR, and seven DMGs were analyzed to establish the relationship between the level of DNA methylation and mRNA expression using qRT-PCR. Due to the limitation of small sample size, replication of the results with a larger sample size would be important in future studies. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that there is an association between inherited color dilution and DNA methylation alterations in hair follicles, greatly contributing to our understanding of the epigenetic regulation of rabbit pigmentation.","This manuscript has been released as a pre-print at the Research Square (Chen et al., 2020).

In recent years, experts have looked for new alternative methods to improve this situation. Black copper minerals are abundant resources not exploited by large-scale copper mining and possess high Mn concentrations. On the other hand, manganese nodules are submarine resources and show high concentrations of Cu, Ni, Fe, and, mainly, Mn. However, both mineral resources are refractory to conventional leaching processes, and so a reducing agent is necessary for their treatment. We studied the use of tailings obtained from the flotation of foundry slags with a high content of Fe3O4 as reducing agents at different MnO2/tailings ratios and H2SO4 concentrations. Mn dissolution was compared in marine nodule and black copper minerals samples. It was found that higher Mn dissolutions are obtained from marine nodules, likely due to the acid consumption created by Cu dissolution from black copper minerals. The remnant elements in manganese nodules were leached under an oxidant condition.",Pedro Robles thanks the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso for the support provided.,This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2021-05-18,2021,2021-05-18,,11,5,817,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moraga, Carlos; Cerecedo-Saenz, Eduardo; González, Javier; Robles, Pedro; Carrillo-Pedroza, Francisco Raul; Toro, Norman","Moraga, Carlos (Escuela de Ingeniería Civil de Minas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Talca, Curicó 3340000, Chile); Cerecedo-Saenz, Eduardo (Área Académica de Ciencias de la Tierra y Materiales, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo, Carretera Pachuca-Tulancingo km 4.5, Mineral de la Reforma, Hidalgo 42184, Mexico;, mardenjazz@yahoo.com.mx); González, Javier (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, javier.gonzalez@ucn.cl); Robles, Pedro (Escuela De Ingeniería Química, Pontificia Universidad Católica De Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2340000, Chile;, pedro.robles@pucv.cl); Carrillo-Pedroza, Francisco Raul (Facultad de Metalurgia, Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila, Carretera 57 Km 5, Monclova 25710, Mexico;, raul.carrillo@uadec.edu.mx); Toro, Norman (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Almirante Juan José Latorre 2901, Antofagasta 1244260, Chile; Department of Mining and Civil Engineering, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, 30203 Cartagena, Spain)","Moraga, Carlos (University of Talca); Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University; Polytechnic University of Cartagena)","Moraga, Carlos (University of Talca); Cerecedo-Saenz, Eduardo (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo); González, Javier (Catholic University of the North); Robles, Pedro (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Carrillo-Pedroza, Francisco Raul (Autonomous University of Coahuila); Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University; Polytechnic University of Cartagena)",8,4,,1.98,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/5/817/pdf?version=1621319189,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138165094,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The simulations were carried out with the package Gromacs 2020.3. The interaction potentials used were General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) for PAA and CLAYFF-MOH for mineral surfaces. The SPC/E model described water molecules and Lennard-Jones 12-6 parameters adjusted for SPC/E model were used for Na+ and Cl− ions. The studied systems were carried out at pH 7, obtaining stable adsorption between the PAA and the studied surfaces. Interestingly, the strongest adsorptions were for montmorillonite at both low and high salt concentrations. The effect of salinity differs according to the system, finding that it impairs the absorption of the polymer on montmorillonite surfaces. However, a saline medium favors the interaction with quartz and kaolinite. This is explained because montmorillonite has a lower surface charge density and a greater capacity to adsorb ions. This facilitated the adsorption of PAA. It was possible to identify that the main interaction by which the polymer is adsorbed is through the hydroxyl of the mineral surface and the COO−Na+ complexes. Molecular dynamics allows us to advance in the understanding of interactions that define the behavior of this promising reagent as an alternative for sustainable treatment of complex tailings in highly saline environments.",G.R.Q. and R.I.J. thank Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

204,pub.1139109126,10.3390/min11070660,,,Integration of Dual Border Effects in Resource Estimation: A Cokriging Practice on a Copper Porphyry Deposit,"Hierarchical or cascade resource estimation is a very common practice when building a geological block model in metalliferous deposits. One option for this is to model the geological domains by indicator kriging and then to estimate (by kriging) the grade of interest within the built geodomains. There are three problems regarding this. The first is that sometimes the molded geological domains are spotty and fragmented and, thus, far from the geological interpretation. The second is that the resulting estimated grades highly suffer from a smoothing effect. The third is related to the border effect of the continuous variable across the boundary of geological domains. The latter means that the final block model of the grade shows a very abrupt transition when crossing the border of two adjacent geological domains. This characteristic of the border effect may not be always true, and it is plausible that some of the variables show smooth or soft boundaries. The case is even more complicated when there is a mixture of hard and soft boundaries. A solution is provided in this paper to employ a cokriging paradigm for jointly modeling grade and geological domains. The results of modeling the copper in an Iranian copper porphyry deposit through the proposed approach illustrates that the method is not only capable of handling the mixture of hard and soft boundaries, but it also produces models that are less influenced by the smoothing effect. These results are compared to an independent kriging, where each variable is modeled separately, irrespective of the influence of geological domains.",We acknowledgment the NAZARBAYEV UNIVERSITY and National Agency for Research and Development of Chile for supporting this work.,This research was funded by NAZARBAYEV UNIVERSITY via Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants for 2021–2023 via grant No. 021220FD4951 and National Agency for Research and Development of Chile through grants CONICYT/FONDECYT/ /No. 3180655.,Minerals,,,,2021-06-22,2021,2021-06-22,,11,7,660,All OA; Gold,Article,"Madani, Nasser; Maleki, Mohammad; Sepidbar, Fatemeh","Madani, Nasser (School of Mining and Geosciences, Nazarbayev University, Nur-Sultan City 010000, Kazakhstan); Maleki, Mohammad (Department of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, mohammad.maleki@ucn.cl); Sepidbar, Fatemeh (School of Earth Sciences, Damghan University, Damghan 36716-41167, Iran;, f.sepidbar@ut.ac.ir)","Madani, Nasser (Nazarbayev University)","Madani, Nasser (Nazarbayev University); Maleki, Mohammad (Catholic University of the North); Sepidbar, Fatemeh (Damghan University)",5,2,,1.97,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/7/660/pdf?version=1626925713,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139109126,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology,

1002,pub.1134950938,10.5194/se-12-275-2021,,,The preserved plume of the Caribbean Large Igneous Plateau revealed by 3D data-integrative models,"Abstract. Remnants of the Caribbean Large Igneous Plateau (C-LIP) are found as thicker
than normal oceanic crust in the Caribbean Sea that formed during rapid
pulses of magmatic activity at ∼91–88 and ∼76 Ma. Strong geochemical evidence supports the hypothesis that the C-LIP
formed due to melting of the plume head of the Galápagos hotspot, which
interacted with the Farallon (Proto-Caribbean) plate in the eastern
Pacific. Considering plate tectonics theory, it is expected that the
lithospheric portion of the plume-related material migrated within the
Proto-Caribbean plate in a north–north-eastward direction, developing the
present-day Caribbean plate. In this research, we used 3D lithospheric-scale,
data-integrative models of the current Caribbean plate setting to reveal, for
the first time, the presence of positive density anomalies in the uppermost
lithospheric mantle. These models are based on the integration of up-to-date
geophysical datasets from the Earth's surface down to 200 km depth,
which are validated using high-resolution free-air gravity measurements. Based
on the gravity residuals (modelled minus observed gravity), we derive density
heterogeneities both in the crystalline crust and the uppermost oceanic mantle
(<50 km). Our results reveal the presence of two positive mantle
density anomalies beneath the Colombian and the Venezuelan basins, interpreted
as the preserved fossil plume conduits associated with the C-LIP
formation. Such mantle bodies have never been identified before, but a
positive density trend is also indicated by S-wave tomography, at least down
to 75 km depth. The interpreted plume conduits spatially correlate
with the thinner crustal regions present in both basins; therefore, we
propose a modification to the commonly accepted tectonic model of the
Caribbean, suggesting that the thinner domains correspond to the centres of
uplift due to the inflow of the hot, buoyant plume head. Finally, using six
different kinematic models, we test the hypothesis that the C-LIP originated
above the Galápagos hotspot; however, misfits of up to ∼3000 km are found between the present-day hotspot location and the
mantle anomalies, reconstructed back to 90 Ma. Therefore, we shed
light on possible sources of error responsible for this offset and discuss two
possible interpretations: (1) the Galápagos hotspot migrated (∼1200–3000 km) westward while the Caribbean plate moved to the north,
or (2) the C-LIP was formed by a different plume, which – if considered fixed
– would be nowadays located below the South American continent.","We would like to thank Camilo Montes (Universidad del Norte) for the fruitful discussion about the GPlates reconstruction in the Caribbean.

This work assesses combustion and performance of the dual-fuel operation in the spark ignition (SI) engine that simultaneously integrates acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) and hydroxy (HHO) doping. The study evaluates four fuel blends that combine ABE 5, ABE 10, and an HHO volumetric flow rate of 0.4 LPM. The standalone gasoline operation served as the baseline for comparison. We constructed an experimental test bench to assess operation conditions, fuel mode, and emissions characteristics of a 3.5 kW-YAMAHA engine coupled to an alkaline electrolyzer. The study proposes thermodynamic and combustion models to evaluate the performance of the dual-fuel operation based on in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion temperature, fuel properties, energy distribution, and emissions levels. Results indicate that ABE in the fuel blends reduces in-cylinder pressure by 10–15% compared to the baseline fuel. In contrast, HHO boosted in-cylinder pressure up to 20%. The heat release rate and combustion temperature follow the same trend, corroborating that oxygen enrichment enhances gasoline combustion. The standalone ABE operation raises fuel consumption by around 10–25 g∙kWh−1 compared to gasoline depending on the load, whereas HHO decreases fuel consumption by around 25%. The dual-fuel operation shows potential for mitigating CO, HC, and smoke emissions, although NOx emissions increased. The implementation of dual-fuel operation in SI engines represents a valuable tool for controlling emissions and reducing fuel consumption while maintaining combustion performance and thermal efficiency.","Acknowledgments to Universidad del Atlántico through the project ING81-CII2019 “Estudio experimental de la sustitución parcial de combustible con HIDROXY (HHO) en motores térmicos de encendido por compresión y la influencia sobre sus prestaciones”, Universidad del Norte, Sphere Energy Company for the support provided for the investigative internship of Daniel Maestre, and Colombian Institute for Scientific and Technological Development (COLCIENCIAS) through the “Convocatoria 809 Minciencias, Formación de capital humano de alto nivel para las regiones- Atlántico” for the support provided.",This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-06-07,2021,2021-06-07,,11,11,5282,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillin-Estrada, Wilson; Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel; Bula-Silvera, Antonio; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Duarte-Forero, Jorge","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson (UREMA Research Unit, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@uninorte.edu.co, (W.G.-E.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.-S.);, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co, (A.G.-Q.)); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (KAÍ Research Unit, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, dmaestre@est.uniatlantico.edu.co); Bula-Silvera, Antonio (UREMA Research Unit, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@uninorte.edu.co, (W.G.-E.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.-S.);, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co, (A.G.-Q.)); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@uninorte.edu.co, (W.G.-E.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.-S.);, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co, (A.G.-Q.)); Duarte-Forero, Jorge (KAÍ Research Unit, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, dmaestre@est.uniatlantico.edu.co)","Duarte-Forero, Jorge (University of Atlántico)","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson (Universidad del Norte); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (University of Atlántico); Bula-Silvera, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte); Duarte-Forero, Jorge (University of Atlántico)",8,5,,1.89,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5282/pdf?version=1623060818,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138676027,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

Furthermore, free-roaming domestic animals and use of yucca and/or manioc as a primary food source favor the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths, e.g., Toxocara&nbsp;canis and Toxocara&nbsp;cati, the roundworms of dogs and cats. Infection may result in the clinical picture of toxocarosis, one of the most common zoonotic helminthoses worldwide. To estimate the Toxocara seroprevalence in four different villages of the Wiwa community, serum samples from 483 inhabitants were analyzed for anti-Toxocara-antibodies. Overall, 79.3% (383/483) of analyzed samples were seropositive.

However, the antioxidant behavior of its derivatives has not been well explored. In the present work, the antioxidant activity of 10 dapsone derivatives 4-substituted was determined by an evaluation in two in vitro models (DPPH radical scavenging assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power). These imine derivatives 1-10 were obtained through condensation between DDS and the corresponding aromatic aldehydes 4-substuited. Three derivatives presented better results than DDS in the determination of DPPH (2, 9, and 10). Likewise, we have three compounds with better reducing activity than dapsone (4, 9, and 10). In order to be more insight, the redox process, a conceptual DFT analysis was carried out. Molecular descriptors such as electronic distribution, the total charge accepting/donating capacity (I/A), and the partial charge accepting/donating capacity (ω+/ω-) were calculated to analyze the relative donor-acceptor capacity through employing a donor acceptor map (DAM). The DFT calculation allowed us to establish a relationship between GAPHOMO-LUMO and DAM with the observed antioxidant effects. According to the results, we concluded that compounds 2 and 3 have the lowest Ra values, representing a good antioxidant behavior observed experimentally in DPPH radical capturing. On the other hand, derivatives 4, 9, and 10 display the best reducing capacity activity with the highest ω- and Rd values. Consequently, we propose these compounds as the best antireductants in our DDS imine derivative series.","The authors thank the Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos, and CONACyT for the facilities to develop this work.","R.G.-A. thanks CONACYT for the scholarship, grant numbers 473085 and PEI-231815.

The species is dioecious with external fertilization and without sexual dimorphism. The aim of this work was to optimize broodstock conditioning, induce spawning and describe embryonic development until the early larval stage in a hatchery. Broodstock were conditioned at 3 treatments (with/without sand; water circulation) for 48 days. The clams were fed with a mixed diet of macroalgae, with a daily ration of 250,000 cells/ml. Broodstock response was quantified using condition index and gonad development stages (histological techniques). For spawning induction, physical and biological methods were tested. The best response was achieved in males with physical induction. Histological analysis showed that the water circulation system treatment exhibited the highest percentage of maximum maturity. A fertilization ratio of 500:1 sperm:oocyte was used. The incubation was carried out in 3‐L containers with filtered seawater at 10.7 ± 0.9°C without aeration. Observations, measurements and the duration of each embryonic and larval stage were recorded. The oocyte has a prominent gelatinous layer (= jelly coat) that disappears between the gastrula and trochophore stages. The status of the D‐larval stage was reached at 107 h post fertilization with a mean valve length of 91.4 ± 8.9 µm. This is the first record of the complete embryonic development of this baby clam until the early larval stage and the conditioning in a water circulation system for 48 days are suitable for the species.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful for the funding of the FONDEF ID15I10582 project &quot;The Juliana clam, Tawera gayi, a new species for small‐scale aquaculture: Development of technology for larval and post‐larval culture&quot;.

We observed extensive fields of filamentous cyanobacteria-like mats covering sandy substrates and mostly dead mesophotic Leptoseris spp. reefs. These mats covered up to 100% of the seafloor off Hanga Roa, the main village on the island, located on its western side. The highest mortality of corals was observed at depths between 70 and 95 m in this area. Healthy Leptoseris reefs were documented off the northern and southeastern sides of the island, which are also the least populated. A preliminary morphologic analysis of samples of the mats indicated that the assemblage is composed of at least four filamentous taxa, including two cyanobacteria (cf. Lyngbya sp. and Pseudoanabaena sp.), a brown alga (Ectocarpus sp.), and a green alga (Cladophora sp.). An ongoing eutrophication process is suggested as a potential driver of the proliferation of these filamentous mats off Hanga Roa village.","This work was supported by grants FONDECYT 1180694 and 1181153, as well as funding from the ANID- Millennium Science Initiative ESMOI.

In this context, the identification of key and fragile habitat-forming species is particularly important. Despite their ecological importance, whip corals in the order Antipatharia remain poorly studied around the world, and especially in the South Pacific. During recent expeditions to explore mesophotic and deep benthic habitats around Rapa Nui (Easter Island), dense assemblages of whip black corals were observed in situ. We here report the first detailed description of the distribution and abundance of these black coral assemblages and their associated fauna and habitat. These descriptions were based on analysis of video surveys collected on 67 remotely operated vehicle dives conducted in 2014 through 2019 at three sites (Pukao seamount, Apolo peak, and Rapa Nui Island shelf and slope) within the Easter Island Ecoregion at depths between 50 and 330 m. At least four morphotypes (yellow, red, white/orange, and Pukao) of unbranched black corals were detected. Each morphotype had polyps arranged in a single row on only one side of the corallum, a diagnostic morphological character currently assigned to the antipatharian genus Stichopathes. Samples of the yellow and red morphotypes were collected and studied using morphological and molecular techniques. These analyses indicate that the genus Stichopathes is not monophyletic and requires further revisions, a conclusion that is consistent with previous studies. Extensive fields of whip black corals, primarily of the yellow and red morphotype, were present at 28 sites from 60 to 245 m on rocky substrates, coarse sand, or rhodoliths. Densities of these assemblages per frame were up to 58.2 ± 5.2 colonies m–2 (average: 13.2 ± 0.8), which represent some of the highest reported densities for black corals to date. Numerous faunal groups, including ophiuroids, echinoids, and fishes, were associated with these whip black coral assemblages. Our observations should be considered in future management and conservation efforts around Rapa Nui, where a multi-use marine protected area was established in 2018, as well as in adjacent international waters that remain unprotected but likely harbor similar assemblages.","We thank Poky Tane Haoa, Ricardo Hito, Enrique Pate, and Enrique Hey from the Rapa Nui community for their collaboration during field work.

This study assessed how oxygen concentrations and other environmental predictors explain variation in echinoderm assemblages at these mesophotic systems, where this group is among the predominant fauna. We compiled data on echinoderm taxa at 91 sampling stations, from historical and recent surveys (between 1950 and 2019), covering a longitudinal gradient of approximately 3,700 km along with the Nazca, Salas y Gómez, and Juan Fernández ridges. Uni- and multivariate model-based tools were applied to analyze the patterns of benthic fauna in relation to environmental factors. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between echinoderm species richness and depth, oxygen, and salinity. Changes in echinoderm community composition were significantly explained by oxygen, longitude, and chlorophyll-a. We observed notable species turnovers at ∼101 and ∼86°W, where assemblages tend to be more variable across stations. This turnover possibly reflects the effects of physical barriers to dispersion (e.g., currents) and habitat changes. Echinoderm assemblages observed around Easter and Desventuradas Islands presented a high occurrence of potentially endemic taxa and distinct species assemblages. This study is the first to assess the structure of mesophotic echinoderm assemblages of the southeastern Pacific Ocean along a large spatial scale. The information reported here could help design appropriate management tools for the vast, recently created, marine protected areas in the southeastern Pacific.","We would like to thank the Chilean Navy and the crew of the AGS Cabo de Hornos as well as the crew of the RV Mirai from JAMSTEC.

The interaction terms were evaluated as well as the confounders. Then, adjusted binary logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).
RESULTS: subjects with a high risk of T2D are more likely to belong to the urban setting (OR = 1.908; 95%CI = 1.201-2.01) compared with those with lower T2D after adjusting for age, Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity, history of high levels of glycemia, and diabetes in relatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Urban communities are more likely to have T2D compared with rural-indigenous populations. These populations have differences from the cultural context, including personal, and lifestyle factors.",,"This work was supported by the Colombian research support program, Colciencias, and Empresa Promigas.",Heliyon,,,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2022-01,8,1,e08653,All OA; Gold,Article,"Molina, Rafael Tuesca; García, Ana Liliana Ríos; Vergara, Tania Acosta; Florez-Garcia, Victor Alfonso; Gutierrez, Víctor Rodríguez; Lozano, Karen Florez; Barengo, Noël C.","Molina, Rafael Tuesca (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Centro Universitario CIFE, Interdisciplinary Research Department, Cuernavaca, Mexico); García, Ana Liliana Ríos (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vergara, Tania Acosta (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Florez-Garcia, Victor Alfonso (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Joseph J.

The idea that arose during the execution of the project “Ecosystem of Digital Content for Apps in Urabá”, carried out between 2019 and 2020, was chosen by the Zapata Rural Educational Institution, IERZ, which provides its services to the Zapata district, Necoclí, for fieldwork between March and May 2020, for the commitment of the educational community and the advancements in the Eduapps process. The methodology included: characterization of the level of appropriation in the face of mobile devices and categorization of how citizenship is evidenced from the daily school exercise. The knowledge was transformed into the micro-learning proposal, the Eduapps model, to strengthen citizen training. In the end, it was possible to demonstrate that the proposal promotes training and tunes the academic community of the village based on the use of mobile digital tools and appropriation of didactic strategies, to understand the importance of assuming their own citizenship to build a peaceful territory and with a real exercise of democracy.",,,Anagramas Rumbos y Sentidos de la Comunicación,,,,2021-07-12,2021,2021-07-12,,20,39,157-180,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ochoa, Beatriz Elena Marín; Lanchero, Luis Javier Cruz","Ochoa, Beatriz Elena Marín (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana); Lanchero, Luis Javier Cruz (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana)",,"Ochoa, Beatriz Elena Marín (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Lanchero, Luis Javier Cruz (Pontifical Bolivarian University)",2,1,,1.83,http://dx.doi.org/10.22395/angr.v20n39a7,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144739965,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

Sobre la base de un anlisis indito de datos provistos por la Agencia Informativa Catlica Argentina (AICA) se analiza la relacin del proceso de creacin de parroquias, capillas y santuarios con la evolucin numrica de los agentes eclesiales que atienden estos lugares de culto. Se vinculan, asimismo, estos aspectos con la evolucin de la poblacin catlica y la de la poblacin general del pas.

Abstract: This article analyzes the creation of territorial ecclesiastic structures of the Catholic Church in Argentina since the mid-20th century. Based on an unprecedented analysis of data provided by the Argentine Catholic Information Agency (Agencia Informativa Catlica Argentina, AICA), the authors analyze the process of creating parishes, chapels and sanctuaries and its relationship with the evolution of the number of ecclesiastic agents who serve in these places of worship. They also link these aspects to the evolution of the Catholic population and the country’s general population. The authors argue that the response of the ecclesiastic hierarchy to the growing institutional distancing of believers was to strengthen their presence. This resulted in a sustained increase in its territorial structures, even though this strategy places pressure on the increasingly limited capacity of the Catholic Church to provide services for these structures, particularly in regard to specialized human resources. The results contribute to a nuanced hypothesis regarding the growing religious desinstitutionalization in the field of religion. The responses of the Catholic ecclesiastic hierarchy to the growing distancing of believers from religious institutions include strengthening its territorial presence through growing institutionalization measured in terms of the creation of places of worship.",,,Cultura y religión,,,,2021-12-31,2021,2021-12-31,,15,2,67-105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Suárez, Ana Lourdes; Olszanowski, Martín","Suárez, Ana Lourdes (); Olszanowski, Martín ()",,"Suárez, Ana Lourdes (); Olszanowski, Martín ()",5,3,,1.83,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/cultrelig/v15n2/0718-4727-cultrelig-15-02-67.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145058754,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society,

Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) age of onset (ADAOO) is crucial to investigate potential treatments, follow-up, and therapeutic interventions. Although genetic and non-genetic factors affecting ADAOO were elucidated by other research groups and ours, the comprehensive and sequential application of ML to provide an exact estimation of the actual ADAOO, instead of a high-confidence-interval ADAOO that may fall, remains to be explored. Here, we assessed the performance of ML algorithms for predicting ADAOO using two AD cohorts with early-onset familial AD and with late-onset sporadic AD, combining genetic and demographic variables. Performance of ML algorithms was assessed using the root mean squared error (RMSE), the R-squared (R2), and the mean absolute error (MAE) with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. For predicting ADAOO in familial AD, boosting-based ML algorithms performed the best. In the sporadic cohort, boosting-based ML algorithms performed best in the training data set, while regularization methods best performed for unseen data. ML algorithms represent a feasible alternative to accurately predict ADAOO with little human intervention. Future studies may include predicting the speed of cognitive decline in our cohorts using ML.",We express our highest appreciation to all patients and their relatives enrolled in this study for more than 30 years.,"L.A.S. was financed by COLCIENCIAS and the Department of Atlántico, project “Desarrollo, Implementación y Comparación de Modelos Genómicos de Predicción para la Edad de Inicio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer”, grant #809-2018.

It has been used as a predictor of long-term survival and prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of CCI score on mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients and test the efficacy of the CoLACD score (COVID-19 lymphocyte ratio, age, CCI score, dyspnoea) in predicting mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
METHODOLOGY: It was a retrospective cohort, and the data of this study were gathered from two tertiary hospitals of Karachi, including Liaquat National Hospital and Ziauddin Hospital. Data of patients hospitalized in any of these tertiary care hospitals and diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 infection were used in the study from January 15, 2021, to April 30, 2021.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 53.22 (±14.21) years. The majority of participants were males (74.91%). Predictors of mortality include CCI score, age of participants, D-dimer, smoking status, and shortness of breath. The sensitivity of this CoLACD score was 80.23%, and specificity was 50.23% (diagnostic accuracy is 60.45%). The negative predictive value (NPV) of this test was 39.44%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 83.01%.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that CCI can be used in a clinical setting to achieve a prediction of mortality in COVID-19 patients.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-11-27,2021,2021-11-27,2021-11-27,13,11,e19937,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmed, Jawad; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Capriles, Natalia M.

To allow its broad use by family practice physicians (FPs), it was translated from English into nine European languages (Greek, Polish, Bulgarian, Croatian, Catalan, Galician, Spanish, Italian, and French) and the translation homogeneity was confirmed. This study describes this process. Methods: First, two translators (an academic translator and an FP researcher) were recruited for the forward translation (FT). A panel of English-speaking FPs that included at least 15 experts (researchers, teachers, and practitioners) was organized in each country to finalize the FT using a Delphi procedure. Results: One or two Delphi procedure rounds were sufficient for each translation. Then, a different translator, who did not know the original version of the HSCL-25, performed a backward translation in English. An expert panel of linguists compared the two English versions. Differences were listed and a multicultural consensus group determined whether they were due to linguistic problems or to cultural differences. All versions underwent cultural check. Conclusion: All nine translations were finalized without altering the original meaning.",We would like to thank all FPs who participated in the research process throughout Europe and all trainees in Family Medicine from Brest University who participated in the research process and our proof-reader Mrs. Alex Gillman for her accurate translations.,"Funding.

The book explores the value of this vexed concept in advancing the course for multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinary perspectives, methodologies, theories and epistemologies of knowledge pathing. The discourse on knowledge pathing remains critical in advancing debates and dialogues in the humanities and social sciences spaces of research and studies. This book makes a significant contribution to the scholarly understanding of indigenous knowledge research by focusing on problematising local indigenous community research from Afro-sensed perspectives. The field of indigenous knowledge research and higher education in Africa is complex. Yet, across the continent, higher education has been the sector to least embrace Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) or regard indigenous science as a legitimate source of inspiration for the development of youth and local communities. Higher education institutions and local indigenous communities should thus generate knowledge and power through research. On the other hand, higher education researchers should use their research processes and skills for cross-beneficiation when engaging local indigenous communities. This book embodies the current discourse on decolonisation and the use of indigenous knowledge in research and is intended for research specialists in the field of indigenous knowledge systems.",,,"Knowledge Pathing: Multi-, Inter- and Trans-Disciplining in Social Sciences Series",Problematising Local Indigenous Community Research: Afro-Sensed Perspectives,"Kelly J.

This book first investigates the national contexts and development of education in the BRICS countries, arguing that this grouping represents a valuable but yet overlooked field for illuminating South African education issues with international perspectives. The book consists of chapters arguing for and illustrating this thesis from a variety of angles. Common to all chapters is that authors used the comparative method in education, that is comparing the national education system, in their education societal context interrelationships, of the BRICS countries.  The chapters focus on a number of critical issues in South African education, including the language of learning and teaching issue, the alignment of the world of education with the world of work, early childhood education, and the development of world-class universities. Regarding the last, for example, China has been the terrain of the most intensive national projects of establishing world-class universities, with Project 985, Project 211, and the 'Double First Class University' project.  The chapters demonstrate what South Africa, in approaching her education issues, can learn from the experience of the BRICS countries.",,,BRICS Education,Critical Issues in South African Education: Illumination from international comparative perspectives from the BRICS countries,Charl C.

427,pub.1142575061,10.1002/er.7472,,,Ultrahigh‐areal‐capacitance aqueous supercapacitors enabled by soft biomass‐derived porous carbon membrane,"Sustainable biomass‐derived carbons in powdery forms have shown to be high‐performance capacitive electrode materials for application in supercapacitors (SCs) due to their large specific surface area, distinct porous structure, and low cost; however, their practical applications are being largely hampered due to their powdery status‐related issues including tedious electrode assembly process and insufficient capacitance and cycling stability. Herein, we develop a porous carbon membrane, termed as PECM, by direct carbonization of Pleurotus eryngii (PE) using KOH as activator. The as‐fabricated PECM features a hierarchically nanostructure with high porosity, large specific surface area, and excellent electrolyte wettability, which cannot only afford a large usable active area for the interfacial adsorption of electrolyte ions but also supply fast diffusion pathways for electrolyte ions. Moreover, the as‐fabricated PECM is doped with N and also has large amounts of O, S, and P‐containing functional groups, which would be expected to contribute additional pseudocapacitance. More importantly, the as‐fabricated PECM has excellent mechanical performance and can be directly used to assembly an aqueous symmetric SC device. Attributing to the above structural merits of PECM, the two‐electrode symmetric SC assembled using two identical PECM‐800 electrodes (~20 mg cm−2 for each electrode), exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with ultrahigh areal capacitance (4.6 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2), excellent long‐term cycling stability (113% capacitance retention after 20 000 cycles), and superior energy densities of 0.24 to 0.09 mWh cm−2 at power densities of 5.20 to 51.9 mW cm−2. This work offers a new insight on employing biomass to prepare value‐added and practically applicable carbon materials for the application in SCs. A heteroatom‐doped porous carbon membrane (PECM) is fabricated via direct pyrolysis of Pleurotus eryngii (PE) using KOH as an activator and directly used as a self‐supported electrode for assembling an aqueous supercapacitor. The PECM possesses a hierarchically porous structure, high graphitization degree, excellent mechanical strength, and superior electrolyte wettability. The symmetric aqueous supercapacitor based on PECM exhibits ultrahigh areal capacitance of 4.6 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 and a maximum energy density of 0.24 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 5.20 mW cm−2.","This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province (2021AAC02016 and 2021AAC03201), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University (FWNX41), the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Projects for Returnees of Ningxia Province, the Foundation of Academic Top‐notch Talent Support Program of the North Minzu University (2019BGBZ08), the Leading Talents Program of Science and Technology Innovation in Ningxia Province (2020GKLRLX14), and the Cooperative Scientific Research Project of Chunhui Plan of Ministry of Education of China (201900081).","Funding information Foundation of Academic Top‐notch Talent Support Program of the North Minzu University, Grant/Award Number: 2019BGBZ08; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University, Grant/Award Number: FWNX41; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Projects for Returnees of Ningxia Province; Leading Talents Program of Science and Technology Innovation in Ningxia Province, Grant/Award Number: 2020GKLRLX14; Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province, Grant/Award Numbers: 2021AAC02016, 2021AAC03201; the Cooperative Scientific Research Project of Chunhui Plan of Ministry of Education of China, Grant/Award Number: 201900081",International Journal of Energy Research,,,,2021-11-14,2021,2021-11-14,2022-03-25,46,4,4781-4793,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cui, Mengxia; Wang, Fang; Zhang, Zhengguo; Min, Shixiong","Cui, Mengxia (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China); Wang, Fang (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China); Zhang, Zhengguo (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China); Min, Shixiong (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Technology, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China; Ningxia Key Laboratory of Solar Chemical Conversion Technology, North Minzu University, Yinchuan, China)","Min, Shixiong (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University)","Cui, Mengxia (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University); Wang, Fang (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University); Zhang, Zhengguo (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University); Min, Shixiong (North Minzu University; North Minzu University; North Minzu University)",13,11,,1.78,https://doi.org/10.1002/er.7472,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142575061,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

All the microstructures were synthesized at a very low temperature of 70 °C with a reduced reaction time of 3 h. An increase in the pH from 0.8 to 2.1 decreased the particle sizes from 3 µm to 200 nm and an increase in the aging time from zero, three, and seven days resulted in semispherical, spherical, and euhedral jarosite structures, respectively. The Rietveld analysis also confirmed that the amount of hydronium substitution by potassium in the cationic site increased with an increase in pH. The percentages of hydronium jarosite (JH)/potassium jarosite (JK) for pH values of 0.8, 1.1, and 2.1 were 77.72/22.29%, 82.44/17.56%, and 89.98/10.02%, respectively. Microstructures obtained in this work were tested as alternative anode materials and the voltage measured using these electrodes made with hydronium-potassium jarosite microstructures and graphite ranged from 0.89 to 1.36 V.

Application to the Cádiz Bay, Spain","Tsunami hazard can be analyzed from both deterministic and probabilistic points of view. The deterministic approach is based on a “credible” worst case tsunami, which is often selected from historical events in the region of study. Within the probabilistic approach (PTHA, Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Analysis), statistical analysis can be carried out in particular regions where historical records of tsunami heights and runup are available. In areas where these historical records are scarce, synthetic series of events are usually generated using Monte Carlo approaches. Commonly, the sea level variation and the currents forced by the tidal motion are either disregarded or considered and treated as aleatory uncertainties in the numerical models. However, in zones with a macro and meso tidal regime, the effect of the tides on the probability distribution of tsunami hazard can be highly important. In this work, we present a PTHA methodology based on the generation of synthetic seismic catalogs and the incorporation of the sea level variation into a Monte Carlo simulation. We applied this methodology to the Bay of Cádiz area in Spain, a zone that was greatly damaged by the 1755 earthquake and tsunami. We build a database of tsunami numerical simulations for different variables: faults, earthquake magnitudes, epicenter locations and sea levels. From this database we generate a set of scenarios from the synthetic seismic catalogs and tidal conditions based on the probabilistic distribution of the involved variables. These scenarios cover the entire range of possible tsunami events in the synthetic catalog (earthquakes and sea levels). Each tsunami scenario is propagated using the tsunami numerical model C3, from the source region to the target coast (Cádiz Bay). Finally, we map the maximum values for a given probability of the selected variables (tsunami intensity measures) producing a set of thematic hazard maps. 1000 different time series of combined tsunamigenic earthquakes and tidal levels were synthetically generated using the Monte Carlo technique. Each time series had a 10000-year duration. The tsunami characteristics were statistically analyzed to derive different thematic maps for the return periods of 500, 1000, 5000, and 10000 years, including the maximum wave elevation, the maximum current speed, the maximum Froude number, and the maximum total forces.",We thank to the Environmental Ministry of Spain (Dirección General de Costas de Andalucia) for providing us the local bathymetry.

Method: For the above, the financial asset valuation model (CAPM) was calculated for 18 thousand companies in Colombia before and after 2015, the year of the implementation of the IFRS in this country. Results and discussion: As a main finding it was found that the cost of capital increases 4% after the application of IFRS standards, although the weight of financial risk in the total risk did not change due to the adoption of the new accounting standards, however, companies dedicated to sectors related to raw materials, real estate activities and natural resources showed a greater sensitivity to market performance, while companies in the manufacturing industry showed a negative correlation with the market. Conclusion: It can be concluded that IFRS contribute to the better valuation of the risk of the companies' capital by better discounting the capacity of the firms to generate cash flows and profits to face debts.",,,Desarrollo Gerencial,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-01-01,,13,1,1-20,All OA; Gold,Article,"Botello-Peñaloza, Héctor","Botello-Peñaloza, Héctor (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia)",,"Botello-Peñaloza, Héctor (Industrial University of Santander)",3,0,,1.74,https://revistas.unisimon.edu.co/index.php/desarrollogerencial/article/download/4049/5368,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134001284,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",

One solution is to be able to process copper sulphide ores hydrometallurgically. However, it is widely known that sulphide copper ores—and chalcopyrite in particular—have very slow dissolution kinetics in traditional leaching systems. An alternative to improve the extraction of copper from sulphide ores is the use of a pretreatment process. Several investigations were developed evaluating the effects of pretreatment, mainly in the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite in chloride media. This study presents a review of various pretreatment methods prior to heap leaching to aid in the dissolution of copper from sulphide ores. Different variables of pretreatment that affect the extraction of copper were identified, including the type of salts used in agglomeration, curing time, and curing temperatures. Successful cases such as the implementation of the CuproChlor® process (use of calcium chloride), and various pilot studies using sodium chloride and temperature, show that pretreatment is an alternative that aids in the dissolution of copper from sulphide ores.",,This research received no external funding.,Metals,,,,2021-07-02,2021,2021-07-02,,11,7,1067,All OA; Gold,Article,"Neira, Andrés; Pizarro, Diana; Quezada, Víctor; Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian","Neira, Andrés (Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.)); Pizarro, Diana (Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.)); Quezada, Víctor (Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.)); Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (Escuela de Ingeniería Civil de Minas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Talca, 3340000 Curicó, Chile;, lilian.velasquez@utalca.cl)","Quezada, Víctor (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.))","Neira, Andrés (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.)); Pizarro, Diana (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.)); Quezada, Víctor (Catholic University of the North; Laboratorio de Investigación de Minerales Sulfurados, Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, 1270709 Antofagasta, Chile;, ans004@alumnos.ucn.cl, (A.N.);, diana.pizarro@alumnos.ucn.cl, (D.P.)); Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (University of Talca)",7,3,,1.73,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/7/1067/pdf?version=1626417042,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139386206,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Currently only little information on toxicity and drug interaction potential of the extracts is available. This study now evaluated the effects of two Salix cortex extracts on human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells, in view of clinically relevant CYP450 enzyme activity modulation, cytotoxicity and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Drug metabolism via the CYP450 enzyme system is considered an important parameter for the occurrence of drug-drug interactions, which can lead to toxicity, decreased pharmacological activity, and adverse drug reactions. We evaluated two different bark extracts standardized to 10 mg/ml phenolic content. Herein, extract S6 (S. pentandra, containing 8.15 mg/ml total salicylates and 0.08 mg/ml salicin) and extract B (industrial reference, containing 5.35 mg/ml total salicylates and 2.26 mg/ml salicin) were tested. Both Salix cortex extracts showed no relevant reduction in cell viability or increase in ROS production in hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells. However, they reduced CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzyme activity after 48 h at ≥25 μg/ml, this was statistically significant only for S6. CYP2C19 activity inhibition (0.5 h) was also observed at ≥25 μg/ml, mRNA expression inhibition by 48 h treatment with S6 at 25 μg/ml. In conclusion, at higher concentrations, the tested Salix cortex extracts showed a drug interaction potential, but with different potency. Given the high prevalence of polypharmacy, particularly in the elderly with chronic pain, further systematic studies of Salix species of medical interest should be conducted in the future to more accurately determine the risk of potential drug interactions.","The authors are grateful to Monika Phillip for experimental support.

The isolates were recovered from fin lesion and kidney samples of diseased rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, during two Flavobacteriosis outbreaks occurring in freshwater farms located in Southern Chile. The strains were identified as Epilithonimonas spp. by using biochemical tests and by genome comparison analysis using the PATRIC bioinformatics platform and exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxytetracycline of 128 µg/mL. The tet(X) genes were located on small contigs of the FP105 and FP233-J200 genomes. The sequences obtained for the tet(X) genes and their genetic environment were compared with the genomes available in the GenBank database of strains of the Chryseobacterium clade belonging to the Flavobacterium family, isolated from fish and carrying the tet(X) gene. The Tet(X) proteins synthesized by the Chilean Epilithonimonas strains showed a high amino acid similarity (range from 84% to 100%), with the available sequences found in strains belonging to the genus Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium isolated from fish. An identical neighborhood of tet(X) genes from both Chilean strains was observed. The genetic environment of tet(X) observed in the two strains of Epilithonimonas studied was characterized by the upstream location of a sequence encoding a hypothetical protein and a downstream located alpha/beta hydrolase-encoding gene, similar to the observed in some of the tet(X) genes carried by Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium strains isolated from fish, but the produced proteins exhibited a low amino acid identity (25-27%) when compared to these synthesized by the Chilean strains. This study reports for the first time the carriage of the tet(X) gene by the Epilithonimonas genus and their detection in fish pathogenic bacteria isolated from farmed salmonids in Chile, thus limiting the use of therapies based on oxytetracycline, the antimicrobial most widely used in Chilean freshwater salmonid farming.

The application of the electroosmotic drainage technique to solid residues from leaching and tailings has been proposed to address this problem. The experimental part of this work consists of an experimental design with synthetic solid matrices. The percentage of fine particles and the initial moisture level were defined as factors with three levels. The volume of drained liquid was defined as the response variable. The results showed that electroosmotic drainage was more efficient than gravitational drainage when the moisture content and the percentage of fine material were at their highest levels. The effect of the factors and their interaction was corroborated by an analysis of variance.

ADHD-affected patients display visual-motor and visuospatial abilities and skills that depart from those exhibited by non-affected individuals and struggle with perceptual organization, which might partially explain impulsive responses. Endophenotypes (quantifiable or dimensional constructs that are closely related to the root cause of the disease) might provide a more powerful and objective framework for dissecting the underlying neurobiology of ADHD than that of categories offered by the syndromic classification. In here, we explore the potential presence of the linkage and association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), harbored in genes implicated in the etiology of ADHD (ADGRL3, DRD4, and FGF1), with cognitive endophenotypes related to working memory and perceptual organization in 113 nuclear families. These families were ascertained from a geographical area of the Caribbean coast, in the north of Colombia, where the community is characterized by its ethnic diversity and differential gene pool. We found a significant association and linkage of markers ADGRL3-rs1565902, DRD4-rs916457 and FGF1-rs2282794 to neuropsychological tasks outlining working memory and perceptual organization such as performance in the digits forward and backward, arithmetic, similarities, the completion of figures and the assembly of objects. Our results provide strong support to understand ADHD as a combination of working memory and perceptual organization deficits and highlight the importance of the genetic background shaping the neurobiology, clinical complexity, and physiopathology of ADHD. Further, this study supplements new information regarding an ethnically diverse community with a vast African American contribution, where ADHD studies are scarce.","We express our highest appreciation to all idividuals enrolled in this study.

In this framework, the research aimed to assess the mediating effect of ethnic identity and collective self-esteem on the inverse relationship between mental health problems and quality of life. Data were collected from 908 first-generation Colombian migrants living in Chile, of whom 50.2% were women and with an average age of 35 years. They were assessed with The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQoL)-Bref, Smith's ethnic identity questionnaire, Basabe's collective self-esteem, and Beck's Anxiety and Depression questionnaires. The results provide evidence that both collective self-esteem and ethnic identity exert a partial mediation effect on the relationship between anxiety and depression on quality of life. The study provides evidence of the protective role that the maintenance and reinforcement of ethnic identity and collective self-esteem can have, with a view to strengthening the planning of interventions both in the field of prevention of mental health problems and in the improvement of quality of life based on evidence.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Aristomenis Exadaktylos, Paul B.

Objective: Analyze the concept of Humanization of health services. Materials and Methods: The proposal of Beth L. Rodgers was applied, which establishes seven steps for concept analysis. The documentary research was made with the databases Springer Plus, Pubmed, EBSCO Host and Biblioteca Virtual en Salud (Virtual Library of Health) and national organizations; in Spanish, English and Portuguese. Results: It was possible to analyze the concept of humanization of health assistance with 33 scientific articles, where ethical, epistemological and methodological attributes are described. Similarly, the assertive and effective communication is emphasized for health assistance, in the context of health-disease, contributing to nursing conceptions about humanization in that framework. Conclusions: Humanization of health assistance allows the development of strategies for the benefit of well-being and the good practice. Although the concept of humanization of assistance can be analyzed from different perspectives, the methodology of concept analysis is a useful perspective to consider the humanization of health assistance as a central concept that orientates policies of improvement and quality of assistance, as well as the promotion of practices that facilitate collaborative work, communication and human development.",,,Revista Ciencia y Cuidado,,,,2021-09-01,2021,2021-09-01,,18,3,74-85,All OA; Gold,Article,"Henao-Castaño, Angela Maria; Vergara-Escobar, Oscar Javier; Gómez-Ramírez, Olga Janeth","Henao-Castaño, Angela Maria (Universidad Nacional de Colombia); Vergara-Escobar, Oscar Javier (Fundación Universitaria Juan N Corpas); Gómez-Ramírez, Olga Janeth (Universidad Nacional de Colombia)",,"Henao-Castaño, Angela Maria (National University of Colombia); Vergara-Escobar, Oscar Javier (Fundación Universitaria Juan N.

We included individuals aged ≥60 years, native Spanish-speakers, with at least a primary school educational level and a complete clinical assessment. Patients had either subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, or dementia. One-way ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: We included 720 patients (330 SCD, 154 MCI, and 236 dementia); the dementia group was significantly older [mean age SCD 69.7 ± 4.1, dementia 72.4 ± 3.7 (p = 0.000)] and had lower folate levels than SCD patients. The MCI group had higher free T3 levels compared with SCD patients. Those with lower TSH had greater dementia risk (OR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.15-6.86) but not MCI risk in unadjusted models. B12 deficiency or borderline B12 deficiency was present in 34% of the dementia group, yet no clear correlation was seen between neuropsychological test results and B12 levels in our study. There was no association between MCI or dementia and thyroid hormone, B12 nor folate levels in adjusted models. Conclusion: Our findings do not support an association between metabolic and endocrine disorders and cognitive impairment in older Peruvians from Lima despite a high prevalence of B12 deficiency. Future work may determine if cognitive decline is associated with metabolic or endocrine changes in Latin America.",,"Funding.

Method: Based on a sample of 102 SMEs from the fruit and vegetable sector of the North of Valle del Cauca (Colombia) and a multivariate analysis through the modeling of structural equations. Results: the findings confirm that there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and exploitation with open innovation, the former has a stronger relationship. Depth had a non-significant negative effect on open innovation. A relationship between absorptive capacity and open innovation could not be verified. Conclusions: These findings suggest that exploitation and entrepreneurial orientation are antecedents of open innovation in SMEs, therefore, the strategies of the National Agricultural Innovation System should be aimed at strengthening these capacities so that they improve the conditions of the fruit and vegetable sector in Colombia.

This species is characterized by a fast uptake and release of the toxin. In this work, the main characteristics of the uptake mechanism have been studied by incubation of digestive gland thin slices in media with different composition and DA concentration. DA uptake seems to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a very high estimated KM (1722 µg DA mL-1) and a Vmax of 71.9 µg DA g-1 h-1, which is similar to those found for other amino acids in invertebrates. Replacement of NaCl from the incubation media by Cl-choline (Na+-free medium) did not significantly reduce the uptake, but replacement by sorbitol (Na+-free and Cl--depleted medium) did. A new experiment replacing all chlorides with their equivalent gluconates (Na+- and Cl--free medium) showed an important reduction in the uptake that should be attributed to the absence of chloride, pointing to a Na+-independent, Cl- (or anion-) dependent transporter. In media with Na+ and Cl-, neither decreasing the pH nor adding cyanide (a metabolic inhibitor) had significant effect on DA uptake, suggesting that the transport mechanism is not H+- or ATP-dependent. In a chloride depleted medium, lowering pH or adding CN increased the uptake, suggesting that other anions could, at least partially, substitute chloride.",We acknowledge the Department of Biotoxins of the Instituto Tecnolóxico para o Control de Medio Mariño de Galicia (Intecmar) for supplying us with the mussels used in this study and for permitting inclusion of the domoic acid analyses.,"This research was funded by Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, grant number AGL2012-39972-C02-02.",Toxins,,,Animals; Chlorides; Cyanides; Gastrointestinal Tract; Gluconates; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kainic Acid; Mytilus; Seawater,2021-06-30,2021,2021-06-30,,13,7,458,All OA; Gold,Article,"Blanco, Juan; Mariño, Carmen; Martín, Helena; Álvarez, Gonzalo; Rossignoli, Araceli E.","Blanco, Juan (Centro de Investigacións Mariñas (CIMA), Xunta de Galicia, Pedras de Coron s/n, 36620 Vilanova de Arousa, Spain;, maria.carmen.marino.cadarso@xunta.gal, (C.M.);, helena.martin.sanchez@xunta.gal, (H.M.);, araceli.escudeiro.rossignoli@xunta.gal, (A.E.R.)); Mariño, Carmen (Centro de Investigacións Mariñas (CIMA), Xunta de Galicia, Pedras de Coron s/n, 36620 Vilanova de Arousa, Spain;, maria.carmen.marino.cadarso@xunta.gal, (C.M.);, helena.martin.sanchez@xunta.gal, (H.M.);, araceli.escudeiro.rossignoli@xunta.gal, (A.E.R.)); Martín, Helena (Centro de Investigacións Mariñas (CIMA), Xunta de Galicia, Pedras de Coron s/n, 36620 Vilanova de Arousa, Spain;, maria.carmen.marino.cadarso@xunta.gal, (C.M.);, helena.martin.sanchez@xunta.gal, (H.M.);, araceli.escudeiro.rossignoli@xunta.gal, (A.E.R.)); Álvarez, Gonzalo (Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile;, gmalvarez@ucn.cl; Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Algas y Otros Recursos Biológicos (CIDTA), Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Rossignoli, Araceli E.

Thirteen barriers were previously listed from the literature, and information about them was collected from 24 experienced managers who know the realities of small and medium-sized companies in the sector. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The frequency distribution showed that in each barrier, there was more than 50% of the responses allocated in the upper range, that is, medium or intense observation, demonstrating that SMEs experience many difficulties in this theme. When comparatively analysed via Fuzzy TOPSIS, difficulties associated with lack of knowledge and financial resources/incentives that can support SMEs in adopting sustainable practices are highlighted. The main contribution of this study is to provide robust information that company managers and other researchers can use.

Treatment options, such as surgery and cryotherapy may be difficult or not feasible. Alternative therapies, such as immunomodulating drugs, can potentially be used for companion large animals. The hypothesis of the following retrospective study is: following multiple intravenous and intralesional injections of a mycobacterial cell wall stimulant (MCW) regression of SCC in equine, bovine and caprine patients will be observed. In this observational-retrospective case series, patients included are 2 bovine, 2 caprine and 3 equine patients. The medical records at two different teaching veterinary hospitals were searched for cases with a positive histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma that were subsequently treated with MCW, as either the sole therapy, or in conjunction with other therapies. Seven cases were included in this retrospective study. The median duration of therapy was 56.5 days, with 3 of the 7 patients being euthanized. Significant complications were seen in 3/7 patients. Repeated injections of a MCW may lead to reduction in lesion size of SCC in some cases, but long-term resolution is unlikely and the risk of significant complications is high; due to limited sample size and the variety in species, it is difficult to conclude if MCW is an effective therapy for SCC.",The authors would like to acknowledge the staff at both Oklahoma State University and North Carolina State University for their assistance and help with each of the cases reported in the manuscript.

203,pub.1140584261,10.3390/universe7080308,,,New Bounds for the Mass of Warm Dark Matter Particles Using Results from Fermionic King Model,"After reviewing several aspects about the thermodynamics of self-gravitating systems that undergo the evaporation (escape) of their constituents, some recent results obtained in the framework of fermionic King model are applied here to the analysis of galactic halos considering warm dark matter (WDM) particles. According to the present approach, the reported structural parameters of dwarf galaxies are consistent with the existence of a WDM particle with mass in the keV scale. Assuming that the dwarf galaxy Willman 1 belongs to the region III of fermionic King model (whose gravothermal collapse is a continuous phase transition), one obtains the interval 1.2 keV ≤ m ≤ 2.6 keV for the mass of WDM particle. This analysis improves previous estimates by de Vega and co-workers [Astropart. Phys. 46 (2013) 14–22] considering both the quantum degeneration and the incidence of the constituents evaporation. This same analysis evidences that most of galaxies are massive enough to undergo a violent gravothermal collapse (a discontinuous microcanonical phase transition) that leads to the formation of a degenerate core of WDM particles. It is also suggested that quantum-relativistic processes governing the cores of large galaxies (e.g., the formation of supermassive black holes) are somehow related to the gravothermal collapse of the WDM degenerate cores when the total mass of these systems are comparable to the quantum-relativistic characteristic mass Mc=ℏc/G3/2m−2≃1012M⊙ obtained for WDM particles with mass m in the keV scale. The fact that a WDM particle with mass in the keV scale seems to be consistent with the observed properties of dwarf and large galaxies provides a strong support to this dark matter candidate.","The author would like to thank “Núcleo de Investigación No.7 UCN-VRIDT 076/2020, Núcleo de modelación y simulación científica (NMSC)” for the scientific support.

As an example, the relation between perceived discrimination and contextual problems-which include family, school and peer problems-among children and adolescents in Latin America has received little attention from previous studies. Further, the mediating role of ethnic identification and collective self-esteem in this relation also needs to be considered as they could be proven as protective factors for discriminatory behavior and its outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to, first, establish the relationship between perceived discrimination and contextual problems in inter-ethnic students aged 8-19 years living in Arica, Chile; and second, to identify the role that ethnic identification and collective self-esteem play within this relation. In order to investigate this matter, a cross-sectional study was carried out with 3700 students in 29 schools between the fourth year of primary education and the last year of secondary education, aged between 9-18 years, with 48.4% men and 51.6% women. The sample was divided into primary and secondary school groups. The scales utilized were the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Multi-Group Ethnic Identity Measure-Revised Scale, Collective Self-Esteem Scale and the dimensions of contextual family, school and peer problems, as well as the general index of contextual problems of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System. For data analysis, we tested a path analytic model at both the within and between levels to account for the relations between variables. In each group the models obtained an optimal fit. We found that perceived discrimination and ethnic identification were directly related to contextual problems (.23-.39), and collective self-esteem had only a mediating role.

The method relies on a spatial and statistical analysis of infrastructure risks, along with traffic accident frequency and severity. A relevant feature of this methodology is related to its potential to be used in areas where there are no detailed historical records about traffic crashes, which is common in Global South countries. We applied the methodology to a rural road network in Colombia, where a recent law established that technical criteria should support the location of speed cameras. The case study uses accident information from six years, and risk data from a road safety audit carried out in the area under study. Even though historical records of accidents in the area were not fully available, the methodology allowed prioritising speed camera installations in the zone and identifying the relevant variables to define camera location. The relevant variables were the geometric characteristics of the road, traffic flows, risk factors, and proximity to populated centres. The use of speed controls should be part of a road safety management system, which allows defining camera location according to robust technical criteria.",,,Transport,,,,2021-08-17,2021,2021-08-17,2021-08-17,36,3,199-212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coronell, Garis; Arellana, Julián; Cantillo, Víctor","Coronell, Garis (Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Coronell, Garis (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)",4,2,,1.6,https://journals.vilniustech.lt/index.php/Transport/article/download/15117/10611,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140486942,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being

Most research in this field describes measurements and signal processing methods to determine the effect of some design modifications. However, the number of investigations that try to solve the problem from the design stage is much smaller. The following study presents a review of the trends in the analysis of vibrations of power transmission elements and their relationship to the use of systematic design methodologies in the principal power transmission elements. A revision is shown in design considerations to prevent mechanical vibrations or reduce them to acceptable levels. The effects in terms of improvement in reducing vibrations of the most important works that have taken into account the vibrations in design stages are shown. The results show the importance of considering the mechanical vibrations in the design of power transmission elements. Moreover, the analysis of the state of the art shows the areas to be investigated that contemplate the development or application of formal design methodologies that take into account mechanical vibrations.","The authors would like to thank the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Universidad del Norte, and Universidad de Magallanes for their academic support in this research.",The research was supported by MINCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 785.,Machines,,,,2021-09-25,2021,2021-09-25,,9,10,212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villalba, Rafael Tuirán; Ramírez, Heriberto Maury; Estrada, Héctor Águila","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Seccional Montería, Cra 6 #97A-99, Montería 230002, Colombia); Ramírez, Heriberto Maury (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, hmaury@uninorte.edu.co); Estrada, Héctor Águila (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad de Magallanes, Avenida Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile;, hector.aguila@umag.cl)","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Pontifical Bolivarian University)","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Ramírez, Heriberto Maury (Universidad del Norte); Estrada, Héctor Águila (University of Magallanes)",5,2,,1.59,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/9/10/212/pdf?version=1632713647,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141438685,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

In most cases the individuals are from bycatch but also from intentionally killed animals. Cetaceans with coastal habits are more susceptible to negative interactions with small-scale fisheries, as in the case of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) in the Lake Maracaibo system. For decades, the use of Guiana dolphins by local communities has been reported in this region and is culturally supported by recipes for its preparation. Most of these data was outdated and some were anecdotal, so the objective of this work was to collect systematically data through surveys using the snowball method in seven artisanal fishing communities and to try to quantify the capture rate and to inquire about the potential impact of this practice on the population of Guiana dolphin. From 2017 to 2019, 95 semi-structured interviews were applied. An average bycatch of 180 individuals/year was obtained, the highest catch rate in the entire geographic distribution, an alarming situation considering that the surveys were not carried out in all the fishing ports, generating an underestimation. A total of 78% of interviewed recognized at least one bycatch event during their fishing effort. Surveys revealed a higher incidence of entanglement of offspring and juveniles (78%). 77% of the respondents deny the sale and commercialization of the species, while 5% mention some type of trade. The most frequent part exploited was the dorsal muscle, confirmed by fishermen (97%, n = 72) and the rest of the animal is discarded. During this investigation three episodes of directed capture were recorded, affecting a total of 23 individuals, two of them were pregnant females. The interviews also revealed that the majority of fishermen (93%) recognize the capture of this species as illegal. Considering the vulnerability of the Guiana dolphin in the country, the high incidence of capture and consumption and the lack of surveillance and sanctions by government entities, it is imperative to immediate actions to mitigate the negative impact on the population.","We want to thank the collaborators in the field, Juan Chacín, Carlos Valencia, Omar Morales, Joselo Morales, and Junior Morales, who contributed to the collection of data and links with the fishermen in the investigated localities.",Funding.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, N. pectoralis is assessed globally as Data Deficient. Using low-coverage short Illumina 300 bp pair-end reads sequencing, this study reports, for the first time, the genome size, single/low-copy genome content, and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S rRNA DNA operon and microsatellites, in N. pectoralis. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer approach was 816.04 Mbp, which is within the range previously reported for other representatives of the Carangiformes order. Single/low-copy genome content (63%) was relatively high. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to the known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were considerably more abundant than Class I-Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements and Class I-LTR Retroviral elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon in N. pectoralis consists of, in the following order: a 5' ETS (length = 948 bp), ssrDNA (1835 bp), ITS1 (724 bp), a 5.8S rDNA (158 bp), ITS2 (508 bp), lsrDNA (3924 bp), and a 3' ETS (32 bp). A total of 44 SSRs were identified.

Apparently, discrimination is an important variable for explaining the initiation and continued use of alcohol and marijuana. Since most research focused on discrimination based on factors, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender faced by minority groups, studies on discrimination faced by the general population remain scarce. This cross-sectional study described the relationship between everyday discrimination and alcohol and marijuana use-related behaviors among Chilean adolescents. It included 2330 students between 12 and 20 years of age from educational establishments in the city of Arica. To evaluate substance use, specifically alcohol and marijuana, the Child and Adolescent Evaluation System (SENA) was used. The Everyday Discrimination scale was used to evaluate discrimination. Age and everyday discrimination can predict up to 11% of the variance in substance use.

Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Although knowledge of the microstructure of food of vegetal origin helps us to understand the behavior of food materials, the variability in the microstructural elements complicates this analysis. In this regard, the construction of learning models that represent the actual microstructures of the tissue is important to extract relevant information and advance in the comprehension of such behavior. Consequently, the objective of this research is to compare two machine learning techniques—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN)—when used to enhance its microstructural analysis. Two main contributions can be highlighted from this research. First, a method is proposed to automatically analyze the microstructural elements of vegetal tissue; and second, a comparison was conducted to select a classifier to discriminate between tissue structures. For the comparison, a database of microstructural elements images was obtained from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) micrographs. Two classifiers were implemented using CNN and RBNN, and statistical performance metrics were computed using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. This process was repeated one hundred times with a random selection of images in each repetition. The comparison showed that the classifiers based on CNN produced a better fit, obtaining F1–score average of 89.42% in front of 83.83% for RBNN.

Traditionally, many developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America remain marginal participants in the global flow of biodata, which will eventually affect their productivity and economies. Here, we present the Ecuadorian Microbiome Project (EcuMP) as an integrative initiative to close the research gap in the microbiome for Ecuador. We discuss the relevance that the study of the microbiome has for our understanding of diversity and new forms of production and biocapital. We also evaluate the state of research in metagenomics and the microbiome for South America, with emphasis on Ecuador as a small but biodiverse country. In the strict sense of access, understanding, and technological innovation based on molecular data, we propose the definition of bioliteracy. As indirect estimates of bioliteracy, we measured the number of indexed publications, BioProjects, monthly global internet traffic to GenBank, and patent applications in Espacenet. South America has a notable unevenness in scientific productivity related to the microbiome and metagenomics. Brazil leads productivity, with most of the measured parameters remaining one order of magnitude higher than other countries in the region. Participation of South American countries in the global flow of genomic information dwarfs when compared to the US. To reduce the effects of technological dependency and the associated lack of economic productivity, Ecuador should address the technological gap in the study of the microbiome. Our assessment reveals the urgency to translate the study of microbiomes into a source of technological prowess and the basis for local biocapitals.","Our project has been funded by the Research Grants Programme of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), to which we extend our gratitude.

This results in a form of chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH) characterized by alternating periods of work at high altitude and rest periods at sea level. Previous studies performed in our laboratory showed that aerobic capacity is reduced at 3,800 m, even when oxygen content is maintained. Our study aimed to determine the corporal composition, food intake, maximum oxygen uptake, and concentration of high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) in an acclimatized miner population that work from 0 to 2,500 m with CIHH exposure over 4 years. All miners recruited for our study were operators of heavy trucks with CIHH for over 4 years (shiftwork 7*7 days), and our experimental population was composed of 54 miners at sea level, 61 at 1,600 m, and 38 at 2,500 m. All evaluations were performed on the 3rd or 4th day of diurnal shiftwork. To determine corporal composition, we measured weight and height (to calculate body mass index, BMI), skinfolds (to calculate body fatty, BF), and waist circumference (WC); maximal aerobic capacity was evaluated using a ramp-incremental cycling to exhaustion protocol and a venous blood sample before the exercise test to measure (hsCRP) via an ELISA test. We found higher values of BMI, BF, and WC, in the miners' population but observed no significant difference between populations. We found a decrease in VO2 of 11.6% at 1,600 m and 25.9% at 2,500 m compared to miners at sea level. An increase in (hsCRP) at 1,600 and 2,500 m regards sea level. We observed a high prevalence of overweight and obese subjects, which was related to the ad libitum availability of food and low physical activity (sedentarism). We found that work capacity was maintained despite a decreased VO2 max at moderate altitude. However, overweight and obesity support an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in miner's which is unrelated to altitude. In contrast, an increased hsCRP level could be associated with increased inflammatory mechanisms at 1,600 and 2,500 m.","We are grateful for the technical assistance of Mrs. Hervis Galleguillos and Andrés Robles who collaborated in procedures, evaluations, and operational support.

Engagement is a relevant concept to measure the investment of time, attention and the triggers that motivate a person to consume a certain platform or content, especially social networks; through it, is possible to have elements to quantify with clear indicators the quality of the users’ experience with the digital media they consume, which is made up of various attributes like perception, attention and emotion effect, cognition and feedback. Instagram, a social network for sharing still and moving images, is one of the platforms with the highest level of growth in recent years. Through the quantitative methodology using a factorial analysis, the main engagement attributes that young Mexicans perceive to experience with IGTV were established. The results suggest that young Mexicans consume Instagram TV motivated by entertainment needs, by their interest in various topics and in people who share the information they are interested in. IGTV generates value for them regarding purchase decisions and information relevant to their life and, in short, challenges them to think, reflect and to emotionally connect with communities and people.",,,Anagramas Rumbos y Sentidos de la Comunicación,,,,2021-02-17,2021,2021-02-17,,19,38,157-178,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Béjar, Ligia","García-Béjar, Ligia (Universidad Panamericana)",,"García-Béjar, Ligia (Universidad Panamericana)",2,1,,1.51,https://revistas.udem.edu.co/index.php/anagramas/article/download/3482/3209,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139248508,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Seed availability from commercial hatcheries is critical due to recurrent massive mortalities associated with bacterial infections, especially during the veliger larval stage. The immune response plays a crucial role in counteracting the effects of such infections, but being energetically costly, it potentially competes with the physiological and morphological changes that occur during early development, which are equally expensive. Consequently, in this study, energy metabolism parameters at the individual and cellular levels, under routine-basal status and after the exposure to the pathogenic strain bacteria (Vibrio splendidus VPAP18), were evaluated during early ontogeny (trochophore, D-veliger, veliger, pediveliger, and early juveniles) of A. purpuratus. The parameters measured were as follows: (1) metabolic demand, determined as oxygen consumption rate and (2) ATP supplying capacity measured by key mitochondrial enzymes activities [citrate synthase (CS), electron transport system (ETS), and ETS/CS ratio, indicative of ATP supplying efficiency], mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and mitochondrial density (ρ m) using an in vivo image analysis. Data revealed that metabolic demand/capacity varies significantly throughout early development, with trochophores being the most efficient in terms of energy supplying capacity under basal conditions. ATP supplying efficiency decreased linearly with larval development, attaining its lowest level at the pediveliger stage, and increasing markedly in early juveniles. Veliger larvae at basal conditions were inefficient in terms of energy production vs. energy demand (with low ρ m, ΔΨm, enzyme activities, and ETS:CS). Post-challenged results suggest that both trochophore and D-veliger would have the necessary energy to support the immune response. However, due to an immature immune system, the immunity of these stages would rely mainly on molecules of parental origin, as suggested by previous studies. On the other hand, post-challenged veliger maintained their metabolic demand but decreased their ATP supplying capacity, whereas pediveliger increased CS activity. Overall, results suggest that veliger larvae exhibit the lowest metabolic capacity to overcome a bacterial challenge, coinciding with previous works, showing a reduced capacity to express immune-related genes. This would result in a higher susceptibility to pathogen infection, potentially explaining the higher mortality rates occurring during A. purpuratus farming.","The authors would like to thank Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos of the UCN for providing the infrastructure for carrying out the experiments, especially German Lira and Daniel Gonzalez for animal maintenance.

The characteristics and stages of embryonic development were described until the hatching stage. The eggs were obtained by natural spawning from wild-caught broodstocks that were conditioned to captivity for more than 1 year in a 75 m3 marine land-based aquaculture recirculating system in Chile. The water temperature range in the broodstock RAS, during the natural spawns events, was between 18.6 °C and 19.8 °C in December 2012, between 20.4 °C and 21.2 °C in January 2013, between 21.5 °C and 22.4 °C in February 2013, and between 21.90 °C and 22.87 °C in march. Incubators’ water temperature was kept similar, through daily water exchanges, to the temperature recorded at the broodstock tank to lessen thermal stress which could affect the embryonic development. Thirty-one embryonic stages were characterized in 71.83 h until eggs hatching. Five periods of embryonic were distinguished: morula, blastula, gastrula, neurula, and metamery. Translucent telolecitic eggs hatched on the third day of incubation, and which was comparatively longer than reported for Atlantic bonito Sarda sarda and the eastern Pacific bonito Sarda chiliensis lineolata. The morphometric data with the most significant variability between the stages of embryonic development were: the length and height of the head, and the length and height of the eye.

This study examined the mental health of 204 members of the armed forces and the police department assigned to monitor the public roads to enforce the measures adopted by the Peruvian government. The instruments used in the study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and the Revised Mental Health Inventory-5. The results indicate that (during the last month), the majority of the participants felt nervous and edgy (81.8%), and hopeless or sad (68.2%). According to the participants, the feelings of hopelessness and discouragement were significantly affecting their ability to rebound (84.3%). Participants had mixed feelings in regards of the fear generated by COVID-19, 42.6% reported extreme anxiety or panic, 40.6% were uncomfortable to think about COVID-19, and 42.6% were afraid of losing their lives due to the illness. The fear of COVID-19 predicted 19.7% (Adjusted R2 = 0.197; F = 21.32; p = .000) of the participants’ mental health well-being.

The dispersion phenomenon was analyzed through chord length measurements using the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique, complementing size distributions in unweighted and square-weighted modes. The reduction of the rheological properties was significant, decreasing from 231 Pa in a reagent-free environment to 80 Pa after the application of STPP. A frequency sweep in a linear viscoelastic regime indicated that by applying a characteristic dosage of 0.53 kg/t of STPP, the pulp before yielding increases its phase angle, which increases its liquid-like character. Measurements of the chord length verified the dispersion of particles, which showed an apparent increase in the proportion of fine particles and a reduction of the coarser aggregates when STPP was applied. Measurements of the zeta potential suggested that the high anionic charge of the reagent (pentavalent) increases the electrostatic repulsions between particles, overcoming the effect of cations in seawater. The results are relevant for the mining industry, especially when the deposits have high contents of complex gangues, such as clays, that increase the rheological properties. This increases the energy costs and water consumption needed for pumping the tailings from thickeners to the tailing storages facilities.

High-resolution gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) was performed on pooled samples from each area. We calculated equivalent toxic concentrations (WHO-TEQ) based on the current WHO Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEF). The minimum and maximum values of ∑ PCDDs/Fs + DL-PCBs-TEQ were 4.317 pg TEQ/g fat in Coltauco and 6.31 pg TEQ/g fat in Arica. Molina had a total TEQ of 5.50 pg TEQ/g fat. The contribution of PCDD/Fs was approximately five-fold higher than that of DL-PCBs. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) of ∑ PCDDs/Fs + DL-PCBs based on the three pooled samples ranged between 6.71 and 26.28 pg TEQ/kg body weight (bw)/day, with a mean intake of 16.11 (±6.71) pg TEQ/kg bw/day in breastfed children from 0 to 24 months old. These levels were lower than those reported in international studies. Despite the fact that the observed levels were low compared to those in most industrialized countries, the detection of a variety of POPs in breast milk from Chilean women indicates the need for follow-up studies to determine whether such exposures during childhood could represent a health risk in adulthood.","The authors would like to acknowledge the Primary Health Centers of Arica, Coltauco, and Molina for their work in this study.

We focus on examining the geographic coverage, features of the population studied, height measurement techniques, authors' profiles, and growth patterns in children.

The first studies emphasized the differences among socioeconomic levels. Later, there was an interest in minority groups, such as indigenous people and Afro-descendants.

Various authors have proposed changes in lipid metabolism (total cholesterol decrease) as a possible biological marker for suicidal behavior. The objective of this study was to review the studies that have demonstrated a relationship between serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior and to describe the possible pathophysiological mechanisms that associate changes in cholesterol concentration and suicidal behavior. Relevant literature related to serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior was identified through various database searches. The data from the existing literature present the findings that relate low cholesterol levels and possible pathophysiological mechanisms (neuroinflammation, serotonergic neurotransmission), genes related to cholesterol synthesis, pharmacological treatments that alter lipid metabolism and the possible participation in suicidal behavior. Nevertheless, future research is required to describe how serum cholesterol affects cholesterol metabolism in the CNS to establish and understand the role of cholesterol in suicidal behavior.",,This research received no external funding.,Biomedicines,,"Marta Rodríguez-Arias, Carmen Ferrer-Perez",,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,9,11,1559,All OA; Gold,Article,"González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz; Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia; León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia; Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín; Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther; Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso; López-Narváez, María Lilia; Marín-Medina, Alejandro; Nicolini, Humberto; Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina; Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel","González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Jalpa de Méndez, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Jalpa de Méndez 86205, Tabasco, Mexico;, thelma.glez.castro@gmail.com, (T.B.G.-C.);, yazmin.hdez.diaz@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.)); Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia (Departamento de Genética Psiquiátrica, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México 14610, Mexico;, adgenis@inmegen.gob.mx); León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Comalcalco, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Comalcalco 86650, Tabasco, Mexico;, ivanniaescalante10@gmail.com); Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Jalpa de Méndez, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Jalpa de Méndez 86205, Tabasco, Mexico;, thelma.glez.castro@gmail.com, (T.B.G.-C.);, yazmin.hdez.diaz@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.)); Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.)); Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Comalcalco, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Comalcalco 86650, Tabasco, Mexico;, ivanniaescalante10@gmail.com); López-Narváez, María Lilia (Secretaría de Salud de Chiapas, Hospital Chiapas Nos Une “Dr. Gilberto Gómez Maza”, Tuxtla Gutiérrez 29045, Chiapas, Mexico;, dralilialonar@yahoo.com.mx); Marín-Medina, Alejandro (Universidad de Guadalajara, CUCS, Guadalajara 44340, Jalisco, Mexico;, stat5A@hotmail.com); Nicolini, Humberto (Departamento de Genética Psiquiátrica, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México 14610, Mexico;, adgenis@inmegen.gob.mx); Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.)); Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.))","Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Nicolini, Humberto (National Institute of Genomic Medicine)","González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia (National Institute of Genomic Medicine); León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); López-Narváez, María Lilia (Secretaría de Salud de Chiapas, Hospital Chiapas Nos Une “Dr. Gilberto Gómez Maza”, Tuxtla Gutiérrez 29045, Chiapas, Mexico;, dralilialonar@yahoo.com.mx); Marín-Medina, Alejandro (University of Guadalajara); Nicolini, Humberto (National Institute of Genomic Medicine); Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco)",7,6,0.39,1.46,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/9/11/1559/pdf?version=1635416974,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143007229,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,3 Good Health and Well Being
182,pub.1144381789,10.3390/agriculture12010048,,,Supporting the Bidding Decisions of Smallholder Farmers in Public Calls in Brazil,"In Brazil, the National School Feeding Program (PNAE) seeks to contribute to the socio-economic development of smallholder farmers, prioritizing them in supplying their products for preparing daily meals in public schools. However, farmers face challenges in determining which school calls to bid for and the potential benefits from their participation, due to the multiple quantitative and qualitative decision criteria involved. This paper presents a novel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based method for bidding priority setting, to support the decision making. The model was applied for a case study in Brazil. The academic contribution lies in the innovation of using a Double-Frontier Slack-Based Measure (SBM) DEA model for Hierarchical Network systems, i.e., applied to multiple levels and followed by a tie-breaking method. The practical contribution lies in the decision support of farmers by presenting the results at three levels, the first of which is a ranking by the town or urban cluster priority, the second by the school, and the third by the products. Thus, using the rankings of calls, farmers can make informed decisions regarding the feasibility of bidding for each PNAE public call. At the same time, the objective rankings can alleviate friction and conflict within co-operatives during the decision-making process.","The contribution of Paulo Nocera Alves Junior (the corresponding author) includes work done both at the São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC), University of São Paulo (USP), São Carlos/SP, Brazil, and Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Coquimbo, Chile.

707,pub.1136677852,10.3390/genes12040474,33806162,PMC8065656,From Laboratory towards Industrial Operation: Biomarkers for Acidophilic Metabolic Activity in Bioleaching Systems,"In the actual mining scenario, copper bioleaching, mainly raw mined material known as run-of-mine (ROM) copper bioleaching, is the best alternative for the treatment of marginal resources that are not currently considered part of the profitable reserves because of the cost associated with leading technologies in copper extraction. It is foreseen that bioleaching will play a complementary role in either concentration-as it does in Minera Escondida Ltd. (MEL)-or chloride main leaching plants. In that way, it will be possible to maximize mines with installed solvent-extraction and electrowinning capacities that have not been operative since the depletion of their oxide ores. One of the main obstacles for widening bioleaching technology applications is the lack of knowledge about the key events and the attributes of the technology's critical events at the industrial level and mainly in ROM copper bioleaching industrial operations. It is relevant to assess the bed environment where the bacteria-mineral interaction occurs to learn about the limiting factors determining the leaching rate. Thus, due to inability to accurately determine in-situ key variables, their indirect assessment was evaluated by quantifying microbial metabolic-associated responses. Several candidate marker genes were selected to represent the predominant components of the microbial community inhabiting the industrial heap and the metabolisms involved in microbial responses to changes in the heap environment that affect the process performance. The microbial community's predominant components were Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, At. thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus sp. Oxygen reduction, CO2 and N2 fixation/uptake, iron and sulfur oxidation, and response to osmotic stress were the metabolisms selected regarding research results previously reported in the system. After that, qPCR primers for each candidate gene were designed and validated. The expression profile of the selected genes vs. environmental key variables in pure cultures, column-leaching tests, and the industrial bioleaching heap was defined. We presented the results obtained from the industrial validation of the marker genes selected for assessing CO2 and N2 availability, osmotic stress response, as well as ferrous iron and sulfur oxidation activity in the bioleaching heap process of MEL. We demonstrated that molecular markers are useful for assessing limiting factors like nutrients and air supply, and the impact of the quality of recycled solutions. We also learned about the attributes of variables like CO2, ammonium, and sulfate levels that affect the industrial ROM-scale operation.","We acknowledge Minera Escondida Ltd. for providing the data and the samples for this research, Víctor Zepeda, Pedro Galleguillos, and Ing.

Fish is considered a food of high nutritional quality, being of global production, distribution and commercialization mainly for human consumption. Among the fish worldwide obtained from capture fisheries and mainly aquaculture for human consumption is Tilapia, due to the adaptability of this fish under cultivation conditions in addition to the fact that its meat is of quality and accessible economic value. Fish due to its composition, is highly susceptible to deterioration and contamination by different hazards throughout the food chain, putting the safety of products and public health at risk. Shigellosis is among the diseases that may be contracted from the consumption of food contaminated by bacteria of the genus Shigella spp.; food contamination is mainly related to inadequate or non-hygienic conditions and practices in the production, processing and handling of food. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a general perspective of foodborne diseases, especially shigellosis, causal agents, conditioning factors, related foods such as fish, as well as control and preventive actions in order to protect the food safety and public health.

The human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, have a preference to invade reticulocytes during blood-stage infection. Rodent malaria parasites that also prefer reticulocytes could be useful tools to study human malaria reticulocyte invasion. However, previous tropism studies of rodent malaria are inconsistent from one another, making it difficult to compare cell preference of different parasite species and strains. In vivo measurements of cell tropism are also subjected to many confounding factors. Here we developed an ex vivo tropism assay for rodent malaria with highly purified fractions of murine reticulocytes and normocytes. We measured invasion into the different erythrocyte populations using flow cytometry and evaluated the tropism index of the parasite strains. We found that P. berghei ANKA displayed the strongest reticulocyte preference, followed by P. yoelii 17X1.1, whereas P. chabaudi AS and P. vinckei S67 showed mixed tropism. These preferences are intrinsic and were maintained at different reticulocyte and normocyte availabilities. Our study shed light on the true erythrocyte preference of the parasites and paves the way for future investigations on the receptor-ligand interactions mediating erythrocyte tropism.",The authors would like to thank SIgN Flow Cytometry Core for technical assistance with flow cytometry and SIgN Mouse Core for support in animal husbandry.

Ciliates, a group of microbial eukaryotes, exhibit germline-somatic nuclear dimorphism within a single cell with two different genomes. The ciliate Oxytricha trifallax undergoes massive RNA-guided DNA elimination and genome rearrangement to produce a new somatic macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC). This process eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt genes and also deletes hundreds of germline-limited open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed during genome rearrangement. Here, we update the set of transcribed germline-limited ORFs (TGLOs) in O. trifallax. We show that TGLOs tend to be expressed during nuclear development and then are absent from the somatic MAC. We also demonstrate that exposure to synthetic RNA can reprogram TGLO retention in the somatic MAC and that TGLO retention leads to transcription outside the normal developmental program. These data suggest that TGLOs represent a group of developmentally regulated protein-coding sequences whose gene expression is terminated by DNA elimination.","The authors thank Virginia A.

While these analyses only focus on written corpora, an extensive study on the use of tenses in spoken interaction is still missing. In this paper, I try to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the use of Perfekt and Präteritum in the recordings of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, held in Frankfurt am Main, from December 20, 1963, to August 19, 1965, and available on the web page of the Fritz Bauer Institute. Textual analyses of the depositions of five former German prisoners of the Polish concentration camp show that German native speakers use both tenses in their spoken interactions. These results widely contradict their depiction in DAF materials, textbooks, and grammars. Furthermore, the types of Präteritum found are far more diverse than is traditionally held by scholars, who claimed that the use of this tense in spoken language is limited to verbs such as sein (to be), haben (to have) and modals, such as können (can), müssen (must), sollen (should), etc. The outcome of this study shows how the difference between Perfekt and Präteritum is determined by the subjective attitude of the speakers in relation to the information they want to convey.",,,Linguistic Frontiers,,,,2021-09-01,2021,2021-10-14,2021-09-01,4,2,31-37,All OA; Gold,Article,"Concu, Valentina","Concu, Valentina (Assistant Professor.

There is considerable variability among neonates, children, and adults in the incidence of infection and severe disease following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In our study, we analyzed the transcriptome data of primate animal model of Rhesus monkeys to evaluate the expression levels of possible SARS-CoV-2 receptors and proteases and immunologic features in the lungs, colons, livers, and brains at different developmental stages. Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in neonates compared with other populations, which imply the high incidence of infection. Other potential receptors and Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) and cathepsin of endosomal proteases also exhibited dynamic and differential expression patterns. The expression of receptors (ACE2, BSG, and DPP4) and proteases (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS9, CTSL, and CTSB) were highly correlated during lung development, suggesting the high susceptibility of the lungs. TMPRSS9 was specifically highly expressed in the lungs and reached the highest level in neonates, similar to TMPRSS2. Moreover, the immune cell infiltration analysis revealed immunity immaturity in neonates, implying the association with the mild or moderate type of COVID-19.

The multistep invasion process involves specific interactions between parasite ligands and erythrocyte receptors. Erythrocyte-binding-like (EBL) proteins, type I integral transmembrane proteins released from the merozoite micronemes, are known to play an important role in the initiation and formation of tight junctions between the apical end of the merozoite and the erythrocyte surface. In Plasmodium yoelii EBL (PyEBL), a single amino acid substitution in the putative Duffy binding domain dramatically changes parasite growth rate and virulence. This suggests that PyEBL is important for modulating the virulence of P. yoelii parasites. Based on these observations, we sought to elucidate the receptor of PyEBL that mediates its role as an invasion ligand. Using the eukaryotic wheat germ cell-free system, we systematically developed and screened a library of mouse erythrocyte proteins against native PyEBL using AlphaScreen technology. We report that PyEBL specifically interacts with basigin, an erythrocyte surface protein. We further confirmed that the N-terminal cysteine-rich Duffy binding-like region (EBL region 2), is responsible for the interaction, and that the binding is not affected by the C351Y mutation, which was previously shown to modulate virulence of P. yoelii.

Atomistic models of single-crystals and bi-crystals were built considering 11 different crack lengths. Novel approaches based on fracture mechanics concepts were proposed to predict the crack length effect on single-crystals and bi-crystals. The results showed that the effect of the grain boundary on the fracture resistance was beneficial increasing the fracture toughness almost four times for bi-crystals.,,This research was funded by Universidad del Norte.,Nanomaterials,,,,2021-10-21,2021,2021-10-21,,11,11,2783,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer; Zambrano, Habib R","Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia.; Instituto de Diseño y Métodos Industriales, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia 5110566, Chile.); Zambrano, Habib R (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe; Austral University of Chile); Zambrano, Habib R (Universidad del Norte)","Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe; Austral University of Chile); Zambrano, Habib R (Universidad del Norte)",10,10,0.22,1.37,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/11/11/2783/pdf?version=1634797513,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142807096,40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,

However, there is little information regarding prognostic factors and mortality in COVID-19 from Latin American countries. Objectives To determine prognostic factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the impact of tocilizumab use in patients with hyperinflammatory syndrome and severe disease defined by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) with a value greater than or equal to seven points. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized COVID-19 patients from May to July 2020. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors associated with mortality. Results A total of 136 patients required hospital admission. In-hospital mortality was 39.7%. Mortality was observed to be potentiated by older age, LDH serum levels and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lymphopenia and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio were more common in these patients. Similarly, patients who died were classified more frequently with severe disease. The independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age greater than 65 years, type 2 diabetes mellitus, NEWS2 greater than or equal to seven points and LDH greater than 400U/L. The use of Tocilizumab alone was not related with decreased in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis performed in patients with hyperinflammation and severe disease showed similar results. Conclusions COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients was high and mainly related with older age, comorbidities, LDH and the severity of disease at hospital admission.",The authors wish to thank Universidad del Norte and Hospital Universidad del Norte for supporting this project,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-05-06,2021,2021-05-06,2021-05-06,13,5,e14865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nuñez-Ramos, Jose A.; Illera, Elias Forero; Barrios, Jorge Luis Quintero; Arroyo, Hugo Andres Macareno; Sanjuan, Didier Johanna Larios; Barbur, Maria Carolina Manzur; Sanjuanelo, Ana Milena Mejia; Quevedo, Mauro Duvan Mendoza; Viasus-Perez, Diego Fernando; Illera, Elias Forero; Quintero, Jorge Luis L.; Arroyo, Hugo Andres Macareno; Quevedo, Mauro D.

This study also included the evaluation of specificity and sensitivity of VBGs values for the identification of abnormal ABG values.
METHOD: It was a retrospective, observational study conducted at the Indus Hospital and Health Network, Karachi, Pakistan. All VBG and ABG values in the same patient which were collected at the same time from April 2020 to May 2021 were included in the study.  Results: The study involved 377 patients; 52.8% of patients were female, while 47.2% were male. The mean age of patients was 53.4 years (±17.2). There is an acceptable agreement between the arterial and venous values of pH, bicarbonate (mEq/l), and lactate (mEq/l), respectively, and poor agreement in PCO2 (mmHg) and PO2.
CONCLUSION: The study found that analysis of VBG has the potential to be used in the emergency setting in general. Blood gas values of Lactate, HCO3, and pH have shown acceptable association and significant correlation, and they can be considered clinically interchangeable with ABGs values.

The prescribed treatment for these conditions often includes electrophysical therapies, whose effectiveness in improving symptoms and function is a source of debate. Therefore, this systematic review aims to provide an integrative overview of the efficacy of these modalities in sensorimotor rehabilitation compared to placebo, manual therapy, or between them.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. We perform a literature review in the following databases: Biomed Central, Ebscohost, Lilacs, Ovid, PEDro, Sage, Scopus, Science Direct, Semantic Scholar, Taylor & Francis, and Web of Science, for the period 1980-2020. We include studies that discussed the sensorimotor rehabilitation of people with non-degenerative ulnar, radial, or median nerve injury. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Risk of Bias Tool described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the risk of bias across studies with the GRADE approach described in the GRADE Handbook.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included in the systematic review and 34 in the meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as low or very low according to GRADE criteria. Low-level laser therapy and ultrasound showed favourable results in improving symptom severity and functional status compared to manual therapy. In addition, the low level laser showed improvements in pinch strength compared to placebo and pain (VAS) compared to manual therapy. Splints showed superior results to electrophysical modalities. The clinical significance of the results was assessed by effect size estimation and comparison with the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).
CONCLUSIONS: We found favourable results in pain relief, improvement of symptoms, functional status, and neurophysiological parameters for some electrophysical modalities, mainly when applied with a splint. Our results coincide with those obtained in some meta-analyses. However, none of these can be considered clinically significant.

Estudio multicéntrico de pruebas diagnósticas.,"Introduction: There are no sensitive or specific tests available to diagnose systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).
Objective: To assess the utility as diagnostic tests of total ferritin (TF) levels greater than 5 times the normal value (TF>5N) and the decreased percentage (less than or equal to 20% of TF) of glycosylated ferritin (GF≤20%) for the diagnosis of sJIA in patients with fever of unknown origin evaluated by pediatric rheumatology.
Materials and methods: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of diagnostic tests in children under 16 years of age hospitalized between 2010 and 2014. The reference diagnostic standard was the fulfillment of the classification criteria or confirmed diagnosis at follow-up. We determined the measures of utility of the tests.
Results: We included 40 patients with fever of unknown origin, 11 with sJIA, and 29 with other diagnoses. The median TF was higher in sAIJ (3992 ng/ml) versus other causes of fever of unknown origin (155 ng/ml) (p=0.0027), as well as TF>5N (90.91% versus 51.72%) (p=0.023). The percentage of GF≤20% was higher in patients with other causes of fever of unknown origin (96.5%) compared to sJIA (81.8%) (p=0.178). TF>5N had a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 48%, positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.76, and negative LR of 0.19 demonstrating greater utility for the diagnosis of sJIA than the combination of FT> 5N with GFR <20%, with a sensitivity of 81.8%, specificity of 48.3%, positive LR of 1.58, and negative LR of 0.38.
Conclusion: In patients with FUO evaluated by pediatric rheumatology, TF> 5N proved useful as a screening test for the diagnosis of sJIA.",Al Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe por el apoyo para el desarrollo de la investigación.,,Biomédica,,,"Arthritis, Juvenile; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Ferritins; Fever of Unknown Origin; Humans",2021-12-15,2021,2021-12-15,,41,4,787-804,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eraso, Ruth; Benitez, Claudia Patricia; Jaramillo, Sergio; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena; Quevedo, Augusto","Eraso, Ruth (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia); Benitez, Claudia Patricia (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia); Jaramillo, Sergio (Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Colombia); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (División Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, División Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Colombia); Quevedo, Augusto (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación, Medellin, Colombia)","Eraso, Ruth (University of Antioquia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe)","Eraso, Ruth (University of Antioquia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Benitez, Claudia Patricia (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia); Jaramillo, Sergio (Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Quevedo, Augusto (University of Antioquia; Hospital Universitario de San Vicente Fundación)",3,2,0.23,1.35,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5849/4897,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140860567,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The prevalence is on the rise worldwide, with a current frequency of 200 per 10 000 children. There is no established prevalence in Colombia, according to the Colombian Autism League. The incidence rate is on the rise, unclear if the increase is related to changes in the diagnostic criteria, the study methodology, an actual increase in the incidence of autism, or a combination of these factors. Objective: to characterize a group of patients with autism spectrum disorder and to recognize socio-environmental changes related to the population described. Methods: A descriptive observational study. Patients between 1 and 18 years of age, clinically diagnosed by neurology and child psychiatry, with autism spectrum disorder, between 2011 and 2017, in a reference center for pediatric neurological rehabilitation. Results: Data were obtained from 253 patients with autism spectrum disorders, with a mean age of symptom onset of 22.4 months (SD = 9.72) and an age at diagnosis of 43.2 months. The most frequent autism spectrum disorder was grade 1 or mild (39.5 %), the most common symptom being motor stereotypies (78.3 %), followed by interaction and social communication deficit (75.5 %).

Most endoscopy units restrict their activity based on pre-endoscopic diagnosis. (Objective) To determine the consequences of endoscopic restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on digestive cancer diagnosis. (Design) A comparison of upper digestive endoscopies and colonoscopies with gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed between three endoscopic centers, two of which restricted their procedures and one that did not but performed the procedures under a strict protocol. (Setting) A retrospective analysis was performed collecting data between 15 March 2019 and 15 August 2020. Two-factor ANOVA and a Tukey’s a posteriori test were used as statistical tests. (Main outcome measures) There was variation in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis between 2019 and 2020, considering the endoscopic procedures performed each year. (Result) There was a significant decrease in the total endoscopic procedures performed between 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001), the result of reduced testing at the two centers (p < 0.001) with pre-endoscopic restrictions, which was not compensated for by a slight increase in procedures at the center without restrictions (p = 0.139). Regarding the total cancers diagnosed, while a significant decrease was observed for the two centers with pre-endoscopic restrictions (p = 0.007), a significant increase was registered in the center that maintained its endoscopic productivity (p < 0.001). After 851 procedures (537 upper digestive endoscopies and 314 colonoscopies) there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in the endoscopic staff. (Conclusion) Endoscopic restrictions based on pre-endoscopic diagnosis should be reassessed in consideration of local pandemic situations, and a balance should be sought between COVID-19 infection risk and the detrimental delay of potential cancer diagnosis.",,This research received no external funding.,Gastroenterology Insights,,,,2021-08-25,2021,2021-08-25,,12,3,358-365,All OA;

The stress intensity factor is estimated by means of four different methods, the accuracy is assessed for each approach and the fracture toughness is estimated. The proposed methodology is also applied to estimate the fracture toughness for graphene and diamond using published data from other scientific articles. The obtained fracture toughness for the single-crystal aluminum is compared with other nanomaterials that have similar microstructures. Dislocation emission during the fracture simulation of the cracked nano-crystal of aluminum is analyzed to study the fracture behavior. Brittle fracture behavior is the predominant failure mode for the nanomaterials studied in this research.","W.V.-D. would like to acknowledge to the Universidad del Norte and the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Colciencias) for the support given within the framework of the Ph.D. National Scholarship Colciencias N 647-2015 (Contract Identification Number UN-OJ-2015-29312).",This work was supported by Colciencias at Ph.D. National Scholarship program 647 and Universidad del Norte (grant number UN-OJ-2015-29312).,Nanomaterials,,,,2021-03-09,2021,2021-03-09,,11,3,680,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer; Ricardo, Luis; Palencia, Argemiro; Zambrano, Habib R.","Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, luis.ricardo76@uac.edu.co, (L.R.);, Argemiro.palencia15@uac.edu.co, (A.P.)); Ricardo, Luis (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, luis.ricardo76@uac.edu.co, (L.R.);, Argemiro.palencia15@uac.edu.co, (A.P.)); Palencia, Argemiro (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Autónoma del Caribe, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, luis.ricardo76@uac.edu.co, (L.R.);, Argemiro.palencia15@uac.edu.co, (A.P.)); Zambrano, Habib R.

839,pub.1135451429,10.1109/access.2021.3059936,,,Design Optimization for Low-Complexity FPGA Implementation of Symbol-Level Multiuser Precoding,"This paper proposes and validates a low-complexity FPGA design for symbol-level precoding (SLP) in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication systems. In the optimal case, the symbol-level precoded transmit signal is obtained as the solution to an optimization problem tailored for a given set of users’ data symbols. This symbol-by-symbol design, however, imposes excessive computational complexity on the system. To alleviate this issue, we aim to reduce the per-symbol complexity of the SLP scheme by developing an approximate yet computationally-efficient closed-form solution. The proposed solution allows us to achieve a high symbol throughput in real-time implementations. To develop the FPGA design, we express the proposed solution in an algorithmic way and translate it to hardware description language (HDL). We then optimize the processing to accelerate the performance and generate the corresponding intellectual property (IP) core. We provide the synthesis report for the generated IP core, including performance and resource utilization estimates and interface descriptions. To validate our design, we simulate an uncoded transmission over a downlink multiuser channel using the LabVIEW software, where the SLP IP core is implemented as a clock-driven logic (CDL) unit. Our simulation results show that a throughput of 100 Mega symbols per second per user can be achieved via the proposed SLP design. We further use the MATLAB software to produce numerical results for the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) and the optimal SLP techniques as benchmarks for comparison. Thereby, it is shown that the proposed FPGA implementation of SLP offers an improvement of up to 50 percent in power efficiency compared to the ZF precoding. Remarkably, it enjoys the same per-symbol complexity order as that of the ZF technique. We also evaluate the loss of the real-time SLP design, introduced by the algebraic approximations and arithmetic inaccuracies, with respect to the optimal scheme.","This work was supported in part by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR), Enhanced Signal Space opTImization for satellite comMunication Systems (ESSTIMS), under CORE Junior Project C16/IS/11332341, in part by the AFR-PPP End-to-End Signal Processing Algorithms for Precoded Satellite Communications, under Grant FNR11481283, in part by the Exploiting Interference for Physical-Layer Security in 5G networks (CI-PHY), under Grant FNR11607830, and in part by the Cognitive Cohesive Networks of Distributed Units for Active and Passive Space Applications (COHESAT) under Grant CORE Junior FNR11689919.

The discovery and selection of web services currently face optimization problems. Many services might satisfy a requirement with similar quality criteria. Because of this, software developers have to choose the most appropriate services for a given composition, complicated by the rapid increase in providers and services available in the cloud. Service composition also implies coupling according to a composition flow and non-functional requirement criteria. Such requirements make selection and composition a complex task not previously solved in the literature. This paper presents Ar_WSDS, a computational approach for web services discovery and selection in cloud environments, which bases its implementation on the brain’s pattern recognition systematic functioning. This process allows classifying web services through recognition modules created dynamically based on their quality parameters, resulting in a set of web services suitable for a web service composition. This approach allows a solution to the selection problem using less complex tasks. This paper introduces an architectural and procedural definition that provides the web service description with a pattern to recognize and select services using different recognition levels. We simulated our approach and evaluated it using a dataset from the QWS project that offers a set of quality criteria collected from different providers. The web services are recognized and classified using different quality criteria for the composition and each of their services. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovery and selection process compared to other approaches. Furthermore, Ar_WSDS allows us to recognize and filter out web services with ambiguity and similarity in their provider information, a process that minimizes the discovery space for services.",The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander and Universidad del Norte for their academic support.,The first author received a Doctoral scholarship from the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander of Colombia.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,,11,17,8092,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adarme, Marco; Jimeno, Miguel","Adarme, Marco (Department of Systems and Informatics, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta 540003, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, majimeno@uninorte.edu.co)","Adarme, Marco (Francisco de Paula Santander University)","Adarme, Marco (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte)",3,2,,1.3,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/17/8092/pdf?version=1631065283,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140791644,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4612 Software Engineering,

A suitable absorbent for a particular type of pollutant does not necessarily absorb other types of compounds, so knowing the compatibility between a particular pollutant and a potential absorbent before experimentation seems to be fundamental. In this work, the molecular interactions between some pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin, ibuprofen, and tetracycline derivatives) with two potential absorbers, chitosan and graphene oxide models (pyrene, GO-1, and coronene, GO-2), were studied using the ωB97X-D/6-311G(2d,p) level of theory. The energetic interaction order found was amoxicillin/chitosan > amoxicillin/GO-1 > amoxicillin/GO-2 > ibuprofen/chitosan > ibuprofen/GO-2 > ibuprofen/GO-1, the negative sign for the interaction energy in all complex formations confirms good compatibility, while the size of Eint between 24-34 kcal/mol indicates physisorption processes. Moreover, the free energies of complex formation were negative, confirming the spontaneity of the processes. The larger interaction of amoxicillin Gos, compared to ibuprofen Gos, is consistent with previously reported experimental results, demonstrating the exceptional predictability of these methods. The second-order perturbation theory analysis shows that the amoxicillin complexes are mainly driven by hydrogen bonds, while van der Waals interactions with chitosan and hydrophobic interactions with graphene oxides are modelled for the ibuprofen complexes. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) shows that electrostatic energy is a major contributor to the stabilization energy in all cases. The results obtained in this work promote the use of graphene oxides and chitosan as potential adsorbents for the removal of these emerging pollutants from water.",The authors wish to thank Alessandra Misad for proofreading the manuscript.,This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,"Riccardo Concu, Michael González-Durruthy",,2021-05-17,2021,2021-05-17,,13,10,1620,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anchique, Leonardo; Alcázar, Jackson J.; Ramos-Hernandez, Andrea; Méndez-López, Maximiliano; Mora, José R.; Rangel, Norma; Paz, José Luis; Márquez, Edgar","Anchique, Leonardo (Programa de Química, Grupo Química Supramolecular Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Semillero Electroquímica Aplicada, Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia;, lanchique@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (L.A.);, andrearamos@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (A.R.-H.)); Alcázar, Jackson J.

Our study is to identify a robust prognostic marker for bladder cancer.
METHODS: The transcriptome and clinical data of bladder cancer were downloaded from multiple databases. We searched for genes with robust prognosis by Kaplan-Meier analysis of the whole genome. CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithm was used to calculate the degree of immune cell infiltration.
RESULTS: We identified OLFML2B as a robust prognostic marker for bladder cancer in five cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a high level of OLFML2B expression had a poor prognosis. The expression of OLFML2B increased with the increase of stage and grade. We found that patients with high expression of OLFML2B still had a poor prognosis in two small bladder cancer cohorts. OLFML2B also has the prognostic ability in ten other tumors, and the prognosis is poor in high expression. The correlation analysis between OLFML2B and immune cells showed that it was positively correlated with the degree of macrophage infiltration and highly co-expressed with tumor-associated macrophage markers. Finally, the Wound-healing assay and Colony formation assay results showed that the migration and proliferation ability of bladder cancer cell lines decreased after the knockdown of OLFML2B.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, OLFML2B is a robust risk prognostic marker, and it can help patients with bladder cancer improve individualized treatment.","We appreciate the free use of TCGA, GEO, ArrayExpress databases.",,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,,11,,650678,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lin, Jiaxing; Xu, Xiao; Li, Tianren; Yao, Jihang; Yu, Meng; Zhu, Yuyan; Sun, Dan","Lin, Jiaxing (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Xu, Xiao (Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, The Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Li, Tianren (Department of Gynaecology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Yao, Jihang (Department of Gynaecology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Yu, Meng (Department of Reproductive Biology and Transgenic Animal, China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Zhu, Yuyan (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Sun, Dan (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China)","Sun, Dan (First Hospital of China Medical University)","Lin, Jiaxing (First Hospital of China Medical University); Xu, Xiao (Sheng Jing Hospital); Li, Tianren (First Hospital of China Medical University); Yao, Jihang (First Hospital of China Medical University); Yu, Meng (China Medical University); Zhu, Yuyan (First Hospital of China Medical University); Sun, Dan (First Hospital of China Medical University)",5,4,0.41,1.28,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.650678/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142580058,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

In this retrospective study, for the first time, PSCC resection specimens (N = 103) were annotated into the following compartments: intratumoral tumor (IT Tumor), intratumoral stroma (IT Stroma), peritumoral tumor (PT Tumor) and peritumoral stroma (PT Stroma) compartments. We then quantified CD14+, CD68+ and CD163+ myeloid cells within these compartments using an image analysis software and assessed their association with various clinical parameters, including high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) status. In the total cohort, hrHPV status, grade of differentiation, age and tumor size were associated with myeloid cell densities. hrHPV+ tumors had higher infiltration rates of CD14+, CD68+ and CD163+ myeloid cells in the IT tumor compartment (p < 0.001, for all) compared to hrHPV- tumors. Furthermore, when examining the association between compartment-specific infiltration and differentiation grade, increased myeloid cell densities in the IT tumor compartment were associated with a more advanced histological grade (p < 0.001, for all). This association remained significant when the hrHPV- cohort (N = 60) was analyzed (CD14+ p = 0.001; CD68+ p < 0.001; CD163+ p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis in the hrHPV+ group (N = 43) showed that high infiltration rates of CD68+ and CD163+ cells in the PT tumor compartment were associated with lymph node (LN) metastasis (p = 0.031 and p = 0.026, respectively). Regarding the association between myeloid cell densities and disease-specific survival, the risk of death was found to decrease slightly as the number of myeloid cells in the IT tumor compartment increased (CD14+ p = 0.04; CD68+ p = 0.05; CD163+ p = 0.02). However, after adjusting for hrHPV, no independent association between myeloid densities and disease-specific survival were found. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of assessing myeloid cell densities within the spatial context of the tumor. Further studies are needed to unravel the specific phenotype of myeloid cells residing in the different compartments, their effect on clinical parameters and the impact of hrHPV on the recruitment of myeloid cell populations in PSCC.",,,Frontiers in Immunology,,,"Biomarkers; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Disease Susceptibility; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myeloid Cells; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Papillomavirus Infections; Penile Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment",2021-06-14,2021,2021-06-14,,12,,682030,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rafael, Tynisha S.; de Vries, Hielke M.; Ottenhof, Sarah R.; Hofland, Ingrid; Broeks, Annegien; de Jong, Jeroen; Bekers, Elise; Horenblas, Simon; de Menezes, Renée X.; Jordanova, Ekaterina S.; Brouwer, Oscar R.","Rafael, Tynisha S.

Method: for the above, a qualitative methodology was used with a case study method divided into two phases: the first, a documentary analysis through the VOSviewer program with topics subdivided into concepts of associative models and strategies. In the second phase, a semi-structured interview was conducted, in which knowledge, attitude and actions that producers are willing to implement for the associative process were highlighted as study dimensions. Results: the findings are presented in three topics: knowledge, attitude, and actions of the producers regarding the concept of associativity. This information was very relevant because it highlighted the weaknesses that producers present in collaborative work and the positive aspects to consider in a new form of grouping and working for common objectives. Conclusion: the need for producers to know specifically the issues related to associativity is highlighted, to improve production systems and reduce the number of intermediaries in the process.

Una propuesta discursiva para la postmodernidad,"Es sabido comúnmente que en 1948 Lasswell expone el paradigma que llevará su nombre y que evolucionó a lo que algunos denominan como las 7W del periodismo. Multifacético, el autor propone una serie de cuestiones que fijarán la disciplina y que disponen de vigencia en el seno de un constante mediamorfósis. La fórmula supera al canal o la tecnología por la que se difunde el mensaje. Dicha valía es extensible a los relatos 2.0 así como a la interrelación que caracteriza a las TIC y a la Comunicación. Es por ello, que los postulados en ella recogidos disponen de la virtud para dar respuesta estructurada a cuanto objeto de investigación sea escrutado. El hecho es especialmente destacado en el ámbito de las Ciencias de la Información y de la Comunicación de las que forman parte. El periodismo inmersivo (Domínguez-Martín, 2015) es aquel que hace suyo la realidad virtual (en adelante RV) para contar historias relevantes para la sociedad desde el espacio del cuarto poder. Ofrece una serie de peculiaridades narrativas que calan y median la noticia, difundiéndola con unas connotaciones únicas y significativas. No obstante, está por dilucidar si este ciber-relato tiene el potencial para llegar a consolidarse como un mass media, requisito imprescindible para que se dé una difusión generalizada de la información. De no manifestarse en un futuro esta hipótesis, habría que dirimir cuál podría ser su lugar en un entorno saturado de medios de comunicación y cómo encajaría en el corazón de una estructura de la información cada vez más enrevesada (Reig, 2015).

182,pub.1142224345,10.3389/feart.2021.722056,,,The Evolution of Peteroa Volcano (Chile–Argentina) Crater Lakes Between 1984 and 2020 Based on Landsat and Planet Labs Imagery Analysis,"One of the major challenges in the understanding of the crater lakes dynamics and their connection with magmatic/hydrothermal processes is the continuous tracking of the physical behavior of lakes, especially in cases of remote and poorly accessible volcanoes. Peteroa volcano (Chile–Argentina border) is part of the Planchón–Peteroa–Azufre Volcanic Complex, one of the three volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes with crater lakes. Peteroa volcano is formed by a ∼5 km diameter caldera-type crater, which hosts four crater lakes and several fumarolic fields. Peteroa volcano has a large history of eruptive activity including phreatic-and-phreatomagmatic explosions and several episodes of strong degassing from its crater lakes. Here, we used TIR and SWIR bands from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images available from October 1984 to December 2020 to obtain thermal parameters such as thermal radiance, brightness temperature, and heat fluxes, and Planet Labs Inc. images (RapidEye and PlanetScope) available between May 2009 and December 2020 to obtain physical parameters such as area, color, and state (liquid or frozen) of the crater lakes. We reviewed the historical eruptive activity and compared it with thermal and physical data obtained from satellite images. We determined the occurrence of two eruptive/thermal cycles: 1) Cycle 1 includes the formation of a new fumarolic field and two active craters during a short eruptive period, which includes thermal activity in three of the four crater lakes, and a strong degassing process between October 1998 and February 2001, coincident with a peak of volcanic heat flux (Qvolc) in two craters. The cycle finished with an eruptive episode (September 2010–July 2011). 2) Cycle 2 is represented by the thermal reactivation of two crater lakes, formation and detection of thermal activity in a new nested crater, and occurrence of a new eruptive episode (October 2018–April 2019). We observed a migration of the thermal and eruptive activity between the crater lakes and the interconnection of the pathways that feed the lakes, in both cases, partially related to the presence of two deep magma bodies. The Qvolc in Peteroa volcano crater lakes is primarily controlled by volcanic activity, and seasonal effects affect it at short-term, whilst at long-term, seasonal effects do not show clear influences in the volcanic heat fluxes. The maximum Qvolc measured between all crater lakes during quiescent periods was 59 MW, whereas during unrest episodes Qvolc in single crater lakes varied from 7.1 to 38 MW, with Peteroa volcano being classified as a low volcanic heat flux system. The detection of new thermal activity and increase of Qvolc in Peteroa volcano previous to explosive unrest can be considered as a good example of how thermal information from satellite images can be used to detect possible precursors to eruptive activity in volcanoes which host crater lakes.","Our acknowledgements to Planet Labs Education and Research Standard Program for providing us the PlanetScope and RapidEye imagery.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and reliability of an instrument to measure medical students' lifestyles.
METHODS: A lifestyle questionnaire was developed using the Delphi technique by a group of experts. The final questionnaire was applied to 332 students of the School of Medicine of the Ricardo Palma University in 2017. A preliminary examination was carried out to assess preconditions for construct validityincluding the correlation matrix, the Kaiser Meyer Olkin statistic, and the Bartlett sphericity test. Factor analysis was used for construct validity, and the possible resulting factors were extracted through the principal component analysis. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated to assess the instrument reliability.
RESULTS: In this study, 41.6% of participants were men with a mean age of 20 years (standard deviation = 3). The preconditions for the factor analysis were a Kaiser Meyer Olkin coefficient = 0.773 and a significant Bartlett sphericity test. For the 47 items of the final questionnaire, the factor analysis showed an explained variance of 56.7% with eigenvalues greater than one. Cronbach's alpha was 0.78. The final questionnaire could assume values between -23 to 151 points. Based on a cut point of 71 points, the prevalence of students with an unhealthy lifestyle was 73.6%.
CONCLUSION: The developed instrument has acceptable validity and reliability to measure lifestyle in medical students.

360,pub.1144142957,10.1155/2021/5859249,,,Prediction of Mine Dust Concentration Based on Grey Markov Model,"Accurate quantitative analysis and prediction of dust concentration in mines play a vital role in avoiding pneumoconiosis to a certain extent, improving industrial production efficiency, and protecting the ecological environment. The research has far‐reaching significance for the prediction of dust concentration in mines in the future. Aiming at the shortcomings of the grey GM (1, 1) model in forecasting the data sequence with large random fluctuation, a grey Markov chain forecasting model is established. Firstly, considering the timeliness of monitoring data, the new dust concentration data is supplemented by using the method of cubic spline interpolation in the original data sequence. Therefore, the GM (1, 1) model is established by the method of metabolism. Then, the GM (1, 1) model is optimized by the theory of the Markov chain model. According to the relative error range generated during the prediction, the state interval is divided. Subsequently, the corresponding state probability transition matrix is constructed to obtain the grey Markov prediction model. The model was applied to the prediction of mine dust concentration and compared with the prediction results of the BP neural network model, grey prediction model, and ARIMA (1, 2, 1) model. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of the grey Markov model was significantly improved compared with other traditional prediction models. Therefore, the rationality and accuracy of this model in the prediction of mine dust concentration were verified.",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Nine MFCs were manufactured with zinc and copper electrodes; and as substrates, pineapple, potato and tomato pulp wastes were used in the anode chamber, and residual sludge in the cathode chamber. It was observed that the MFCs with pineapple substrate generated higher values of the electrical parameters, resulting in voltage and current values of 0.3484 ± 0.003 V and 27.88 ± 0.23 mA, respectively. It was also observed that the maximum power density was 0.967 ± 0.059 W/cm2 at a current density of 0.04777 A/cm2 for the same substrate. Acid pH values were observed in the three samples, while the conductivity reached its maximum value on day 23 (69.47 ± 0.91 mS/cm) which declined until the last day of monitoring; the turbidity values increased abruptly after day 22 until the last day where a value of 200.3 ± 2.52 UNT was observed for the pineapple substrate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2006 to January 2021, 234 patients who underwent bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) surgery were included in the analysis. A Lasso regression model was utilized to select the most useful predictive features from among 46 laboratory variables. Then, a logistic regression analysis was used to develop the prediction model. Calibration curves, concordance index (C-index) and Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were performed to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. We also investigated model fit using changes in Akaike Information Criteria (AICs). Decision curve analyses (DCAs) were applied to assess the clinical usefulness of this nomograms. Its internal validation was confirmed.
RESULTS: Among the 234 patients, 53 were confirmed to have ENE. The platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were significantly associated with ENE (P<0.05). The individualized prediction nomogram, including the PLR, SCC-Ag, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and pathologic tumor stage(pT-stage), showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.817 (95% CI, 0.745 to 0.890) and good calibration. Clinical-laboratory nomogram (AIC, 180.034) become the best-fitting model. DCA findings revealed that the clinical-laboratory nomogram was more clinically useful than the pT-stage or tumor grade.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a clinicopathologic and laboratory-based nomogram that incorporates PLR, SCC-Ag, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and pT-stage, which can be conveniently utilized to facilitate the individualized prediction of lymph node metastasis ENE in patients with penile cancer.",The authors wish to thank all the patients and their families.

Assays of the expression profiles of multiple genes increase the probability of overexpression of certain genes and thus can potentially characterize the risk of metastasis.
METHODS: We propose a 20-gene classifier for predicting patients with high/low risk of recurrence within 5 years. Gene expression levels from a quantitative PCR assay were used to screen 473 luminal breast cancer patients treated at Taiwan Hospital (positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Gene expression scores, along with clinical information (age, tumor stage, and nodal stage), were evaluated for risk prediction. The classifier could correctly predict patients with and without relapse (logistic regression, P<0.05).
RESULTS: A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the 20-gene panel was prognostic with hazard ratios of 5.63 (95% confidence interval 2.77-11.5, univariate) and 5.56 (2.62-11.8, multivariate) for the ""genetic"" model, and of 8.02 (3.52-18.3, univariate) and 19.8 (5.96-65.87, multivariate) for the ""clinicogenetic"" model during a 5-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 20-gene classifier can successfully separate the patients into two risk groups, and the two risk group had significantly different relapse rate and prognosis. This 20-gene classifier can provide better estimation of prognosis, which can help physicians to make better personalized treatment plans.",,The research grants were from the Amwise Diagnostics Pte.

194,pub.1143742044,10.1111/ddi.13458,,,Glacier influence on bird assemblages in habitat islands of the high Bolivian Andes,"Abstract  Aim Climate projections for the upcoming decades predict a significant loss of ice mass particularly critical for glaciers in tropical mountains. In the dry landscapes of the southern Andes (from Southern Peru to Chile), this global trend has strong ecological impacts on high‐altitude wetlands that support a unique avifauna for feeding, roosting and nesting. As glacier runoffs are expected to affect the area and the quality of wetland habitats, these changes may potentially affect bird communities. To address this issue, we studied the structural and functional diversity of bird assemblages in glacier‐fed high‐altitude wetlands (>4500 m).   Location Five valleys of the Cordillera Real, Bolivia.   Methods We surveyed bird communities during dry, wet and intermediate seasons in 40 wetlands (total of 27,720 observations of birds and habitats from 540 transects) showing different degrees of dependence on glacial meltwater. We examined the potential effect of glacier retreat on bird communities through changes in wetland area and environmental quality and heterogeneity.   Results We found strong relationship between wetland area and taxonomic and functional diversity, but not on phylogenetic diversity. Generalized additive models revealed that avian diversity was influenced by wetland's productivity and elevation and maximized at intermediate levels of glacier influence. Multivariate analysis further showed that habitat productivity and humidity, both potentially influenced by future glacial retreat trends, are the main drivers of bird community composition, with the wettest habitats being crucial for aquatic birds and uncommon species.

There is limited information on latitudinal traits of coastal cephalopods as part of the interacting species in pelagic and benthic environments. The present study used the loliginid squid Doryteuthis gahi as a model organism to: (1) evaluate latitudinal traits on egg laying patterns, (2) characterize a particular spawning ground, (3) quantify the isotopic variation from different tissues, (4) evaluate potential trophic ontogenetic changes, (5) determinate trophic position, and (6) isotopically estimate the relative importance of putative preys in the squid’s assimilated diet. Results evidenced that egg-masses collected between 2014 and 2020 presented similar patterns along northern-central Chile (27–36°S), with females attaching small egg-capsules (10–50 mm length) through the year and over a variety of anthropogenic and natural substrates. At a small scale (Coquimbo; 29°S), early life history traits showed distinct patterns depending on SST, with warmer collection periods (∼18°C) evidencing larger capsules and smaller embryos, although small paralarvae were obtained over the 4-year sampling period. In this site, sampling of older ontogenetic stages supported the constant presence of small-sized squids (19–77 mm ML). Males had larger mean sizes compared to females and undetermined specimens, with a high proportion of mature stages. Observations in captivity were extended for up to 110 d, validating that small females (45–64 mm ML) spawn the small egg-capsules typically observed in the field. Differences in stable isotope composition between beaks and soft tissues of adult squids were lower for δ13C values (1.1 vs. 1.4‰, respectively) and higher for δ15N values (5.3 vs. 4.7‰, respectively). Isotopic composition through ontogeny found similar δ13C and δ15N values, suggesting that carbon sources (pelagic origin) and trophic position did not change significantly, with copepods, euphausiids and nereid polychaetes being the most important preys. This study unveils the permanent occurrence of a small reproductive morphotype of D. gahi in shallow coastal habitats of northern-central Chile (i.e., center of the distribution range), providing the first insights for understanding the species’ potential adaptations to heterogeneous conditions in the HCS and the unexplored distribution gap between the two centers of abundance (Peru and the Falkland/Malvinas islands).","We would like to thank people who provided important assistance during the study, especially to colleague divers for their photographic records or samples from in situ observations, including: Carlos Oroza (Estudios del mar y su gente), Ignacio Borgeaud (BajoMar EcoDive), Alejandro Pérez-Matus (PUC), Alejandro Soza (ODC Dive Center), Iván Hinojosa (UCSC), and César Cárdenas (INACH).

Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects. For this, feces and blood were collected. The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners.","This research was funded by Universidad de Antioquia (CODI 2015-7857; sostenibilidad), Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia (INV2732) and Corporación Universitaria Remington.

Recent tiger augmentation efforts in Satkosia Tiger Reserve, India received mixed responses from the local communities, causing a stalemate in its progress. As a part of the adaptive management strategy, it was required to assess the concerns and issues to provide a practical solution. Hence, we analyzed the attitude of the people toward conservation in general and tiger specifically. We used structured questionnaire surveys and interviewed 1,932 households from 43 villages located in and around the reserve. We tested the influence of several variables representing four categories- (1) socio-economic, (2) ecosystem values and dependence, (3) relationship with the forest department and (4) losses and fear, on the attitude toward tiger conservation. The villages were clustered based on the responses received under these categories. While conserving forest was important to 91% of respondents, 71% of respondents supported wildlife conservation and only 35% felt important to conserve tiger. The logistic binary regression predicted that at the household level attitude toward tiger conservation is influenced positively by economic well-being, sense of forest ecosystem services, resource dependence and negatively influenced by restrictions from the forest department, and previous experience of loss due to wildlife. At the village level, literacy, resource dependence, access to clean cooking fuel and cooperation from the forest department predicted a positive attitude toward tiger conservation. Restriction from the forest department, fear for livestock, and experience of losses due to wildlife had a negative influence on attitude. We recommend that the villages in the landscape are prioritized based on their needs and accordingly, specific interventions are made to address their concerns. Future augmentation programme must give importance to intangible factors such as fear and perceived restrictions and opt for the involvement of the local community in the decision-making process.","We thank the Odisha State Forest Department and National Tiger Conservation Authority for providing the financial assistance for this study.

In this context, it is important to develop new protocols to characterise the mineralogical variability of archaeological copper ores. A comprehensive and representative methodology in the analysis of minerals, the application of non-destructive analytical techniques, and the combination of insights from geological, archaeological and local knowledge are key to developing a copper mineral repository of the Atacama Desert area. Geochemical analyses were applied to the study of 568 samples from the archaeological site Pukara de Turi, with different techniques such as micro-XRF, XRD, QEMSCAN, Raman spectroscopy and technological studies. This exhaustive analysis allowed for the recognition of two mineralogical associations: atacamite/brochantite (99%) and azurite/chrysocolla (1%). The study of various minerals allows data to be interpreted more reliably and to trace the likely geological sources of these minerals. The azurite/chrysocolla samples appear to belong to the same mineral association found in the Cerro Verde district, which is probably the source of these samples. The atacamite/brochantite samples appear to come from more than one geological source, including, but not limited to, Chuquicamata-Radomiro Tomic and El Abra-Conchi.","The analyses presented were conducted at Unidad de Equipamiento Científico-MAINI at Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.

This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the survival of teeth treated with a non-restorative cavity control (NRCC) compared to resin composite restorations (RCR) on proximal carious lesion in anterior primary teeth, as well as the impact of these treatments on patient-centered outcomes.MethodsA randomized clinical trial with two parallels arms (1:1) will be conducted. Children between 3 and 6 years old will be selected from the Center of Clinic Research of Pediatric Dentistry of Ibirapuera University (UNIB), a dental trailer (FOUSP) located on Educational Complex Professor Carlos Osmarinho de Lima, the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of Santa Cecília University and from the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of University Center UNINOVAFAPI. One hundred and forty-eight teeth will be randomly distributed in two experimental groups: (1) Selective removal of carious tissue and RCR; or (2) NRCC through cavity enlargement using a metallic sandpaper. The primary outcome will be tooth survival after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The duration and the cost of dental treatments will be considered for the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the evaluated treatments. The discomfort reported by the participants will be measured after each treatment using the FIS scale. The participants’ satisfaction and perception of the parents/legal guardians will be evaluated through questionnaires. For the primary outcome, Kaplan–Meier’s survival and Long-Rank test will be used for comparison between the two groups. All the variables will be modeled by Cox regression with shared fragility. Significance will be considered at 5%.DiscussionThe NRCC could be an option to manage carious lesions on proximal surfaces of primary teeth, and the approach could be well accepted by the children and parents/legal guardians.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT03785730, Registered on December 18th 2018, first participant recruited 30/04/2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03785730.Ethics Reference No: 91569118.8.0000.5597.Trial Sponsor: Universidade Ibirapuera.The Trial was prospectively registered.","The authors would like to thank the CEPECO Collaborative Group, Pediatric dental clinic of Uninorte and UNINOVAFAPI, and pediatric dentists of dental care trailer of FOUSP for all support to perform of the study.",FundingNone.

The best description of the CHIKV transmission during pregnancy can be found in a well-documented epidemic in 2005, in the ""La Reunion"" island, a French territory located in the Indian Ocean, in which about one-third of the population was infected. Reports of arbovirus infections in pregnancy are increasing over time, but the spectrum of clinical findings remains an incognita among researchers, including CHIKV.
PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, it was possible to verify 2 cases exposed to CHIKV during foetal period and the possible implications of the infection on gestational structures and exposed children after the birth.
DIAGNOSIS: In both cases, the mothers were positive by laboratory tests in serologic analysis for CHIKV, as ezyme-linked immunossorbent assay (ELISA), plaque reduction neutralisation testing (PRNT) and immunofluorescence (IF); but there were no positive tests in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for mothers or children.
INTERVENTIONS: The exposed children were followed up in a paediatrics clinic in order not only to provide the medical assistance, but also to verify child development and the possible implications and neurocognitive changes caused by gestational infection.
OUTCOMES: There were neurological and developmental changes in one of the children followed up on an outpatient basis. There was an improvement in the neurological situation and symptoms only 3 years and 1 month after birth.
LESSONS: Based on the cases presented, we can conclude that clinical symptoms of CHIKV maternal infection may occur late in new-borns and can affect their development.",,,Medicine,,,"Antibodies, Viral; Chikungunya Fever; Chikungunya virus; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Continuity of Patient Care; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Psychomotor Disorders; Serologic Tests; Time",2021-04-30,2021,2021-04-30,2021-04-30,100,17,e25695,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fajardo, Thamirys Cosmo Grillo; Gazeta, Rosa Estela; Catalan, Daniel Thome; Mello, Alexandra Siqueira; da Silva, Andrea Cristina Botelho; Bertozzi, Ana Paula Antunes Pascalicchio; Dos Santos, Geovane Ribeiro; Pinto, Clóvis Antonio Lopes; Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira; Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Passos, Saulo Duarte","Fajardo, Thamirys Cosmo Grillo (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Gazeta, Rosa Estela (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Catalan, Daniel Thome (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Mello, Alexandra Siqueira (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); da Silva, Andrea Cristina Botelho (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Bertozzi, Ana Paula Antunes Pascalicchio (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Dos Santos, Geovane Ribeiro (Department of Morphology and Pathology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Pinto, Clóvis Antonio Lopes (Pathology Department, AC Camargo Cancer Center); Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Durigon, Edison Luiz (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Passos, Saulo Duarte (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine; Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine)","Passos, Saulo Duarte (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine; Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine)","Fajardo, Thamirys Cosmo Grillo (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Gazeta, Rosa Estela (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Catalan, Daniel Thome (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Mello, Alexandra Siqueira (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); da Silva, Andrea Cristina Botelho (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Bertozzi, Ana Paula Antunes Pascalicchio (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Dos Santos, Geovane Ribeiro (Department of Morphology and Pathology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Pinto, Clóvis Antonio Lopes (Pathology Department, AC Camargo Cancer Center); Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira (Universidade de São Paulo); Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna (Universidade de São Paulo); Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal (Universidade de São Paulo); Durigon, Edison Luiz (Universidade de São Paulo); Passos, Saulo Duarte (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine; Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine)",2,1,0.23,1.17,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025695,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137544495,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: Data of 207 patients referred to endodontic treatment at undergraduate Dental Schools of Brazil were collected over a period of 8 months. Patient-related data included age, gender, first dental visit, tooth brushing frequency, number of remaining teeth, and previous endodontic treatment, and tooth-related information regarding number, type, and location in the mouth of teeth that need RCT, waiting time for the endodontic treatment, endodontic diagnosis, pain report, and dental crown condition was collected for each participant. Bivariate analysis (Chi-square test; p < 0.05) associated gender and tooth/patient-related conditions. Poisson regression analysis compared multiple endodontic need and exposure variables.
RESULTS: Patients were mainly comprised of women (65.2%), aged 18-39 years (69.6%). Previous RCT was significantly more prevalent in women when compared to men (p=0.005). First dental visit at later moment (after 20 years of age) demonstrated 400% greater prevalence of multiple RCT demand when compared to patients that attended the dental office at age below seven years (p=0.032). Most of the patients presented only one tooth needing RCT (80.2%), mainly premolars (44.9%). Interestingly, women underwent more RCT in maxillary teeth (p=0.016) and significantly contributed with their report to the diagnosis process when compared to men (p=0.014). Regarding dental crown condition, 45.4% of all teeth registered unsatisfactory restorations, which were more pronounced in female patients (p=0.018). Unsatisfactory restorations or dental caries had 75% and 82%, respectively, less prevalence of multiple RCT indication when compared to sound dental crown (p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: RCT was undertaken more frequently in young female adults' premolars presenting unsatisfactory restorations. First dental visit, number of teeth with previous endodontic treatment, tooth group, and dental crown condition were significantly associated with the necessity of multiple endodontic treatments.",,,International Journal of Dentistry,,Javier Martin,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2021-12-30,2021,,7973356,All OA; Gold,Article,"Albuquerque, Maria Tereza Pedrosa; Abreu, Lorena Caetano; Martim, Leticia; Münchow, Eliseu Aldrighi; Nagata, Juliana Yuri","Albuquerque, Maria Tereza Pedrosa (Department of Clinical Dentistry Endodontics, Federal University of Bahia, Av.

1830,pub.1137243598,10.3390/app11083552,,,Multivariate Statistical Analysis for Training Process Optimization in Neural Networks-Based Forecasting Models,"Data forecasting is very important for electrical analysis development, transport dimensionality, marketing strategies, etc. Hence, low error levels are required. However, in some cases data have dissimilar behaviors that can vary depending on such exogenous variables as the type of day, weather conditions, and geographical area, among others. Commonly, computational intelligence techniques (e.g., artificial neural networks) are used due to their generalization capabilities. In spite of the above, they do not have a unique way to reach optimal performance. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the data’s behavior and their statistical features in order to identify those significant factors in the training process to guarantee a better performance. In this paper is proposed an experimental method for identifying those significant factors in the forecasting model for time series data and measure their effects on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Additionally, we seek to establish optimal parameters for the proper selection of the artificial neural network model.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla–Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS.

Middleware systems, such as Robot Operating System (ROS), are being developed and widely used to tackle this difficulty. Streaming data Sharing Manager (SSM) is one of such middleware systems that allow developers to write and read sensor data with timestamps using a Personal Computer (PC). The timestamp feature is essential for the robot control system because it usually uses multiple sensors with their own measurement cycles, meaning that measured sensor values with different timestamps become useless for the robot control. Using SSM allows developers to use measured sensor values with the same timestamps; however, SSM assumes that only one PC is used. Thereby, if one process consumes CPU resources intensively, other processes cannot finish their assumed deadlines, leading to the unexpected behavior of a robot. This paper proposes an SSM middleware, named Distributed Streaming data Sharing Manager (DSSM), that enables distributing processes on SSM to different PCs. We have developed a prototype of DSSM and confirmed its behavior so far. In addition, we apply DSSM to an existing real SSM based robot control system that autonomously controls an unmanned vehicle robot. We then reveal its advantages and disadvantages via several experiments by measuring resource usages.",,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,Jin Xiao,,2021-02-14,2021,2021-02-14,,21,4,1344,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fukuda, Hiroaki; Gunji, Ryota; Hasegawa, Tadahiro; Leger, Paul; Figueroa, Ismael","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo 135-8548, Japan); Gunji, Ryota (Graduate School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo 135-8548, Japan;, ma19030@shibaura-it.ac.jp); Hasegawa, Tadahiro (Department of Electrical Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo 135-8548, Japan;, thase@shibaura-it.ac.jp); Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, pleger@ucn.cl); Figueroa, Ismael (Escuela de Auditoría, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2340000, Chile;, ismael.figueroa@uv.cl)","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology)","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Gunji, Ryota (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Hasegawa, Tadahiro (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Figueroa, Ismael (University of Valparaíso)",3,3,,1.16,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/4/1344/pdf?version=1613979907,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135549182,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

The relationship between satellite phenology and climate indices, namely MEI (Multivariate ENSO Index), PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and SAM (Southern Annular Mode) were established using statistical analyses for non-stationary patterns. The annual mode of phenological activity fluctuated in strength through time from the semiarid region to the border of southern Patagonia. Concomitantly, enhanced synchrony between EVI and climatic oscillations appeared over interannual cycles. Cross correlations revealed that variability in MEI was the lead predictor of EVI fluctuations over scales shorter than 4 months at lower latitudes and for the most poleward study site. The PDO was correlated with EVI over lags longer than 4 months at low latitude sites, while the SAM showed relationships with EVI only for sites located around 40°S. Our results indicate that the long-term phenological variability of the vegetation within protected areas along southwestern South America is controlled by processes linked to climate indices and that their influence varies latitudinally. Further studies over longer time scales will be needed to improve our understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation condition and its effect over phenological variability.",,"The LP DAAC operates as a partnership between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), for the production and distribution of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1).

One hundred and fifty-one patients diagnosed with schizophrenia completed the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS-24), sociodemographic information, and clinical and treatment characteristics of patients with schizophrenia. Multivariate analysis with multiple linear regression was then performed to identify variables that were potentially associated with the recovery assessment (variable criterion). A significant association was found between adherence to antipsychotic medication and the Willing to Ask for Help dimension of Recovery (β = 0.239, p = 0.005). Association of clinical and socio-demographic variables with recovery were identified: negative symptoms with Personal Confidence and Hope (β = -0.341, p = 0.001) and Goal and Success Orientation (β = -0.266, p = 0.014); cognitive symptoms with Willing to Ask for Help (β = -0.305, p = 0.018) and no domination by symptoms (β = -0.351, p = 0.005); marital status with reliance on others (β = -0.181, p = 0.045); age with Personal Confidence and Hope (β = -0.217, p = 0.021), Goal and Success Orientation (β = -0.296, p = 0.003), and no domination by symptoms (β = 0.214, p = 0.025).

We hypothesized that the neurocognitive dysfunction present in KS relies on an imbalance in X-chromosome gene expression. Thus, the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern and neurocognitive X-linked gene expression were tested and correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We evaluated 11 KS patients by (a) IQ assessment, (b) analyzing the XCI patterns using both HUMARA and ZDHHC15 gene assays, and (c) blood RT-qPCR to investigate seven X-linked genes related to neurocognitive development (GTPBP6, EIF2S3, ITM2A, HUWE1, KDM5C, GDI1, and VAMP7) and XIST in comparison with 14 (male and female) controls. Considering IQ 80 as the standard minimum reference, we verified that the variability in IQ scores in KS patients seemed to be associated with the XCI pattern. Seven individuals in the KS group presented a random X-inactivation (RXI) and lower average IQ than the four individuals who presented a skewed X-inactivation (SXI) pattern. The evaluation of gene expression showed higher GTPBP6 expression in KS patients with RXI than in controls (p = 0.0059). Interestingly, the expression of GTPBP6 in KS patients with SXI did not differ from that observed in controls. Therefore, our data suggest for the first time that GTPBP6 expression is negatively associated with full-scale IQ under the regulation of the type of XCI pattern. The SXI pattern may regulate GTPBP6 expression, thereby dampening the impairment in cognitive performance and playing a role in intelligence variability in individuals with KS, which warrants further mechanistic investigations.","We thank reported patient and their mothers for their cooperation in this study, Patricia Monteagudo, Andrea Mathez, Joao Ferro, and Julia Oliveira for the clinical follow-up of patients; Janete Cerutti and Rui Maciel for lab support.

Therefore, it is necessary to make the right decisions to carry out these activities, such as increasing the profit of businesses, improving the commercial strategies, and analyzing the industrial processes performance to produce better goods and services. This work proposes an intelligent system approach to prescribe actions and reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in an equalizer tank of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using machine learning models and genetic algorithms. There are three main objectives of this data-driven decision-making proposal. The first is to characterize and adapt a proper prediction model for the decision-making scheme. The second is to develop a prescriptive intelligent system based on expert’s rules and the selected prediction model’s outcomes. The last is to evaluate the system performance. As a novelty, this research proposes the use of long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks (ANN) with genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization in the WWTP area.","This work was supported by the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS, Investment Tax Benefits, Call No. 786.",Sustainability,,,,2021-04-13,2021,2021-04-13,,13,8,4311,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arismendy, Luis; Cárdenas, Carlos; Gómez, Diego; Maturana, Aymer; Mejía, Ricardo; M., Christian G.

Thus, effects of larval density (LD = 5, 10 and 15 ml−1) and food concentration (FC = 15,000; 30,000; 45,000 and 60 cells ml−1) were assessed on survival (S) and growth. Clearance (CR) and ingestion rates (IR) were also studied. Lowest S was observed at 15,000 cells ml−1 (19%–22%), while S > 50% prevailed at ≥30,000 cells ml−1. Both LD and FC significantly affected gross growth rate (GGR), with maximal values (7.3 µm d−1) observed at 5 larvae ml−1. Mean GGR of 6.1 to 6.9 µm d−1 was recorded at 10–15 larvae ml−1 and 45,000 to 60,000 cells ml−1. Maximal CR (13.8–23 ml larva−1 h−1) was recorded at 15 cells ml−1. Ingestion rates increased as FC increased, reaching asymptotic values (9.7–11.5 cells larva−1 min−1) at 45,000 and 60,000 cells ml−1. Allometric IR—Shell height exponents increased (b = 1.1 to 1.9) as FC increased. The combined results suggest that N. subnodosus larvae may be reared at stocking densities from 5 to 15 larva ml−1 and reach maximal GGR if fed 45,000 to 60,000 cells ml−1.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Partial funding for this study was provided by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) through the Grant No. 5404 awarded to ZGE by the 2017 Convocatoria de Proyectos de Desarrollo Científico para Atender Problemas Nacionales.

In vitro studies evaluating the antioxidant effect of herbal extracts on fish cell models have focused on ROS production and the respiratory burst mechanism. However, the effects on enzymatic antioxidant defense on salmon leukocytes have not been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the enzymatic antioxidant defense and ROS-induced cell damage in Salmon Head Kidney-1 (SHK-1) cell line exposed to polyphenol-enriched extract from Sambucus nigra flowers. Results Firstly, the Total Reactive Antioxidant Power (TRAP) assay of elderflower polyphenol (EP) was evaluated, showing 459 and 489 times more active than gallic acid and butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT), respectively. The toxic effect of EP on salmon cells was not significant at concentrations below 120 µg/mL and no hemolysis activity was observed between 20 and 400 µg/mL. The treatment of SHK-1 cell line with EP decreased both the lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation induced by H2O2, which could be associated with decreasing oxidative stress in the SHK-1 cells since the GSH/GSSG ratio increased when only EP was added. Conclusions These results suggest that plant extracts enriched with polyphenols could improve the enzymatic antioxidant defense of salmon leukocytes and protect the cells against ROS-induced cell damage.

239,pub.1140160443,10.1109/access.2021.3102263,,,Instance-Level Image Translation With a Local Discriminator,"Instance-level image translation aims to only translate instance of interest and can be operated more finely and flexibly than object-level and holistic-level image translation. However, current algorithms are not suitable to do it since they employ a holistic or object level’s discriminator that tends to change the whole image or all instances. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet effective local discriminator, in which the input image is split into two parts, region of interest (ROI) and background. Instance mask is employed to align the ROI and the background is design to be random in a prior distribution to mitigate a divergence between the ROI and the background. In this way, we obtain translated instance with decent margins without artifacts as current algorithms get. Moreover we propose a new architecture to simultaneously realize versatile instance-level image translation. Experimental results prove that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in position accuracy and background retainment by a clear margin.",The authors would like to thank Zhihui Wang for valuable suggestions.,"This work was supported in part by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Education under Grant 2019R1A6A1A09031717, in part by the NRF through the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) under Grant 2020R1A2C2013060, and in part by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (IPET) through the Smart Farm Innovation Technology Development Program by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) and MSIT and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) under Grant 421027-04.",IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-08-03,2021-01-01,9,,111802-111813,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xu, Mingle; Lee, Jaehwan; Fuentes, Alvaro; Park, Dong Sun; Yang, Jucheng; Yoon, Sook","Xu, Mingle (Department of Electronics Engineering, JeonBuk National University, Jeonbuk, 54896, South Korea); Lee, Jaehwan (Department of Electronics Engineering, JeonBuk National University, Jeonbuk, 54896, South Korea); Fuentes, Alvaro (Department of Electronics Engineering, JeonBuk National University, Jeonbuk, 54896, South Korea); Park, Dong Sun (Core Research Institute of Intelligent Robots, JeonBuk National University, Jeonbuk, 54896, South Korea); Yang, Jucheng (College of Artificial Intelligence, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300222, China); Yoon, Sook (Department of Computer Engineering, Mokpo National University, Jeonnam, 58554, South Korea)","Park, Dong Sun (Jeonbuk National University)","Xu, Mingle (Jeonbuk National University); Lee, Jaehwan (Jeonbuk National University); Fuentes, Alvaro (Jeonbuk National University); Park, Dong Sun (Jeonbuk National University); Yang, Jucheng (Tianjin University of Science and Technology); Yoon, Sook (Mokpo National University)",3,1,,1.11,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09505697.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140160443,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

During the development of the reading we identify the American, European, Asian and Colombian companies that have achieved success with the application of Blue Ocean models, which although most of them competed within the so-called red oceans, they now float and swim in the free blue currents. Consequently, a series of unexpected events will be experienced in the exemplification of real cases of companies that had not been heard about before. Thus, in the present article we will deal with the issue of marketing and innovation with value; fundamentally it will be beneficial for reading and learning strategies that are useful in order to differentiate low costs and quality.",,,Dictamen Libre,,,,2021-03-04,2021,2021-03-04,,,20,107-120,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ospina, Eliana Jazbleidy Salamanca; Uribe, Carlos Alberto; Vega, Lilia Mercedes Mendoza","Ospina, Eliana Jazbleidy Salamanca (Universidad del Quindío); Uribe, Carlos Alberto (Universidad del Quindío); Vega, Lilia Mercedes Mendoza (Universidad Libre Seccional Barranquilla)",,"Ospina, Eliana Jazbleidy Salamanca (University of Quindío); Uribe, Carlos Alberto (University of Quindío); Vega, Lilia Mercedes Mendoza (Free University of Colombia)",2,0,,1.1,https://revistas.unilibre.edu.co/index.php/dictamenlibre/article/download/2895/2309,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107356494,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

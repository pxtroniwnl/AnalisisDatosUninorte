A highly fragmented and heavily regulated sector, it has become increasingly complex owing to globalisation and geographical decoupling of production and consumption activities. The urban population of the world has grown from 746 million in 1950 to 3.9 billion in 2014 and more than 70% of the population is anticipated to be living in urban areas by 2050. Food supply chains play a vital role in feeding the world’s most populous cities, whilst underpinning transportation, storage, distribution, and waste management activities for the sustainability of the urban environment. That is why, this book presents the latest research on food supply chain management with a focus on urbanisation. The contributions involve food distribution in cities, food waste minimisation, and food security with a focus on models and approaches to achieve more sustainable and circular food supply chains.",,,,,"Emel Aktas, Michael Bourlakis",,2020,2020,,2020,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,13,9,,4.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127853812,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 2 Zero Hunger

The sociology of Latin America is a thriving field whose major contributions include Dependence theory, World-systems theory, historical debates on economic development, among others. This handbook offers research essays that introduce the readers to the main assessments of the discipline’s key areas and current trends, specifically with regard to contemporary sociology in Latin America, as well as a collection of innovative empirical studies deploying a variety of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The handbook is organized in eight subfields in which the most significant theoretical and methodological contributions are being made. These include studies in classical areas of sociology, such as sociology of inequalities, sociology of religions, and the well-established sociology of the state, collective action and social movements. The sociology of migrations in Latin America, which has rapidly consolidated into a specialized subfield in the region, provides analytical and conceptual categories that offer alternative theories. This collection also offers a group of sociological studies in diverse fields such as sociology of gender, medical sociology, and sociology of violence. Due to the deterioration of social and economic conditions, as well as recent disruptions to an already tense political environment, these have become some of the most productive and important fields in the sociology of the region. This roiling sociopolitical atmosphere also generates new and innovative expressions of protest and survival, which are being explored by sociologists across different continents today. The essays included in this collection presents a guided map and a thematic articulation to central sociological debates that introduces readers to contemporary sociology in Latin America.",,,,,"Xóchitl Bada, Liliana Rivera-Sánchez",,2020-06-08,2020,2020-06-08,2021-06-10,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,4,2,,1.83,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128316724,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,10 Reduced Inequalities

Despite this, the field of Youth Studies, like many others, is dominated by the knowledge economy of the Global North. To address these geopolitical inequalities of knowledge, The Oxford Handbook of Global South Youth Studies offers a contribution from Southern scholars to remake Youth Studies from its current state, that universalizes Northern perspectives, into a truly Global Youth Studies. Contributors from across the Global South—including from Diaspora, Indigenous and Aboriginal communities—locate and define ‘the Global South’; articulate the necessity of studying Southern lives to enrich, reinterpret, legitimate, and offer symmetry to youth studies; and use Southern theory to do so. Eleven concepts—personhood, intersectionality, violences, de- and postcoloniality, consciousness, precarity, fluid modernities, ontological insecurity, navigational capacities, collective agency, and emancipation – are reimagined and ‘re-presented.’ The outcome is a series of everyday practices such as hustling, navigating, fixing, waiting, being on standby, silence, and life-writing that demonstrate how youth living in adversity experiment with and push back against routine and conformity, and how research may support them in these endeavors and, simultaneously, redefine the relationships between knowledge, practice, and politics – what the editors term epistepraxis. The handbook concludes with a nascent charter for a Global Youth Studies of benefit to the world, which no longer excludes, assumes, or elides but embraces new possibilities for representing youth, researching among them, and devising policies and interventions to better serve them.",,,,,"Sharlene Swartz, Adam Cooper, Clarence M.

It maps the field for the twenty first century reflecting the massive changes that have occurred and the challenges ahead for future research. It provides a rich diversity of scholarly perspectives and covers the entire spectrum of higher education from a geographical, a topical and disciplinary perspective. It is unrivaled in its capacity to go beyond national boundaries and provides indispensible comparative analyses. The major reference works available about higher education have been published more than two decades ago and since then higher education has undergone major changes that have resulted in a much larger, diverse, global, and multidimensional reality. One of the main trends has been relentless expansion on a worldwide scale. This has led to mass higher education becoming a reality across continents, substantial growth in the number of countries with universal access to higher education, and great diversification of the student body. The tremendous increase in the international links in higher education, through issues such as training, students’ mobility, staff mobility, research activities, is another major change. The consequence is a global dimension that is strongly associated with the intensification of international networks in which institutions and researchers explore, create and share knowledge. As a result of the changes and trends, higher education has increasingly become part of debates that highlight its complexity as an institution that combines relevant political, social, economic, and cultural purposes and dimensions. Asked to play important and varied economic and social roles, higher education has had to reshape its priorities, and organizational and decision-making structures. The growth and increased complexity of the field have both led to more attention being paid to all aspects of higher education and to the expansion of research.",,,,,"Pedro Nuno Teixeira, Jung Cheol Shin",,2020,2020,,2020,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,22,11,,14.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130181223,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

This second edition builds on the massive collection of information and research from the first edition by adding new entries as well as updating the existing entries. The entries in this encyclopedia range from succinct summaries of specific sites and the scientific aspects of archaeological enquiry to detailed discussions of archaeological concepts, theories and methods, and from investigations into the social, ethical and political dimensions of archaeological practice to biographies of leading archaeologists from throughout the world. The different forms of archaeology are explored, along with the techniques used for each and the challenges, concerns and issues that face archaeologists today. This compendium is both a print reference and an online reference work. One of the encyclopedia’s major innovations is that it harnesses the capabilities of an online environment, enhancing both the presentation and dissemination of information.

122,pub.1126165272,10.1163/9789004435315,,,"Comparative Constitutional History, Volume One: Principles, Developments, Challenges","George Bancroft (1800–1891) was an influential statesman, historian and educator. He was one of the first Americans to attend the University of Göttingen as a young man in order to master multiple academic disciplines and educational techniques that the young United States needed. At Göttingen, Bancroft became fascinated by German constitutional theory and history, their connection to politics and human geography, and the forerunners of German legal science. After his return to the United States, Bancroft translated into English books by Arnold Heeren, his former professor. Bancroft also set up a school and adopted German teaching methods at Round Hill in Northampton, Massachusetts, employed German scholars, and intensely engaged Göttingen academics and other Americans who looked to Germany for pedagogic and constitutional inspiration. A close reading of Bancroft’s translations and correspondence suggests that this was not a one-way exchange. Bancroft was instrumental not only in importing German texts and practices into the United States, but also formulated American notions of progress, abolitionism and state-systems that in turn shaped the so-called Göttingen School. Citizenship is and has for a long time been a core component of constitutional theory. The rebirth of citizenship in the quattrocento in Northern Italy from classical Greek and Roman sources of inspiration demonstrates its salience, as does the importance citizenship had in French Revolutionary thinking. In general, citizenship constitutes a reciprocal relationship between the citizen and the polity with a set of fundamental rights and obligations. These might include the right to vote for representative assemblies, the right to free movement within the territory of the state and the obligation to bear arms when required by law. However, the relationship between a state and the citizens of its overseas territories challenges the basic model of citizenship. Contrasting the approaches of the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the rights of citizens of overseas territories sheds light on the meaning and contours of citizenship in constitutional theory and law. Located at a crossroads between politics and law, constitutional preambles often represent the outcome of debates between different political forces over the founding principles of the Constitution. The discussions that took place during the drafting of the Preamble to the Ukrainian Constitution provide an insightful case study of this phenomenon. Influenced by its Soviet past and an unstable political environment, Ukraine has seen severe struggles among the political parties in order to reach an agreement over issues of particular sensitivity to the nation. By examining the case of Ukraine and its 1996 Constitution, this chapter also aims to contribute to the debate concerning the legal value of constitutional preambles. While stressing the theme of ‘good faith’ and surveying the decisions and opinions of courts and scholars in Hong Kong, this article delves into the issue of interpretation of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and explains why, in the face of a breach of the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong resulting from the exercise of illegal interpretative power by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, it is about time for the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong to forcefully re-assert its power of constitutional control over the actions of the Standing Committee. This chapter examines the separation of powers and forms of government in North Africa and the Middle East following the ‘Arab Spring’ and shows that most Arab constitutions still guarantee (albeit to a lesser extent than in the past) an extremely high concentration of power in the hands of the Head of State, thus favouring the continuation in office of illiberal regimes. This weak separation of powers is due to different reasons, including the constitutional tradition, the top-down constitution-making processes and the external influences. The only notable exception (at least for the moment) is Tunisia, which is already at an advanced stage in the process of democratization. This chapter compares constitutional institutions that political thinkers in Revolutionary France, early nineteenth-century Spain, and Mexico devised with the aim of protecting constitutional order from abuses by one or more of the branches of government. The chapter focuses on two different types of historical institutions: those with moderating powers and those with conserving powers. Moderating institutions acted as buffers between legislative and executive authorities to prevent either from encroaching upon the prerogatives of the other. Conservative institutions undid unconstitutional actions and supervised constitutional order. The chapter shows that Mexicans were well-acquainted with the constitutional debates surrounding both types of institutions in France and Spain. It demonstrates that Mexican politicians not only endorsed these two types of institutions in their constitutional plans, but also reworked them to create an innovative institution of constitutional control in the 1836 Mexico Constitution: the Supreme Conservative Power. This chapter offers both a genealogy and a critique of the Portuguese system of judicial review of legislation, which blends elements of American-style diffuse control carried out by the ordinary courts and European-style concentrated control carried out by a specialized constitutional court. The genealogy suggests an unorthodox explanation of the peculiarly mixed character of the system. The critique identifies three principal flaws of the system and argues that it should be reformed. The judicial review of constitutional amendments in Colombia has evolved through the activism of constitutional judges rather than the texts of the Constitutions. In times of judicial crisis and reform to the judiciary it becomes more interesting because the constitutional judges have reviewed amendments regarding the judicial branch, as several of them have been declared unconstitutional during the last four decades. This chapter tells the trajectory of the review of constitutional amendments to the Judiciary, suggesting that one of the factors that could explain these rulings is the defence of the judicial branch by the constitutional judges. In this way, it tells the interdependency between politics and Law on the decisions that have limited the power of the Congress to reform the Judiciary, by the Supreme Court, between 1978 and 1991; as well as by the Constitutional Court as of the Constitution of 1991. Individual access to constitutional justice can take many forms. One of the most prominent examples is the individual constitutional complaint. In many constitutional courts, the constitutional complaint has become the key method for individuals to assert constitutional claims. In Germany, constitutional complaint is very well established and it extends to complaints against judicial judgments. This chapter examines individual access to constitutional justice in South Korea and Taiwan. Although the legal systems of both countries have been heavily influenced by German constitutional practices, constitutional complaint against judicial judgments is explicitly prohibited in Korea; in Taiwan such a possibility was only officially introduced in 2019 and awaits implementation in 2022. By comparatively tracing and analysing the constitutional conditions, and nature and evolution of the mechanism of individual constitutional complaint in South Korea and Taiwan, this chapter aims to shed light on variations and convergences in individual access to constitutional justice in East Asia.",,,,,"Francesco Biagi, Justin O.

The authors support the hypothesis that the current regional disparities are principally the result of a long and complex process in which historical, geographical, economic, institutional, and political factors have all worked together. Lessons from the past can aid current debates on regional inequalities, territorial cohesion, and public policies in developing and also developed countries. In contrast with European countries, Latin American economies largely specialized in commodity exports, showed high levels of urbanization and high transports costs (both domestic and international). This new research provides a new perspective on the economic history of Latin American regions and offers new insights on how such forces interact in peripheral countries. In that sense, natural resources, differences in climatic conditions, industrial backwardness and low population density areas leads us to a new set of questions and tentative answers. This book brings together a group of leading American and European economic historians in order to build a new set of data on historical regional GDPs for nine Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.

54,pub.1125451821,10.1007/978-3-030-35187-8,,,Private International Law Aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility,"This book addresses one of the core challenges in the corporate social responsibility (or business and human rights) debate: how to ensure adequate access to remedy for victims of corporate abuses that infringe upon their human rights. However, ensuring access to remedy depends on a series of normative and judicial elements that become highly complex when disputes are transnational. In such cases, courts need to consider and apply different laws that relate to company governance, to determine the competent forum, to define which bodies of law to apply, and to ensure the adequate execution of judgments. The book also discusses how alternative methods of dispute settlement can relate to this topic, and the important role that private international law plays in access to remedy for corporate-related human rights abuses. This collection comprises 20 national reports from jurisdictions in Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia, addressing the private international law aspects of corporate social responsibility. They provide an overview of the legal differences between geographical areas, and offer numerous examples of how states and their courts have resolved disputes involving private international law elements. The book draws two preliminary conclusions: that there is a need for a better understanding of the role that private international law plays in cases involving transnational elements, in order to better design transnational solutions to the issues posed by economic globalisation; and that the treaty negotiations on business and human rights in the United Nations could offer a forum to clarify and unify several of the elements that underpin transnational disputes involving corporate human rights abuses, which could also help to identify and bridge the existing gaps that limit effective access to remedy. Adopting a comparative approach, this book appeals to academics, lawyers, judges and legislators concerned with the issue of access to remedy and reparation for corporate abuses under the prism of private international law.",,,Ius Comparatum - Global Studies in Comparative Law,,"Catherine Kessedjian, Humberto Cantú Rivera",,2020,2020,,2020,42,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,4,0,,6.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125451821,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It is the perspective of social pedagogy: a theoretical and practical perspective that has been developing in continental Europe over the last 150 years. Social pedagogy poses a way of acting that places young people at the center of socio-educational work, putting their decisions and actions into value. It aims to accompany them in their life process of personal construction within the framework of the community in which they live. The book is organized into three large blocks of chapters. The introduction aims to prepare readers for the social pedagogy approach to work with young people. It briefly outlines its current situation in the world and, relate it to the main professions in which it is embodied in different socio-cultural contexts: social pedagogy, social education, and social work. The first block presents the framework and socio-pedagogical, theoretical, and practical parameters in which work with young people takes place in Europe and Latin America. The second block of chapters deals with youth policies and the training and professionalization of educators and those who work with young people. The last block focuses on some socio-educational practices with young people that include youth justice, social inclusion process, youth participation in digital life or transition to adult life. The book is based on a wide perspective of young people from cultural diversity. All the contributions of this book are based on research and practical experiences.",,,,,"Xavier Úcar, Pere Soler-Masó, Anna Planas-Lladó",,2020-04-21,2020,2020-04-23,2020-04-21,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,4,3,,1.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126927551,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education

Bioarchaeology—the study of archaeological human skeletons—provides direct evidence of the human experience of past climate and environmental changes and serves as an important complement to paleoclimate, historical, and archaeological approaches to changes we may expect with global warming. Comprising 27 chapters from experts across a broad range of time periods and geographical regions, this book addresses hypotheses about how climate and environmental changes impact human health and well-being, factors that promote resilience, and circumstances that make migration or interpersonal violence a more likely outcome. The volume highlights the potential relevance of bioarchaeological analysis to contemporary challenges by organizing the chapters into a framework outlined by the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Planning for a warmer world requires knowledge about humans as biological organisms with a deep connection to Earth’s ecosystems balanced by an appreciation of how historical and socio-cultural circumstances, socioeconomic inequality, degrees of urbanization, community mobility, and social institutions play a role in shaping long-term outcomes for human communities. Containing a wealth of nuanced perspectives about human-environmental relations, the book is key reading for students of environmental archaeology, bioarchaeology, and the history of disease. By providing a longer view of contemporary challenges, it may also interest readers in public health, public policy, and planning.",,,,,Gwen Robbins Schug,,2020-10-12,2020,2020-10-12,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,19,10,,12.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130955858,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 44 Human Society",

Therefore, there is an increasing need to search for integrated solutions to make development more sustainable. The United Nations has acknowledged the problem and approved the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. On 1st January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda officially came into force. These goals cover the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The Encyclopedia of the UN Sustainable Development Goals comprehensively addresses the SDGs in an integrated way. It encompasses 17 volumes, each one devoted to one of the 17 SDGs. This volume addresses SDG 12, namely ""Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"" and contains the description of a range of terms, which allows a better understanding and fosters knowledge. Concretely, the defined targets are: Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries Achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources Halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses Achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment Substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities Ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities Editorial Board Medani P.

The challenge is to assemble a working wind turbine emulator reflecting the turbine behavior which consists on that the shaft spin is not fixed for a given wind velocity but depends on the target power to be delivered. This task is achieved via a PID controller that can be tuned after proper modelling of the wind turbine emulator. Since the emulator components are different and include even nonlinear components, a strategy of black box modelling is preferred. Artificial Neural Networks are used due to their capabilities as universal approximators, and supervised learning is chosen as the learning strategy due to its positive results in black box modelling. A DC generator is selected for the emulator which eases its interconnection with a DC microgrid testbench available at a laboratory intended for studying the effect of renewable energies in conventional power systems. The excitation voltage and the RPM range of the DC generator allow to create an emulator with a 10:1 power ratio that in fact agrees with the power handling specifications of the microgrid testbench.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte for support given through the Energy Strategic Program and for the Renewable Energy Laboratory, UniGRID, supported by the autonomous patrimony national of funding for science, technology and innovation FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS, COLCIENCIAS Code 57598 Grant 037-2018.

The progress has been slow, and there are still many areas where integration has been nonexistent. In Colombia, the government has improved several areas, but there are many needs for people with disabilities in education, who are usually left behind. We propose here a program for building inclusive mobile applications for children and adults with disabilities. The developers of those games will be high school students from schools in Barranquilla, and using this approach will teach them about inclusion. The users of those applications will be the children and adults with special needs served by institutions for students with special needs.

The report starts with modeling the demand curve for regularly periods from a dataset. Subsequently, IEEE 39 standard power system was used as a testbed where the standardized demand curves are applied and scaled to an interest voltage level. The case study uses Colombian energy demand data, and the analysis is carried out based on voltage magnitude at busbars, which is the electrical variable of concern. The demand response strategy adopted is the time-of-use tariff that assigns rate benefits depending on the demand blocks defined by the system operator. The results lead to the voltage magnitudes showing a flattening in their hourly profile when there is a higher level of penetration of the demand response.

However, Non-Line-of-Sight conditions may severely affect network performance. Therefore, network planning requires obtaining the best line of sight possible between the nodes and the gateway. This paper presents a system to plan LoRaWAN networks using genetic algorithms. Results show that the system locates the nodes minimizing obstructions in the communication links. Additionally, tests compared system performance against an expert judgment, achieving less than 3% error in most test cases.

LoRaWAN fulfills all these characteristics employing the Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation technique. Thus, the technology shows an important alternative for the Internet of Things, and different studies created simulation models of LoRaWAN. Nonetheless, LoRa communication systems operate in free bands with modulation frequencies of 400 and 900 MHz. Therefore, directly simulating the system in these passband frequencies requires higher memory and processing resources compared to simulating a baseband system. This paper details a technique to study LoRa communications, by employing the Complex Envelope method. The method describes the transfer function of the communication system using an equivalent baseband representation. Results of bit error rate for different transmission parameters agree with other models in the literature, showing the validity of our approach.",,,,"2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",,,2020-10-22,2020,,2020-10-22,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Márquez, Luz E.; Calle, Maria; Vélez, Juan C.","Márquez, Luz E.

Also, this study assessed available parametrized equations of the JONSWAP spectra in order to verify their applications for easing the application of the GA model. The modeled results demonstrated the capability of the GA model to find the best alpha and gamma values of the spectra for normal and extreme sea state conditions. In addition, the assessed spectra parameterized equations evidenced limitations to represent the wave energy distribution at the study area, then, this study performed a successfully modification of one of these parameterized equations to model the proper JONSWAP spectra. According to the results was evidenced the necessity to apply numerical approaches such as Genetic Algorithms to solve wave spectra equations for offshore structure designing, and the assessing of support parameterized equations before their application because the wave loads could be wrongly estimated.",,,,"Day 2 Tue, May 05, 2020",,,2020-05-04,2020,2020-05-04,2020-05-04,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel; Guzmán, Andrés","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Nueva Granada Military University); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Military University); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",3,0,,0.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127309604,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,

To assess the impact of the defect on the performance, two approaches were taken into consideration. Initially, the fuel cell system was simulated using a unidimensional (1D) dynamic model which took into consideration mass transfer, heat transfer, and electrochemical phenomena. The second approach was experimental, using a 5 sq.cm PEM fuel cell, the impact of the GDL porosity on the fuel cell system was studied. Also, the system response under different load changes was investigated. After that, experimental results are presented to give a better insight into the phenomena analyzed, mainly on the dynamic system response. Cracks and catalyst clusters were the main defects analyzed, both of them were observed in new membranes assemblies. To control the defects, new membranes assemblies were tested, and after that, defects were induced using Nafion solution and catalyst powder to emulate the presence of catalyst clusters. For the cracks, some fibers in the GDL cloth were cut to emulate the defect. Membranes now with defects were tested again to compare its performance and detect any performance loss due to the physical changes in the electrodes. Results indicate a strong correlation between the porosity and the supply air pressure and the system time constants. Also, the impact of the defects was evidenced in the dynamic system response, after step changes in the operating conditions.",,,,Volume 8: Energy,,,2020-11-16,2020,2021-02-16,2020-11-16,,,,Closed,Proceeding,"Fontalvo, Victor M.; Illera, Danny; Sanjuan, Marco E.; Gomez, Humberto A.","Fontalvo, Victor M.

Each DOF is driven with a pair of antagonistic pneumatic artificial muscles, and Bowden wires are carefully laid for mimicking the tendons of the human hand to facilitate the motion control of the robotic hand. Rubber bladders with force sensors are also employed as the skin of the palm and the finger pad to enable the force control and compliant manipulation of the robotic hand.

Some authors use graphical representations of best practices for synthesizing knowledge. Although, some drawbacks impede extraction and interpretation of best practice information. Some of such drawbacks are improperly usage of representation symbols, incomplete information presented by authors, non-standard representation, absence of essential elements of best practices, non-homogeneous level of specificity, and imprecise denomination of practice. Consequently, in this paper we propose a model of best practice representation by using pre-conceptual schemas. Our model can be applied to any knowledge area with a generic structure and it is appropriate for human and computational comprehension. Our model is intended to allow for completely representing knowledge related to best practices, creating, selecting, updating, extending, and combining best practices.

The self-regulation process occurs in a context structured by the convergence theory (ICT and life environment). The objective of this work provides a framework for continuous improvement between the interrelation of activation of the use or adoption of ICT by students in a context of competencies. It was performed with a sample of students. An experimental random sampling design was used. The results demonstrate the manner of application of ICT used by the student in their self-learning. It is observed in the treatment of variability and uncertainty in the environment, it helps trainers to estimate times in training activities in an efficient and fat free way.","In the process of preparing this work, he was supported by the 2019EM-ML-08 project, which is hosted by the ViceRectory for Research and Postgraduate Studies at the Catholic University of Temuco.

Instructors can adapt pedagogical strategies to train students' soft skills and the technical knowledge needed for the profession. Design Thinking (DT) is a methodology that promotes the production of creative and innovative software solutions. Teaching DT in Software Engineering (SE) courses can promote students with an interdisciplinary teaching practice that stimulates soft skills to understand and explore problems and design innovative software solutions. This paper presents research exploring how DT provides practical experiences and it supports the development of students' soft skills from SE courses. We proposed and developed a dynamic based on the DT phase that simulates practical situations of a software project. The students' perceptions of the dynamics were analyzed qualitatively. The results showed that the dynamics promoted practical experiences and the development of soft skills, such as problem-solving, creativity, teamwork, diversity, and critical thinking.",,,,Proceedings of the XXXIV Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering,,,2020-10-21,2020,2020-12-21,2020-10-21,,,690-699,Closed,Proceeding,"Marques, Anna B.; Ferreira, Bruna; Lopes, Adriana; Silva, Williamson","Marques, Anna B.

1131,pub.1130926712,10.1145/3377814.3381709,,,Towards an open repository for teaching software modeling applying active learning strategies,"Modeling is a core topic in Software Engineering Education. Nevertheless, students face difficulties while learning software modeling. To teach software modeling effectively in computing courses, instructors who usually employed traditional methods could use active learning strategies. However, instructors are reluctant to change their teaching approaches due to several barriers that hinder the application of active learning strategies. Besides, relatively little research addresses how to mitigate them. The objective of this research is to help instructors implementing active learning strategies when teaching software modeling with UML diagrams. To achieve this objective, we conducted a Design Science Research (DSR). We proposed an artifact called OpenSMALS, an Open Repository for teaching Software Modeling applying Active Learning Strategies. OpenSMALS provides specific guidelines on how instructors can apply these strategies and helping instructors to identify the active learning strategies best suit their teaching context. We performed four DSR Design Cycles---in four different universities---to evaluate and evolve OpenSMALS. Our results show that OpenSMALS satisfactorily reduced the barriers faced by instructors, and it achieved an appropriate maturity level to be adopted by other instructors.",,,,Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training,,,2020-06-27,2020,2020-09-18,2020-06-27,,,162-172,Closed,Proceeding,"Silva, Williamson; Gadelha, Bruno; Steinmacher, Igor; Conte, Tayana","Silva, Williamson (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, AM - Brazil); Gadelha, Bruno (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, AM - Brazil); Steinmacher, Igor (Northern Arizona University); Conte, Tayana (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, AM - Brazil)",,"Silva, Williamson (Federal University of Amazonas); Gadelha, Bruno (Federal University of Amazonas); Steinmacher, Igor (Northern Arizona University); Conte, Tayana (Federal University of Amazonas)",2,2,,0.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130926712,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,4 Quality Education

Thus, these artifacts support team communication. Failures in communication via software artifacts occur because practitioners typically concentrate on the artifacts’ content, without reflecting on how other software development team members will interpret these artifacts. Such communication failures can negatively affect the quality of software artifacts. To support better communication via artifact, we proposed the Directives of Communicability (DCs). The DCs aim to support practitioners in analyzing the characteristics that affect the artifacts’ content on team communication. In this paper, we present an exploratory study carried out to evaluate the practitioners’ perception about the contribution of DCs to the quality of a specific software artifact. The results indicate that DCs contribute to this purpose. We noticed positive perceptions of practitioners about the use of DCs in software artifacts.",,,,19th Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality,,,2020-12,2020,2021-03-06,2020-12,,,1-10,Closed,Proceeding,"Lopes, Adriana; Conte, Tayana; de Souza, Clarisse Sieckenius","Lopes, Adriana (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Brasil); Conte, Tayana (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Brasil); de Souza, Clarisse Sieckenius (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil)",,"Lopes, Adriana (Federal University of Amazonas); Conte, Tayana (Federal University of Amazonas); de Souza, Clarisse Sieckenius (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro)",1,0,,0.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136163253,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

Because of eclipse occurrence timing over the Chilean region, it is a unique event as happened during the local evening time, when ionospheric evolution was going down due to decrease in electron density as intensity of ionizing radiation decreases. Solar eclipse, solar further decreases ionizing radiation. We have chosen two GPS receiving station close to totality path. The SILL station was in totality (magnitude 1.006), while PVCA was in partial (magnitude 0.99) eclipse region. Interestingly, we have observed maximum decrease in electron density (0.56 TEC unit) at PVCA compare to SILL (0.38 TEC unit) station. The higher decrease in electron density at partial eclipse station could possibly due to two regions: local time difference and geographical difference. A more detailed analysis is further warranted to confirm these possibilities.","The author A.K.M. thanks the Science and Education Research Board (SERB) for financial support under Ramanujan Fellowship (file SB/S2/RJN-052/2016) and the Faculty Recharge Program (FRP) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) (ID FRP62343), New Delhi.

In Chile, an increase in the production of copper sulfide concentrates is projected, considering the depletion of oxidized minerals. This increase also includes complex or dirty concentrates with a high presence of impurities, mainly arsenic. Currently in an environmental context, Chilean smelters on average do not meet the emissions standard for copper smelters due to the age of these smelters and the high investment required to modify their infrastructure. Strategically, the increase in high impurities in concentrates results in higher treatment costs, penalties and difficulty of acceptance in the international market. With regard to the economic context of these smelters in Chile, these are among the most cost of operation worldwide. A globalized strategy for the modernization of foundries in Chile is therefore needed.

In this regard, the use of dielectric spectroscopy is being coupled to statistical methods such as machine learning in order to develop new methods to identify adulteration. However, there is a small number of scientific reports above the application of the aforementioned methods when citric fruit juices is being identified. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate dielectric spectroscopy and four different classification techniques (Support Vector Machine - SVM, K-nearest neighbor-KNN, Linear Discriminat -LD and Quadratic Discriminat-QD) to discriminate between three citrus juices. For this purpose, samples of Citrus limetta, Citrus limettioides and Citrus reticulata were evaluated; obtaining its dielectric spectral profiles in the range of 5 to 9 GHz. Then from the spectral profiles the loss factor (e”) was calculated using the reflection coefficient. Next e” value was pretreated, reducing noise through a savitzky golay filter, and new variables created through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, the models for classification were constructed with the previously mentioned techniques and the principal components. The results shown that using four components the variance can be explained in 97%; likewise, the discrimination values vary between 88.9 and 100.0%, with SVM, LD and QD the best discrimination techniques all successfully at 100.0 %. Therefore; It is concluded that the technique of dielectric spectroscopy and machine learning presents potential for the discrimination of citrus fruit juices.","The authors would like to thank Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Chota for funding with mining CANON funds the excecution of the research project called “Desarrollo de un sistema no destructivo para la determinación de las propiedades físicoquímicas en frutas nativas y derivados de la región Cajamarca, usando espectroscopía dieléctrica” approved with resolution N°432-2018-C.O./UNACH.

Robinson Crusoe Island is 667 km from the continent and approximately four million years old; Alejandro Selkirk Island is an additional 181 km west and only one million years old. The natural impacts of subsidence and erosion have shaped the landscapes of these islands, resulting in progressive changes to their subtropical vegetation. The older island has undergone more substantial changes, due to both natural causes and human impacts. After the discovery of Robinson Crusoe Island in 1574, people began cutting down forests for lumber to construct boats and homes, for firewood, and to make room for pastures. Domesticated plants and animals were introduced, some of which have since become feral or invasive, causing damage to the local vegetation.

More than an analysis that explore the concepts of encryption, in this paper we focus on the possible apparition of events of order and disorder. In this manner we built a formalism entirely based on the entropy from random events that are generated as part of the strategy of security. For a photon linear polarization, the entropy might be high enough that would be a source of errors as reflected on the lost of information by a 10% due to polarization superposition of states.",,,,2020 IEEE / ITU International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Good (AI4G),,,2020-01-25,2020,,2020-01-25,00,,152-157,Closed,Proceeding,"Nieto-Chaupis, Huber","Nieto-Chaupis, Huber (Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

Often patients cannot estimate a possible crisis so that, in most cases most of them are quite sensitive to strokes and cardiac arrest unexpectedly. In this paper the algorithm of Tom Mitchell is employed as a kind of software that manages the updated inputs in order to anticipate a possible crisis in terms of probabilities. Thus, while sensors are enough accurate to measure a variable, the algorithm is able to make predictions about the worse scenarios of diabetes crisis. When this information is monitored inside an Internet of Bio-nano Things network, patients might be assisted in the shortest times, by avoiding irreversible complications in their health. Therefore, a health services operator acquires capabilities to minimize risks and make fast and precise decisions with minimal errors either from clinicians and instruments.",,,,2020 IEEE / ITU International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Good (AI4G),,,2020-01-25,2020,,2020-01-25,00,,147-151,Closed,Proceeding,"Nieto-Chaupis, Huber","Nieto-Chaupis, Huber (Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

316,pub.1133476196,10.1117/12.2562015,,,Development of an experimental optical adaptive optics for small telescopes,"We are developing an optical adaptive optics (AO) system for small telescopes. An AO instrument in optical wavelength mounted on a 1-2 m class telescope located at a good seeing site will make it possible to achieve high angular resolution of 0.1-0.2 arcsec. Such capability will enable us to perform unique astronomical programs, as well as to provide good opportunity in education for both astronomy and engineering. In order to examine the AO capability on small telescopes, we developed an experimental AO instrument, in which inexpensive commercial devices are extensively used to reduce cost for development. We designed the weight and the physical size so small that it is portable and easy to be mounted on a small telescope, which is a unique feature of our AO instrument. After the engineering observations performed in Japan, we mounted it on the 1-m telescope of the European Southern Observatory of La Silla in Chile in March 2018 to examine the performance. We found that there were approximately 4 times and 5 times improvements in the full-width-halfmaximum (FWHM) and Strehl ratio of the PSF from the natural seeing, respectively. The best AO-corrected PSF obtained during the observation achieved FWHM=0.18 arcsec and the Strehl ratio = 0.18. Based on the detailed analysis of the timeseries wavefront and deformable-mirror-operation data, further improvement in AO performance is expected by adjustment of the system parameters. We succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility of an inexpensive optical AO system for small telescopes.",,,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Adaptive Optics Systems VII,"Dirk Schmidt, Laura Schreiber, Elise Vernet",,2020-12-13,2020,,,11448,,114486z-114486z-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Minezaki, Takeo; Kono, Yukihiro; Vanzi, Leonardo; Zapata, Abner; Flores, Mauricio; Ramirez, Sebastian; Ohnaka, Keiichi","Minezaki, Takeo (The Univ. of Tokyo (Japan)); Kono, Yukihiro (The Univ. of Tokyo (Japan)); Vanzi, Leonardo (Pontificia Univ.

In essence, peaks functions are assumed as the pattern of rate of infections at large cities. In this manner, once the free parameters of theses patterns are identified then one proceeds to engage to the well-known Mitchell’s criteria in order to construct the algorithm that would yield the best estimates as to carry out social intervention as well as to predict dates about the main characteristics of infection’s distributions. The distributions are modeled by the Dirac-Delta function whose spike property is used to make the numerical convolutions. In this manner the parameters of Dirac-Delta function’s argument are interpreted as the model parameters that determine the dates of social regulation such as quarantine as well as the possible date of end of first wave and potential periods of the beginning of a second one. The theoretical and computational approach is illustrated with a case of outbreak depending on free parameters simulating the implementation of new rules to detain the infections.",,,,2020 IEEE Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering (AIKE),,,2020-12-13,2020,,2020-12-13,00,,148-152,Closed,Proceeding,"Nieto-Chaupis, Huber","Nieto-Chaupis, Huber (Universidad Privada del Norte, Av.

The robot software implementation requires a variety of knowledge and experiences. Thereby developing cost for such software systems is now increasing. Middleware systems such as Robot Operating System (ROS) are being developed to decrease such cost and widely used. Streaming data Sharing Manager (SSM) is one of such middleware systems that allow developers to write and read sensor data with timestamps using a common PC. This feature enables developers to control a robot by taking account of measured time. This control is important because using multiple sensor data with different timestamp cannot allow developers to control a robot correctly. SSM assumes that only one PC is used to control a robot, therefore if it exists a process that consumes much CPU resource, other processes cannot finish their assumed deadlines, leading to the unexpected behavior of a robot. This paper proposes an architecture called Distributed Streaming data Sharing Manager (DSSM) that enables to distributing each process on existing SSM to different PCs. We investigate the current architecture and behavior of SSM, then propose a new architecture that can achieve our goal. Finally, we apply DSSM to an existing SSM based robot control system that autonomously controls an unmanned vehicle, then confirm the effectiveness of DSSM by measuring the resource usages.",,,,2020 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII),,,2020-01-15,2020,,2020-01-15,00,,862-866,Closed,Proceeding,"Fukuda, Hiroaki; Gunji, Ryota; Hasegawa, Tadahiro; Leger, Paul; Figueroa, Ismael","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Gunji, Ryota (Graduate School of Electrical Engineerning and Computer Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Hasegawa, Tadahiro (Department of Electrical Engineerning, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ingenieía, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Figueroa, Ismael (Escuela de Auditoría, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile)","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology)","Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Gunji, Ryota (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Hasegawa, Tadahiro (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Figueroa, Ismael (University of Valparaíso)",1,0,,0.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125504467,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

These guidelines make it possible to control the variables involved in crop growth, such as temperature, humidity, radiation, among others. At present, mathematical models are being developed to control the behavior of these variables in greenhouses. In this research, the modeling of forced airflow from the temperature and humidity in a greenhouse is carried out. The selected greenhouse is in the Yuyucocha experimental farm of the Universidad Técnica del Norte in the city of Ibarra-Ecuador. Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) of the variety colloquially called ""superchola"" are grown in the greenhouse using aeroponics. High-quality seeds are obtained; however, it is necessary to improve the minimum temperature conditions for the warm months of the year. A model was developed to determine how the airflow is distributed inside the enclosure. The model is validated by comparing the results obtained with experimental samples in June from a network of sensors. It is observed that the forced airflow in the enclosure needs external elements to reach the minimum temperatures required for the potato crop in the months of higher environmental temperature.",,,,2020 IEEE ANDESCON,,,2020-10-16,2020,,2020-10-16,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Cabascango, Manuel; Mejía-Echeverría, Cosme; Morales, Diego Ortíz; Peña, David Ojeda","Cabascango, Manuel (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador); Mejía-Echeverría, Cosme (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-GIDSIM-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador); Morales, Diego Ortíz (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-GIDSIM-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador); Peña, David Ojeda (Universidad Técnica del Norte, FICA-GIDSIM-Mecatrónica, Ibarra, Ecuador)","Cabascango, Manuel (Universidad Técnica del Norte)","Cabascango, Manuel (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Mejía-Echeverría, Cosme (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Morales, Diego Ortíz (Universidad Técnica del Norte); Peña, David Ojeda (Universidad Técnica del Norte)",3,2,,0.84,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133226249,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3008 Horticultural Production",

Tools that have contributed to the analysis of fields in which massive amounts of data are available is ʺdata miningʺ, a powerful tool that can be used effectively in the analysis of large amounts of data and in the subsequent derivation of important analytical results. This paper presents a methodology of analysis of crime facts from online newspapers, identifying the different communes where the greatest number of criminal events occur, which gives an idea of potentially more dangerous places, through the detection and geographical mapping of critical points, or the analysis of the nature of the crime through the extraction of entities. Statistics that measure the predictive capacity of the model indicate that the methodology is robust to recognize crime events within the body of the news.",,,,2020 15th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI),,,2020-06-27,2020,,2020-06-27,00,,1-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Saldaña, Manuel; Escobar, Christian; Galvez, Edelmira; Torres, David; Toro, Norman","Saldaña, Manuel (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Almirante Juan José Latorre 2901, Antofagasta, 1244260, Chile; Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica de Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, 1270709, Chile); Escobar, Christian (Departamento de Minería y Metalurgia, Universidad Tecnológica de Chile INACAP, Antofagasta, 1267326, Chile); Galvez, Edelmira (Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica de Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, 1270709, Chile); Torres, David (Department of Mining, Geological and Cartographic Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, 30203, Murcia, Spain); Toro, Norman (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad Arturo Prat, Almirante Juan José Latorre 2901, Antofagasta, 1244260, Chile; Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica de Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, 1270709, Chile)","Saldaña, Manuel (Arturo Prat University; Catholic University of the North)","Saldaña, Manuel (Arturo Prat University; Catholic University of the North); Escobar, Christian (Departamento de Minería y Metalurgia, Universidad Tecnológica de Chile INACAP, Antofagasta, 1267326, Chile); Galvez, Edelmira (Catholic University of the North); Torres, David (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Toro, Norman (Arturo Prat University; Catholic University of the North)",2,1,,1.61,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129399106,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4805 Legal Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Studies have also shown that there is a correlation between students' spatial skills and programming abilities, but it is unknown how well students' prior spatial abilities can predict students' introductory programming abilities at the end of the semester. During this study we used a multinomal logistic regression to create a predictive model to predict students' introductory programming abilities at the end of the semester. The highest model accuracy (64.6%) was obtained when accounting for students' prior programming abilities, prior spatial skills, socioeconomic status, and three factors regarding students' attitudes towards computing. It was also found that when looking at the predictability of each individual variable, students' prior spatial ability had the highest predictability (56.6% accuracy) when compared to all other variables.",,,,Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,,,2020-06-15,2020,2020-06-15,2020-06-15,,,446-451,Closed,Proceeding,"Bockmon, Ryan; Cooper, Stephen; Gratch, Jonathan; Zhang, Jian; Dorodchi, Mohsen","Bockmon, Ryan (University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA); Cooper, Stephen (University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA); Gratch, Jonathan (Texas Woman's University, Denton, TX, USA); Zhang, Jian (Texas Woman's University, Denton, TX, USA); Dorodchi, Mohsen (University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA)",,"Bockmon, Ryan (University of Nebraska–Lincoln); Cooper, Stephen (University of Nebraska–Lincoln); Gratch, Jonathan (Texas Woman's University); Zhang, Jian (Texas Woman's University); Dorodchi, Mohsen (University of North Carolina at Charlotte)",25,14,,7.97,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128203252,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

The study implemented algorithms of ANN using input data from a battery of psychometric tests. This battery assesses multiple domains of attention and executive functioning, memory and learning, sensorimotor functioning, social perception, language, and visual-spatial processing. We attempt to explore how accuracy is the use of ANN for the prediction of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We implemented the ANN with a configuration of three layers, 20 neurons in the input layer, 25 neurons in the hidden layer, and two neurons in the output layer. We studied the accuracy of the model in training and testing, also the confusion matrix of the model. Using our machine learning approach, we have trained the ANN model to predict children/adolescents with FASD with accuracy ranging from 75.5% in testing data. These results suggest that the ANN approach is a competitive and efficient methodology to detect and differentiate the cognitive neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. However, we could not recommend the use of this technique for diagnosis FASD if the model does not improve accuracy.",,,,2020 39th International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society (SCCC),,,2020-11-20,2020,,2020-11-20,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"de J.

270,pub.1131879197,10.1145/3422584.3423152,,,Interfaces for Modular Reasoning in Context-Oriented Programming,"Different activation mechanisms for Context-Oriented Programming (COP) like implicit activations have been proposed, increasing COP opportunities to be applied in real scenarios. However, activation mechanisms and base code definitions are insufficiently decoupled, as conditionals to activate layers require base code variable references. This hinders reuse, evolution, and modular reasoning of COP and base code, and therefore, uses of COP in real scenarios. This paper proposes interfaces, which are shared abstractions to communicate activation mechanisms and base code in a decoupled manner. Using these interfaces, an object can exhibit its internal state and behaviors, and conditionals use them to (de)activate layers. As layers are planned to be (re)used in different applications, developers can use interfaces to overcome the incompatibility between values exposed by a particular base code and values required by a layer. In addition, as a layer is a plain object, it can use an interface to exhibit the conditional evaluation of its activation to other layers to resolve conflicts among activations of layers. We apply this proposal to implicit activations in which evaluations of conditionals implicitly (de)activate layers. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of this proposal through RI-JS, a practical JavaScript library that currently supports interfaces, reactive activations (implementation variant for implicit activations), global and dynamic deployment, enter and exit transition processes, and partial methods.",,,,Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Workshop on Context-Oriented Programming and Advanced Modularity,,,2020-07-21,2020,2020-10-18,2020-07-21,,,1-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Leger, Paul; Masuhara, Hidehiko; Figueroa, Ismael","Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Masuhara, Hidehiko (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan); Figueroa, Ismael (Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile)",,"Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Masuhara, Hidehiko (Tokyo Institute of Technology); Figueroa, Ismael (University of Valparaíso)",3,1,,1.14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131879197,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4612 Software Engineering,

In this sense, machine learning is a suitable approach to analyze network traffic, and it generally achieves good results in the identification and detection of malware. However, an underlying problem is creating a dataset with network characteristics that accurately reflect the malwareś behavior. Characterizing adequately the dataset is a relevant process to identify malware with high precision when using traditional machine learning algorithms. This paper compares empirically three supervised machine learning algorithms, in order to identify ransomware traffic based on Android mobile network traffic features. We consider 9 features related to time properties of flows and bidirectional packets in 10 families of ransomware and different benign application Android network traffic. Empirical results show that Random Forest (RF) achieved a 96% accuracy in classifying ransomware, higher than Decision Tree (DT) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) approaches. We conclude that the selected features allow us to identify ransomware traffic and differentiate it from the traffic of benign applications.",,,,2020 39th International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society (SCCC),,,2020-11-20,2020,,2020-11-20,00,,1-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Manzano, Carlos; Meneses, Claudio; Leger, Paul","Manzano, Carlos (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Meneses, Claudio (Dpto.

The questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies in online environments. However, questionnaires available in the literature have some limitations when applied in MOOCs: (1) they do not consider those strategies that have been related with academic achievements in MOOCs; (2) the response rates are low due to their large number of questions, which limits the usage of the collected data; and (3) they do not capture the idiosyncrasies of the actual MOOCs technological environment given that statements of existing questionnaires are based on instruments developed in the 90s. To overcome these shortcomings, this study presents the MOOC-SRL, a questionnaire to measure SRL in MOOCs. This questionnaire is built upon an analysis of existing SRL questionnaires used in traditional face to face, online learning and on a review that analyzed which SRL strategies relate to successful learning outcomes in MOOCs. This questionnaire was validated through an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis developed over a sample of 4,627 ($N = 4,627$) learners of 6 different MOOCs. The final questionnaire consists of 22 items to assess 5 SRL strategies in MOOCs: Self-efficacy, Goal setting, Study environment management, Organization and Help-seeking.","This work has been co-funded by Dirección de Investigación de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under the project “Analítica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje híbrido” (DIUC_XVIII_2019_54).

Over the past four decades, governments across the globe have struggled to design, implement and evaluate policies that benefit the development of small firms. Deciding whether macro or micro policies are more appropriate for a given context has usually created an initial challenge for policy-makers. However, a cause for even greater dispute has been determining and agreeing what might be the preferred outcomes of such policies (e.g. more firms, better performing firms, fewer firm failures, job creation, greater productivity, higher levels of innovation, inclusivity of disadvantaged groups). Furthermore, evaluating the impact of specific policies presents a wide range of difficulties since it is impossible to isolate a simple cause-and-effect relationship between policy and its stated goal. This book explores the development of small business policy in five countries across five continents and seeks to develop a deeper understanding regarding how small business policy has evolved in these countries and what we might learn from their experiences.

The book demonstrates the importance of addressing the history of Southeast Asia as a multi-layered framework, rather than a series of entangled histories. In doing so, Manila is contextualized not merely as a Spanish settlement connected to New Spain via America, but instead within Southeast Asia, situated between the Chinese and the Sulú Seas, and located in the centre of commercial routes used by Armenian, Dutch, and Portuguese traders. This historical and geographical context is crucial to understanding later cultural dialogues. Urban planning, housing and architecture, and social networks in the city are also examined.

This book helps readers to internalize happiness, form a healthy opinion about this emotion, and detach it from external factors that can only cause temporary discomfort or delight. A group of expert authors considers happiness within three critical realms: internally, interactively, and work-related. Their thoughtful contributions approach happiness from a multiplicity of angles, and present a full spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives to consider, based on a wide range of circumstances, personal and professional. This companion will be valuable for researchers, students, and coaches, whether they seek input for future theory development, or motivation for performance in personal and professional life.",,,,,Joan Marques,,2020-10-15,2020,2020-10-15,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,3,1,,0.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131331501,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

The only way that can happen is if people with the money also start changing their minds …” From an interview with Ramolao Makhene “The quest for renewal reaches optimal levels when non-conformist, critical and even iconoclastic attitudes towards every form of ideological posturing and pretense are adopted.” Andries Walter Oliphant, Staffrider, Vol. 10, No. 2 (1992) Can South African theatre continue to maintain its autonomy and exercise its critical role? Can one rethink form and find new content? Can a concept of post-protest theatre be developed? How might theatre contribute to a post-apartheid society? These are just some of the questions addressed in this book. The real and present difficulties South African theatre is facing, as well as possible future orientations, are clearly shown, at one of the most complex moments of political transition in the history of South African society.

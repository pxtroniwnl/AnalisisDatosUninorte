Consequently, families frequently must provide care to individuals with TBI. Because they are rarely prepared for the associated demanding medical needs and financial burden, family caregivers are at risk for physical and emotional problems, which can negatively influence their individual and family functioning. Whereas scholars have examined the influence of survivor functioning on caregiver burden, few have explicitly recognized that caregiver burden also influences survivor functioning. Results of a multivariate linear regression suggest that, in a sample of 51 pairs of TBI survivors and their caregivers living in Colombia, survivors receiving care from a family member who reported a higher level of burden had poorer objective neuropsychological functioning than those receiving care from a family member who reported a lower level of burden, after controlling for survivor education and history of occupational therapy. Therefore, a family-focused approach might maximize intervention effectiveness, especially for Latin American and Hispanic families, which tend to be characterized by a strong sense of familism. The emphasis on family can create problems in a healthcare system that views the individual as the primary unit.",,,Neurorehabilitation,,Juan Carlos Arango-Lasprilla,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Brain Injuries; Caregivers; Cognition; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Surveys and Questionnaires",2012,2012,,2012,30,1,87-95,Closed,Article,"Lehan, Tara; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos; de los Reyes, Carlos José; Quijano, María Cristina","Lehan, Tara (Northcentral University, Prescott Valley, AZ, USA); Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos (Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA); de los Reyes, Carlos José (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Quijano, María Cristina (Department of Social Sciences, Pontificia University Javeriana of Cali, Cali, Colombia)",,"Lehan, Tara (Northcentral University); Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos (Virginia Commonwealth University); de los Reyes, Carlos José (Universidad del Norte); Quijano, María Cristina (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",44,6,1.57,7.43,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078521778,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,

DESIGN: Prospective.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one pairs of individuals with TBI and their caregivers from two major cities in Colombia completed a comprehensive psychosocial evaluation that included information related to patient and caregiver sociodemographic factors, patient factors, and caregiver estimation of patient neurobehavioral functioning.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview) and caregiver depression (PHQ-9).
RESULTS: Generalized linear models revealed that patient language problems and caregiver perception of patient functioning on six neurobehavioral domains were related to caregiver burden. Caregiver socioeconomic status and caregiver perception of patient functioning on six neurobehavioral domains were related to caregiver depression. These variables were then selected as candidates for the multiple regression models, which were fit separately for caregiver depression and burden, and revealed that caregivers' perception of patient depression was the only factor associated with both caregiver burden and depression.
CONCLUSION: Caregivers' perception of patient depression was the single best predictor of both caregiver burden and depression. Implications for treatment based on these preliminary findings are discussed.",,,Neurorehabilitation,,,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Brain Injuries; Caregivers; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Depression; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",2012,2012,,2012,31,4,443-52,Closed,Article,"Stevens, Lillian Flores; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos; Deng, Xiaoyan; Schaaf, Kathryn Wilder; De los Reyes Aragón, Carlos José; Quijano, María Cristina; Kreutzer, Jeffrey","Stevens, Lillian Flores (Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Adminstration Medical Center, Richmond, VA, USA); Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos (IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain); Deng, Xiaoyan (Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA); Schaaf, Kathryn Wilder (Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA); De los Reyes Aragón, Carlos José (Department of Psychology, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Quijano, María Cristina (Department of Social Sciences, Pontificia University Javeriana of Cali, Colombia); Kreutzer, Jeffrey (Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA)",,"Stevens, Lillian Flores (Heritage Valley Beaver); Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos (IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain); Deng, Xiaoyan (Virginia Commonwealth University); Schaaf, Kathryn Wilder (Virginia Commonwealth University); De los Reyes Aragón, Carlos José (Universidad del Norte); Quijano, María Cristina (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Kreutzer, Jeffrey (Virginia Commonwealth University)",15,1,0.79,2.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078659720,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,

HPV DNA is found in 47% to 48% of all penile tumors, and most of these cases correspond to high-risk genotypes, preferentially HPV-16. HPV status is associated with histologic subtype, with higher detection ratios in warty-basaloid carcinomas and lower detection ratios in keratinizing variants (ie, verrucous, papillary, and usual squamous cell carcinomas). It is the cell type, rather than a distinctive architecture, that is more strongly associated with HPV presence. The detection ratio is higher in tumors composed entirely or partially of cells with basaloid features. In addition, a few studies have evaluated the impact of HPV infection on the prognosis of patients with penile cancer. However, results are controversial, and more data are needed to clarify this matter. A proper understanding of the role of HPV in penile carcinogenesis might help in planning intervention strategies such as vaccination against HPV infection.",,,Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology,,,"Carcinoma, Basosquamous; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; DNA, Viral; Human papillomavirus 16; Humans; Male; Papillomavirus Infections; Penile Neoplasms",2012-05,2012,,2012-05,29,2,67-71,Closed,Article,"Chaux, Alcides; Cubilla, Antonio L.","Chaux, Alcides (Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Universidad del Norte School of Medicine, Asunción, Paraguay); Cubilla, Antonio L.

METHODS: Tissue microarrays were built from 19 normal adrenal medullas, 39 primary pheochromocytomas, and 8 unrelated metastatic pheochromocytomas. In 2 of the 8 cases of metastatic pheochromocytoma tissues, samples from the primary tumor were available. The expression levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated S6, p27, and c-myc were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and p27 were greater in the nontumor tissue than in the primary and metastatic pheochromocytomas. Increasing levels of phosphorylated Akt were noted in the nontumor adrenal medulla, primary pheochromocytomas, and metastatic pheochromocytomas. Finally, the levels of phosphorylated S6 were greater in the metastatic pheochromocytomas than in the nontumor adrenal medulla and primary pheochromocytomas.
CONCLUSION: We found evidence of dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in primary and metastatic pheochromocytomas, with increased phosphorylated S6 and phosphorylated Akt, and decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog and p27 expression levels. Because the currently available treatment modalities are less than optimal, our findings lend additional support to continuing to explore the utility of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway-targeted therapy for pheochromocytomas.",,,Urology,,,Adolescent; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; Pheochromocytoma; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Young Adult,2012-06-13,2012,2012-06-13,2012-09,80,3,736.e7-736.e12,Closed,Article,"Chaux, Alcides; Brimo, Fadi; Gonzalez-Roibon, Nilda; Shah, Smit; Schultz, Luciana; Rizk, Jean-Marc; Argani, Pedram; Hicks, Jessica; Netto, George J.","Chaux, Alcides (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD; Department of Urology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Universidad del Norte School of Medicine, Asuncion, Paraguay); Brimo, Fadi (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD; Department of Urology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Universidad del Norte School of Medicine, Asuncion, Paraguay; Department of Pathology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Gonzalez-Roibon, Nilda (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD); Shah, Smit (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD); Schultz, Luciana (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD); Rizk, Jean-Marc (Department of Pathology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Argani, Pedram (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD); Hicks, Jessica (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD); Netto, George J.

6528,pub.1058165803,10.1068/p7214,23469703,,Male Facial Anthropometry and Attractiveness,"The symmetry and masculinity of the face are often considered important elements of male facial attractiveness. However, facial preferences are rarely studied on natural faces. We studied the effect of these traits and facial metric parameters on facial attractiveness in Spanish and Colombian raters. In total, 13 metric and 11 asymmetry parameters from natural, unmanipulated frontal face photographs of 50 Spanish men were measured with the USIA semiautomatic anthropometric software. All raters (women and men) were asked to rank these images as potential long-term partners for females. In both sexes, facial attractiveness was negatively associated with facial masculinity, and preference was not associated with facial symmetry. In Spanish raters, both sexes preferred male traits that were larger in the right side of the face, which may reflect a human tendency to prefer a certain degree of facial asymmetry. We did not find such preference in Colombian raters, but they did show stronger preference for facial femininity than Spanish raters. Present results suggest that facial relative femininity, which is expected to signal, eg good parenting and cooperation skills, may be an important signal of mate quality when females seek long-term partners. Facial symmetry appears unimportant in such long-term mating preferences.",,,Perception,,,"Adolescent; Association; Beauty; Cephalometry; Colombia; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cues; Face; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Judgment; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Spain; Young Adult",2012-01-01,2012,2012-01-01,2012-10,41,10,1234-1245,Closed,Article,"Soler, Carles; Kekäläinen, Jukka; Núñez, Manuel; Sancho, María; Núñez, Javier; Yaber, Iván; Gutiérrez, Ricardo","Soler, Carles (Department of Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, University of Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Spain); Kekäläinen, Jukka (Department of Biology, University of Eastern Finland, PO Box 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland); Núñez, Manuel (Department of Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, University of Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Spain); Sancho, María (Department of Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, University of Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Spain); Núñez, Javier (Department of Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, University of Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Spain); Yaber, Iván (Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena, Colombia); Gutiérrez, Ricardo (Department of Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, University of Valencia, 46100 Burjassot, Spain; Departamento de Química y Biología, División de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Soler, Carles (University of Valencia)","Soler, Carles (University of Valencia); Kekäläinen, Jukka (University of Eastern Finland); Núñez, Manuel (University of Valencia); Sancho, María (University of Valencia); Núñez, Javier (University of Valencia); Yaber, Iván (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Gutiérrez, Ricardo (University of Valencia; Universidad del Norte)",15,1,0.26,1.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058165803,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Thirty-one individuals with TBI and 61 healthy controls completed the SF-36, a self-report HRQoL measure composed of eight component areas: physical health problems, pain, role limitations due to physical problems or due to emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue and general health perceptions.
RESULTS: The samples were statistically similar with respect to age, gender and education and statistically different with respect to depression, SES, social support and cognition. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with TBI had significantly lower means on all SF-36 sub-scales. However, after adjusting for depression, SES, social support and cognitive performance, significant differences remained on three of the SF-36 sub-scales. Specifically, individuals with TBI had lower adjusted means on Role-Physical (p-value < 0.005), Role-Emotional (p-value < 0.005) and Bodily Pain (p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Even after controlling for depression, SES, social support and cognitive performance, individuals with TBI living in Barranquilla Colombia report having poorer quality of life across various domains, including Role-Physical, Role-Emotional and Bodily Pain.

In the former (warty and basaloid SCC), there is a predominance of undifferentiated basaloid cells. In the latter (eg, usual, papillary, and verrucous SCC), the predominant cell is larger with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Based on these morphologic features, a new term, ""penile intraepithelial neoplasia"" (PeIN), was proposed. PeIN was further subclassified into differentiated and undifferentiated, with the latter being subdivided into basaloid, warty, and warty-basaloid subtypes. Macroscopically, PeIN subtypes are indistinguishable. Microscopically, differentiated PeIN is characterized by acanthosis, parakeratosis, enlarged keratinocytes with abundant ""pink"" cytoplasm (abnormal maturation), and hyperchromatic cells in the basal layer. In basaloid PeIN the epithelium is replaced by a monotonous population of uniform, small, round, and basophilic cells. Warty PeIN is characterized by a spiky surface, prominent atypical parakeratosis, and pleomorphic koilocytosis. Warty-basaloid PeIN show features of both warty and basaloid PeIN. There is a significant association of subtypes of PeIN with specific variants of invasive SCCs. This is a simple and reproducible nomenclature for penile precancerous lesions based on cell type and differentiation. It takes into account the similarities between vulvar and penile pathology and the hypothesis of a bimodal pathway of penile cancer progression.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank Jeong S.

Although the diagnosis and classification of penile tumors is straightforward in most cases, a few entities are problematic, especially to pathologists from countries in which penile cancer is rarely encountered. The differential diagnosis of squamous hyperplasias from differentiated penile intraepithelial neoplasia or from extremely low-grade invasive neoplasms (eg, pseudohyperplastic and verrucous carcinomas) may be particularly difficult. Similarly, given the morphologic features shared by all verruciform tumors (ie, verrucous, warty, papillary, and cuniculatum carcinomas, along with giant condylomas), it is challenging at times to distinguish one from another. At the other end of the spectrum, because of their lack of differentiation, it is sometimes difficult to classify high-grade carcinomas, such as basaloid and sarcomatoid, which may have etiologic/prognostic implications. Penile mixed tumors, harboring more than 1 histologic subtype and grade, constitute a frequent finding in routine pathology. The recognition of distinctive morphologic patterns and histologic grades in these tumors is important because these features could be related to etiologic factors, such as human papillomavirus infection, or they could influence outcome. Penile tumors with glandular features (eg, adenosquamous and mucoepidermoid carcinomas), although rare, may be confused with the more common pseudoglandular (adenoid, acantholytic) variant of squamous cell carcinomas, their main mimicker. In this review we provide clues that may help in the differential diagnosis of these lesions.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Sharon Blackburn, graphic designer, from the Pathology Photography and Graphic Arts, Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD), for her outstanding diagrams of verruciform tumors.

To estimate the likelihood of this event, investigators have combined pathologic features of the primary tumor in the form of stratification systems. In this article we review 3 such systems (Solsona et al, J Urol 2001;165:1506; Hungerhuber et al, Urology 68:621, 2006; and Chaux et al, Am J Surg Pathol 2009;33:1049) built upon histologic grade, extent and depth of tumor invasion, and perineural invasion. We evaluate their usefulness, limitations, and possible implications for the management of patients with penile cancer. We also provide clues for the proper identification and interpretation of these pathologic features. Inguinal metastases were observed in 64% to 83% of patients in high-risk groups, 20% to 33% of intermediate groups, and 0% to 8% of low-risk groups. The results of these studies suggest that patients in high-risk groups could benefit from prophylactic bilateral groin dissection. In addition, patients in low-risk groups might be managed by surveillance alone. Finally, the authors suggest that additional approaches, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, should be used for the intermediate-risk group. The identification of other pathologic features, such as vascular and perineural invasion, could tip the scales in problematic or paradoxical cases. The fate of these risk groups would be better defined by the identification of molecular biomarkers and genetic profiling.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Sharon Blackburn, Graphic Designer, from the Pathology Photography and Graphic Arts, Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD), for her outstanding diagram of the penile anatomical levels.",,Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology,,,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Penile Neoplasms; Prognosis; Risk Assessment",2012-05,2012,,2012-05,29,2,83-89,Closed,Article,"Chaux, Alcides; Cubilla, Antonio L.","Chaux, Alcides (Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Universidad del Norte School of Medicine, Asunción, Paraguay); Cubilla, Antonio L.

METHODS: Clinical evaluation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), 4-variable Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI), and erosions were recorded in 1,093 patients with early RA (<1 year from onset). Multivariate analyses evaluated influences of sex, age, marital status, education, medical coverage, SES, and ethnicity on HAQ DI, DAS28-ESR, and presence of erosions.
RESULTS: Ethnicities included 43% Mestizo, 31% Caucasian, 19% African LA, 4% Amerindian, and 3% other. Fifty-eight percent were of low/low-middle SES, 42% had <8 years of education, 21% had no medical coverage, median disease duration was 6 months (25th, 75th percentiles 4, 9 months), median HAQ DI score was 1.25 (25th, 75th percentiles 0.63, 2.00), median DAS28-ESR score was 6.2 (25th, 75th percentiles 4.9, 7.2), and 25% had erosions. Women and Mestizos, African LA, and Amerindians had earlier onset than men or Caucasians (P < 0.01). When adjusted by country, the analysis of covariance model showed that low/low-middle SES, female sex, partial coverage, and older age were associated with worse HAQ DI scores; only low/low-middle SES was associated with higher DAS28 scores. Statistically significant differences were found in HAQ DI and DAS28 scores between countries. When excluding country, low/low-middle SES, female sex, and no coverage were associated with worse HAQ DI and DAS28 scores, whereas separated/divorced/widowed status was associated with worse HAQ DI scores and age was associated with worse DAS28 scores. Logistic regression showed that older age, no coverage, and the Amerindian and other ethnic groups were associated with erosions.
CONCLUSION: We compared early RA patients from the main LA ethnic groups. Our findings suggest that low/low-middle SES is important in determining disease activity.

In recent years several variants, each with distinctive clinicopathologic features, have been described. Pseudohyperplastic carcinoma and carcinoma cuniculatum are both low-grade, extremely well-differentiated SCC variants characterized by an indolent clinical course and good prognosis. The former, which may be confused with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, preferentially affects the inner foreskin mucosa of elderly men and the latter is a verruciform tumor with an endophytic, burrow-like pattern of growth. Pseudoglandular carcinoma (featuring solid tumor nests with extensive central acantholysis simulating glandular lumina) and clear cell carcinoma (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related tumors composed of periodic acid-Schiff positive clear cells) are aggressive tumors with a high incidence of inguinal nodal metastases. Papillary carcinomas are HPV-unrelated verruciform tumors composed of complex papillae with acanthosis, hyper- and parakeratosis, absence of koilocytes, irregular fibrovascular cores, and jagged tumor base. Finally, in warty-basaloid carcinomas areas of warty (condylomatous) and basaloid carcinomas coexist in the same tumor, either separated or intermingled, giving the tumor a variegated appearance.

Recent studies of our group have shown that increases in morbidity, aggressiveness, and proliferative activity of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), especially clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), in Ukrainian patients continuously inhabiting the radio-contaminated areas could be explained by specific molecular changes influenced by the so-called “chronic persistent low-dose ionizing radiation” (CPLDIR) exposure. This study aimed to examine the role of angiogenesis in CCRCC carcinogenesis associated with CPLDIR in patients living more than 20 years in cesium 137 (137Cs) contaminated areas after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine. Paraffin-embedded specimens of 106 CCRCs were studied: Control cases were 18 tumors from Spanish patients (group 1), 25 tumors from Ukrainian patients from so-called clean areas without known radio-contamination (group 2), and 63 tumors from Ukrainian patients from radio-contaminated areas (group 3). For intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) determination, anti-CD31 antibody was used. A computerized image analysis program was used to quantitatively calculate the vascular density. Seventy-three percent of group 3 and 72 % of group 2 CCRCCs displayed the highest MVD. A striking increase in MVD was seen in group 3 CCRCCs, in comparison with groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.001). The majority of the hot spot vessels in group 3 was poorly differentiated. Moreover, MVD values for total vessels as well as for capillaries and tumor grade were strongly correlated. When we compared only tumor–node–metastasis tumor stages I and II, the differences remained statistically significant (p < 0.1). The ratio of the average total vessels and capillaries in the Ukrainian groups combined was 1.65:1 in comparison to the Spanish group. Our results provide evidence that CPLDIR exposure increases MVD (particularly capillary) in CCRCCs and is associated with a higher histological grade.",,,Virchows Archiv,,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Capillaries; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Cesium Radioisotopes; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Microvessels; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced; Radiation, Ionizing; Spain; Ukraine",2012-05-13,2012,2012-05-13,2012-06,460,6,611-619,Closed,Article,"Romanenko, A.

METHODS: A Delphi consensus method with a group of 12 international experts was used to identify the different causes that prompt TF and to propose an algorithm to analyze reports of suspected lack of efficacy of medicines. A pilot analysis of 50 reports was the basis to evaluate the interrater and intrarater validity of the algorithm.
RESULTS: A 10-question algorithm was proposed. The evaluation of 50 reports of suspected TF showed that only 8% could be actually attributed to a manufacturing quality problem, whereas the real reason underlying the alleged TF was the inappropriate use of the prescribed drug in 28%. Minimum information to attribute the cause to a TF was lacking in 31% of these reports. The interrater reliability was ""moderate"" (kappa coefficient = 0.55), and the intrarater reliability ranged from 0.732 to 0.908 (""substantial"" to ""almost perfect"").
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed TF algorithm is a valid, reliable, and reproducible analysis tool that can help to disentangle the frequent and complex reports of suspected TF.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank the National University of Colombia and the entire collaborating group at the Research Group Latin America (Durg‐LA) for their valuable contributions and participation in the validation processes: Mariano Madurga, Mabel Valsecia, Verónica Vergara, Alejandro Goyret, Lily Gordillo, Álvaro Vallejos, Bárbara Gerena, Claudia Santucci, Beatriz Cardoso, and Sandra Torres.

HCRFs are discriminative graphical models that are attractive for this problem because they (1) exploit the temporal structure of EEG; (2) include latent variables that can be used to model different brain states in the signal; and (3) involve learned statistical models matched to the classification task, avoiding some of the limitations of generative models. Our approach involves spatial filtering of the EEG signals and estimation of power spectra based on autoregressive modeling of temporal segments of the EEG signals. Given this time-frequency representation, we select certain frequency bands that are known to be associated with execution of motor tasks. These selected features constitute the data that are fed to the HCRF, parameters of which are learned from training data. Inference algorithms on the HCRFs are used for the classification of motor tasks. We experimentally compare this approach to the best performing methods in BCI competition IV as well as a number of more recent methods and observe that our proposed method yields better classification accuracy.","This work was partially supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey under grant 111E056, Sabanci University Internal grant IACF-11-00889 and by a Turkish Academy of Sciences Distinguished Young Scientist Award.",,Journal of Neural Engineering,,,"Algorithms; Artifacts; Artificial Intelligence; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Humans; Imagination; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Normal Distribution; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; User-Computer Interface",2012-03-14,2012,2012-03-14,2012-04-01,9,2,026020,Closed,Article,"Saa, Jaime F Delgado; Çetin, Müjdat","Saa, Jaime F Delgado (Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory, Sabanci University, Orhanli, Tuzla, 34956 Istanbul, Turkey; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Çetin, Müjdat (Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory, Sabanci University, Orhanli, Tuzla, 34956 Istanbul, Turkey)",,"Saa, Jaime F Delgado (Sabancı University; Universidad del Norte); Çetin, Müjdat (Sabancı University)",42,4,0.48,5.53,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009298503,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3208 Medical Physiology; 40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

Estimates in adult population are uncommon. We determined the burden of disease associated with pneumococcus in adults in Colombia in year 2008.
METHODOLOGY: Using different data sources (official mortality records, medical databases, published literature and local epidemiological data) we estimated prevalence, incidence, mortality and disability due to bacterial pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and bacteremia of any cause for year 2008, and the fraction of these that can be attributed to S. pneumoniae.
RESULTS: A total of 63,463 DALYs are lost due to S. pneumoniae in Colombians age 15 or over. Most of this burden (51,848 DALYs, 81.7%) is due to pneumonia, followed by meningitis (9241 DALYs, 14.6%). The three conditions, overall, represent 2.03 DALYs per 1000 Colombians in that age range.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lower incidence of pneumococcal disease in adults, as compared with children, its burden is still significant, comparable to that of schizophrenia or epilepsy.

The aim was to see whether nouns such as orgy or genocide affect the well-established preference of Spanish to adjoin the relative clause high in the tree (to servant instead of actress in the example above). We manipulated the valence and arousal of the lexical entities residing in the NP. Our results indicate that (a) the inclusion of either pleasant or unpleasant words induces changes in the usual NP1 preference found in Spanish; (b) the effects of high-arousal words are especially clear, in that they pull RC adjunction towards the NP where they are located, be it the NP1 or the NP2; and (c) in the context of sentence production, these kinds of words seem intense enough to promote changes in (and even reverse) a solid syntactic bias.

It is known to persist in the environment and can cause serious health problems. One of the strategies adopted to remove lindane from the environment is bioremediation using microorganisms. Immobilized cells present advantages over free suspended cells, like their high degradation efficiency and protection against toxins. The aims of this work were: (1) To evaluate the ability of Streptomyces strains immobilized in four different matrices to remove lindane, (2) To select the support with optimum lindane removal by pure cultures, (3) To assay the selected support with consortia and (4) To evaluate the reusability of the immobilized cells. Four Streptomyces sp. strains had previously shown their ability to grow in the presence of lindane. Lindane removal by microorganisms immobilized was significantly higher than in free cells. Specifically immobilized cells in cloth sachets showed an improvement of around 25% in lindane removal compared to the abiotic control. Three strains showed significantly higher microbial growth when they were entrapped in silicone tubes. Strains immobilized in PVA-alginate demonstrated lowest growth. Mixed cultures immobilized inside cloth sachets showed no significant enhancement compared to pure cultures, reaching a maximum removal of 81% after 96 h for consortium I, consisting of the four immobilized strains together. Nevertheless, the cells could be reused for two additional cycles of 96 h each, obtaining a maximum removal efficiency of 71.5% when each of the four strains was immobilized in a separate bag (consortium III).","AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by Consejo de Investigaciones de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (CIUNT), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT) and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET).

The adverse effects of altitude on fetal growth can be prevented by the administration of antioxidant vitamins, but the mechanisms responsible are not well known. The maintenance of a viable pregnancy depends largely on adequate placental steroidogenesis, especially in the last two-thirds of pregnancy. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the effect of antioxidant vitamins (C and E) on plasma concentrations of progesterone and 17β-oestradiol during the last two-thirds of high-altitude pregnancies in ewes both native and naïve to the high-altitude environment. In addition, pregnancy outcomes were evaluated by determining the bodyweight of newborn lambs. Sex steroid patterns differed between ewes with and without vitamin supplementation. Concentrations of plasma progesterone and 17β-oestradiol were significantly higher in the supplemented groups from approximately 40 days before parturition until near term. Newborn weights were significantly lower in animals not adapted to the higher altitude, and vitamin supplementation prevented this decrease. In conclusion, the administration of antioxidant vitamins in the present study enhanced placental steroidogenesis, thus favouring fetal development in pregnancies developing at high altitudes.","The authors thank Ms Macarena Roa, Paulina Campos and Paz Mocarquer for technical assistance during animal sampling and Mr Gabino Llusco for his assistance with animal care.

Prevalence of the 21 primary serovars against Leptospira interrogans was determined using the microagglutination test. Individuals were considered positive for a given serovar if antibodies were observable at a 1:100 dilution or greater. Overall prevalence was 9.52%, with positive titers to serovar hurstbridge in Carnivora (Canidae); serovar sarmin in Primata (Atelidae); and serovars australis, mini, autumnalis, pomona, icterohaemorrhagiae, and seramanga in Primata (Cebidae). Prevalence was positively correlated with humidity and temperature, with significantly higher prevalence at the site characterized by high humidity, severe flooding because of rainfall, and warm weather throughout the year. All positive animals were classified as clinically asymptomatic, meaning that antibodies from a current or past infection were detected but no overt symptoms were apparent. The diversity of serovars observed and the taxon-specific nature of these associations suggest that the epidemiology of Leptospira transmission is likely to be complex and multidimensional. The strong association observed between prevalence and climate suggests that the important role of climate as an indicator of Leptospira infection risk in humans may also be applicable to wildlife. Future studies in both wild and captive populations of Neotropical wildlife will further elucidate this disease interplay.","We thank the directors (who wish to remain anonymous) of the Zoos AD for permission to conduct this research.

More than 90% of varicella cases occur in childhood. The aim of this study was to gather all relevant information on epidemiology and resource use in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2000.
METHODS: Epidemiologic studies published since 2000 with at least 50 cases of varicella or herpes zoster, or at least 10 cases of congenital disease were included. Gray literature was also searched. Outcomes included incidence, admission rate, mortality and case-fatality ratio. Use of resources and both direct and indirect costs associated were extracted.
RESULTS: From the 495 records identified, 23 were included in the meta-analysis to report varicella-zoster virus outcomes and 3 in the herpes zoster analysis. The global pooled varicella incidence in subjects under 15 years of age was 42.9 cases per 1000 individuals per year (95% confidence interval: 26.9-58.9); children under 5 years of age were the most affected. Pooled general admission rate was 3.5 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval: 2.9-4.1) and median hospitalization was 5-9 days. The most common varicella complications reported in studies were skin infections (3-61%), followed by respiratory infections (0-15%) and neurologic problems (1-5%). Direct costs averaged (2011/international dollar [I$]) $2040 per admission (range, I$ 298-5369) and I$70 per clinical visit (range, 11-188 I$).

The proposal is presented as a framework based on the layers programming paradigm. The main purpose of the algorithm is the solution of the load balancing distribution problem in systems highly congested by clients. The proposal is compared with the well-known Even Distribution for distributed systems. The comparison is made with performance metrics such as the processing time and the number of lost clients.

Causes of this variation are not clear, but they are thought to be related to human papillomavirus infection, smoking, lack of circumcision, chronic inflammation, and poor genital hygiene. Most penile tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, and a variegated spectrum of distinct morphologies is currently recognized. Each one of these subtypes has distinctive pathologic and clinical features. About half of penile carcinomas are usual squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest corresponds to verrucous, warty, basaloid, warty-basaloid, papillary, pseudohyperplastic, pseudoglandular, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, and cuniculatum carcinomas. Previous studies have found a consistent association of tumor cell morphology and human papillomavirus presence in penile carcinomas. Those tumors composed of small- to intermediate-sized, basaloid (""blue"") cells are often human papillomavirus positive, whereas human papillomavirus prevalence is lower in tumors showing large, keratinizing, maturing eosinophilic (""pink"") cells. Human papillomavirus-related tumors affect younger patients, whereas human papillomavirus-unrelated tumors are seen in older patients with phimosis, lichen sclerosus, or squamous hyperplasia. This morphologic distinctiveness is also observed in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The specific aim of this review is to provide a detailed discussion on the macroscopic and microscopic features of all major subtypes of penile cancer. We also discuss the role of pathologic features in the prognosis of penile cancer, the characteristics of penile precursor lesions, and the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of invasive and precursor lesions.",,,Human Pathology,,,Carcinoma; Humans; Male; Penile Neoplasms,2012-06,2012,,2012-06,43,6,771-789,Closed,Article,"Chaux, Alcides; Cubilla, Antonio L.","Chaux, Alcides (Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA; Instituto de Patología e Investigación, Martin Brizuela 325, Asunción, Paraguay 1617; Universidad del Norte School of Medicine, Gral.

In the present study, the performance of an airlift (ALR) (with a centric-tube column) and a bubble column (BC) photobioreactors were compared considering Nannochloropsis sp. growth. The experiments were carried out keeping average light intensity, temperature, volume culture, and CO2 supply constant, while cell concentration and pH level were measured and examined. Furthermore, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in cfx, ansys 11.0, was developed using a multiphase flow model with an Eulerian approach to evaluate the hydrodynamic behavior of both systems. The results showed that a higher cell concentration (375 × 105 cell/ml) was obtained in the airlift PBR yielding a better growth rate than the bubble column PBR. In terms of hydrodynamic performance, the existence of the centric-tube in the airlift system shows a well-defined flow pattern, better light distribution cycle, and more effective mixing. These hydrodynamic characteristic of the airlift PBR may allow a better yield for the microalgae biomass production.","The authors want to acknowledge UNINORTE for the support obtained from the YOUNG RESEARCHER projects: “Diseño de fotobiorreactor solar capaz de modular la radiación fotónica incidente sobre la biomasa, para la optimización de los niveles de producción de aceite de microalgas en la región Caribe Colombiana” and “Modelación y simulación con CFD del flujo de biomasa en un sistema biológico para el cultivo de microalgas” and to the Aquaculture Research Institute CENIACUA for contributing with their facilities and personnel to carry out the microalgae cultivation.

The research reported here aimed to describe the experiences of a group of Irish injecting drug users, who were injecting mephedrone based headshop products prior to the introduction of legislative controls in Ireland, with particular focus on pre- and post-legislative use, effects of injecting mephedrone, settings and contexts for injecting, polydrug use and serial drug injecting, risk perceptions and harm reduction practises.
METHODS: Following a predevelopment phase with a Privileged Access Interviewer, in-depth interviews using a phenomenological approach were conducted with eleven attendees of a low threshold harm reduction service.
RESULTS: The findings describe the abuse potential of these mephedrone based headshop products when used by intravenous injection. Although participants were aware of risks and safe injecting practises, compulsive re injecting with excessive binge use over long periods of time was common. Nasal to injection route transitions, intense paranoia, violent behaviour and aggression, emergence of Parkinson type symptomatologies (in the form of spasms and 'wobbling'), and permanent numbness in lower extremities were reported. Multi and serial drug injecting with heroin was used in efforts to manage the intense rush and avoid unpleasant comedown. Participants reported limb abscesses, vein clotting, damage and recession resulting from product toxicity, crystallisation of the products when diluted and flushing practises. Seven participants were homeless, with groin and street injecting common. Following legislative changes use of mephedrone products declined due to closure of headshops, increased street prices, concerns around contamination and the emergence of new street stimulant drugs.
CONCLUSION: Continued monitoring of drug displacement patterns in post legislative time frames is advised, alongside longitudinal ethnographic research to track the diffusion of mephedrone and other cathinone derivatives within injecting networks. Further investigation of the adverse health consequences of these drugs on injection is warranted.",AcknowledgementThe research was funded by the Irish Needle Exchange Forum.

Significant erosion was observed (>3% of the initial area) as a result of the morphodynamic imbalance of the insular system. The Grande, Rosario, and Tesoro Islands have lost 6.7%, 8.2%, and 48.7% of their territory, respectively. Data indicate an inverse relationship between the size of the island and the magnitude of the erosion. Erosive processes were detected along ∼85% of coastline exposed directly to NNE–NE waves. The erosive activity on the archipelago has been constant for the last 50 years as consequence of continual wave action and rising sea levels. However, anthropogenic intervention has caused significant changes to the geomorphologic setting of the coast, which creates different morphologic outputs for the erosive processes.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors express their gratitude to the directors of CIOH and the PNNCRSB, Mr. CN Esteban Uribe Alzate and Mr. TN Mario Cabezas, respectively, for their strong support of this project and to Olga Cabrales, Luis Aurelio Martínez, Angélica Mejía, Enovaldo Herrera and Juan David Santana for their contributions and support during the field phase.

2975,pub.1092820124,10.1115/es2012-91297,,,CFD Simulation of Multiphase Flow in an Airlift Column Photobioreactor for the Cultivation of Microalgae,"Due to their better operational advantages, such as good scalability, operational flexibility, high mass and heat transfer characteristics, homogenous shear stress, good mixing and better control over fluid circulation, airlift column photobioreactors (PBR) have become a promising design alternative for microalgae culture, among bubble column and other types of photobioreactors. The good hydrodynamic environment for fragile microorganisms in airlift columns have led to numerous investigations in order to understand the hydrodynamic phenomena of multiphase flow, particularly gas-liquid, inside this type of PBR. In the present paper, a CFD (Computer Fluid Dynamics) simulation in CFX, ANSYS Inc. 11.0, is developed following a multiphase flow model with an Eulerian-Eulerian approach. For evaluating turbulence, the modified k–ε model is chosen. Gas holdup, gas superficial velocity and liquid velocity profiles for different heights column are obtained by varying air volumetric flow rates at 2, 5 and 8 L/min. Also gas holdup, gas superficial velocity and liquid velocity contours are obtained for a sequence of five step times. An experimental video validation to compare the multiphase flow behavior has been made with a high-resolution video camera. The experiments are carried out by using an airlift column photobioreactor with air supply by a porous sparger. The profiles of the hydrodynamic variables made for 5 different column heights show that the trends of gas holdup and gas superficial velocity are very similar and do not depend on the variation of inlet air flow. For the liquid velocity profiles, the trends don’t show the same behavior, the profiles at lower heights are off-centered and less symmetric and the maximum velocities are reached at h = 0.2 m. The time sequences with the variable contours are made to enhance the visualization and understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior, especially when air supply begins and the bubble plume starts to form.Copyright © 2012 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2012 6th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A and B",,,2012-07-23,2012,2013-07-23,2012-07-23,,,1253-1262,Closed,Proceeding,"García, Samira; Paternina, Edgardo; Pupo, Oscar R.; Bula, Antonio; Acuña, Francisco","García, Samira (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Paternina, Edgardo (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia); Pupo, Oscar R.

2871,pub.1052778053,10.1007/s11069-012-0337-8,,,Severe tornadoes on the Caribbean coast of Colombia since 2001 and their relation to local climate conditions,"Tornadoes have been reported in various places around the world. The United States has the greatest number of tornado reports. In South America, tornadoes have been reported in Argentina and neighboring countries, such as Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay. There are no reports of tornadoes in Colombia in the worldwide databases. The first reported tornado event in Colombia took place in 2001. Since then, four tornados have affected the northern part of Colombia. The aim of this study is to characterize the events reported on the Caribbean coast of Colombia and their relation to local climate conditions. Before 2001, we had no knowledge regarding tornadoes in this area. However, during the past 10 years, these atmospheric phenomena have occurred in Barranquilla and the surrounding metropolitan area. Worldwide databases on tornadoes have not registered any such events in this part of South America. A review of the atmospheric information was conducted to determine the influence of air temperature increases on tornado formation. This study reveals that tornadoes have appeared between May and September, the months during which the city experiences the hottest temperatures of the year. The most significant tornado took place on September 15, 2006. This tornado lasted 15 min and travelled almost 10 km. Of the four registered tornadoes, this was the only one to affect the residential area of the city. The other three affected only the suburbs located in the surrounding metropolitan area. The most recent phenomenon related with tornadoes took place between July and August of 2010, during which three tornadoes could have potentially formed. However, a vortex never made contact with the ground. This meteorological analysis is very basic because climate information for these areas is limited. Still, what information we have reveals conditions that are typical of tornado formation: a mass of cold air combined with high air temperatures in a specific area. The data analysis reveals that tornados have occurred between May and June. These months correspond to the period characterized by the highest temperatures: average temperatures of 28.2 °C and maximum temperatures of 33.2 °C. This is also the period characterized by the greatest relative humidity and precipitation (84 % and 50 mm, respectively). Because the tornadoes reports only appeared in the last 10 years, it is not possible to determine whether there is a realistic relationship between their occurrence and large-scale climatic change. This article characterizes tornadoes as a new environmental threat and not an isolated phenomenon for this part of Colombia. Tornadoes in this region should thus be included in global databases.","The authors would like to give thanks to Carlos Ortiz, Professor of social sciences, for the information he provided, to the El Heraldo daily newspaper of the city of Barranquilla, and to the Office of Research and Projects (DIDI) at the Universidad del Norte.",,Natural Hazards,,,,2012-08-12,2012,2012-08-12,2012-11,64,2,1805-1821,Closed,Article,"Ortiz-Royero, J.

From observations, interviews and official records, it was learned that they were people of few resources who had been made aware of this alternative method of resolution being offered to them without charge. They learned that they could expect resolution within a short time and that the Act of Agreement was binding. Some of the participants heard about conciliation from someone who had participated; others were informed in public education campaigns. Participants may have come to the House of Justice or city offices for another mandatory service, such as updating their ID cards, and learned about conciliation while they were waiting. For example, while renewing her ID, a mother might learn that she was eligible for child support, and she could request conciliation in order to have a formal hearing about it. Another might find out that she could get some assistance with separating from her former partner and making sure she did not lose her house, her goods, or her money.

Mining, smelting, agriculture, and fossil-fuel combustion are known to have contributed to Pb pollution in lakes of other regions. Few studies, however, have examined Pb sequestered in lakes of the southeastern USA, particulary peninsular Florida, which is subject to less continental atmospheric influence than other regions of the eastern USA. We obtained sediment cores from Little Lake Jackson and Little Lake Bonnet in Highlands County, Florida and used Pb isotopes in the records to identify principal sources of Pb contamination. The sediment records showed that changes in Pb concentration and isotope ratios correspond temporally with gasoline consumption in the USA, as well as with changes in lead ores used to produce leaded gasoline. Lead concentrations in the study lakes showed temporal variations that were similar to those found in peat records from east-central Florida. Isotope trends were similar to the mean USA atmospheric Pb deposition record, and to Pb isotope records from Bermuda and Atlantic corals. We modeled the isotopic composition of the anthropogenic Pb in lake sediments and found that the overall trend is controlled by Pb that was released during leaded gasoline combustion. There is, however, additional Pb at each site that comes from sources that are not fully represented by the natural, background Pb. Lead isotope ratios and Pb/arsenic (As) ratios provide evidence that Pb deposition in lakes during the middle 1900s might have been influenced by lead arsenate applications to golf courses, a source that is often ignored in Pb isotope studies. Isotope evidence confirms, however, that following cessation of commercial lead arsenate use in the 1960s, atmospheric alkyl lead was again the primary influence on Pb in sediments of the study lakes.","Funding for this project was provided in part by a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR grant to the University of South Florida—St. Petersburg.

Results show that the testbed has propagation characteristics difficult to reproduce in testbeds present in the literature. Experiments demonstrate testbed performance regarding path loss, average packet loss and number of duplicates. Despite poor performance of links in the network, percentage of successful packet reception in the sink node was 70%, using a controlled flooding protocol with 8 nodes. Testbed implemented is a real scenario for WSN applications where nodes are deployed randomly to cover a determined area.

Investigating the collapse of the Puerto Colombia pier (Colombian Caribbean Coast) in March 2009: methodology for the reconstruction of extreme events and the evaluation of their impact on the coastal infrastructure. On March 7, 2009, a 200-m section of the Puerto Colombia pier collapsed when a cold front passed through the Atlntico Department of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. Herein, the most important meteo-marine event of the last 10 years in the Colombian Caribbean area was reconstructed using SWAN software and the WAVEWATCH III global wave model, which uses wind fields as input. The modeling method involved a nested grid approach for wave generation and propagation in a particular sector of the central Caribbean coast of Colombia. To validate the numerical model, the time series for the event generated using modeling data was compared with the recorded wave data from two buoys: buoy 42058, which is located in the Caribbean Sea and operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and buoy 41194, which is located near the Magdalena River mouth and operated by the General Maritime Directorate (DIMAR). The simulation results were incorporated into the CMS-Wave and CMS-Flow models for reconstruction of the cold-front event. The modeling results were also compared with previously reported data for the waves generated by hurricanes Joan (1988) and Lenny (1999). The results revealed that the analyzed study area was more heavily affected by the ocean conditions than the 2009 cold front event produced compared with conditions produced by other hurricanes that have affected the Colombian Caribbean coast. The findings also indicate that the proposed methodology, which utilizes several wave propagation models, produces results that adequately characterize the processes in deep, intermediate, and shallow waters.","The authors thank the Research, Development, and Innovation Office of the Universidad del Norte (Direccin de Investigacin, Desarrollo e Innovacin de la Universidad del Norte) for its support in the completion of this research.

As plants become more instrumented, more data is available for fault detection applications, if they are capable of demonstrate anticipation and low false alarm rates. A regional Natural Gas transportation system deals with these types of drawbacks. While the improvements are carried out, some effort should be done in order to improve the safety in operations. In this paper a data-driven technique was used to detect fault conditions along the pipeline, sectioning it in five partitions to increase the detection sensibility. To overcome the lack of quality in data, simulation software intended to gas controllers training and pipeline operation was used to simulate leaks scenarios. Some historic data with high quality is also used to create normal operation condition models by means of Principal Component Analysis. All simulated faults were detected in a reduced time gap and recent events related to third-party actions showed the tool proficiency to detecting faults in real time. In addition, it considers a fault normalized index per section indicating the fault persistence and aggressiveness in a single plot.Copyright © 2012 by ASME",,,,"Volume 6: Energy, Parts A and B",,,2012-11-09,2012,2013-10-08,2012-11-09,,,769-774,Closed,Proceeding,"Torres, Melitsa J.; Posada, Jose D.; Garcia, Jaime R.; Sanjuan, Marco E.","Torres, Melitsa J.

Few technical studies related with energy optimization of air compressed networks are reported in the specialized literature, in contrast, in natural gas and steam networks have been widely analyzed. Pressure, temperature and flow monitoring of air compression is not enough for implementation of energy optimization models, for this reason authors have developed a transit conditions model which takes into account air supply equipments and air compressed process requirements. This paper presents a decision support system for the scheduling selection of a set of air compressors in an industrial plant based on energy demand minimization. Several constraints must be taken in consideration during the optimization process, this can be desegregate in two types, the first set of constrains was used for simulate the operation of scroll, screw and centrifuges compressors, the second based in graph an node theory and contain the mathematical transit conditions model of supply air network topology, for the complexity of the problem the use of a genetic algorithm to search an optimal combination was necessary.Copyright © 2012 by ASME",,,,"Volume 6: Energy, Parts A and B",,,2012-11-09,2012,2013-10-08,2012-11-09,,,1589-1593,Closed,Proceeding,"M., Lesme Corredor; Guillen, Diego; Prada, José; Contreras, Alisson","M., Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Guillen, Diego (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Prada, José (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Contreras, Alisson (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia)",,"M., Lesme Corredor (Universidad del Norte); Guillen, Diego (Universidad del Norte); Prada, José (Universidad del Norte); Contreras, Alisson (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092894116,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

We found a stable ferromagnetic state in Ag-doped GaN with a total magnetization of 1.81μB per supercell, indicating that Ag is ferromagnetically ordered in GaN. These results imply that the ferromagnetic ground state originates from the hybridized Ag (4d)–N (2p)–Ga (3d)–N (2p) chain formed through p–d coupling. This study shows that 4d transition metals, such as, silver may also be used as ferromagnetic dopants in semiconductors.","AcknowledgementsThe calculations reported in this paper were performed using the computing facilities at the HIPERLAB-cluster of Universidad del Norte.

The calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation with ultrasoft pseudopotential within the density functional theory. The surface is modeled using the repeated slabs approach. To study the most favorable reconstruction with vanadium adatom, we considered H 3 , T 4 , and T 1 high‐symmetry sites. We found that the most energetically favorable structure corresponds to the V‐ T 4 reconstruction or the vanadium adatom located at the hcp‐hollow ( T 4 ) site whereas the vanadium adsorption on‐top of a aluminium atom ( T 1 position) is energetically unfavorable.

A graphical interface was designed to provide the user with detailed information on consumption of the devices installed in each of the above environments, and allows the modification of parameters such as number of devices, power consumption associated to the levels specified for each device, environmental conditions, among others. Implementing the system developed in different environments, power consumption was lower than the one generated by implementing models without intelligent management. Additionally, we could estimate the savings in wear life of the devices, compared to the implementation of the system without intelligent management.","This work was supported in part by the Research and Project Management and the Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group at Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.",,,2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI),,,2012-10,2012,,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"M, Christian G.

Number recognition processes have an important role in remotely monitoring data for electrical meter readings, and monitoring data from these devices can help to reduce energy consumption. Research in the area of number recognition is vast and there are many different methods have been developed; some of these approaches follow characteristics extraction methods and others, such as the Hausdorff Distance, use the calculation of the distance between two finite sets. In this article, some of these approaches and a comparison among them are presented. Results showed that for recognizing complete digits, characteristic extraction methods offer a better result in terms of recognition time than Hausdorff Distance methods; however, both are similar when considering recognition percentage.","This reasearch was funded by the Direction of Research and Projects, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Spain, through a research grant approved in Request for Proposals year 2010.",,Applied Artificial Intelligence,,,,2012-11,2012,,2012-11,26,10,921-940,Closed,Article,"Rodríguez, Miguel; Berdugo, Geovanni; Jabba, Daladier; Calle, Maria G.; Jimeno, Miguel; Tello, Juan P.; Triana, Eileen; Zapata, Laura","Rodríguez, Miguel (Department of System Engineering, Engineering Division, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Berdugo, Geovanni (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Engineering Division, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jabba, Daladier (Department of System Engineering, Engineering Division, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Calle, Maria G.

Raman spectroscopy meets most of these requirements, allowing for the identification of volume and trace amounts of an unknown substance. In this paper we report the characterization of explosive substances such as ANFO and pentolite, both in their pure forms as well as mixed with other substances, such as sugar and sodium hydrogen carbonate, using a portable Raman Enwave Optronics EZRaman-model M, whose signal is sent and received by a head coupled to an optical fiber. The obtained spectra have been validated by comparison with those obtained by a conventional Raman spectrometer with high resolution. We discuss the advantage of using miniaturized laptops running with a 785-nm laser, making a correction of the signal response to obtain optimized spectral fingerprints with minimum noise, in order to design an autocalibrated, easily portable device that performs the function of identification of the mentioned substances.",We thank Colciencias and Armada Nacional de Colombia for their financial support during the realization of this work.

Electrical characterization by light beam-induced current (LBIC) was also carried out after the treatments. Several pieces of ~2 × 2 cm2, from mc-Si wafers, were mechanically polished and chemically etched and subsequently metallized with gold (on both surfaces) by sputtering, using optimized deposition times for doing transparent electrodes suitable for LBIC mapping. The surface treatments are discussed in terms of their capabilities to reveal the crystal defects and to provide the best conditions for efficient LBIC signals directly on silicon substrates, in the absence of a p–n junction. The best surface treatments allowing both revealing crystallographic defects and permitting the measurement of highly contrasted LBIC maps is the KOH etching. A large number of intra-grain defects are clearly revealed, being their electrical activity sensitively higher than that of the grain boundaries.","This study was supported by the Research Projects VA166A11-2 (“Consejería de Educación, Junta de Castilla y León”—Spain) and IPT-420000-2010-022 (INNPACTO program, “Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación”, Spain).

Consequently, the health risks associated with the exposure to nanocomposite materials are utmost important. The objective of our work is to study the toxic effects of the nanodiamond-polyaniline (ND-Pani) composites in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cell line. Toxic effects of either ND or ND-Pani nanocomposite in powder form on HEK293 are tested using MTT assay. Results indicated that there was no significant difference in the cell survival between samples treated with ND-Pani nanocomposite and the control sample for the two lower concentrations used in the experiments (p<0.05). Morphology of the cells was not significantly affected due to the inclusion of nanocomposites during the incubation phase. The stability of the film was also improved due to the inclusion of the nanodiamond particles into the polymeric matrix making it suitable for electrochemical sensing applications. Experimental results have shown that the toxicity effect of lower concentration of ND-Pani composite is negligible, thus indicating that below 1 μg/ml could be a safer range without secondary toxicity effect.",AcknowledgmentsThe research leading to this paper is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant no.

1730,pub.1061567389,10.1109/tcsi.2012.2195129,,,An Empirical Phase-Noise Model for MEMS Oscillators Operating in Nonlinear Regime,"Nonlinearity of a silicon resonator can lead to improved phase-noise performance in an oscillator when the phase shift of the sustaining amplifier forces the operating point to a steeper phase-frequency slope. As a result, phase modulation on the oscillator frequency is minimized because the resonator behaves as a high-order phase filter. The effect of the increased filtering translates into phase-noise shaping that reflects superior overall performance. Nonlinear effects in MEMS oscillators can be induced via sufficient driving power, generating low-frequency nonwhite noise processes that need to be considered in a phase-noise description. Since the phase-frequency response is not symmetric for a nonlinear detuned resonator, an empirical model based on power series is proposed to describe its effect in the noise sources and to account for the observed higher effective quality factor of the oscillator, the reduction in the corner frequency, and elevated levels of flicker noise very close-to-carrier. The applicability of the presented phase-noise model is shown for three piezoelectric MEMS oscillators, producing a relative fitting error below 1% in all cases.","This work was supported by Integrated Device Technology, San Jose, CA.

The goals are minimize the overall exploration time and increase the time in which intruders are tracked by the agents in a static environment. An intelligent approach is presented for the coordination of multiple robots using a market-based model considering three levels to find the suitable task for an agent: knowledge acquired, decision making algorithm and social interactions. For the two problems the decision making algorithms have been implemented using computational intelligent techniques. The proposed approach has been implemented in an indoor real-world environment using cell maps and its performance is tested in simulation runs. Experimental results and conclusions emphasize the advantages of using the coordination mechanisms developed in this work by contrasting the effectiveness in coverage area and tracking tasks to similar non-intelligent approaches.","This work was supported by National Institute for Development of Science and Technology of Colombia, Colciencias, the Research, Development and Innovation Management and the Robotics and Intelligent Systems Research Group of Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.",,,2012 XXXVIII Conferencia Latinoamericana En Informatica (CLEI),,,2012-10-01,2012,,2012-10-01,,,1-10,Closed,Proceeding,"M, Christian G.

The analysis combined a human rights‐based approach and a human development approach, and included concepts of multiple settings and levels, interrelated participation spaces, children and young people's citizenship, inclusion and exclusion, democracy, advocacy and empowerment. The main problems faced by children and young people seeking to influence policy‐makers were identified as adultism, dependency and lack of accountability. The research identified pre‐conditions, participation spaces and ways of organising for effective advocacy, and facilitation methods that had proved effective. It concludes that children and young people who achieve effective advocacy are generally self‐empowered, but can count on effective adult support and facilitation. They work through coordination with the authorities and not by clashing with them, but need to ensure effective follow up if they want politicians to keep their promises.","The research was made possible by financial support from Irish Aid through the ‘Active Citizenship in Central America’ programme, coordinated by the Dublin City University Centre for International Studies in Ireland and the Institute of Nicaraguan Studies in Managua, Nicaragua.

Además, hemos incorporado la reseña de un libro sobre relaciones entre España y el Cono Sur.
 El primer artículo, de Pablo Beytía, de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, examina las propuestas epistemológicas centrales de Pierre Bourdieu, a través del establecimiento de una filosofía de la ciencia relacional, una filosofía de la acción disposicional y una sociología reflexiva. Al mismo tiempo se establecen los rasgos generales de la epistemología del autor francés en el campo sociológico. Desde la Universidad del Norte, en Barranquilla, Colombia, Luis Trejos estudia un problema endémico de la sociedad colombiana: la violencia política en cuanto una “constante en la historia colombiana”. El autor es enfático al señalar que “la violencia se ha convertido en una variable permanente dentro de las interacciones sociales, las instituciones y las estructuras socioeconómicas de Colombia”.
 Los dos artículos siguientes corresponden a memorias por los derechos humanos y memorias sociales. El trabajo de Gonzalo Cáceres, de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, estudia los memoriales sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos tras la dictadura militar en nuestro país. En la visión de Cáceres, los memoriales gozan de una legitimidad extendida, que tienen la capacidad de evocación, reconocimiento y declaración. Desde Bogotá, Colombia, Pablo Nieto se refiere a las memorias sociales en tanto adscripciones al espacio físico y simbólico, puesto que “permite vincular el pasado y los sentidos del mismo a marcas o lugares de la memoria”. En este sentido, se analiza la relación entre memoria y territorio y el cómo “las sociedades han logrado establecer marcas territoriales y disputas por la tierra y el territorio”.
 Los siguientes dos trabajos corresponden a autores argentinos. Emilio Tévez se refiere al tema de los inmigrantes bolivianos en Argentina, estableciendo las relaciones que estos tienen “con el mundo del trabajo desde la niñez en su lugar de origen”. Se estudió a “niños y adultos migrantes provenientes de Bolivia y trabajadoras de la Escuela Fray Mamerto Esquiú”. Santiago Gabriel Calise, por su parte, estudia algunas reinterpretaciones del legado luhmanniano en relación con el derecho, tomando en consideración los trabajos de Marcelo Neves y Aldo Mascareño. El objetivo de la publicación es “confrontar estas diferentes visiones sobre el funcionamiento del sistema jurídico en América Latina”.
 Finalmente, hemos incorporado una reseña realizada por Daniel Noemi Voionmaa del trabajo de Luis Martín-Cabrera titulado Radical Justice: Spain and the Southern Cone beyond Market and State. En este texto se estudian “novelas policiales y documentales que refieren y elaboran sobre el período de las posdictaduras en España, Argentina y Chile, enfatizando que los eventos acaecidos son resultado del desarrollo global del capitalismo y de sus redes de terror”.
 En suma, al igual que los números anteriores, el presente número 3 del volumen XXVI de Persona y Sociedad cuenta con seis artículos, al que se ha sumado una reseña, que nos introducen en temáticas referidas a epistemología, violencia política, derechos humanos, territorio, migraciones y derecho.",,,Persona y Sociedad,,,,2012-12-01,2012,2012-12-01,,26,3,7,Closed,Article,"Caro, Isaac; Rozas, Valentina","Caro, Isaac (); Rozas, Valentina ()",,"Caro, Isaac (); Rozas, Valentina ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144729909,,

There was one three-year, national study of conciliation supported by the Institute of Studies of the Attorney General of Colombia and the Ministry of the Interior and Justice (Alvarez-Correa et al., 2008–2011). However, that study covered the social, psychological, and psychiatric histories of the conciliators, not the process itself. The data available for measuring the success (or lack thereof) of Conciliation in Equity was imprecise and inconsistent. What is reported in this chapter is the product of reviews of the literature by members of the research team carried out from 2009 through 2011. The researchers also made phone calls and sent letters and emails to authorities. Documents were collected during the period of observation in 2009 in Houses of Justice, community centers, and PACs.

1652,pub.1041453878,10.1080/00102202.2011.615769,,,Modeling and Numerical Solution of Coal and Natural Gas Co-Combustion in a Rotary Kiln,"Due to the great importance of rotary kilns in the cement industry and the fact that these systems are known to be high energy consumers, a model was developed for one of the most important phenomena occurring inside of such kilns, i.e., combustion. This model and its numerical solution allow for carrying out process optimization techniques in order to reduce the use of the fuel required, emissions, and operation costs. Furthermore, this model permits geometrical modifications in the burner as well as variations in operational conditions, i.e., flow rates, temperatures, and concentrations. The process studied here is carried out inside a tubular rotary kiln, which has a burner of concentric tubes that allows the combustion of two fuels in different phases, in this case, coal and natural gas. The modeling accounts for phenomena such as the turbulence produced due the high Reynolds number in the feed streams; the convective heat loss from the shell to the environment; and a three-step and two-step eddy brake-up combustion model for natural gas and volatiles. The model is developed from Lagrangian–Eulerian multiphase flow, taking into consideration coal solid particles in the gaseous stream, devolatilization rate of coal, heterogeneous burnout of char, and NOx generation. Finally, velocity, temperature, and concentration fields were analyzed to evaluate dragging, reactions conversion, and pollutants formation in the process.",The authors want to acknowledge Cementos Argos (Planta Caribe) for providing important process operational information and technical support.,,Combustion Science and Technology,,,,2012-01,2012,,2012-01,184,1,26-43,Closed,Article,"Barraza, Cesar L.; Bula, Antonio J.; Palencia, Argemiro","Barraza, Cesar L.

In recent years, several research studies have proposed semi-automated vision-based methods for tracking of construction workers and equipment. Nonetheless, there is still a need for automated initial recognition and real-time tracking of these resources in video streams. To address these limitations, a new algorithm based on histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is proposed. The method uses HOG features with a new multiple binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to automatically recognize and differentiate workers and equipment. These resources are tracked in real-time using a new GPU-based implementation of the detector and classifier. Experimental results are presented on a comprehensive set of video streams on excavators, trucks, and workers collected from different projects. Our preliminary results indicate the applicability of the proposed approach for automated recognition and real-time 2D tracking of workers and equipment from a single video camera. Unlike other methods, our algorithm can enable automated and real-time construction performance assessment (including detection of idle resources) and does not need manual or semi-automated initialization of the resources in 2D video frames. The preliminary experimental results and perceived benefits of the proposed method are discussed in detail.",,,,Computing in Civil Engineering (2012),,,2012-06-11,2012,2012-09-19,2012-06-11,,,429-436,Closed,Proceeding,"Memarzadeh, M.; Heydarian, A.; Golparvar-Fard, M.; Niebles, J.

In models such as the international friction index (IFI), macrotexture is used to quantify the speed sensitivity of wet friction measurements on a given pavement surface. IFI is primarily a statistical model, in which the pavement macrotexture is correlated to the speed constant, Sp, or the slope of the linear regression relationship between ln(friction) and the slip speed. An evaluation is presented of the statistical significance of pavement macrotexture on the IFI model and the applicability of IFI concepts to the range of macrotexture typical of highway and runway pavements. The results of the investigation showed that the proposed concept in the IFI model was not applicable for high macrotexture levels in particular because friction measured on such pavements was known to remain constant with changing slip speeds. At high levels of macrotexture, variations of friction measurements with slip speed could be explained by the error term used in linear regression. Moreover, the speed constant used in the IFI model was shown to be extremely sensitive at high levels of macrotexture from a theoretical perspective as well. The findings limit the applicability of the IFI model at relatively high levels of macrotexture. An appropriate threshold macrotexture level was determined for reliable application of the IFI model.",,,Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,2012-01-01,2012,2012-01-01,2012-01,2306,1,138-143,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, Luis G.; Gunaratne, Manjriker; de León Izeppi, Edgar; Flintsch, Gerardo W.; Martinez, Gilberto","Fuentes, Luis G.

At the same time, users have made their locations more available than ever, representing a major privacy problem, as attackers could easily determine their victims' common paths or actual locations. As a result, some techniques have been designed to protect the users' private information while allowing Location Based Service systems (LBS) to continue growing. Location obfuscation is a technique that alters, substitutes, or generalizes the real location of the users to protect them against malicious attacks. Moreover, there are activities that require a high level of accuracy while also maintaining the protection of the location, such as fleet management or transportation of valuables. In this work, a light-weight and fully reversible location obfuscation technique named Matlock is presented. Matlock, based on matrix obfuscation, requires low computation per operation and hides the location in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The performance evaluation shows how this technique alters the location of paths from different geographical regions, produces a non-morphologically similar path to the original path, and generates increasing distance functions between the original and the obfuscated paths, which together should reduce the probability of using estimation techniques to perform deobfuscation of the information.",,,,2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC),,,2012-04-01,2012,,2012-04-01,,,1829-1834,Closed,Proceeding,"Wightman, Pedro M.; Jimeno, Miguel A.; Jabba, Daladier; Labrador, Miguel","Wightman, Pedro M.

Development of an operational nearshore wave forecast system for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An assessment of coastal information needs in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands identified real-time wave data and improved wave forecasts as essential for supporting nearshore operations in the region. After deployment of operational wave-measuring buoys off the north, south, east, and west coasts of the Puerto RicoVirgin Islands archipelago, the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was implemented for the region. The main purpose of its implementation is to provide for data needs in areas not well represented by the buoys as well as for filling the nearshore gap not addressed by the operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Multigrid WAVEWATCH III (NMWWIII) model forecast. The model consists of a nesting between WWIII and SWAN where oceanic boundary conditions in the form of two-dimensional wave spectra are supplied by the NMWWIII model. In this study we present results from two model-validation experiments under varying physical-forcing scenarios, one in which swell waves dominate (Rincn) and one in which wind swell dominates (Ponce). The results show good agreement between the observed and the modeled wave field for the Rincn domain, on Puerto Rico's northwest coast and facing the Atlantic Ocean, which indicates that appropriate boundary conditions are being obtained from NMWWIII and propagated correctly by SWAN into nearshore areas.

Our algorithm is based on machine learning techniques, in which meaningful visual features are extracted based on the estimated body pose of workers. We adopt a bag-of-poses representation for worker actions and combine it with powerful discriminative classifiers to achieve accurate action recognition. The discriminative framework is able to focus on the visual aspects that are distinctive and can detect and recognize actions from different workers. We train and test our algorithm by using 80 videos from four workers involved in five drywall related construction activities. These videos were all collected from drywall construction activities inside of an under construction dining hall facility. The proposed algorithm is further validated by recognizing the actions of a construction worker that was never seen before in the training dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves an average precision of 85.28 percent. The results reflect the promise of the proposed method for automated assessment of craftsmen productivity, safety, and occupational health at indoor environments.",,,,Construction Research Congress 2012,,,2012-05-17,2012,2012-07-11,2012-05-17,,,879-888,Closed,Proceeding,"Escorcia, Víctor; Dávila, María A.; Golparvar-Fard, Mani; Niebles, Juan Carlos","Escorcia, Víctor (Electrical and Electronic Engineering Dept., Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

1518,pub.1092859022,10.1115/es2012-91216,,,Maximum Power From Fluid Flow: Results From the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics,"The heat transfer principle of power maximization in power plants with heat transfer irreversibilities was cleverly extended by Bejan [1] to fluid flow, by obtaining that the energy conversion efficiency at maximum power is ηmax = 1/2(1 − P2/P1). This result is analog to the efficiency at maximum power for power plants, ηmax = 1 − (T2/T1)1/2 which was deduced by Curzon and Ahlborn [2]. In this paper, the analysis to obtain maximum power output delivered from a piston between two pressure reservoir across linear flow resistance is generalized by considering the piston cylinder friction, by obtaining relations of maximum power output and optimal speed of the piston in terms of first law efficiency. Expressions to relate the power output, cross sectional area of the chamber and first law efficiency, were deduced in order to evaluate the influence of the overall size constraints and fluid regime in the performance of the piston cylinder system. Flow in circular ducts and developed laminar flow between parallel plates, are considered to demonstrate that when two pressure reservoirs oriented in counterflow, with different and arbitrary cross sectional area, must have the same area in order to maximize the power output of the system. These results introduce some modifications to the results obtained by Bejan [1] and Chen [3]. This paper extends the Bejan and Chen’s work by estimating under turbulent regime the lost available work rate associated with the degree of irreversibilities caused by the flow resistances of the system. This analysis is equivalent to evaluate the irreversibilities in an endoirreversible Carnot heat engine model caused by the heat resistance loss between the engine and its surrounding heat reservoirs. This paper concludes with an application to illustrate the practical applications by estimating the lost available work of an actual steady-flow turbine and the layout pipes upstream and downstream of the same device.Copyright © 2012 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2012 6th International Conference on Energy Sustainability, Parts A and B",,,2012-07-23,2012,2013-07-23,2012-07-23,,,1243-1252,Closed,Proceeding,"Diaz, German Amador; Santos, John Turizo; Hernandez, Elkin; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Corredor, Lesme","Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Santos, John Turizo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hernandez, Elkin (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Diaz, German Amador (Universidad del Norte); Santos, John Turizo (Universidad del Norte); Hernandez, Elkin (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (Universidad del Norte); Corredor, Lesme (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092859022,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering; 51 Physical Sciences; 5103 Classical Physics,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Despite the benefits, manual stopwatch study of previously recorded videos can be labor-intensive, may suffer from biases of the observers, and impractical after substantial period of observations. To address these limitations, this paper presents a new vision-based method for automated action recognition of construction equipment from different camera viewpoints. This is particularly a challenging task as construction equipment can be partially occluded and they usually come in wide variety of sizes and appearances. The scale and pose of the equipment action can also significantly vary based on the camera configurations. In the proposed method, first a video is represented as a collection of spatio-temporal features by extracting space-time interest points and describing each feature with a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions of the spatio-temporal features and action categories using a multiple binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This strategy handles noisy feature points arisen from typical dynamic backgrounds. Given a novel video sequence, the multiple binary SVM classifier recognizes and localizes multiple equipment actions in long and dynamic video sequences containing multiple equipment actions. We have exhaustively tested our algorithm on 1,200 videos from earthmoving operations. Results with average accuracy of 85% across all categories of equipment actions reflect the promise of the proposed method for automated performance monitoring.",,,,Construction Research Congress 2012,,,2012-05-17,2012,2012-07-11,2012-05-17,,,889-898,Closed,Proceeding,"Heydarian, Arsalan; Golparvar-Fard, Mani; Niebles, Juan Carlos","Heydarian, Arsalan (Graduate student, Vecellio Construction Engineering and Management, Via Dept. of Civil and Env.

The main goal was to reduce the reaction time preliminarily established by a process of conventional heating. A full factorial design assessed the influence of ethanol-to-palm oil (8:1–16:1) molar ratio and temperature (43–57 °C) on the transesterification yield. Microwave irradiations varying from 8 to 15 W were set up according to reaction temperature. Under optimal conditions (8:1 ethanol-to-oil molar ratio at 43 °C), 97.56 % of the fatty acids present in the palm oil were converted into ethyl esters in a 12-h reaction, corresponding to a productivity of 64.2 mg ethyl esters g−1 h−1. This represents a sixfold increase from the process carried out under conventional heating, thus proving to be a potential tool for enhancing biochemical modification of oils and fats. In general, advantages of the new process include: (1) microwaves speed up the enzyme-catalyzed reactions; (2) there are no destructive effects on the enzyme properties, such as stability and substrate specificity, and (3) the microwave assistance allows the entire reaction volume to be heated uniformly. These bring benefits of a low energy demand and a faster conversion of palm oil into biodiesel.",The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico) and FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) Brazil.,,Bioprocess Engineering,,,"Bioengineering; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Enzymes, Immobilized; Esterification; Ethanol; Lipase; Microwaves; Palm Oil; Plant Oils; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Siloxanes; Temperature",2012-08-18,2012,2012-08-18,2013-04,36,4,443-451,Closed,Article,"Da Rós, Patrícia C.

This paper presents the optimization of a combined power/cooling cycle, also known as the Goswami cycle, which combines the Rankine and absorption refrigeration cycles. The cycle uses a special binary fluid mixture as the working fluid and produces a power and refrigeration. In this regard, multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs) are used for Pareto approach optimization of the thermodynamic cycle. The optimization study includes two cases. In the first case, the performance of the cycle is evaluated as it is used as a bottoming cycle and in the second case, as it is used as a top cycle utilizing solar energy or geothermal sources. The important thermodynamic objectives that have been considered in this work are, namely, work output, cooling capacity, effective first law, and exergy efficiencies. Optimization is carried out by varying the selected design variables, such as boiler temperature and pressure, rectifier temperature, and basic solution concentration. The boiler temperature is varied between 70–150 °C and 150–250 °C for the first and the second cases, respectively.",Nomenclature Abstract | Introduction | Modeling Details | Multi-Objective Pareto Optimization | Multi-Objective Thermodynamic Optimization of Goswami Cycle | Conclusions | Acknowledgements | Nomenclature | References E exergy cooling (kW) h specific enthalpy (kJ/kg) m· mass flow rate (kg/s) s specific entropy (kJ/kg K) T temperature (°C) Q heat transfer (kW) W work (kW) x ammonia concentration (kg NH3 /kg solution) η efficiency (%) ɛ recovery heat-exchanger effectiveness c cold fluid cf chilled fluid eff effective value exergy exergy h heat input hs heat source in input net net o reference state out output t turbine ref refrigeration I first law II second law,,Journal of Energy Resources Technology,,,,2012-05-22,2012,2012-05-22,2012-09-01,134,3,032002,Closed,Article,"Demirkaya, Gokmen; Besarati, Saeb; Vasquez Padilla, Ricardo; Ramos Archibold, Antonio; Goswami, D.

The In 2 S 3 and ZnS‐nd layers were prepared by the spray ion layer gas reaction (ILGAR) technique from Indium chloride (InCl 3 ), Indium acetylacetonate (In(acac) 3 ) and Zinc acetylacetonate, respectively.

1482,pub.1062146763,10.1115/1.4006434,,,Performance Analysis of a Rankine Cycle Integrated With the Goswami Combined Power and Cooling Cycle,"Improving the efficiency of thermodynamic cycles plays a fundamental role in reducing the cost of solar power plants. These plants work normally with Rankine cycles which present some disadvantages due to the thermodynamic behavior of steam at low pressures. These disadvantages can be reduced by introducing alternatives such as combined cycles which combine the best features of each cycle. In this paper, a combined Rankine–Goswami cycle (RGC) is proposed and a thermodynamic analysis is conducted. The Goswami cycle, used as a bottoming cycle, uses ammonia–water mixture as the working fluid and produces power and refrigeration while power is the primary goal. This bottoming cycle, reduces the energy losses in the traditional condenser and eliminates the high specific volume and poor vapor quality presented in the last stages of the lower pressure turbine in the Rankine cycle. In addition, the use of absorption condensation in the Goswami cycle, for regeneration of the strong solution, allows operating the low pressure side of the cycle above atmospheric pressure which eliminates the need for maintaining a vacuum pressure in the condenser. The performance of the proposed combined Rankine–Goswami cycle, under full load, was investigated for applications in parabolic trough solar thermal plants for a range from 40 to 50 MW sizes. A sensitivity analysis to study the effect of the ammonia concentration, condenser pressure, and rectifier concentration on the cycle efficiency, network, and cooling was performed. The results indicate that the proposed RGC provide a difference in net power output between 15.7% and 42.3% for condenser pressures between 1 and 9 bars. The maximum effective first law and exergy efficiencies for an ammonia mass fraction of 0.5 are calculated as 36.7% and 24.7%, respectively, for the base case (no superheater or rectifier process).","Nomenclature Abstract | Introduction | Proposed Cycle | Simulation Details | Results and Discussion | Conclusions | Acknowledgements | Nomenclature | References E exergy cooling, kW H enthalpy, kJ/kg m· mass flow rate, kg/s S entropy, kJ/kg K T temperature, °C Q heat transfer, kW W work, kW x ammonia concentration, Kg NH3 /Kg solution η efficiency, % c cold fluid eff effective value exergy exergy h heat hs heat source in input net net o reference state out output t turbine ref refrigeration I First Law II Second Law",,Journal of Energy Resources Technology,,,,2012-05-22,2012,2012-05-22,2012-09-01,134,3,032001,Closed,Article,"Vasquez Padilla, Ricardo; Ramos Archibold, Antonio; Demirkaya, Gokmen; Besarati, Saeb; Yogi Goswami, D.; Rahman, Muhammad M; Stefanakos, Elias L.","Vasquez Padilla, Ricardo (Clean Energy Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ramos Archibold, Antonio (Clean Energy Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Autonoma del Caribe, Barranquilla, Colombia); Demirkaya, Gokmen (Clean Energy Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL); Besarati, Saeb (Clean Energy Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL); Yogi Goswami, D.

The job sizes, ready times, and processing times on the two BPMs are known. The batch processing machines can process a batch of jobs as long as the total size of all the jobs assigned to a batch does not exceed its capacity. Once the jobs are batched, the processing time of the batch on the first machine is equal to the longest processing job in the batch; processing time of the batch on the second machine is equal to the sum of processing times of all the jobs in the batch. The batches cannot wait between two machines (i.e., no-wait). The problem under study is NP-hard. We propose a mathematical formulation and present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

1388,pub.1023475814,10.1007/978-3-642-33811-3_10,,,Pesticides Removal Using Actinomycetes and Plants,"The γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH, lindane) is an organochlorine pesticide used in agriculture and medicine to world level. It has a big tendency to bioaccumulation into the environment so is listed as a priority pollutant by the US EPA. Hence the development of new technologies to remediate these sites using microorganisms is every time more necessary. The actinomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria with great potential to bioremediate xenobiotics. One strain, Streptomyces sp. M7, isolated from organochlorine pesticide contaminated sediment, was selected for its capacity to grow in presence of lindane as only carbon source. This microorganism was cultured in soil extract medium added of lindane 100 μg L−1, obtaining a maximal growth of 0.065 mg mL−1, similar to the control, with a highest lindane remotion of 70.4 % at 30°C and pH 7. When different initial pesticide concentrations (100, 150, 200, and 300 μg L−1) were added in soil medium, an increment of the microbial growth was detected in all the concentrations tested. Also a diminution of the residual lindane concentration was determined in the soil samples in relation to controls without bacteria (29.1, 78.0, 38.8, and 14.4 %, respectively). Besides, it was determined the optimum Streptomyces sp. M7 inoculum when lindane 100 μg kg−1soil was added to the soil sample. The optimum inoculum was 2 g kg−1 soil for obtaining the most efficiently bioremediation process: the lindane removal in these conditions was 67.8 % at 28 days of incubation. Later it was considered necessary to know the pesticide effects on maize plants seeded in lindane-contaminated soil previously inoculated with Streptomyces sp. M7. Lindane concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 mg kg−1 soil did not affect the germination and vigor index of maize plants seeded in contaminated soils without Streptomyces sp. M7. When this microorganism was inoculated at the same conditions, a better vigor index was observed and 68 % of lindane was removed. In this connection, Streptomyces sp. M7 was grown on culture medium in presence of root exudates of maize, spiked with 1.66 mg L−1 of lindane. The highest level of pesticide removal obtained on this condition suggests that root exudates enhanced removal of lindane by the bacterium. On the other hand, little information is available on the ability of biotransformation of organochlorine pesticides by actinomycete strains. It was demonstrated that Streptomyces sp. M7 possesses the LinA enzyme that catalyzes dehydrochlorination of lindane to 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-TCDN) via γ-pentachlorocyclohexene (γ-PCCH). These results confirm that actinomycete strains could be considered one of the most promising bacterial groups for lindane biodegradation in contaminated environment. Particularly, Streptomyces sp. M7 could be used for this purpose.","This work was supported by Consejo de Investigaciones de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (CIUNT), Agencia Nacional de Promoción CientÚfica y Tecnológica (ANPyCT), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones CientÚficas y Técnicas (CONICET) and Fundación Bunge y Born.",,Soil Biology,Fungi as Bioremediators,"Ebrahim Mohammadi Goltapeh, Younes Rezaee Danesh, Ajit Varma",,2012-12-04,2012,2012-12-04,2013,32,,227-242,Closed,Chapter,"Alvarez, Analía; Fuentes, María S.; Benimeli, Claudia S.; Cuozzo, Sergio A.; Saez, Juliana M.; Amoroso, María J.","Alvarez, Analía (Planta Piloto de Procesos Industriales y Microbiológicos (PROIMI-CONICET), Avenida Belgrano y Pasaje Caseros, 4000, Tucumán, Argentina; Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Tucumán, Argentina); Fuentes, María S.

Different interfacial characteristics between the diamond coatings and the modified WC–Co substrate were obtained by the use of two different chemical etchings and a CrN/Cr interlayer, with the aim to produce an adherent diamond coating by increasing the interlocking effect of the diamond film, and halting the catalytic effect of the cobalt present on the cemented carbide tool. A systematic study is analyzed in terms of the initial cutting tool surface modifications, the deposition and characterization of microcrystalline diamond coatings deposited by HFCVD synthesis, the estimation of the resulting diamond adhesion by Rockwell indentations and Raman spectroscopy, and finally, the evaluation of the dry machining performance of the diamond coated tools on A390 aluminum alloys. The experiments show that chemical etching methods exceed the effect of the CrN/Cr interlayer in increasing the diamond coating adhesion under dry cutting operations. This work provided new insights about optimizing the surface characteristics of cemented carbides to produce adherent diamond coatings in the dry cutting manufacturing chain of high silicon aluminum alloys.","AcknowledgementsThis research is supported from the NSF GOALI/Collaborative Research Award #: 0928823.

Self-report questionnaires were used to measure peer victimization (i.e., when a child is the target of negative actions from her/his peers) and gender identity. We hypothesized a negative relationship between typicality and peer victimization in that more gender typical children would be less victimized. We also expected to find a stronger association between gender typicality and victimization in contexts with higher levels of pressure to conform to gender norms. Results indicated that the girls in the single-sex schools endorsed significantly higher levels of gender typicality and felt pressure to conform to gender norms than the girls in the mixed-sex schools. The girls in the mixed-sex schools reported significantly higher levels of peer victimization. Girls in the same-sex schools reported lower levels of peer victimization in classrooms with high levels of perceived pressure to conform to gender norms. Multilevel modeling revealed that gender typicality was negatively associated with peer victimization among the girls in the same-sex schools and was uncorrelated with victimization in the mixed-sex school. These findings add to the database indicating that peers relationships are affected by gender and that the effects of gender are moderated by group composition.","Work on this paper was supported by (a) grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Société et la Culture (FQRSC), (b) fellowships awarded to the first and third author from the SSHRC and the FQRSC, and (c) a Concordia University Research Chair awarded to the second author.",,Sex Roles,,,,2012-02-01,2012,2012-02-01,2013-10,69,7-8,442-454,Closed,Article,"Drury, Kate; Bukowski, William M.; Velásquez, Ana M.; Stella-Lopez, Luz","Drury, Kate (Department of Psychology and Center for Research on Human Development, Concordia University, 7141 SherbrookeSt. West, H4B 1R6, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Bukowski, William M.

As a result, sensor networks are highly prone to an enormous number of logical and physical attacks. These attacks vary from eavesdropping on sensitive information, imputing inaccurate information, to the unintentional failure of nodes as in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Many approaches have been proposed for assuring the Hop-to-hop encryption using different short keys in each node along the path from source to destination, for example the random key pre-distribution scheme. This random key pre-distribution scheme and its enhanced editions were applied with assumptions of no prior deployment knowledge. The paper proposes a scheme that uses prior deployment knowledge in terms of the energy level carried by each node for modifying the polynomial pool based key pre-distribution scheme proposed in [1]. The paper shows that the node energy level observation can be used to control the selection of polynomial keys held by this node. The proposed scheme shows that it is suitable to be applied on topology control protocols such as the A3 protocol [2]. The proposed scheme reduces the energy consumption and computational overhead through controlling the use of security keys according to specific network's energy threshold that positively reflects on the performance of the whole WSN.",,,,2012 Third International Conference on Intelligent Systems Modelling and Simulation,,,2012-02,2012,,,1,,632-638,Closed,Proceeding,"Fouad, Mohamed Mostafa M.; Mostafa, Mostafa-Sami M.; Dawood, Ahmed Reda","Fouad, Mohamed Mostafa M.

Even though the Palestinian gentile was not the immediate auto-referential denomination, its social and economic life developed in the territories mentioned in the quote above, and territorial identification tied the inhabitants to historical Palestine. Around 1947, the “Palestinian,” non-Jewish population, that is to say, the sum of Muslims (around 1.1 million) and Christians (more than to 150,000) was almost twice that of the Jewish population (around 650,000), a doubling of the population in the territories since the 1922 Census.Owing to the consequences of the first Arab-Israeli war, an important part of the Arab population of Palestine (711,000 according to United Nations data) was obliged to leave or was voluntarily re-located and included in the registers of Palestinian refugees. Nowadays, three quarters of the Palestinian people find themselves in a situation of displacement, with more than half of them outside the boundaries of their historical home (Rempel 2007). Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, Egypt and Syria were the original destinations of the refugees who now number 4.8 million, of which 1.4 million are registered in fifty-eight refugee camps along the Palestine territories Jordan, Syria and Lebanon (UNRWA 2010).One of the less studied aspects of this problem is the migration of Arab inhabitants in the Palestinian territories before and after the “Nakba,” to South America. In the first period, from the end of the nineteenth Century to 1948, there is a process of progressive migration, whereas after the first Arab-Israeli War, the moving of the Palestinian population changes into a diaspora of a regional (and secondarily global) character.",,,,Migration and New international Actors: An Old Phenomenon Seen With New Eyes,,,2012-01-01,2012,,,,,37-49(13),Closed,Chapter,"Levaggi, Ariel S.

In this report, we demonstrate for the first time the presence of ACPH in the synapse and its preferential localization at the pre-synaptic side. We isolated subcellular fractions from the rat telencephalon enriched in pre- versus post-synaptic components by using differential centrifugation steps to evaluate ACPH catalytic activity and expression level. Relative ACPH levels were determined by Western blot techniques while antibodies against synaptophysin and PSD-95 were used as positive pre- and post-synaptic markers, respectively. Our results show that ACPH protein levels are significantly increased at the synapse, which correlates with a 56% increase in ACPH activity. Furthermore, Western blot experiments show that ACPH is preferentially located at the pre-synaptic side and this is consistent with the increase of its enzymatic activity in fractions enriched in pre-synaptic components. These results give new insights regarding the localization and a putative role of ACPH in the CNS.",AcknowledgmentsThe authors are indebted to the following funding grants: Programa Bicentenario en Ciencia y Tecnología (No PSD-11) to R.S. and F.P.; VRIDT funding grant from Universidad Católica del Norte to R.S. and F.P.; Fondecyt No 1100322 and Proyecto Anillo ACT09-06 to U.W.

We searched 13 sites on the maritime Antarctic islands and 12 sites on the Antarctic Peninsula for annual bluegrass (Poa annua), a non-native flowering plant. We also evaluated the possible effects of competition between P. annua and 2 vascular plants native to Antarctica, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) and Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica). We grew the native species in experimental plots with and without annual bluegrass under conditions that mimicked the Antarctic environment. After 5 months, we measured photosynthetic performance on the basis of chlorophyll fluorescence and determined total biomass of both native species. We found individual specimens of annual bluegrass at 3 different sites on the Antarctic Peninsula during the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 austral summers. The presence of bluegrass was associated with a statistically significant reduction in biomass of pearlwort and hairgrass, whereas the decrease in biomass of bluegrass was not statistically significant. Similarly, the presence of bluegrass significantly reduced the photosynthetic performance of the 2 native species. Sites where bluegrass occurred were close to major maritime routes of scientific expeditions and of tourist cruises to Antarctica. We believe that if current levels of human activity and regional warming persist, more non-native plant species are likely to colonize the Antarctic and may affect native species.","We are grateful to R.M.

The purpose of this study was to compare the glucose homeostasis of male and female rats exposed to low levels of heavy metals in drinking water. Treated groups were Sprague–Dawley male and female rats exposed to drinking water from Antofagasta city, with total arsenic of 30 ppb and lead of 53 ppb for 3 months; control groups were exposed to purified water by reverse osmosis. The two treated groups in both males and females showed arsenic and lead in the hair of rats. The δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase was used as a sensitive biomarker of arsenic toxicity and lead. The activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase was reduced only in treated male rats, compared to the control group. Treated males showed a significantly sustained increase in blood glucose and plasma insulin levels during oral glucose tolerance test compared to control group. The oral glucose tolerance test and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance demonstrated that male rats were insulin resistant, and females remained sensitive to insulin after treatment. The total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol increased in treated male rats vs. the control, and triglyceride increased in treated female rats vs. the control. The activity of intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter in male rats increased compared to female rats, suggesting a significant increase in intestinal glucose absorption. The findings indicate that exposure to low levels of arsenic and lead in drinking water could cause gender differences in insulin resistance.","We would like to thank Blanca Alvarez Carvajal from Laboratorio Clínico Hormonal RadioLab, Laboratorio Clínico Blanco for the technical assistance in this study.

1104,pub.1092991330,10.1115/gt2012-68808,,,Numerical Analysis of a Fogging System in a Gas Turbine,"Air cooling via evaporation of water droplets injected at the compressor intake duct is the process known as Fogging System, which is among the most used technologies for increasing output power of gas turbines nowadays. The optimal design of this system must consider numerous variables, such as: air temperature (Ta), air relative humidity (RH), duct geometry, amount of water injected (mw), droplets size (Dd), and nozzles location. Since there are so many variables the flow under study is very complicated. In consequence the analytical determination of an optimal Fogging System design is not feasible. In this paper, a numerical model was developed in order to characterize the injection of water at the air intake duct of a Gas Turbine. First, the expressions characterizing the model were included in the CFD software ANSYS CFX v-11 and simulated in a simple geometry (rectangular duct). Validation of CFD results was carried out by comparison with experimental data. Good agreement between numerical results of a control case and experimental data was achieved (deviation < 2%). Then, the influence of key parameters such as: Ta, RH, Dd, mw over the performance of the air cooling system was investigated. Finally, the model was used to design a Fogging System for an existing 120 MW Gas Turbine. For this gas turbine operating under real conditions, the model predicts a net power increment of 2% [7].Copyright © 2012 by ASME",,,,Volume 3: Cycle Innovations; Education; Electric Power; Fans and Blowers; Industrial and Cogeneration,,,2012-06-11,2012,2013-07-09,2012-06-11,,,913-923,Closed,Proceeding,"Jeanty, Freddy; De Andrade, Jesús; Croquer, Sergio; Correa, Jorge Luis Clarembaux; Asuaje, Miguel","Jeanty, Freddy (Simon Bolivar University, Valle de Sartenejas, Venezuela); De Andrade, Jesús (Simon Bolivar University, Valle de Sartenejas, Venezuela); Croquer, Sergio (Simon Bolivar University, Valle de Sartenejas, Venezuela); Correa, Jorge Luis Clarembaux (Simon Bolivar University, Valle de Sartenejas, Venezuela); Asuaje, Miguel (Simon Bolivar University, Valle de Sartenejas, Venezuela)",,"Jeanty, Freddy (Simón Bolívar University); De Andrade, Jesús (Simón Bolívar University); Croquer, Sergio (Simón Bolívar University); Correa, Jorge Luis Clarembaux (Simón Bolívar University); Asuaje, Miguel (Simón Bolívar University)",3,0,,0.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092991330,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

It is, thus, essential to consider non-random spatial structure when evaluating the underlying causes of biological variation. In this study, we analyzed the population structure of Chilina dombeyana shell morphology of 14 populations that are close geographically and belong to the same hydrographic basin. We utilized a variation partitioning approach to evaluate the importance of spatial processes, such as migration, acting over the landscape, and environmental characteristics, including habitat and hydrologic characteristics, and the occurrence of aquatic predators in promoting between population variation. Our results demonstrate spatially structured variation in C. dombeyana shell morphology, with populations living near each other having more similar shell sizes than populations living farther apart. The shell size variation partition indicated that both spatially structured environmental factors and genetic relationships resulting from migration or shared common ancestry may explain this pattern. Shell shape variation, in contrast, was found to be essentially under the influence of non-spatially structured environmental factors, with habitat and water characteristics accounting for about half of the total variation among populations. The large proportion of the variation in shell size that is spatially structured demonstrates that spatial structure on morphological traits might be strong and highlights the need to consider such phenomenon in intraspecific studies of phenotypic evolution.",,,The Science of Nature,,,Animal Shells; Animals; Chile; Ecosystem; Environment; Fresh Water; Phenotype; Snails,2012-02-12,2012,2012-02-12,2012-03,99,3,225-232,Closed,Article,"Bertin, Angéline; Ruíz, Victor H.; Figueroa, Ricardo; Gouin, Nicolas","Bertin, Angéline (Departamento de Biología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de La Serena, Benavente 980, Casilla 599, La Serena, Chile); Ruíz, Victor H.

Here, by visualizing attached bacterial cells on energetic substrates with different microscopy techniques, we obtained the first direct evidence that it is possible to positively modulate biofilm formation of the extremophilic bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans on sulfur and pyrite surfaces by using Quorum Sensing molecules of the N-acylhomoserine lactone type (AHLs). Our results revealed that AHL-signaling molecules with a long acyl chain (12 or 14 carbons) increased the adhesion of A. ferrooxidans cells to these substrates. In addition, Card-Fish experiments demonstrated that C14-AHL improved the adhesion of indigenous A. ferrooxidans cells from a mixed bioleaching community to pyrite. Finally, we demonstrated that this improvement of cell adhesion is correlated with an increased production of extracellular polymeric substances. Our results open up a promising means to develop new strategies for the improvement of bioleaching efficiency and metal recovery, which could also be used to control environmental damage caused by acid mine/rock drainage.","This work was supported by grants FONDECYT 1080441, FONDECYT 1120295, and CNRS-CONICYT (PICS no. 5270).

However, there is no available information regarding the effects of this disease on the physiological performance of infected abalone. We studied the effect of different levels of infection on components of energy balance and physiological indices (rates of absorption and assimilation, O/N ratio, and scope for growth) in the abalone species Haliotis rufescens and Haliotis discus hannai. Juveniles were exposed to C. X. californiensis transmission for 130 days, during which time the presence/absence of WS-RLOs was evaluated by PCR (following DNA sequencing-based confirmation of 100% identity with the sequence of C. X. californiensis from California), and the prevalence and intensity of infection were evaluated via histological analysis. Among H. rufescens juveniles exposed to the bacterium, 92% became infected (positive by histology), and the intensity of infection ranged from low (degree 1) to moderate (degree 2). In contrast, no H. discus hannai juveniles were positive for WS-RLO by histology, although 23% were positive by PCR, possibly indicating incipient WS-RLO infection that did not develop during the experimental period or to mere presence of WS-RLO DNA in the sample. Infection of H. rufescens juveniles by WS-RLOs negatively affected all components of the energy balance and physiological indices, such as scope for growth and the O/N ratio, in direct relation to the degree of infection. The most strongly affected functions were the rate of ingestion, standard metabolism, and production of feces, which were reduced by 60-80% in the most highly infected individuals. The reduced energy intake in the organisms produced a strong energy imbalance such that the energy available for growth was reduced by 49% in infected organisms. In contrast, juveniles of H. discus hannai carrying the bacterium developed no infection and showed no alterations of physiological function. Our results indicate that the level of early infection by WS-RLOs may exert a negative effect on physiological activity in H. rufescens, even when the disease is not evident.",AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to the Centro de Producción de Abalón de la Universidad Católica del Norte (CPA-UCN) for their invaluable contribution in providing all the necessary facilities required to undertake this study under controlled conditions.

A procedure for the validation of a routine method for determining the total protein, carbohydrate, lipid and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) contents in Chlorella fusca, Dunaliella salina and Spirulina sp. has been developed. Detection limits of 10.8 μg/mg, 2.7 μg/mg and 5.6 μg/mg for total protein content and 3.5 μg/mg, 1.8 μg/mg and 8.8 μg/mg for total carbohydrate content were determined in C. fusca, D. salina and Spirulina sp., respectively. Most of the biological macromolecule levels measured in the microalgae were in accordance with the magnitude of previously reported data for other strains of the same taxa. However, lower levels than expected of lipids and Chl-a were measured in C. fusca and Spirulina sp., which may be associated with an imbalance between specific growth rates and the rate of macromolecule synthesis. The protein values measured in Spirulina sp. (52.3 ± 2.2 μg/mg DW) were close to the lower limit of the range reported in the literature for non-halophilous strains of the same genus. Except for the Chl-a quantification procedure, the analytical methods for macromolecules had a high degree of repeatability and reproducibility. The variability among repeated measurements of Chl-a was associated with auto-degradation processes during pigment extraction.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to express their appreciation to VRID of the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile for financial support and to Drs.

Since 1983, a significant number of IVA cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 Caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. IVA is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-CoA and its metabolites. In total, 10 IVA patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. All patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 G > A (p.G123R) mutation. The amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the IVD protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of IVD enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. Despite the genetic homogeneity of this South African IVA group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state.

1027,pub.1000675144,10.1201/b11608-5,,,Alleles and Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a polygenic, complex, and disabling disease that affects joints in a symmetric and progressive manner. This disorder has a genetic component, thus predisposing genes influence both occurrence and symptom severity. Beyond predispositional genes influencing susceptibility, there also exist genes that are unrelated to etiology and still others that may have protective attributes. Contemporary research has, however, been unable to elucidate the exact mechanism by which these genes act as causatives or protective. HLA–DRβ1 represent the group of genes that have demonstrated clearly to have a significant role in the development of RA; an association that was found primarily with Stastny (1976) and established in numerous confirmatory investigations worldwide. 91The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a region located in chromosome 6 (6p21.3) that encompasses three sub-regions: HLA class I, class II, and class III. The genes HLA–DRβ1 are highly polymorphic and belong to class II, and a number appear to be key to the development and progress of RA. HLA–DR4, for example, has been the most reported gene for RA susceptibility around the world. High resolution HLA typing, has allowed researchers to find several subtypes of DR4, leading to the conclusion that not all the DR4 alleles have the same role in RA onset and progression. The shared epitope (SE) is a sequence commonly found in some HLA–DRβ1 alleles, between the amino acid residues 70 to 74, forming a part of the antigen binding site. Interestingly these alleles have been found to be RA risk factors. DRβ1⋆0401, ⋆0404, ⋆0405, and ⋆0101, for example, have been reported in several case-control and familiar studies. Other genes like TNFα, PTPN22, and those comprised in the MHC region have also been associated with RA. The mechanism by which the alleles from this region participate as immunoregulatory factors would be clarified when robust and replicable evidence at levels of cell signalling, T cells function, and serological and clinical factors are confirmed. HLA typing studies can be performed to partially achieve these objectives, usually within the context of case-control or familiar surveys. Researchers and pharmaceutical companies currently face the to elucidate the role of the molecules, receptors, and genes involved in RA, in order to produce more effective medicines and treatments to relieve the symptoms, or even to prevent the manifestation of this distressing pathology.",,,,Scientific Basis of Healthcare,"Colin R.

The approach is based on a local unmixing procedure that splits the hyperspectral scene into tiles and performs endmember extraction on each tile. The main assumption is that within a tile, a single spectral signature is an adequate representation of an endmember. Local endmember signatures from each tile are then clustered to extract endmember classes that better account for endmember spectral variability across the scene and provide a better global description of the full forest scene. Within a scene, abundances are computed using all extracted spectral endmembers and the abundance of an endmember class is computed as the sum of the abundances for the spectral endmembers belonging to that class. Variations in abundance maps are used to understand seasonal changes in forest cover. The procedure was performed using eleven near-cloud-free Hyperion images collected in different months in 2008. Results from the analysis agreed with published knowledge of the phenological changes for this forest. Correlation analyses with NDVI and rainfall time series are used to understand variations in coverage of certain endmember classes with weather. Mangrove was shown to be uncorrelated with rainfall, whereas the upland forest endmember was highly correlated with rain. This study shows the potential for unmixing methods to exploit hyperspectral data for temporal analysis.","This work was supported by the NASA EPSCoR Program under Grant NNX09AV03A, and used facilities of the Center for Subsurface Imaging Systems (CenSSIS) a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center sponsored under Award EEC-9986821, and additional support of the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry.",,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,,,,2012-12-11,2012,2012-12-11,2013-04-01,6,2,329-338,Closed,Article,"Goenaga, Miguel A.; Torres-Madronero, Maria C.; Velez-Reyes, Miguel; Van Bloem, Skip J.; Chinea, Jesus D.","Goenaga, Miguel A.

Many of these applications feature a fibrous or a porous medium that can be modeled by using capillary bundle models to predict the behavior of the electroosmotic flow within the particular system. The role of geometry in predicting volumetric flowrates in porous media is investigated by modeling the electroosmotic flow in idealized capillaries of rectangular, cylindrical, and annular geometries. This is achieved by the coupling of electrostatics and continuum hydrodynamics to obtain analytical expressions that govern the electrokinetically - driven volumetric flow within these idealized capillary geometries. A previous study developed a model to compare the cylindrical and annular capillary geometries by utilizing two methods that compare the areas of the two geometries. The methods used in this previous work will also be used in the present contribution to compare the volumetric flowrates in the cylindrical and annular capillaries with a rectangular capillary. Illustrative results will be presented to aid in the understanding of the influence of the various geometrical and electrostatic parameters that arise from the analysis of these volumetric flowrates. It was found that the electroosmotic volumetric flowrates are significantly affected by the capillary geometry.","AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to acknowledge funding for one of us (JP) through a Diversity Fellowship and through a research assistantship from the Center for the Management, Utilization and Protection of Water Resources from Tennessee Technological University.

These expectations are discussed on the basis of the archaeological record of the Puna of Argentina and Chile. This record supports the derived hypothesis that from the early Holocene to the end of the mid-Holocene, the rate of adaptive cultural evolution increased as human populations increased in size. Cultural flow was an important mechanism for the technological transfer of adaptive technological innovations between local populations connected through larger social networks which exceeded the Puna region, since the beginnings of the human colonization of the area when the risk of local extinction was high. More broadly, the archeological record of the Puna region supports the theoretical prediction that population pressure was not the cause of the major trends in cultural evolution, but the consequence. Based on this, the interrelation between population size dynamics and cultural evolution is highlighted.",AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by CONICET.

                  The San Salvador River in northern Chile is a tributary of the Loa, the only river that traverses the Atacama Desert from the mountains to the Pacific. Recent investigations along the San Salvador River revealed the presence of a Formative period village site and associated cemetery approximately 110 km inland from the Pacific Ocean. Bioarchaeological and biogeochemical analyses conducted on human skeletal remains recovered from the San Salvador Cemetery allowed us to better understand the site’s role as an intermediary for coast/interior relations during the Middle Formative (500 B.C.–A.D. 100). Evidence from material culture and human remains at San Salvador suggests that this population was involved in exchange networks that united the oases of the Atacama Desert with the Pacific Ocean. Isotopic data support this notion, as the population demonstrates great variability in both the protein (marine and terrestrial) and carbohydrate components of their diet. During this period, communal economies produced surpluses used in a network of exchange for foods, prestige goods, and ideas. These ties were not coincidental but, rather, part of a regional economic structure that remains only partly explored.
El Río San Salvador del norte de Chile es un afluente del Río Loa, el único curso de agua dulce que atraviesa el desierto de Atacama desde las montañas hasta el Pacífico. Recientes investigaciones en San Salvador revelaron la presencia de una aldea y un cementerio del periodo Formativo emplazados a unos 110 km. de la costa del Pacifico. Análisis bioantropológicos y biogeoquímicos llevados a cabo en restos óseos humanos recuperados del cementerio permitieron comprender el funcionamiento del sitio como intermediario en las relaciones entre la costa y el interior en el Formativo Medio (500 a.C.–100 d.C). La evidencia de la cultura material y de los restos humanos en San Salvador indica que esta población estuvo involucrada en las redes de intercambio que ligaban los oasis del desierto de Atacama y el Océano Pacífico. Los datos isotópicos apoyan esto, pues la población muestra una gran variabilidad tanto en el consumo de proteína (marina y terrestre) como en los componentes de carbohidratos en su dieta. Durante este período las economías comunales produjeron excedentes utilizados en una red de intercambio de alimentos, bienes de prestigio e ideas.

One challenge is encoding the data and minimise the switching activity of data in the serial links in order to reduce the additional power dissipation; while under real-time and minimal hardware constraints. Consequently, proposed is a novel low area/power decision circuit for NoC channel encoding which identifies in real-time packets for encoding and extends the existing SILENT encoders/decoders to further minimise power consumption and demonstrates the power performance savings of the decision circuit and modified (en)decoders using example test traffic with the EMBRACE NoC router, a mixed signal spiking neural network (SNNs) embedded platform.",,,International Journal of Adaptive Resilient and Autonomic Systems,,,,2012-10-01,2012,,2012-10-01,3,4,1-16,Closed,Article,"McDonnell, Neil; Carrillo, Snaider; Harkin, Jim; McDaid, Liam","McDonnell, Neil (School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Magee Campus, Northern Ireland, UK); Carrillo, Snaider (School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Magee Campus, Northern Ireland, UK); Harkin, Jim (School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Magee Campus, Northern Ireland, UK); McDaid, Liam (School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, University of Ulster, Magee Campus, Northern Ireland, UK)",,"McDonnell, Neil (University of Ulster); Carrillo, Snaider (University of Ulster); Harkin, Jim (University of Ulster); McDaid, Liam (University of Ulster)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037894099,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

CORT impaired fear conditioning (F((1,28)) = 11.52, p < 0.01) and extinction (F((1,28)) = 4.86, p < 0.05) of auditory fear learning, but did not affect visual fear conditioning. In addition, we analyzed the CORT effects on the neuronal morphology of the inferior colliculus (flat neurons, auditory mesencephalon, a key brain area for auditory processing) and superior colliculus (wide-field neurons, related to visual processing) by Golgi stain. CORT decreased dendritic arborization of inferior colliculus neurons by approximately 50%, but did not affect superior colliculus neurons. Thus, CORT had more deleterious effects on the auditory fear processing than the visual system in the brain.",AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by FONDECYT N° 1100413 and Anillo de Ciencia y Tecnología N° ADI-09 grants (Dagnino-Subiabre).,,Hearing Research,,,"Acoustic Stimulation; Animals; Conditioning, Psychological; Corticosterone; Dendrites; Fear; Inferior Colliculi; Male; Maze Learning; Models, Neurological; Photic Stimulation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stress, Physiological",2012-10-23,2012,2012-10-23,2012-12,294,1-2,104-113,Closed,Article,"Dagnino-Subiabre, Alexies; Pérez, Miguel Ángel; Terreros, Gonzalo; Cheng, Michelle Y.; House, Patrick; Sapolsky, Robert","Dagnino-Subiabre, Alexies (Laboratory of Behavioral Neurobiology, Center for Neurobiology and Brain Plasticity, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Sciences, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile; Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Pérez, Miguel Ángel (Laboratory of Behavioral Neurobiology, Center for Neurobiology and Brain Plasticity, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Sciences, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile; Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Terreros, Gonzalo (Laboratory of Behavioral Neurobiology, Center for Neurobiology and Brain Plasticity, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Sciences, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile); Cheng, Michelle Y.

The aims of this research are: (a) to quantify and analyze the household solid wastes generated in the city of Ensenada, Mexico, and (b) to project biogas production and estimate generation of electrical energy. The characterization study was conducted by socioeconomic stratification in two seasonal periods, and the biogas and electrical energy projections were performed using the version 2.0 Mexico Biogas Model. Per capita solid waste generation was 0.779 ± 0.019 kg per person per day within a 98 % confidence interval. Waste composition is composed mainly of food scraps at 36.25 %, followed by paper and cardboard at 21.85 %, plastic at 12.30 %, disposable diapers at 6.26 %, and textiles at 6.28 %. The maximum capacity for power generation is projected to be 1.90 MW in 2019. Waste generated could be used as an intermediate in different processes such as recycling (41.04 %) and energy recovery (46.63 %). The electrical energy that could be obtained using the biogas generated at the Ensenada sanitary landfill would provide roughly 60 % of the energy needed for street lighting.","This work was financed by the FOMIX CONACYT-BC.

Both procedures are compared analyzing, in both precursors, the influence that variables such as H3PO4/precursor ratio, activation temperature and impregnation time have on the resulting activated carbons (ACs) properties. The work also pays special attention to the mesoporosity development and the application of these ACs to adsorb gasoline vapors.Both H3PO4 activation procedures develop activated carbons having suitable activation yields and porosity developments, giving the Activation after Incipient Wetness Impregnation method better results than the Activation after Hydrothermal Impregnation. Both natural bio-fibers are good precursors, rendering the coconut fiber matting better results than the banana pseudostem. The variables studied affect the porosity development, being precursor and H3PO4/precursor ratio the variables that most affect. By a suitable selection of these variables, activated carbons having high adsorption capacities (BET above 2500m2g−1 and micropore volume above 1.00cm3g−1) and well developed mesoporosity (reaching 1.41cm3g−1), can be prepared.

It is a review of how psychology in South Africa developed over more than a century to become one of the most popular subjects in universities and an established and recognized profession, whose members play a variety of roles in the South African polity and larger society. The impact that apartheid racism had on key aspects of psychology's development is traversed, and the influences that previous ruling party politics had on professional psychological organizations are delineated. The unification of psychology under the Psychological Society of South Africa, a few months before the advent of democracy in South Africa, is explicated. The protection of the title of psychologist in law and certain other changes in the legislative environment, enabling a greater role for psychologists, are reported. The primary research sites for psychology and its funding and the main university psychology programs are described, as are the requirements for registration and licensure. The genesis and the importance of the work of internationally acclaimed South African psychologists, such as J. Wolpe and A. A. Lazarus, are contextualized.

To investigate which ecotypes among the diverse microbial communities could have a role in cycling arsenic in salt lakes in Northern Chile and to obtain clues to facilitate their isolation in pure culture, sediment samples from Salar de Ascotán and Salar de Atacama were cultured in diluted LB medium amended with NaCl and arsenic, at different incubation conditions. The samples and the cultures were analyzed by nucleic acid extraction, fingerprinting analysis, and sequencing. Microbial reduction of As was evidenced in all the enrichments carried out in anaerobiosis. The results revealed that the incubation factors were more important for determining the microbial community structure than arsenic species and concentrations. The predominant microorganisms in enrichments from both sediments belonged to the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla, but most of the bacterial ecotypes were confined to only one system. The occurrence of an active arsenic biogeochemical cycle was suggested in the system with the highest arsenic content that included populations compatible with microorganisms able to transform arsenic for energy conservation, accumulate arsenic, produce H2, H2S and acetic acid (potential sources of electrons for arsenic reduction) and tolerate high arsenic levels.","This work was supported by funds provided by the BBVA Foundation project BIOARSENICO and the Chilean Government through FONDECYT Project 1100795 from the Science and Technology Chilean Commission (CONICYT).

During the Middle Horizon (AD 500-1000), local populations experienced a cultural apex associated with a substantial increase in inter-regional interaction, population density, and quantity and quality of mortuary assemblages. Here, we test if this cultural peak affected dietary practices equally among the distinct local groups of this period. We examine caries prevalence and the degree of occlusal wear in four series recovered from three cemeteries. Our results show a reduction in the prevalence of caries for males among an elite subsample from Solcor 3 and the later Coyo 3 cemeteries. Dental wear tends to increase over time with the Late Middle Horizon/Late Intermediate Period cemetery of Quitor 6 showing a higher average degree of wear. When considered in concert with archaeological information, we concluded that the Middle Horizon was marked by dietary variability wherein some populations were able to obtain better access to protein sources (e.g., camelid meat). Not all members of Atacameño society benefited from this, as we note that this dietary change only affected men. Our results suggest that the benefits brought to the San Pedro oases during the Middle Horizon were not equally distributed among local groups and that social status, relationship to the Tiwanaku polity, and interment in particular cemeteries affected dietary composition.","The authors are grateful for the comments of two anonymous reviewers and the Associate Editor, which significantly improved this article.

Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.","We are in debt to Elliott Ramos for assistance in the field during setting up of these experiments.

AD 1450–1541). A full coverage archaeological survey was conducted in the Los Infieles area (50 km2). The survey confirmed the presence of a large mining complex focused principally on the extraction of opaline silica and chrysocolla. The materials registered during the survey suggest that each of the five mining clusters recorded at Los Infieles included at least one large site, in which similar operational sequences of mining activities were conducted. The absence of lapidary workshop remains and the small size of remaining sorted minerals at the sites also suggest that the final products obtained from the mining operations were high-quality granule and pebble size minerals. The large number of mines and their associated facilities across the Los Infieles region support the idea that during the Inca Period, chrysocolla and opaline silica had much greater economic value than scholars have thought, at least at an imperial provincial level. The evidence collected thus far also indicates that the Inca state was significantly involved in sponsoring and supporting these mining operations.","I want to express my deepest gratitude to the members of the agrarian community “Olla de Caldera,” especially to their council, for granting permission to conduct the fieldwork, and to our muleteers, Don Augusto and Rafael Robledo.

Three main sampling strategies were identified: selective, volume-reduced, and bulk sampling. Most sediment samples came from sandy beaches at the high tide line, and most seawater samples were taken at the sea surface using neuston nets. Four steps were distinguished during sample processing: density separation, filtration, sieving, and visual sorting of microplastics. Visual sorting was one of the most commonly used methods for the identification of microplastics (using type, shape, degradation stage, and color as criteria). Chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., specific density) were also used. The most reliable method to identify the chemical composition of microplastics is by infrared spectroscopy. Most studies reported that plastic fragments were polyethylene and polypropylene polymers. Units commonly used for abundance estimates are ""items per m(2)"" for sediment and sea surface studies and ""items per m(3)"" for water column studies. Mesh size of sieves and filters used during sampling or sample processing influence abundance estimates. Most studies reported two main size ranges of microplastics: (i) 500 μm-5 mm, which are retained by a 500 μm sieve/net, and (ii) 1-500 μm, or fractions thereof that are retained on filters. We recommend that future programs of monitoring continue to distinguish these size fractions, but we suggest standardized sampling procedures which allow the spatiotemporal comparison of microplastic abundance across marine environments.","We are very grateful to four anonymous reviewers who provided many constructive comments that helped to improve this manuscript.

In order to determine the sedimentary environment, paleobathymetry, and age of these deposits, we carried out integrated sedimentologic, ichnologic, and micropaleontologic studies on samples from oil wells and outcrops in the region. Our results indicate that these successions were deposited at lower-bathyal depths (>2000 m) during the middle to late Miocene. Shallow-marine deposition followed in the southwestern part of the study area during the Pliocene(?). We attribute deep-marine sedimentation in this area to a major event of subsidence in the Miocene that affected the entire forearc and that was caused by basal subduction erosion. We suggest that the anomalously thin crust that characterizes this area may have facilitated forearc subsidence and allowed the Miocene transgression to advance much farther inland here than in other regions of Chile. Subsequent uplift of the forearc is ascribed to basal accretion or underplating of sediments. Our conclusions contradict previous studies that favor a stable margin at these latitudes since the Jurassic. Deep-marine sedimentation in this area during the Miocene implies that the present Coastal Cordillera and Longitudinal Depression were probably submerged during that epoch.",,,Geological Society of America Bulletin,,,,2012-03-20,2012,2012-03-20,2012-07-01,124,7-8,1262-1277,Closed,Article,"Encinas, Alfonso; Finger, Kenneth L.; Buatois, Luis A.; Peterson, Dawn E.","Encinas, Alfonso (Departamento de Ciencias de la Tierra, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile); Finger, Kenneth L.

The tree topology resulting from morphological and combined analyses places Betaeus jucundus as sister to all the remaining species of Betaeus and Betaeopsis, rendering Betaeus paraphyletic. On the other hand, Betaeopsis is recovered as monophyletic. Betaeus australis is positioned as sister to the remaining species of Betaeus s. str. (excluding B. jucundus), which is composed of three well-supported and resolved clades. Mapping of biogeographic traits on the combined tree suggests at least two possible historic scenarios. In the first scenario, the North-East Pacific harboring the highest diversity of hooded shrimps (seven species of Betaeus), acted as the ""center of origin"", where species appeared, matured and eventually migrated toward peripheral regions. In the second scenario, Betaeus+Betaeopsis originated in the southern Indo-West Pacific and subsequently colonized the North-East Pacific, where a major radiation involving dispersal/vicariance events took place. The mapping of life history traits (symbiosis vs. free living and gregariousness vs. single/pair living) in the combined tree suggests (1) that different types of symbioses with dissimilar host organisms (sea urchins, abalones, other decapods, spoon worms) evolved independently more than once in the group (in B. jucundus and in various lineages of Betaeus s. str.), and (2) that gregariousness was ancestral in the Betaeus s. str. -Betaeopsis clade and later shifted toward single/pair living in several lineages.","AcknowledgmentsJ.A.B. was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from SMSFP.

Balanitis and balanoposthitis can develop from several causes, and those related to infectious agents (particularly Candida) are commonly observed in medical practice. Bacterial flora from the skin of the perineum, penis, and urethra is mostly comprised of Gram-positive cocci and diphtheroids, and members of the genera Candida and Malassezia comprise the opportunistic yeast that inhabit human genital skin. Moreover, several specific pathogens (including bacteria, virus, yeast, and parasites) may colonize human genital skin and cause anogenital disease, with transmission occurring via sexual and nonsexual routes. In this Chapter, mostly nonsexually transmitted infections are discussed, although some organisms reviewed here may also be transmitted through sexual contact (e.g., tuberculosis, molluscum contagiosum, cutaneous and deep mycoses, pediculosis pubis, scabies, and genital amebiasis).",,,,Male Genital Lesions,,,2012-06-15,2012,2012-06-15,2013,,,167-211,Closed,Chapter,"Rosenblatt, Alberto; de Campos Guidi, Homero Gustavo; Belda, Walter","Rosenblatt, Alberto (Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital (HIAE), Av.

It places these rallies in the context of these organisations' adoption of confrontational and public forms of protest after 1972. These represent a high-water mark in Black Consciousness organisation and provided the excuse for the state's prosecution of the leaders of the movement. Despite this, these rallies have been understudied. This article therefore presents a new account of these protests. It shows how the leaders of SASO and the BPC progressively revised their ideas about public confrontation through the process of organising these rallies. After the Minister of Justice announced his intention to ban them, these leaders refused to back down. The rallies each took place as planned, and each provoked a response from local police forces – which, in turn, were clearly expecting the rallies and prepared for the task of dispersing them. This article suggest that the embrace of confrontational forms of protest by SASO and the BPC should be understood as representing a significant moment in the development of public forms of mass protest in South Africa.",,,Journal of Southern African Studies,,,,2012-03,2012,,2012-03,38,1,55-71,Closed,Article,"Brown, Julian","Brown, Julian (NRF Chair in Local Histories and Present Realities, University of the Witwatersrand)",,"Brown, Julian (University of the Witwatersrand)",18,13,,5.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035571986,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

                  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals causing significant health burden worldwide. Clinical reports have shown that infants infected with RSV suffer CNS disorders like seizures; central apnea, lethargy, feeding or swallowing difficulties, abnormalities of tone or strabismus, abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and encephalopathy . Whether these CNS disorders result from either RSV replication or immune system reactivity at nervous tissue is still unknown. In this context, clarifying RSV entry, localization and spread on CNS will seed insights on RSV neuropathology. Preliminary evidences have shown the presence of viral RNA and anti-RSV antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected host.

The W-L SoHO C2 Lasco coronagraph observations were made under the 2.2 solar radii (R0) occulting disk to look at the ultimate sources of the SW; EUV imagers are preferably devoted to the analysis of the corona on and very near the solar disk. Here, in addition to eclipse white-light (W-L) snapshots, we used the new SWAP space-borne imager designed for the systematic survey of coronal activity in the EUV lines near 17.4 nm, over a field of view (FOV) up to 2 R0. Using summed and co-aligned images, the corona can then be evaluated for the 1st time up to the limit of this FOV. At the time of the July 11, 2010, solar total eclipse a 20h continuous run of observations was collected, including images taken during eclipse totality from several ground observing locations where W-L data were collected.

In nature, only the hexagonal, hBN, exists. In practice, high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) synthesis has to be used to produce small cBN crystals. For larger size machining inserts, the powder-like cBN crystals need to be sintered at specific HPHT conditions using a metallic binder. The present work investigates the sintering of cBN inserts using a Ti-based binder at 7 GPa of pressure and 1800°C.

The fractures surrounding sub-Saharan land reform are most obvious in the south, where the land question traces its roots to racially motivated colonial policies. The South African government, like others in the region, is attempting to combat landlessness through market-led land reform. This article assesses the implementation of the country’s Land Restitution Programme in the Polokwane district. Its main argument is that the modernist mega-narratives, which inform the programme, create a disconnect between the state and the landless. To address this problem, the article proposes a reorientation in which local narratives will replace theoretical mega-narratives at the centre of land reform programmes.",,,Progress in Development Studies,,,,2012-06-28,2012,2012-06-28,2012-07,12,2-3,173-191,Closed,Article,"Logan, B.

The shocks under analysis occurred on 21 April 2007, 14 November 2007 and 27 February 2010, in the north, south and center of Chile, respectively. The impacts are measured as the difference between the predicted and the effectively observed volume of visitor arrivals after the quakes in each Region. The predictions are computed using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models on monthly visitor arrivals during the period January 2004 to June 2010. The results indicate that the impacts depend on the magnitude of the earthquake, the perception of safety generated by news coverage and the type of tourism characterizing the region where the earthquake has occured. In the case of the most recent earthquake of 27 February 2010, the recovering status of visitors arrivals is studied, showing that the inbound arrivals to some regions have fully recovered from the devastation after 4 months while other regions have not.","The authors greatfully acknowledge the comments made by the anonymous referee.

This paper analyzes the relation between gender role beliefs and prejudice toward gay men and lesbians in Chile. Participants were Chilean university students (N = 283). Results indicate that men are more prejudiced than women and religious people are more prejudiced than non-religious people. On the other hand, gender role beliefs mediate sex differences in prejudice. The participants' more traditional gender role beliefs hold more negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Men are more prejudiced than women, particularly in their attitudes toward gay men. In addition, sex differences in attitudes toward lesbians and gay men are mediated by gender role beliefs.",This article was supported by Project Fondecyt 1110423 (“Homophobia and psychosocial effects in the quality of life in gay men and lesbians: Towards a comprehensive model”).,,International Journal of Sexual Health,,,,2012-07,2012,,2012-07,24,3,226-236,Closed,Article,"Cárdenas, Manuel; Barrientos, Jaime; Gómez, Fabiola; Frías-Navarro, Dolores","Cárdenas, Manuel (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Barrientos, Jaime (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez, Fabiola (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Frías-Navarro, Dolores (Departamento de Metodología y Ciencias del Comportamiento, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain)","Cárdenas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)","Cárdenas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Barrientos, Jaime (Catholic University of the North); Gómez, Fabiola (Catholic University of the North); Frías-Navarro, Dolores (University of Valencia)",24,1,,3.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026485153,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,5 Gender Equality

A possible solution is to incorporate into construction products such as clayey ceramics. Thus, the main objective of this work was to evaluate the firing behavior of a kaolinitic clayey body from Campos dos Goytacazes-RJ incorporated with flat glass waste (FGW) from civil construction. The characterization of the FGW was done by X-ray Fluorescence and optical dilatometry. Compositions were prepared with 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 wt.% of FGW incorporated into the clayey body. Specimens were prepared by uniaxial press-molding and then fired at 850 and 1050°C. The microstructural changes due to the firing process were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (DRX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The reactive mixture was prepared with 50 wt% graphite and 50 wt% Ni-Mn followed by doping of 2 to 5wt% of pure iron. The synthesis was performed inside an anvil type high pressure device. After extraction and purification, the paramagnetic properties of the diamond crystals were evaluated by specific techniques at room temperature. It was found that the diamond synthesized with different iron content exhibit different paramagnetic properties. The data obtained by infrared spectroscopy and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy are coincident for radiation defects and different for nitrogen centers. The spectra of the electron spin resonance exhibited broad lines produced by residual impurities of Fe compounds together with catalyst alloy and were accompanied by a distortion of the spectrum of paramagnetic nitrogen in the form of a tilt of the ESR spectra with respect to the zero line.",,,Materials Science Forum,,,,2012-08,2012,2012-08,2012-11-14,727-728,,1360-1363,Closed,Article,"Skury, Ana Lúcia Diegues; Bobrovinichii, Guerold S.; Monteiro, Sergio N.; Rodrigues, Quesia F.S.

We show that the interference of localized electron states with resonant electron states leads to the appearance of the Fano–Rashba effect. This effect occurs due to the interference of bound levels of spin-polarized electrons with the continuum of electronic states with an opposite spin polarization.

The catalyst agent also acts as a carbon solvent and affects the properties of the final product. This is a consequence of its direct influence on the growth of diamonds crystals. The control of the growth, which is required to achieve a high quality level, is still a question open to discussion. In this work, an industrial diamond powder was synthesized from graphite using Ni-Mn as catalyst alloy added with up to 5% of iron. The synthesis was carried out at 4.5GPa and 1300°C for 10 minutes in high pressure device with central concavity. The analysis of the cubic-shaped diamond surface topography suggests that the formation of defects on the {111} faces is most likely a consequence of a complex growth process that influences the crystal productivity and morphology.",,,Materials Science Forum,,,,2012-08,2012,2012-08,2012-11-14,727-728,,1345-1348,Closed,Article,"Skury, Ana Lucia D.; Rodrigues, Quesia F.S.F.; Bobrovinitchii, Guerold Sergueevitch; Monteiro, Sérgio Neves","Skury, Ana Lucia D.

Members of this industry face several challenges in designing sustainable mineral operations with lower environmental and social impacts while remaining profitable. These challenges must be addressed in the design, operation and postclosure phases, but the design phase affords the greatest opportunity to reduce the impact of operations and increase profits.Some of the most important challenges are the efficient use of water and energy. For example, because of the decline in ore grades in mineral concentration is being used to reduce the particle size to increase the mineral liberation. However, this increase in grinding increases energy consumption and affects the water recovery in the dewatering stages. This manuscript examines these and other effects through process simulation of a flotation plant for copper ores. Based on these simulations, the relationship between particle size, energy consumption, and water recovery is established. This makes it possible to explore the trade-off between energy, liberation, and water recovery.","AcknowledgementThe financial support from CONICYT (Fondecyt 1090406), CICITEM (R10C1004) and the Antofagasta Regional Government is gratefully acknowledged.",,Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,22nd European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering,,,2012,2012,,2012,30,,627-631,Closed,Chapter,"Donoso, Marcela; Mellado, Mario E.; Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Donoso, Marcela (University College London, UK Dept. of Chemical and Mineral Process Engn., Universidad de Antofagasta.

The validation is simple, and a sensitivity analysis can easily be performed. The simplicity of the analysis provides insight into the control and optimization of the heap leaching process without strong mathematical complexities. The model and the corresponding sensitivity analysis include the effects of heap height, particle sizes, flow rates and several operation-design variables. Using a case study, we discuss the importance of model validation based on sensitivity analysis. We also comment on several choices for optimizing the process. We had three goals in this work: a posteriori validation, highlighting the importance of model validation and providing insight into optimization choices.

This applies to legislation, institutional systems and planning education. In 2008, the Association of African Planning Schools AAPSs embarked on a 3-year initiative on the revitalisation of planning education in Africa, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The aim of the project was to propose ways through which the training of urban planners can be more responsive to the special circumstances of African urbanisation. This paper reflects on this initiative.An initial outline is presented on the main challenges facing planners in urban Africa and is positioned within debates regarding the role of planning and planners more generally. A special case is made for the importance of planning in addressing these issues. It does, however, require a departure from the traditional approaches to planners’ training. There are constraints to this. The circumstances that inform planning education in AAPS member schools and the challenges that underpin this endeavour are outlined, based upon information gathered on visits to, and input from member schools and associated publications on planning education in Africa. Findings inform a number of recommendations made on the shifts required if urban planning is to be relevant and effective in the face of current and future urbanisation challenges on the continent.",,,Cities,,,,2012-06,2012,,2012-06,29,3,174-182,Closed,Article,"Odendaal, Nancy","Odendaal, Nancy (School of Architecture, Planning and Geomatics, African Centre for Cities, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa)","Odendaal, Nancy (University of Cape Town)","Odendaal, Nancy (University of Cape Town)",48,6,,11.17,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020760633,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 4 Quality Education

These have to deal with: participants and knowledge holders; language used in research; interviews and observations; familiarity (or lack thereof) with the knowledge holders; mathematical analysis of cultural artefacts; etc. Knowledge in this field engages with indigenous knowledge systems. This article primarily deals with indigenous games which the author researched. He proceeds to explore questions which arose and to provide possible solutions. The author also reflects on and analyses other studies that have grappled with the questions and draws on the implications and insights of these studies in constructing the suggested answers.

As a bright and high-velocity object, 82 Eri was already realized by Jan Hendrik Oort in his 1926 treatise to be of ‘probably different origin’ and we confirm its being a member of the ancient thick-disc population on account of its outstanding iron-to-magnesium deficiency.

The companies cultivating H. rufescens in Chile utilize plastic plates, colonized by a mixture of diatoms, as settlement substrate and food for larvae, but with poor results on abalone survival and growth. Here, we report the utilization of recruitment plates conditioned with Ulva sp. germlings, in order to evaluate larval settlement, survival and growth rate of H. rufescens postlarvae. The results were compared with traditional methods as control. Settlement was lower with Ulva sp. (52 ± 3%) than the control treatment (86 ± 2%). However, at Day 15, the post‐larval survival in the control group was lower than the Ulva sp. treatment, reaching 59 ± 18% and 77 ± 8%, respectively. Survival decreased on Day 30 in both treatments. The specific growth rate of the postlarvae was higher in plates conditioned with Ulva sp. (1.9 ± 0.1% growth/d), than control plates (0.8 ± 0.1% growth/d). Our results support the use of germlings of Ulva sp. on plastic plates as a good option for the cultivation of the first stage of development of the red abalone, improving the post‐larval growth rate, with a positive impact on commercial farms.",We are grateful to the Marine Botany Laboratory staff of the Universidad Católica del Norte for practical support.

The model's intersecting and nested continua demonstrate multiple, complex, and fluid interrelationships between bilingualism and literacy and the contexts, media, and content through which biliteracy develops.

For pore networks undergoing strong random compaction, this length becomes singular at transition porosities, revealing a change in the microstructure of the porespace controlling the transport. Nodal balances and lattice Boltzmann simulations of flow in pore networks under compaction show that the scaling between permeability and porosity changes near the transition porosities. Simulation results are compared with experimental permeability data from transparent two-dimensional micromodels of networks decorated with the same pore size distribution. Permeability–porosity data of media undergoing smooth compaction is well described by a single power law. Under strong compaction, however, the scaling between permeability and porosity is possible by traits only, the scaling exponent changes notably at given transition porosities. These behaviors are common to a wealth of permeability–porosity data thus far unexplained.",,,Transport in Porous Media,,,,2012-11-27,2012,2012-11-27,2013-01,96,2,429-438,Closed,Article,"Rozas, R.

Basically these changes consist of an organic phase incorporation as well as changes in temperature and pH profiles. The resulting conditions have an effect on the following stages and more importantly on the behavior of the microbial community.The influence of the increase in temperature and acidity during solvent extraction on a mixed culture of bioleaching microorganisms was investigated. The effect of both factors was tested separately and together, where temperature was increased from 20 to 30°C and pH was decreased from 2.0 to 1.5 and then to 1.0 (according to SX plant data). At the same time, the effect of an organic phase composed of 24% LIX 84IC as the extractant and Oxform SX12 as the solvent on the same microbial community was studied. Quantitative and qualitative changes of the microbial population were investigated using optical microscopy, MPN (Most Probable Number) and qPCR.Decreasing pH had a stronger negative effect on biomass numbers and activity (oxidation of ferrous iron) than temperature that showed almost no effect. Total cell number and activity decreased around one and one and a half orders of magnitude respectively when pH decreased to 1.0.The number of active ferrous iron-oxidizing cells was reduced more by contact with the organic phase than by the decrease in pH, and the detrimental impact of both stress factors together was even greater (decrease of over two orders of magnitude at pH 1.0). The increase of the SX agent concentration further decreased the number of active iron-oxidizing cells. On the other hand, the decrease in the organic extractant concentration did not show a significant improvement in the measured iron-oxidizing activity. Relatively constant cell numbers were recovered from the organic phase after contact, with the predominance of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans.Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and Alicyclobacillus spp. showed the smallest decrease in cell numbers of all the species quantified when acidity was increased and during contact with the organic extractant.The results gathered in this study show the clear impact of SX on bioleaching communities, and therefore possible influences on subsequent downstream stages. Preventing the leakage of organic extractant from the SX step to the following stages is essential to minimize the deteriorating effect of this agent on the overall microbial activity.",AcknowledgmentThis work was fully funded by BHP Billiton Chile S.A.

Crustaceans are benthic marine resources highly exploited in Chile. Brachyuran crabs are of particular interest and in Chile are commercialized with different processing and presentations. Generally, Chilean brachyuran crab-meat commercial packages do not include taxonomic information, which in addition to the loss of diagnostic characters during the processing, impedes the identification of species being commercialized. The goal of this study was to determine which brachyuran species are being commercialized in the Chilean market using DNA Barcoding and phylogenetic analysis. For authentication of commercial crab-meat and DNA Barcoding a partial sequence of the Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene of seven commercialized brachyuran species in Chile were used. For authentication, samples were obtained from seven commercial formats available on the local market in Coquimbo, Chile. Most commercial packages contained more than one species of crab. The Species detected in order of frequency are Metacarcinus edwardsii, Romaleon polyodon, Cancer porteri, Cancer plebejus, and Homalaspis plana. Mislabeling was detected in one of the commercial formats that declared including meat from Cancer species. The procedure presented herein, based on standard DNA Barcoding as well as phylogenetic analyses, can be used for the normative control of crab-meat processed products.",AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by grant INNOVA 07CT9 PDT-79.

This pursues the improvement of the understandability of the internal model operation, which is a key issue in pattern exploration data mining tasks. This exploratory visualization is based on the well-known technique named Treemap (maps of trees), that allows representing hierarchical structures like DTs, in which grids are used to represent their node structure. The proposed visualization represents the number of instances or weight associated to a node with a color scale in degradation, using either 2D o 3D views of the data-mining model. In this sense, this work main contribution is to introduce a new visualization scheme that allow humans a better understandability of how the data mining models work internally.",,,,"2012 IEEE Ninth Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference",,,2012-11-01,2012,,2012-11-01,,,203-210,Closed,Proceeding,"Rojas, Wilson Andrés Castillo; Villegas, Claudio Meneses","Rojas, Wilson Andrés Castillo (Universidad Arturo Prat, Chile); Villegas, Claudio Meneses (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile)",,"Rojas, Wilson Andrés Castillo (Arturo Prat University); Villegas, Claudio Meneses (Catholic University of the North)",2,1,,0.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093549808,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4607 Graphics, Augmented Reality and Games",

We investigated the effects of rat predation on Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) by simulating unattended clutches with domestic Chicken eggs. Experiments were independently set at two Humboldt Penguin colonies in north (Pájaros Island, 29°S) and central Chile (Algarrobo Island, 33°S). At both colonies, eggs were primarily predated by rats (Rattus rattus = 70.8 % at Pájaros and Rattus norvegicus = 52.6 % at Algarrobo), and secondarily by Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus = 9.7 % at Pájaros and 15.8 % at Algarrobo). Significantly more eggs were predated at night. At both colonies, rates of rat and gull predation were highest within the first 12 h. Our study constitutes the first quantification of rats as important alien predators at Humboldt Penguin colonies. We suggest that rat presence at Humboldt Penguin colonies coupled with events that can cause temporary nest abandonment, such as human perturbation and El Niño events, may impact on the species’ breeding success. Eradication of rats is suggested to improve the nesting habitat of this and other threatened and endemic seabird species in the region.","We are indebted to R.

Recently, the authors have presented analytical models for heap leaching that describe time scales for the particle and the heap in a rather simple model but with enough accuracy to be applied in the planning, optimisation, control and design of heap leaching. The simplicity of these models allows us to overcome the mathematical complexities of partial differential equation-based models and the error of empirical models. In this work, we present these analytical models, and then show how uncertainty in the input variables and parameters affects the response of the process by comparing the response curve with fixed parameters to the ones with uncertainty. Here we present simulation experiments of heap leaching processes under uncertainties based upon analytical models and using Monte Carlo techniques. We conclude that, in some cases, there exists an important influence of the input variables’ uncertainty on the response of the heap leaching process.",AcknowledgementsMario E.

The heterosupramolecular polymeric materials obtained were characterized by chemical, spectroscopic, and morphological methods. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) patterns of films indicate not only the homogeneous distribution of the components but also the morphological changes induced by the metal. Raman and UV-visible spectroscopic analysis as well as ionic conductivity after incorporation of ion–lithium point to a competition between metal–polymer end polymer–polymer interactions, which may be, to some extent, regulated by the nature and concentration of the metal. Due to the antiseptic effects of CS and noble metal nanoparticles, separately or synergistically coupled, the films produced would be potentially useful for designing tailor-made bioactive surfaces.","Research partially funded by FONDECYT (Contracts 1090282, 1070195), Basal Financing Program CONICYT, FB0807 (CEDENNA), Millennium Science Nucleus, Basic and Applied Magnetism Grant No. P10-061-F.",,Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals,,,,2012-07-30,2012,2012-07-30,2012-08-22,562,1,229-241,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, S.; Vera, V.; Rivera, F.; Moreno, M.; Benavente, E.; Gonzalez, G.","Fuentes, S.

Our study uses the analytical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for cutoff Gaussian wavepackets incoming at the system. We find that the wavepacket evolution is governed by a dynamical Fano profile, which is a transient structure that travels embedded in the scattered wavepacket, whose shape and time evolution can be controlled by manipulations of the Aharonov–Bohm phase of the device. We demonstrate analytically that this transient structure is characterized by the energy and width associated to the Fano resonance. At long times and distances from the interaction region, the transient oscillatory structures fades away and both the Breit–Wigner resonance and Fano line-shape are fully imprinted on the Gaussian pulse.","AcknowledgmentsR.R. and J.V. acknowledge financial support of Facultad de Ciencias UABC under grant P/PIFI 2011-02MSU0020A-08; R.R. also thanks the Physics Department of the UCN for their generous support during his stays in Antofagasta.

Seriolella violacea is a pelagic fish, native from the easterly South Pacific Ocean. This species has shown desirable behavioral and metabolic characteristics under captivity conditions, which leaded the Marine Fish Laboratory from the UCN to increase its efforts on the research and development to validate S. violacea as a new aquaculture option. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the excretion rates of palm fish juveniles weighing 300–500g at two different temperatures: 14°C and 18°C. Total ammonia as nitrogen (TAN) excreted was 4.4±0.9 and 7.1±1.9mgTAN/kgfish/h for 14°C and 18°C respectively. The experiments were carried out in a recirculating system operating as a farm-like situation. Tests were performed in 1000L rearing tanks operating as open respirometers. The results of the present study indicate that TAN excretion rates on S. violacea juveniles, is temperature dependent. Data obtained in these experiments are valuable information for the engineering design of land based aquaculture systems for palm fish.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Aquaculutre Department from Universidad Católica del Norte for all the support and specially the technical personal from Marine Fish Laboratory.

Our analysis reveals that the formation and decay of a quasistationary state at the Fano resonance produces a monochromatic emission embedded in the transmitted packet, characterized by a dominant frequency Ωav=ɛn/ℏ with a finite time duration, where ɛn is the Fano resonance energy. We demonstrate that the duration of this coherent emission can be extended by narrowing the Fano resonance with appropriate variations of the Aharonov-Bohm phase. This emission is switched off in the limit of zero width, where the localization of the associated molecular state occurs.",R.R. and J.V. acknowledge financial support of Facultad de Ciencias UABC under Grant No. P/PIFI 2011-02MSU0020A-08.

The title, Leetong, has become a part of the conceptual political lexicon of the Sesotho language to refer to the corruption of apartheid ideology. This collection of short stories constitutes a body of protest fiction based on inferences from situations rather than actual incidents. Collectively the eight short stories combine to form one voice in contention with the political dispensation of oppressed South Africans during a particular historical era of political oppression, known as the apartheid era. The dehumanisation of black South Africans has not stopped since the apartheid era because the dominant image of black South Africans continues to be that of heathens. This article postulates the notion that the scheme of the short story volume Leetong [On a Journey] has created a powerful metonymy, to the extent that whenever one alludes to the title, one conjures up images associated with oppression.",,,Journal of Literary Studies,,,,2012-06,2012,,2012-06,28,2,68-82,Closed,Article,"Seema, Johannes","Seema, Johannes ()",,"Seema, Johannes ()",1,0,,2.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013304672,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

We assume that the subspace $$ \mathfrak{v} $$ is invariant under D. With this hypothesis we show a process to determine the solution of $$ {\mathcal{S}_G} $$ through every state x = yv; where v is any admissible initial condition on V.

To manage patient data in CCR, security as governed by HIPAA must be attained when using XML and its technologies (XACML, XSLT, etc.). Our objective is to have an XML document (CCR instance) appear differently to authorized users at different times based on a user's role, constraints, separation of duty, delegation of authority, etc. In this paper, we propose a security framework that targets XML schemas and documents, in general, and CCR schemas and documents, in particular with control capabilities that achieve customizable access to an XML document's elements by applying secure software engineering methodologies and defining new UML XML-focused diagrams for schemas and permissions. This allows us to generate XACML policies, and enforce security at the runtime level on XML instances to insure that correct and required patient data is securely delivered. In a market of rapidly emerging mobile healthcare applications to allow patients to manage their own data (PHRs) and for self-management of chronic diseases, the need for secure access to information and its authorization and transmission to providers (and EHRs) will be critical.",,,,2012 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops,,,2012-10-01,2012,,2012-10-01,,,782-789,Closed,Proceeding,"De la Rosa Algarín, Alberto; Berhe, Solomon; Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.; Demurjian, Steven A.","De la Rosa Algarín, Alberto (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA); Berhe, Solomon (Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA); Pavlich-Mariscal, Jaime A.

Following [8, Gajardo et al. Minimal Time Sequential Batch Reactors with Bounded and Impulse Controls for One or More Species. SIAM J. Control and Optimization, vol. 47, Issue 6, pp. 2827–2856, 2008], we allow controls to be bounded measurable functions of time plus possible impulses. A suitable modification of the dynamics leads to a slightly different optimal control problem, without impulsive controls, for which we apply different optimality conditions derived from the Pontryagin principle and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We thus characterize the singular arcs of our problem as the extremal trajectories keeping the substrate at a constant level. We also establish conditions for which a “immediate one impulse” (IOI) strategy is optimal. Some numerical experiences are then included in order to show that those conditions are also necessary to ensure the optimality of the IOI strategy.","Supported by FONDECYT under grants No.1080173 (P.

As Cusicanqui demonstrates, this truncated recognition subordinates indigenous people, depriving them of their contemporaneity, complexity, and dynamism and, therefore, of their potential to challenge the given order. Coloniality and its relations of domination, she claims, are also reproduced in the knowledge production of academic scholars of decoloniality, primarily from the global North. These academics, she argues, appropriate the language and ideas of indigenous scholars without grappling with the relations of force that define their relationships to them, thus decontextualizing and depoliticizing these concepts and marginalizing indigenous scholars from their own debates. Counterposing the Aymara concept of ch'ixi—a parallel coexistence of difference—to multiculturalism and hybridity, which incorporates and flattens or distorts difference, Cusicanqui shows that decolonization must be not only a discourse but also an affirmative practice.",,,South Atlantic Quarterly,,,,2012-01-01,2012,,2012-01-01,111,1,95-109,Closed,Article,"Cusicanqui, Silvia Rivera","Cusicanqui, Silvia Rivera ()",,"Cusicanqui, Silvia Rivera ()",531,193,,314.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007320352,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

Nevertheless, this approach does not describe the eventual effects on living organisms. The aim of this study was to couple two monitoring tools for environmental diagnostics: the chemical tool, metal concentrations in hard-bottom sediments; and the ecological tool, observations of invertebrate communities inhabiting Lessonia trabeculata holdfasts. The study was conducted during austral summer, in central Chile, in a subtidal ecosystem threatened by a sewage outfall, and was compared with a nearby control zone. Environmental assessment was conducted at three different sites with distances ranging from the outfall to 60 m (there was similar site disposal in control zone). Metal levels in sediments were highest in the site closest to the outfall, decreasing with distance, and were also low in control sites. Changes found in community taxonomic diversity were consistent with the presence of the outfall, especially at 30 m away. The subtidal ecosystem was polluted. It is important to incorporate these multi- and interdisciplinary approaches to environmental research and legislation in order to obtain information that represents effects at different timescales, improves field logistics and truthfully characterises environmental conditions.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of FONDECYT (Project 11080235) and Mecesup UVA 06/04 to APM.

In addition, we set out to validate this scale using the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale Cardenas and Barrientos (The Journal of Sex Research 45(2):140–149, 2008a). Finally, we divided our sample into categories with a view to creating a typology (Egalitarian, Normative opponents, Bigots, and Individual opponents). No research to date has confirmed the hypothesized factor structure of the BCASSFS in Latin American countries. Using data from a convenience sample obtained through the application of a survey of heterosexuals at a university in northern Chile (N = 283), a model of two correlated factors was used and the fit indexes obtained. The results indicate that the BCASSFS is a valid and reliable scale for measuring beliefs about children’s adjustment in same-sex families in Chile. Moreover, the findings indicated that responses to BCASSFS could be explained by two factors (individual opposition and normative opposition) and that the two factors were correlated. Finally, differences between “egalitarian,” “normative opponents,” “bigots,” and “individual opponents” in the ATLG scale were examined, statistically significant differences being found between groups in the ATL and ATG subscales.",,,Sexuality Research and Social Policy,,,,2012-12-08,2012,2012-12-08,2013-03,10,1,43-51,Closed,Article,"Barrientos, Jaime; Cárdenas, Manuel; Gómez, Fabiola; Frías-Navarro, Dolores","Barrientos, Jaime (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Cárdenas, Manuel (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez, Fabiola (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Frías-Navarro, Dolores (Facultad de Psicología, Departamento de Metodología y Ciencias del Comportamiento, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, España)","Barrientos, Jaime (Catholic University of the North)","Barrientos, Jaime (Catholic University of the North); Cárdenas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Gómez, Fabiola (Catholic University of the North); Frías-Navarro, Dolores (University of Valencia)",18,2,,5.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022532025,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

Survey design and first results on 50 square degrees monitored in 2011,"Abstract  We are monitoring a 6° wide stripe along the southern Galactic disk simultaneously in the r and i bands, using a robotic 15‐cm twin telescope of the Universitätsternwarte Bochum near Cerro Armazones in Chile. Utilising the telescope's 2.7° field of view, the survey aims at observing a mosaic of 268 fields once per month and to monitor dedicated fields once per night. The survey reaches a sensitivity from 10 m down to 18 m (AB system), with a completeness limit of r ∼ 15.5 m and i ∼ 14.5 m which – due to the instrumental pixel size of 2.″4 – refers to stars separated by >3″. This brightness range is ideally suited to examine the intermediately bright stellar population supposed to be saturated in deep variability surveys with large telescopes. To connect to deep surveys or to explore faint long term variables, coadded images of several nights reach a depth of ∼ 20 m . The astrometric accuracy is better than 1″, as determined from the overlap of neighbouring fields. We describe the survey design, the data properties and our procedures to derive the light curves and to extract variable stars. We present a list of ∼2200 variable stars identified in 50 square degrees with 50‐80 observations between May and October 2011. For bright stars the variability amplitude A reaches down to A ∼ 0.05 m , while at the faint end variations of A > 1 m are detected. About 200 stars were known tobe variable, and their amplitudes and periods – as far as determinable from our six month monitoring – agree with literature values, demonstrating the performance of the Bochum Galactic Disk Survey (© 2012 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the northern area of the country, the fishery of brown seaweeds has an enormous social, ecological, and economical importance. More than 11,000 people depend directly or indirectly on the collection and harvesting of this resource. Ecologically, kelps constitute areas for food, reproduction, and refuge for hundreds of invertebrates and fish species. Economically, landings up to 300,000 dry tons per year represent close to US $60 million for the industry. Until 2002, the Chilean brown seaweed fishery was mainly sustained by natural mortality, where plants cast ashore were collected by artisanal fishermen. Since then, three brown seaweed species of economic importance (Lessonia nigrescens, Lessonia trabeculata, and Macrocystis pyrifera) have been intensively harvested in coastal areas between 18° and 32° S. To manage kelp populations along the northern Chilean coast, regulations have been based on the principle “how you harvest is more important than how much you harvest”. This exploitation strategy has been adopted in consensus between fishermen, industries, governmental entities, and scientists. Since L. nigrescens represents more than 70% of total brown seaweed landings, this study tests the effects of L. nigrescens harvesting on the following population variables: (1) abundance, (2) distribution, (3) juvenile recruitment, (4) plant morphology, (5) frequency of reproductive plants, and (6) biodiversity of the macroinvertebrate community associated to kelp holdfasts. Our results show that, despite the enormous harvesting pressure on Lessonia density and biomass, the associated macroinvertebrate richness has been maintained, due to normal plant growth and high recruitment all year round.","We thank Fondo de Investigación Pesquera FIP-Chile for supporting the project FIP-2006-25, FIP 2008-38 to JAV.

Mining capitalists and colonial, as well as apartheid, governments tended to resist urban permanence, but they were usually unable to stop it. Economists and social anthropologists, being less conscious than historians of the cyclical nature of mining, have been prone to discount the remarkable tenacity of the Zambian Copperbelt's urban residents in the face of mining downturns. By contrast, very little attention in the literature has been paid to the decline of gold mining in South Africa. In view of the Zambian precedent for urban resilience, it would be unwise to overlook the continuing influence of South African mining on urban settlement in spite of the industry's gradual decline over the last four decades. The patterns of development of new platinum mines in South Africa and new copper mines in Zambia show certain similarities and historical continuities, including a reluctance on the part of mining companies to accept responsibility for the housing and welfare of all their workers and their families.",,,Journal of Contemporary African Studies,,,,2012-10,2012,,2012-10,30,4,539-550,Closed,Article,"Macmillan, Hugh","Macmillan, Hugh (African Studies Centre, Oxford University)","Macmillan, Hugh (African Studies Centre, Oxford University)","Macmillan, Hugh (African Studies Centre, Oxford University)",15,2,,4.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022084828,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

A newly proposed law aims to create a Service of Biodiversity and Protected Areas that would unify the terrestrial and marine systems. The proposed law would allow the inclusion of private protected areas. Aims: We evaluate the current status of the conservation areas and propose an eco-regional plan that would allow reaching the overall target to bring 10% of all natural ecosystems under protection. Methods: A GAP analysis for all Chilean terrestrial and marine environments considered two protection scenarios: (1) public protected areas only, and (2) a combination of public and private protected areas. Afterwards, a multi-scale MARXAN assessment including 1367 conservation objects was carried out to identify suitable protected areas. Results: Chile does not meet its conservation target in four out of its 11 terrestrial eco-regions and in none of its eight marine eco-regions. To achieve the target of having 10% of all natural ecosystems (and conservation objects identified within them) under protection, an expansion of terrestrial public and private protected areas that currently cover 21.4% of Chile is required to reach 37.5%; marine protected areas need to cover 11.8% of Chile's exclusive economic zone. Conclusions: The under-represented conservation objects in protected areas in the highly biodiverse Mediterranean region require a proactive strategy towards establishing private protected areas. The proposed conservation law represents a first step in the right direction to extend the NSPA.","We thank C. Anderson, A. Poole, J.R. Gutiérrez, and L.R.

However, as the complexity of code generators grow, they tend to be harder to maintain, especially when there is a large amount of templates involved. This paper proposes an approach for code generation based on regular expression substitution. Instead of using templates for code generation, this approach transforms existing source code, using regular expression substitution, to implement the required functionality. We are currently applying this technique to strengthen the code generation framework of Heinsohn Business Technology, as part of the “Lion” project co-financed by Colciencias.

We tested this prediction in the shrimp  P aranchistus pycnodontae  , which inhabits the mantle cavity of the winged pearl oyster  P teria penguin  in the C oral T riangle. In various symbiotic crustaceans, males are smaller than females, and this sexual dimorphism has been used as evidence of sex change (protandry) in these organisms. Preliminary observations in  P a. pycnodontae  suggested that males were smaller than females. Thus, we first investigated the sexual system of  P a. pycnodontae  to determine if the species was protandric. Morphological identification and size frequency distributions indicated that the population comprised small males, small immature females and larger mature females, which was confirmed by dissections. No transitional individuals were found. Thus,  P a. pycnodontae  is a gonochoric species with reverse sexual dimorphism.  P a. pycnodontae  inhabit as heterosexual pairs in the mantle cavity of hosts more frequently than is expected by chance alone. Pairing was size assortative; both carapace length and propodus length of the major cheliped were positively correlated between males and females forming pairs. Males occur with females in the same host, independent of the female gravid condition or of the stage of development of the brooded eggs. Lastly, the major cheliped did not exhibit positive allometry in males. All the available information suggests that  P a. pycnodontae  has adopted a socially monogamous mating system with males and females forming exclusive pairs from other adults. Symbiotic shrimps can be used as a model system to understand behavioural diversity within socially monogamous marine invertebrates.","Acknowledgements This research was partially funded by the Committee for Research and Exploration Grant of the National Geographic Society (to J.A.B.).

A case study","Kelp harvesting in northern Chile is managed by local fishermen and is part of an organized industry. However, the lack of standardized harvesting protocols has made regulation difficult. This, in combination with the impacts of oceanographic disturbances has resulted in some kelp populations being considerably reduced during the last decade. Consequently, harvest methods that maintain kelp resources are sorely needed if harvesting is to remain a viable industry in Chile. Here, experiments were done to identify sustainable methods for harvesting Macrocystis pyrifera along the coast of northern Chile. Three methods were compared with regard to their impacts on kelp populations; one that involves extracting half of the fronds from each individual in a population, one that involves extracting all the fronds from half of the individuals in a population, and a third that involves extracting all the fronds from all of the individuals in a population (i.e., the method currently used). Following this, populations were evaluated over a 2-month period to monitor re-growth of the remaining individuals and recruitment of new individuals, as well as changes in understory algal diversity and herbivore abundance. Our results indicate that removing half of the fronds from each individual in a population was the best method for maintaining the resource for future harvest because, it (1) maintains rapid growth of new fronds on the harvested individuals, (2) promotes recruitment of new individuals, and (3) reduces herbivore densities through physical abrasion. Consequently, this method is recommended for future harvesting of M. pyrifera in Northern Chile.","We are grateful to Andres Deza for diving assistance in Chile, and the LABECO from the Universidad Católica del Norte, specially Alonso Vega and Nicole Piaget.

These deposits are mainly composed of nitrate, halite, sodium anorthite, and quartz. Minor species include anhydrite, glauberite, loeweite, calcite, polyhalite, probertite, and gypsum. Recently, several operations began to use heap leaching for the extraction of saltpetre. Modelling the heap leaching of caliche is not straightforward because of the many minerals and their different dissolution rates. Moreover, caliche may have a large fraction of soluble minerals, approximately 40%, which causes the heap to slump. In this work, we present two models. The first, which is a phenomenological model, is an extension of the model published by Valencia et al. (2008). The system is modelled as a column comprised of N small columns, and in each of these small columns, the height of the solids varies with time when the soluble minerals are dissolved. The liquid in each small column has the same composition (well-stirred reactor). The second model, which is an analytical model, is an extension of that published by Mellado et al. (2009) for low-grade minerals, such as copper and gold, which considers that the leaching phenomenon occurs on different scales of size and time. However, in this work, the time scale at the particle level is based on the Bruner and Tolloczko dissolution model. The objective of this work is to test the suitability of the analytical model as a tool for use in optimisation, for which the model needs to be solved many times. The phenomenological model was used to generate simulated experimental data. The results show that the analytical model may be a useful tool in optimisation.",AcknowledgmentThe authors wish to thank CONICYT for support through Project PEL 81105010.,,Minerals Engineering,,,,2012-06,2012,,2012-06,33,,46-53,Closed,Article,"Gálvez, Edelmira D.; Moreno, Luis; Mellado, Mario E.; Ordóñez, Javier I.; Cisternas, Luis A.","Gálvez, Edelmira D.

However, little is known about the genetic basis of escape responses. The estimation of the magnitude of hereditary factors affecting variation in escape responses indicates their potential to evolve by natural selection. Scallops are exceptional among bivalve molluscs because they possess an excellent swimming capacity, which helps them to escape predators. In this study we estimated the narrow-sense heritability (h2), phenotypic variance components and phenotypic and genetic correlations of several escape response traits (i.e. reaction time, number of claps (rapid valve closures and openings), and the duration and intensity of the clapping response) in juvenile Argopecten purpuratus scallops. We stimulated scallop escape responses using their natural predator, the sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus. Genetic estimates for escape response traits were determined by the animal model. Most studied traits showed substantial amounts of additive genetic variance controlling their phenotypic variation (CVA=18.43–100.2), were repeatable (at least over a short period, R=0.36–0.42), and had significant heritabilities (h2=0.36–0.57). Indeed, it can be inferred that most of the analysed escape response traits of A. purpuratus could evolve through natural selection. Moreover, significant genetic correlations between some escape response traits were observed, suggesting that selection acting on one escape trait will affect that of another, facilitating their coevolution.","AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to C.

Are positive plant–plant interactions more frequent than negative interactions in Antarctic ecosystems? Are microclimatic modifications by cushions of  U . antarctica  responsible for the nurse effect?    Location  Two sites in A ntarctica: K ing G eorge I sland, S outh S hetland (62°11′ S, 58°56′ W; 62°11′ S, 58°59′ W).    Methods  We evaluated the association of plant species with  U . antarctica  cushions by recording species growing – in equivalent areas – within and outside  U . antarctica  cushions. Additionally, we performed transplant experiments with  D eschampsia antarctica  individuals to assess if  U . antarctica  cushions enhance plant survival. In both study sites we monitored temperature, moisture and nutrient status of soil outside and within the cushions to provide insights into potential mechanisms underlying possible interactions between  U . antarctica  and other plant species.    Results  Eight out of 13 species were positively associated with cushions of the widespread lichen  U . antarctica  , while only one species (  U . aurantiaco‐atra  ) showed a negative association with  U . antarctica  . Survival of  D eschampsia  was enhanced when growing associated with  U . antarctica  cushions. Our results indicate that cushions ameliorated the extreme conditions of Antarctic islands through increased temperature and soil moisture, decreased radiation and evaporative water loss and increased nutrient availability.    Conclusions  The nurse effect of  U . antarctica  is verified. Cushions of this macrolichen may be a key component in structuring the A ntarctic landscape and maintaining local species richness, and their presence might influence range expansion of other species.",We are grateful to Fernando Carrasco‐Urra for assistance in the field.

Determining the annual brood number is especially relevant for species that are actively fished. Herein we combined different approaches to estimate the annual brood number of two commercially exploited species of squat lobsters from the Chilean continental shelf and upper slope, Cervimunida johni and Pleuroncodes monodon. Long-term maintenance in the laboratory revealed that most females (>70%) produced 3 or more broods during the annual reproductive season. Incubation of individual broods required about 40 days, which would allow for 3 subsequent broods during the main reproductive period (June–September). The dynamics of brood release of ovigerous females that were collected from the field at approximately monthly intervals supported the estimate of 3–4 annual broods for adult females. Furthermore, these latter data also indicated a high degree of breeding synchrony among reproductive females. It is suggested that the production of successive broods might be an adaption to the variable oceanographic conditions during the reproductive period, ensuring that at least one larval cohort finds favorable conditions for development and settlement. Based on these results it is recommended that fishing effort is reduced during the main reproductive period of the two squat lobsters.",AcknowledgmentsFunding provided through the Fisheries Research Fund (FIP No. 2006-43) from the Chilean Ministry of Economy.

Males with highly developed weapons are expected to fight and possibly incur higher levels of injury than males with less developed weapons, which usually avoid agonistic encounters. Discrete male morphotypes, where some males are very large and feature powerful chelae, have been reported for several large shrimp species, where males show a lobster‐like monopolization of resources. During competitive interactions, these large males fight more vigorously than small males and, consequently, it is expected that they accumulate more injuries. Herein, we identified different morphotypes in the river shrimp  C ryphiops caementarius  , and we compared the percentage of body damage between large and small shrimps. We measured 26 morphometric data and 6 intensities of color on the chelipeds. Multivariate analysis based on a combination of morphometric and color data confirmed that there are two morphotypes. The ‘dominant’ morph is characterized by stout teeth on the cutting edges and by dark blue color on the external surface of the major cheliped. The two morphotypes can be distinguished based on the differences in the allometric relationships between several morphologic traits and carapace length. Males from the large morphotype had a higher percentage of injuries on their chelipeds than other males. These results suggest that males from the large morphotype are dominant and compete aggressively for access to resources, a hypothesis to be tested in future, behavioral studies.",Acknowledgements We are very grateful to Sandra Gallardo Peña for her expert help with the figures and to Stefan Dennenmoser and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an initial draft of the paper.

These methodologies can be classified as those that use either heuristics or mathematical optimization techniques. However, none of these methods is currently used in industry. This is, the former is very simple to incorporate the complexities of the problem and the latter requires that the designer has more specialized training.In this work, we use sensitivity analysis to analyze and design separation circuits. We study the effect of each stage on the general circuit by identifying the relationships between recovery at each stage and global recovery of the circuit. Based on these results, we propose a novel methodology to analyze and design separation circuits. This new method is a hybrid because it uses mathematical analysis and the designer's experience.

Glaeser and Mare (2001) estimate the elasticity wage-city size larger than one million inhabitants around of 36 % higher than smaller areas, while Glaeser and Messenger (2010) identify a elasticity of 45 % for the case of skilled workers. This positive relation also exists within industries, but with an uneven impact (Elvery 2010). In spite of the extensive empirical evidence, the most of the applications have been focused on North American, European and Asian contexts. In this chapter we extend the analysis toward the Latin American case, where the ONU-Wider has strongly recommended focusing on “increasing inequalities partly as a consequence of the uneven impact of trade openness and globalization” (Kanbur et al. 2005). We use the Chilean case and provide a first estimation of wage differentials between thick and thin labor markets. Although the extension toward new contexts could be considered a contribution as itself, the particular scenario of Latin American realities must be discussed.",,,Advances in Spatial Science,Defining the Spatial Scale in Modern Regional Analysis,"Esteban Fernández Vázquez, Fernando Rubiera Morollón",,2012-09-28,2012,2012-09-28,2012,,,215-236,Closed,Chapter,"Paredes, Dusan; Lufin, Marcelo; Aroca, Patricio","Paredes, Dusan (Facultad de Economia, Departamento de Economia, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Lufin, Marcelo (Facultad de Economia, Departamento de Economia, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Aroca, Patricio (Facultad de Economia, Departamento de Economia, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North)","Paredes, Dusan (Catholic University of the North); Lufin, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North); Aroca, Patricio (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002826938,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,10 Reduced Inequalities

These relationships, studied mainly through neutral DNA markers, are not always consistent with actual biogeographic patterns or the evolutionary history of marine species. In addition, increased information at functional genomic level from non-model species allows the study of adaptive responses in marine populations. This work reports local transcriptomic patterns in populations of the mussel Mytilus chilensis and their correspondence with oceanographic variability in southern Chile. Analysis of gene expression patterns was conducted through qPCR of seven candidate genes involved in the response to environmental stress (HSP70, HSP90), iron metabolism (Ferritin), pathogens (Mytilin B, Defensin) and oxidative stress (SOD-CuZn, Catalase) in at five study sites located in southern Chile, from Valdivia (39°56′S–73°36′W) to Melinka (43°52′S–73°44′W). Multivariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the relationship between levels of individual gene expression and site features characterized using satellite data on surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and total suspended sediments. Two main groups of sites with differential patterns of gene expression were identified. Individuals exposed to higher temperatures showed an overexpression of HSP70, HSP90 and Ferritin genes. The expression of SOD-CuZn and Catalase was correlated with local chlorophyll-a (i.e. food availability for mussels), although with opposite correlations. In addition, Mytilin B showed higher levels of expression in areas with higher freshwater influence. Patterns of gene expression across the region of interest suggest that spatial variability in environmental conditions induce phenotypic changes in different populations of the same mussel species. In addition, the analysis of expression patterns in candidate genes can reveal local patterns in populations where other molecular markers show no genetic structure.",Funding for this research was provided by CORFO-INNOVA 07CT9PDT-79 project.

We use this procedure in order to look for the automaton which is able to anticipate the highest number of decisions made by the subjects during the experiments.

With this, the improvement of the understandability of the internal operation of the model is pursued. This exploratory visualization is based on the wellknown technique named Treemap (maps of trees), that allows representing hierarchical structures like the D-T, being used grids to represent the nodes of the D-T. The proposed visualization represents the number of instances or weight associated to a node with a scale of colors in degradation. In this way it is managed to heighten the rules of the D-T in a 2D and 3D graphical representation of this visualization. Additionally, a metadata structure is defined to be able to represent the graphical visualization of the D-T, and with this to allow users the interoperability of the model with other visualization techniques and later on, to add interaction mechanisms to it. Finally, a first attempt of subjective evaluation, based on for criteria, of the proposed visualization, is made.

                    to test for monogamy given the generality of this mating system in the subfamily Pinnothereliinae (family Pinnotheridae) to which
                    A. aidae
                    belongs. Against expectations,
                    A. aidae
                    lives as solitary individuals within burrows more frequently than expected by chance alone. Additional observations suggested that
                    A. aidae
                    exhibits a polygynandrous mating system with males moving among burrows in search of receptive females. First, only 21% of the burrows harboured heterosexual pairs of crabs and the body size of paired crabs was poorly correlated. This suggests pair instability and frequent shifts among burrows by male and/or female crabs, as reported before for other symbiotic crustaceans in which the body size of paired crabs is poorly correlated. Second, males paired with females that were sexually receptive (without embryos) or that have been receptive recently (carrying early embryos) were found more frequently than expected by chance alone. The above agrees with that reported for species in which sexual pairing does not last long. Third, sexual dimorphism in terms of claw size and coloration was evident. Claws were larger in males than in females, a condition that argues in favour of male–male competition in
                    A. aidae
                    . In addition, the body coloration of males was more similar to the sand grains of the beach than that of females. This sex-specific coloration suggests that males are ‘better adapted' than females to roam on the surface of the beach in search of burrows because their coloration should diminish the risk of detection by predators. Experiments are needed to reveal the details of the polygynandrous mating system herein inferred for
                    A. aidae
                    and to understand those conditions favouring particular reproductive strategies in symbiotic decapod crustaceans.","This study formed part of a Master&#x27;s degree thesis by D.F.P., and was supported by a fellowship from CAPES-Brazil (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior).

They act as barrier to propagation of megathrust earthquakes along strike. To better understand how such a system works from ocean side to more inland, we investigated the area between the Tongoy bay and the Altos de Talinay in northern Chile (∼30°S). It represents a forearc peninsula–bay system in which a normal fault (Puerto Aldea fault) has been described as accommodating a relative vertical motion between the two parts, the peninsula being uplifted with respect to the bay. We dated shells from beach ridges by U–Th disequilibria in order to compare the bay area to the peninsula area for which 10Be dating of wave-cut platforms are available (Saillard et al., 2009). These indicate: (1) the Puerto Aldea fault activity probably ceased since at least ∼230 ka, implying the bay and peninsula parts are evolving together since then; (2) the uplift rate is variable and has decreased from ∼0.8 m/ka to ∼0.2 m/ka between ∼300 and 100 ka.",AcknowledgmentsThis research project is led thanks to the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and CNRS-INSU EC2CO program.

The nemertean Prosorhochmus nelsoni is a common predator in the mid-intertidal zone on rocky shores along the Chilean coast, where it can reach very high abundances (up to 260 ind m−2) in algal turfs, algal crusts, barnacle crusts, and mixed substrata. Tidal and diurnal scans revealed that the activity of P. nelsoni is primarily restricted to night and early-morning low tides and is relatively low when air temperatures are high. On average, larger worms crawled faster than smaller worms, with their maximum velocity being influenced by substratum type. Their estimated rate of predation is 0.092 prey items nemertean−1 day−1, just below the laboratory rate of ~0.2 amphipods nemertean−1 day−1 previously estimated for this species. P. nelsoni consumes a diverse spectrum of prey items (i.e., amphipods, isopods, decapods, barnacles, and dipterans) and is possibly exerting a significant influence on its prey populations. We suggest that the opportunistic predatory behavior of this intertidal predator is caused by the trade-off between immediate persistence (e.g., avoidance of desiccation) and long-term survival through successful foraging.","We are grateful to Bernardo Broitman (Project FONDECYT 1090488) for the temperature data.

The importance of floating seaweeds as dispersal agents for associated organisms and for the algae themselves varies depending on the supply from benthic source populations and on their persistence at the sea surface. Persistence of floating algae depends on water temperature, grazing activity, epifaunal load, and, to a lesser extent, on prevailing irradiance conditions. In temperate regions, persistence of floating algae is primarily limited by warm sea surface temperatures and high densities of motile and sessile epifauna whereas at higher latitudes algae can successfully compensate grazer-induced tissue loss by continuous growth at the prevailing low water temperatures. Accordingly, floating seaweeds can bridge large oceanic distances especially at high latitudes allowing for connectivity among distant benthic populations of algae and associated rafters.",ER and MT were supported through FONDECYT 1100749 during the preparation of this contribution.

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was given to 1,361 passengers of 28 cruise ships during October and November of 2009, then factor analysis and cluster analysis were employed.   Findings The results suggest that although visitors held a high overall satisfaction of the onshore experience, there are two dimensions that require the attention of tourist policy makers: the city infrastructure (traffic, noise, cleanliness and infrastructure) and the general shopping experience. In particular, the worst experience seems to be related to street vendors. Moreover, there is evidence that tourists from the USA are more exigent of being fully satisfied.   Research limitations/implications The survey was only conducted in the months of October and November. Future research can also include the repetition of the study in different seasons to compare results. The study shows that there is a good potential for the growth of tourism activity of the destination because over 52 per cent of the participants declared their intention of return to the city as land tourists and more than 60 per cent will recommend the destination to their friends.

To this end we analyze the evolution of per capita income levels for the Italian regions using a non-traditional (non-parametric) statistical model. In addition we segment the set of economies by the mean of hierarchical clustering methodologies and compare the trajectories of the regions by introducing different notions of distance. The general conclusion is that the average distance identifies a clear division between a high performance club consisting of regions from the Center North, and a low performance club composed by regions from the South and islands. The presence of a cluster composed by Center North regions is substantially confirmed by the distance correlation analysis, suggesting an homogeneous response to external shocks. By contrast Southern regions display the same dynamical evolution but difference in co-movements. Our analysis provides hints about the fundamentals that link the regions in their process of divergence. In fact the performance clubs pattern we discovered reflects the distribution of economic activities as well as the structural attributes of the regional economies.",,,Quality & Quantity,,,,2012-10-04,2012,2012-10-04,2014-01,48,1,439-456,Closed,Article,"Brida, Juan Gabriel; Garrido, Nicolás; Mureddu, Francesco","Brida, Juan Gabriel (School of Economics and Management, Free University of Bolzano, Bolzano, BZ, Italy); Garrido, Nicolás (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Mureddu, Francesco (Centre for North South Economic Research CRENoS, Cagliari, CA, Italy)","Brida, Juan Gabriel (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano)","Brida, Juan Gabriel (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano); Garrido, Nicolás (Catholic University of the North); Mureddu, Francesco (Centre for North South Economic Research CRENoS, Cagliari, CA, Italy)",15,0,,4.21,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006391298,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics,

A brief history of the Wilson plot evolution and alternative methods to the Wilson plot, including the advantages and disadvantages, are discussed as applied for enhanced heat transfer. A slight modification to the Briggs and Young (1969) method is proposed so that the experimental errors can be propagated through the method, allowing us to estimate the error in the generated correlations. Furthermore, a new method based on unconstrained minimization is proposed as an alternative to the least-squares regression. As an example, both methods have been applied to two enhanced boiling tubes (the most recent generation) and heat transfer coefficients were compared against direct wall temperature based heat transfer coefficient measurements made on the same tubes for water flow with high-performance internal helical ribs. Both the unconstrained minimization method and the modified Briggs and Young (1969) method performed well and predicted the same heat transfer performance within experimental uncertainty for two databases taken on two different experimental facilities. Furthermore, if the presently modified Wilson plot method is utilized, and the form of the correlating equation is chosen judiciously and is only applied within the range of experimental conditions tested, the results garnered from the analysis can very adequately predict the local heat transfer performance.","This project has been supported financially by the LTCM Falling Film Research Club members: Carrier Corporation, the Trane Company, Wieland-Werke AG, and Wolverine Tube, Inc., which is gratefully acknowledged.

A national policy context where standardized tests dominate curriculum and instruction and first language literacy is discouraged and undervalued poses unusual challenges for learners whose communicative repertoires encompass translanguaging practices. Drawing on the critical sociolinguistics of globalization and on ethnographic data from US and international educational contexts, we argue via a continua of biliteracy lens that the welcoming of translanguaging and transnational literacies in classrooms is not only necessary but desirable educational practice.

According to Schwartz, cultural values are related to an orientation that is individualistic (values referred to as power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation and self-direction), collectivistic (benevolence, tradition and conformity) or mixed (security and universalism). Today, there is a theoretical consensus that cultural values are mediators in the evaluation of quality of life (QOL); nonetheless, there are few published studies to date relating them to QOL. To determine whether a significant relationship exits between cultural values and QOL in three Spanish-speaking countries. A total of 821 persons participated: 321 from Chile, 200 from Spain and 300 from Cuba. The Schwartz Cultural Values Survey and the WHOQOL-BREF Quality of Life Scale were used. Analysis of variance, and correlation and regression analyses were preformed after collecting data. Only hedonism was significantly correlated with the global evaluation of QOL in Spain and Chile. Few correlations were found in all three countries between cultural values and the QOL domains evaluated, with the exceptions of the value of self-direction, which was related to physical well-being, and the value stimulation, which was correlated with psychological as well as social well-being in all three countries.

The two most notable chloride and sulfate-rich deserts on earth are the Dry Valleys of Antarctica and the Atacama Desert of Chile. While each is hyperarid, they possess very different hydrological regimes. We first show, using previously published S and O isotope data for sulfate minerals, that downward migration of water and sulfate is the primary mechanism responsible for depth profiles of sulfate concentration, and S and O isotopes, in both deserts. In contrast, we found quite different soluble Cl concentration and Cl isotope profiles between the two deserts. For Antarctic soils with an ice layer near the soil surface, the Cl concentrations increase with decreasing soil depth, whereas the ratio of 37Cl/35Cl increases. Based on previous field observations by others, we found that thermally driven upward movement of brine during the winter, described by an advection/diffusion model, qualitatively mimics the observed profiles. In contrast, in the Atacama Desert where rare but relatively large rains drive Cl downward through the profiles, Cl concentrations and 37Cl/35Cl ratios increased with depth. The depth trends in Cl isotopes are more closely explained by a Rayleigh-like model of downward fluid flow. The isotope profiles, and our modeling, reveal the similarities and differences between these two very arid regions on Earth, and are relevant for constraining models of fluid flow in arid zone soil and vadose zone hydrology.",,,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,,,,2012-12,2012,,2012-12,99,,271-286,Closed,Article,"Amundson, Ronald; Barnes, Jaime D.; Ewing, Stephanie; Heimsath, Arjun; Chong, Guillermo","Amundson, Ronald (Division of Ecosystem Sciences, 137 Mulford Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA); Barnes, Jaime D.

Data were collected using questionnaires. Through purposive sampling based on South African and UFS demographics, 120 questionnaires were administered to UFS students. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The results show that language is a critical component in the conceptualisation and actualisation of social justice in South Africa's higher education. The results further indicate that language continues to play the role of privileging access to higher education for some, while curtailing access to higher education for others, in South Africa. The paper concludes that this reality is contrary to the principles of social justice and recommends a radical overhaul of the language dispensation in South Africa's higher education within the framework of social justice.","The author is grateful to Aniebo Samson-Akpan for diligently collecting the data used in this paper.

In order to investigate the importance of kelp rafts for species dispersal in the Patagonian Fjord Region (PFR), the abundance and distribution pattern of floating kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera, Durvillaea antarctica) and of the invertebrate fauna associated with M. pyrifera were evaluated during austral spring of 2002–2005, 2008 and 2010. In the southernmost Magellan Region (MR), benthic M. pyrifera were additionally sampled to compare the community structures in both conditions. Floating kelps were abundant throughout the entire PFR, harbouring a diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna. The density of floating kelps increased towards the south. In the MR, a loss of species was observed between benthic and floating condition (e.g. decapods, echinoderms, several peracarid species), but a high diversity of organisms from all major phyla were observed on rafts. Throughout the PFR, the predominant rafting species belonged to the peracarids, molluscs and annelids, but the community composition differed between floating samples from the northern and southern zones of the PFR. Relative abundances of peracarids were higher in northern zones, whereas molluscs and annelids dominated in the southern areas. Species of the peracarid genera Peramphithoe, Gondogeneia, Bircenna and Limnoria were shared between all areas. The results suggest that kelp rafts not only contribute to local population connectivity in the PFR, but could also be an important dispersal vehicle for rafting species along the PFR in north–south direction, crossing the biogeographic boundary around Taitao Peninsula. Furthermore, the MR appears to be an important stepping stone for species dispersal via kelp rafting in the subantarctic region.","We are grateful to Lars Gutow for his advice during the preparation of this manuscript.

After 3 and 6 days of exposure to either A. catenella or T-iso, scallops were stimulated to elicit an escape response by exposing them to the predatory sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus. We monitored the escape response of the scallops in terms of reaction time after first contact with the sea star, number of claps (burst of rapid valve closures) until exhaustion, clapping time, clapping rate, the time scallops spent closed when exhausted, and recovery from the initial number of claps, clapping time and clapping rate. Additionally, histopathological and stress responses (through heat-shock protein [hsp70] induction), as well as accumulation of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins, were monitored on scallops after 3 and 6 days of exposure to A. catenella. After 6 days of exposure, scallops exposed to A. catenella accumulated PSTs and reacted more rapidly with a higher clapping rate, however the duration of their escape response was shorter than controls, when exposed to M. gelatinosus. Additionally, scallops exposed to A. catenella showed histopathological features, especially after 6 days of exposure, including increased melanization of the tissues and myopathy, with high levels of degeneration of the muscle fibers. A six-day exposure to A. catenella also caused an increase in prevalence of rickettsiales-like organisms within scallop tissues. This study suggests that PST accumulation can affect the interaction between the Northern scallop and both pathogens and predators, potentially increasing their susceptibility to either of them.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank Gabriela Núñez Arancibia, Andrea Hueche and Ana Luisa Valdivia for their technical help during the experiment.

                    Quinoa cultivation in Chile presents an ancient and active complex of geographic, climatic, social and cultural interactions that has determined its current biodiversity in the three main growing zones (north, central and south). Importantly, these interactions involve the participation of farmers, whose activities are at the base of seed exchange networks due to their knowledge and
                    in situ
                    conservation of genetic diversity. The present study reports how a better understanding of farmers’ seed exchanges and local production practices could impact the genetic structure and diversity of quinoa at national scale in Chile. Using field interviews and characterization of 20 microsatellite genetic markers in a multi-origin set of 34 quinoa accessions representative of Chile and the South American region, the phenetic analysis of germplasm was consistent with the current classification of quinoa ecotypes present in Chile and Andean zone. This allowed the identification of five populations, which were represented by quinoa of Salares (northern Chile), Coastal/Lowlands (central and southern Chile), Highlands (Peru, Bolivia and Argentina) and Inter-Andean Valleys (Ecuador and Colombia). The highly informative quality of the markers used revealed a wide genetic diversity among main growing areas in Chile, which correlated well with natural geographical–edaphic–climatic and social–linguistic context to the expansion of quinoa biodiversity. Additionally, in addition to ancient seed exchanges, this process is still governed by the diverse agricultural practices of Andean farmers. Genetic erosion is considered an imminent risk due to small-scale farming, where the influence of increased migration of people to urban systems and export-driven changes to the agro-ecosystems may further reduce the diversity of quinoa plants in cultivation.",,,The Journal of Agricultural Science,,,,2012-02-24,2012,2012-02-24,2012-12,150,6,702-716,Closed,Article,"FUENTES, F.

Under these circumstances, users using mechanisms (e.g., behavioral preference) that allow them to find and colonize refuges in which net benefits are maximized are expected to be selected by the environment. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that resource generalists display strong preferences for resources that provide the greatest reproductive benefits using Calyptraeotheres garthi, a crab that inhabits the limpets Crepidula cachimilla and Bostrycapulus odites in the south-western Atlantic. In the field, female crabs inhabiting C. cachimilla featured larger average body size, and subsequently, larger average fecundity and brood weight than those inhabiting B. odites. Thus, C. cachimilla is a higher quality host for C. garthi compared to B. odites. In contrast to expectations, host selection experiments revealed that female crabs were attracted to the host species from which they were collected and not to the host species that provided the greatest reproductive benefits (C. cachimilla). Host chemical and/or visual cues imprinted in crabs early during ontogeny (soon after colonization of their first host), rather than genetic differences, may explain the source-host fidelity of C. garthi. In the two hosts, females of C. garthi lead a solitary lifestyle and appear to inhabit the same host individual for long periods of time as indicated by the close relationship between female crab and host body size. The frequency of male–female pairs within host individuals was lower than expected by chance alone. Also, males were, on average, smaller than females and did not appear to inhabit the same host individual for long periods of time. The above suggests that males might be using a pure‐search mating strategy, continuously roaming among host individuals in search of receptive females. The details of the mating system of C. garthi need to be further investigated.",AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Dr. Enrique Morsan and colleagues of the IBMP for their hospitality during the travels to San Matías Gulf.

We focus here on the process of commemoration of the dead as evidenced in the graves excavated from Kish’s ‘A Cemetery’. We use skeletal remains, fieldnotes, and artifactual evidence to situate these individuals within their biological and mortuary contexts and to explore elements of living, dying, and remembering at Kish. The repetitive actions involved in burying the dead in the ruins of a razed palace suggest the construction of social memory aimed at creating communal cohesion and reinforcing local norms. The details afforded each individual and their grave suggest that burials functioned both to engage a new political landscape and to create spaces in which the bereaved commemorated individual lives.","The Kish Project was generously supported by NEH Grant PI-500014-04, the Field Museum of Natural History, Colorado College, and the Associated Colleges of the Midwest.

In this article, thefirst in a series, we wish to contribute to the current vibrant debate about languageissues in higher education – both internationally and locally. It primarily aims atproviding a critical historical review of the conundrum of the “language across thecurriculum” issue and its implications for the South African higher education sector.This is done by critically comparing current local circumstances to lessons learntfrom the original context where the notion of “language across the curriculum” waspresented to improve the quality of education in schools in the United Kingdom in themid-1970’s. The premise behind this is that “to interpret the developments within afield competently, one needs a sense of its history” (Weideman, 2011: IX). Adding a veryspecific historical perspective is thus, and indeed, a necessary point of departure as itmay enable South African practitioners and policy makers to: (a) evaluate if all relevantinformation is considered in decision making today, and (b) situate strands of currentthinking in a framework that could clarify assumptions and implications potentiallyaccepted uncritically today.Keywords: LAC (language across the curriculum), language and literacy development,higher education, multilingualism, Bullock report",,,Journal for Language Teaching,,,,2012-06-07,2012,2012-06-07,,46,1,7-28,Closed,Article,"van Dyk, T; Rooy, S Coetzee-Van","van Dyk, T (); Rooy, S Coetzee-Van ()",,"van Dyk, T (); Rooy, S Coetzee-Van ()",4,0,,1.25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072485823,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education
194,pub.1051861617,10.1134/s106377291210006x,,,Analysis of optical spectra of V1357 Cyg≡Cyg X-1,"Optical spectra and light curves of the massive X-ray binary V1357 Cyg are analyzed. The calculations were based on models of irradiated plane-parallel stellar atmospheres, taking into account reflection of the X-ray radiation, asphericity of the stellar surface, and deviations from LTE for several ions. Comparison of observed spectra obtained in 2004–2005 at the Bohyunsan Observatory (South Korea) revealed variations of the depths of HI lines by up to 18% and of HeI and heavy elements lines by up to 10%. These variations are not related to the orbital motion of the star, and are probably due to variations of the stellar wind intensity. Perturbations of the thermal structure of the atmosphere due to irradiation in various states of Cyg X-1 (including outburst) do not lead to the formation of a hot photosphere with an electron temperature exceeding the effective temperature. As a result, variations of the profiles of optical lines of HI, HeI, and heavy elements due to the orbital motion of the star and variations of the irradiating X-ray flux do not exceed 1% of the residual intensities. Allowing for deviations from LTE enhances the HI and HeI lines by factors of two to three and the MgII lines by a factor of nine, and is therefore required for a fully adequate analysis of the observational data. Analysis of the HI, HeI, and HeII lines profiles yielded the following set of parameters for theOstar at the observing epoch: Teff = 30 500±500 K, log g = 3.31±0.05, [He/H] = 0.42 ± 0.05. The observed HeI line profiles have emission components that are formed in the stellar wind and increase with the line intensity. The abundances of 11 elements in the atmospheres of V1357 Cyg and α Cam, which has a similar spectral type and luminosity class, are derived. The chemical composition of V1357 Cyg is characterized by a strong excess of helium, nitrogen, neon, and silicon, which is related to the binarity of the system.",,,Astronomy Reports,,,,2012-10-07,2012,2012-10-07,2012-10,56,10,741-760,Closed,Article,"Shimanskii, V.

Parasite numbers recorded from Clarias gariepinus supported the HAI hypothesis that higher endoparasite and lower ectoparasite numbers occur at highly impacted areas. The apparent effects of pollution type on the ratio between ectoparasites and endoparasites are discussed. Environmental stressors such as flood conditions resulted in immunological responses, reflected statistically as changes in white blood cell percentage (WBC%). It is suggested that endoparasite and WBC% data provide the best overall assessment of fish condition in the Olifants River system. Modifications made to the HAI included further development of the original parasite presence/absence component into a more extensive parasite index component.

Data considered approximately 2years of daily visible PAR (400–700nm), UVA (400–320nm), and UVB (280–320nm). Satellite ozone data were also compared with a 305/340 ratio. On an annual scale, the visible and UV radiation co-varied in phase, with maxima in spring–summer and lower values in autumn–winter. Winds and cloudiness also showed an annual cycle, with predominantly southerly winds and lower cloudiness in summer. On a synoptic scale, solar radiation was coupled with cloudiness and winds, a relationship that is also evidenced over large scale atmospheric circulation. A 3-month lag was observed between solar radiation and ozone annual cycles; the latter peaked in springtime. The 305/340 ratio was a good ozone index over short time scales, showing fluctuations at the same frequencies as ozone and good cross-correlations once the annual cycle was extracted. The spatial–temporal analysis supports the possibility that the local pattern observed might be common for other important upwelling sites affected by the same type of atmospheric variability. Finally, this study showed that solar radiation wavelengths fluctuating at similar frequencies as those of upwelling favorable winds, are likely to be modulating biological processes in the coastal upwelling area off Concepción over short time scales.","AcknowledgementsWe thank the Chilean meteorological directorate for data on cloudiness, sun hours, and winds.

The goals of the study were to understand the seasonal representation of siliceous microorganisms in surface sediments and to evaluate the use of this information in the interpretation of past climatic/oceanographic conditions in the area. The implications of seasonal and preservational biases are discussed. Additionally, a 30-cm core collected at the same site and spanning the last ∼150years of sedimentation was also studied in order to provide a record of historical siliceous productivity changes.Firstly, the analyses focused on diatoms since they were numerically the most prominent microorganisms in the water column and the surface sediments, independent of season and year. In both settings, maxima of the key diatom genera Chaetoceros and Skeletonema coincided with the spring–summer upwelling period. For the autumn–winter non-upwelling period, significant plankton–sediment discrepancies were observed, with enrichment of moderately robust taxa in the sediments, as well as freshwater diatoms and phytoliths tracing the increased river discharges in winter. Secondly, the downcore analysis revealed a marked decrease in total diatom accumulation rates since the late 19th and throughout the 20th century, which was accompanied by increasing concentrations of lithogenic particles and freshwater diatoms. An alkenone-based sea surface temperature reconstruction in the same core (past ∼150years) and instrumental data show that these changes occurred simultaneously with a general trend of increasing temperatures in the upwelling area off Concepción. Taken together, these signals suggest an intensified influence of ENSO-like variability in the ocean-climate system off central-southern Chile.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by the Center for Oceanographic Research in the eastern South Pacific (COPAS) of the University of Concepcion (FONDAP Program Project No. 150100007).

The continental margin off Concepción (36°S; 73°W) lies beneath an important upwelling center characterized by high primary production rates and, consequently, high fluxes of organic matter. In spring and summer, this material settles to the seafloor where it decays, producing periods of very low oxygen content in bottom waters (<1mLL−1). In addition, an oxygen minimum zone develops at ∼100–400m water depth, where dissolved oxygen levels are <0.5mLL−1. This situation changes during strong El Niño events, when dissolved oxygen at the bottom increases drastically (>1mLL−1). The goals of this study were to determine the input of trace metals to the sediment and to decipher how this information can be used to reveal variations in primary productivity or bottom oxygenation. Gravity cores collected at two stations – VG06-2 over the mid-shelf station (88m water depth, upper boundary of the oxygen minimum zone) and VG06-3 over the outer shelf (120m water depth, within the oxygen minimum zone) – were sampled for high resolution profiles (1cm) of trace metals, biogenic opal, stable isotopes, and total organic carbon. The results suggest that the variability in the trace metal distribution on the continental shelf off Concepción is determined by redox conditions and the organic carbon flux to the bottom. Some sections of the sediment cores from the outer shelf showed appreciable authigenic enrichment of U, Cd, and Mo (EF: 5–10, 2–5, and 10–16 respectively) along with heavier values of δ15N, suggesting periods of suboxic conditions. During these periods, fluxes of organic material to the bottom were higher, as indicated by elevated TOC and opal contents. Alternating periods of higher and lower trace metal contents were not observed mid-shelf as they were on the outer shelf. Rather, the mid-shelf samples showed authigenic enrichment of U, Cd, and Mo (EF: 1–6, 4–5, and 10–20, respectively) throughout the core except in a 10-cm-thick gray layer. In general, authigenic enrichment of U, Mo, and Cd occurred at both sites, coincident with olive green layers in the cores. These layers were associated with periods of elevated primary productivity and suboxic conditions. Such periods did not seem to last as long as the oxygenated periods, which had higher inputs of refractive detrital material, coincident with the occurrence of distinct gray sediment layers.","We thank the captain and crew of the Chilean Navy AGOR “Vidal Gormáz” for support at sea during the SeepOx cruise.

169,pub.1025226850,10.1007/s00531-012-0795-y,,,Morphology and geology of the continental shelf and upper slope of southern Central Chile (33°S–43°S),"The continental shelf and slope of southern Central Chile have been subject to a number of international as well as Chilean research campaigns over the last 30 years. This work summarizes the geologic setting of the southern Central Chilean Continental shelf (33°S–43°S) using recently published geophysical, seismological, sedimentological and bio-geochemical data. Additionally, unpublished data such as reflection seismic profiles, swath bathymetry and observations on biota that allow further insights into the evolution of this continental platform are integrated. The outcome is an overview of the current knowledge about the geology of the southern Central Chilean shelf and upper slope. We observe both patches of reduced as well as high recent sedimentation on the shelf and upper slope, due to local redistribution of fluvial input, mainly governed by bottom currents and submarine canyons and highly productive upwelling zones. Shelf basins show highly variable thickness of Oligocene-Quaternary sedimentary units that are dissected by the marine continuations of upper plate faults known from land. Seismic velocity studies indicate that a paleo-accretionary complex that is sandwiched between the present, relatively small active accretionary prism and the continental crust forms the bulk of the continental margin of southern Central Chile.","Part of the research off Central Chile was funded by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT) grants 1100166 (CMSA) and grant 1080623 (Mocha Island), to Javier Sellanes and Silvio Pantoja, respectively.

This book updates the original Global Journalist (1998) volume with new data, adding more than a dozen countries, and provides material on comparative research about journalists that will be useful to those interested in doing their own studies. The editors put together this collection working under the assumption that journalists’ backgrounds, working conditions and ideas are related to what is reported (and how it is covered) in the various news media round the world, in spite of societal and organizational constraints, and that this news coverage matters in terms of world public opinion and policies. Outstanding features include: Coverage of 33 nations located around the globe, based on recent surveys conducted among representative samples of local journalists Comprehensive analyses by well-known media scholars from each country A section on comparative studies of journalists An appendix with a collection of survey questions used in various nations to question journalists Coverage of 33 nations located around the globe, based on recent surveys conducted among representative samples of local journalists Comprehensive analyses by well-known media scholars from each country A section on comparative studies of journalists An appendix with a collection of survey questions used in various nations to question journalists As the most comprehensive and reliable source on journalists around the world, The Global Journalist will serve as the primary source for evaluating the state of journalism.

The objectives were to establish the effect of environmental conditions on trace metal distributions at two shelf sites, one affected by seasonal oxygenation and the other by permanent low oxygen conditions due to the presence of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We evaluate trace metals as proxies of past changes in primary productivity and the bottom water oxygen regime. Concentrations of pore water sulfides and NH4+ were also measured as indicators of the main diagenetic pathways at each site. Our results for the inner shelf (seasonal suboxia) suggest that the oxidative state of the sediments responds to seasonal pulses of organic matter and that seasonal oxygenation develops during high and low primary productivity in the water column. Here, positive fluxes (to the water column) estimated from pore water concentrations of several elements were observed (Ba, Co, Ni, Fe and Mn). The less reduced environment at this site produces authigenic enrichment of Cu associated with the formation of oxides in the oxic surface sediment layer, and the reduction of U within deeper sediment sections occur consistently with negative estimated pore water fluxes. In the outer shelf sediments (permanent suboxia, OMZ site), negative fluxes (to the sediment) were estimated for all elements, but these sediments showed authigenic enrichments only for Cd, Cu and U. The short oxygenation period during the winter season did not affect the accumulation of these metals on the shelf. The distribution of Cu, Cd and U have been preserved within the sediments and the authigenic accumulation rates estimated showed a decrease from the deep sections of the core to the surface sediments. This could be explained by a gradual decrease in the strength of the OMZ in the last 100 years, in combination with periods of strong oxygenations during El Niño events.","AcknowledgmentsWe thank the captain and crew of the Chilean Navy&#x27;s RV “Vidal Gormáz” for support at sea during the SeepOx cruise.

This review of published literature on the occurrence of pesticides within South African freshwater systems indicates that fewer than 50 studies of selected pesticides have been undertaken, with emphasis being on organochlorines. Extensive historical usage has led to the widespread persistence of selected organochlorines. Few studies have established linkages between pesticides, exposure pathways, environmental concentrations and the monitoring of toxicological effects on non-target organisms. Emphasis is now being placed on developing more field-relevant assessments, including microcosm and mesocosm studies, in situ bioassays and field studies. There are few data relating to the extent of exposure and effects of pesticides in South African aquatic environments, and thus further research is needed. Research should focus on multidisciplinary approaches that increase effective decisionmaking in data-poor circumstances. A pesticide risk assessment programme for aquatic ecosystems needs to be implemented in South Africa, which could feed into the National Toxicity Monitoring Programme. Preliminary risk assessment models should be used to detect pesticides posing possible or definite risks, whereafter more detailed chemical, toxicological and biological monitoring assessments should be performed if risks are predicted.",,,African Journal of Aquatic Science,,,,2012-04,2012,,2012-04,37,1,1-16,Closed,Article,"Ansara-Ross, TM; Wepener, V; van den Brink, PJ; Ross, MJ","Ansara-Ross, TM (Centre for Aquatic Research, Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, PO Box 524, Johannesburg, 2006, South Africa); Wepener, V (Centre for Aquatic Research, Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, PO Box 524, Johannesburg, 2006, South Africa); van den Brink, PJ (Department of Aquatic Ecology and Water Quality Management, Wageningen University and Research Centre, PO Box 8080, 6700, AA, Wageningen, The Netherlands; Alterra, Wageningen University and Research Centre, PO Box 47, 6700, AA, Wageningen, The Netherlands); Ross, MJ (Centre for Aquatic Research, Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, PO Box 524, Johannesburg, 2006, South Africa)","Ansara-Ross, TM (University of Johannesburg)","Ansara-Ross, TM (University of Johannesburg); Wepener, V (University of Johannesburg); van den Brink, PJ (Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research); Ross, MJ (University of Johannesburg)",58,6,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070958773,31 Biological Sciences; 37 Earth Sciences,

Ours is a leading variable for the business cycle and exhibits low persistence which avoids the fictitious long-horizon predictability associated with other predictors used in the literature. We compare our variable with the most popular predictors in a sample period that includes the recent financial crisis. Our results suggest that oil price changes are the only variable with forecasting power for stock returns. This significant predictive ability is robust against the inclusion of other variables and out-of-sample tests. We also study the cross-section of expected stock returns in a conditional CAPM framework based on oil price shocks. Our model displays high statistical significance and a better fit than all the conditional and unconditional models considered, including the Fama–French three-factor model. From a practical perspective, ours is a high-frequency, observable variable that has the advantage of being readily available to market-timing investors.","We would like to thank Augusto Castillo, Gonzalo Cortazar, Rodrigo Fuentes, Borja Larrain, Chris Telmer, Jose Tessada, Eduardo Walker and seminar participants at UC.

We aimed to identify the main larval transport/retention characteristics in the study area, which constitutes the southernmost P. monodon fishing grounds embedded in the Humboldt Current System. We hypothesized that the main contribution to population renewal originates in the two persistent adult aggregations close to the nursery ground that occurs over a continental shelf terrace limited by two submarine canyons. Two extensive bio-physical field campaigns were carried out during the main 2001–2002 upwelling season field data indicated that larvae were released from late austral winter to spring from spots to the north and south of the nursery. Zoea I were found mainly below 50m depth in southward-flowing waters, whereas older zoea dominated in northward flowing layers above 50m. Larvae were circumscribed between the coast and the shelf break front and pelagic retention areas were identified over the widest shelf area. Megalopa and juveniles during March, were only found over the nursery area. Individual based simulations coupled to the output of a hydrodynamic model (climatological configuration) for the studied area, showed that the release sites close to the nursery made the largest contribution to recruitment. Sites further north could also contribute to recruitment if hatching occurred later in the upwelling season. The contribution of vertical behavior to larval success was also important, as was the former’s interaction with the site and time of larval release. Our results support the relevance of coastal circulation (affected by topography) on the persistence of P. monodon populations off southern Chile, and the modulation of temporal variability. These results might apply to other abundant species in the area.","AcknowledgementsThis research was funded by the Chilean national FONDECYT project 1010900 to W. Schneider, R. Roa-Ureta, and L.R.

Anisotropic distribution of orbit poles of small, inner main-belt binaries","Our photometric observations of 18 main-belt binary systems in more than one apparition revealed a strikingly high number of 15 having positively re-observed mutual events in the return apparitions. Our simulations of the survey showed that it cannot be due to an observational selection effect and that the data strongly suggest that poles of mutual orbits between components of binary asteroids in the primary size range 3–8km are not distributed randomly: The null hypothesis of an isotropic distribution of the orbit poles is rejected at a confidence level greater than 99.99%. Binary orbit poles concentrate at high ecliptic latitudes, within 30° of the poles of the ecliptic. We propose that the binary orbit poles oriented preferentially up/down-right are due to either of the two processes: (i) the YORP tilt of spin axes of their parent bodies toward the asymptotic states near obliquities 0° and 180° (pre-formation mechanism) or (ii) the YORP tilt of spin axes of the primary components of already formed binary systems toward the asymptotic states near obliquities 0° and 180° (post-formation mechanism). The alternative process of elimination of binaries with poles closer to the ecliptic by dynamical instability, such as the Kozai effect due to gravitational perturbations from the Sun, does not explain the observed orbit pole concentration. This is because for close binary asteroid systems, the gravitational effects of primary’s irregular shape dominate the solar-tide effect.","The work at Ondřejov and the Charles University Prague was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic, Grants 205/05/0604 and 205/09/1107, and by the Research Programs MSM0021620860 and MEB0810085 of the Czech Ministry of Education.

Only one-third of its working age adults are employed. 150 000 unemployed youth are outside of training and education. Centrally located and landlocked, the Free State lacks obvious regional assets and features a declining economy. How can the Free State develop a more inclusive labour market and education system? How can it address the long-term challenges of poverty, inequity and poor health? How can it turn the potential of its universities and FET-colleges into an active asset for regional development?This publication explores a range of helpful policy measures and institutional reforms to mobilise higher education for regional development. It is part of the series of the OECD reviews of Higher Education in Regional and City Development.

It elaborates the distinction established by the advertiser Bernstein (1974) and the linguist Simpson (2001) between reason and tickle advertising. In order to accomplish this endeavor, we distinguish what type of information is used and how it is handled through the discourse of the advertisement. Therefore, the basic constituents of two types of commercial message will be described. This will allow us to predict their disposition taking into account the rhetorical strategy chosen by the advertiser.

150,pub.1014809486,10.1130/b30445.1,,,Geomorphologic evidence for the late Pliocene onset of hyperaridity in the Atacama Desert,"The Atacama Desert has experienced a long and protracted period of hyperaridity that has resulted in what may be the most unusual biome on Earth, but the duration of this aridity is poorly constrained. We reconstructed aspects of the fluvial and geochemical history of this region using integrated landscape features (alluvial fans, hillslope soils, soil chemistry, river profiles) in the southern portion of the present desert. Topographic reconstructions of a large watershed (11,000 km2) show deep incision and sediment removal between the late Miocene and the end of the Pliocene, and modest to negligible incision in post-Pliocene times. These changes in incision suggest an ∼50–280× reduction in river discharge, which should reflect corresponding changes in precipitation. Changes in the nature of hillslope soils in the Atacama Desert indicate that in the Pliocene or earlier, hillslopes were mantled with silicate-derived soil. This mantle was stripped off and locally deposited as alluvial fans (late Pliocene to early Pleistocene) that now block or otherwise cause a rearrangement of Pliocene and earlier river channels. Finally, the hillslopes have largely accreted a soil mantle of dust and salt since the apparent late Pliocene stripping, suggesting a decline in annual precipitation of at least 125 mm yr−1 or more (mean annual precipitation [MAP] is now <3 mm yr−1). Embedded in the long post-Pliocene era of salt accumulation, there are a variety of features suggesting overland flow on hillslopes (rills, striped gravel deposits, piping, and water spouts) and large, infrequent storms that infiltrated gentle alluvial fans (due to the depth of salt-rich horizons). Despite evidence for episodes that punctuate the hyperaridity, the magnitude and duration of these pluvial events have been insufficient to remove the regional accumulations of sulfate, chloride, and nitrate. The late Pliocene cessation of many fluvial features is coincident with recent research on the tropical Pacific, which shows that the Pacific was in a permanent El Niño state until ca. 2.2 Ma, at which time sea-surface temperatures offshore of South America declined greatly relative to those of the western Pacific, in turn setting up the present El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate system. These observations indicate that the latest period of aridity has been prolonged and largely continuous, and it appears to have occurred in step with the onset of the ENSO climate system, beginning ∼2 m.y. ago.",,,Geological Society of America Bulletin,,,,2012-05-18,2012,2012-05-18,2012-07-01,124,7-8,1048-1070,Closed,Article,"Amundson, Ronald; Dietrich, William; Bellugi, Dino; Ewing, Stephanie; Nishiizumi, Kunihiko; Chong, Guillermo; Owen, Justine; Finkel, Robert; Heimsath, Arjun; Stewart, Brian; Caffee, Marc","Amundson, Ronald (Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, California 94720, USA); Dietrich, William (Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, McCone Hall, Berkeley, California 94720, USA); Bellugi, Dino (Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, McCone Hall, Berkeley, California 94720, USA); Ewing, Stephanie (Department of Land Resources & Environmental Sciences, Montana State University, 817 Leon Johnson Hall, Bozeman, Montana 59717, USA); Nishiizumi, Kunihiko (Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA); Chong, Guillermo (Departamento de Ciencias Geológicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Owen, Justine (Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, California 94720, USA); Finkel, Robert (Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, McCone Hall, Berkeley, California 94720, USA; Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94550, USA); Heimsath, Arjun (School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, 548 Physical Sciences F-wing, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA); Stewart, Brian (Department of Geology and Planetary Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA); Caffee, Marc (Department of Physics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA)",,"Amundson, Ronald (University of California, Berkeley); Dietrich, William (University of California, Berkeley); Bellugi, Dino (University of California, Berkeley); Ewing, Stephanie (Montana State University); Nishiizumi, Kunihiko (University of California, Berkeley); Chong, Guillermo (Catholic University of the North); Owen, Justine (University of California, Berkeley); Finkel, Robert (University of California, Berkeley; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory); Heimsath, Arjun (Arizona State University); Stewart, Brian (University of Pittsburgh); Caffee, Marc (Purdue University West Lafayette)",99,17,,14.01,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014809486,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,13 Climate Action

These approaches enable rich and detailed explanations to be uncovered and bring experience to life. Important recommendations and practice- based implications may then be raised and debated for future use. This book brings together a range of phenomenological methods and insights into one accessible text. Illustrated with plenty of examples of successful phenomenological research, Qualitative Research in Midwifery and Childbirth keeps the focus applied to midwifery and childbirth and makes clear the links to practice throughout. The book introduces three key phenomenological approaches – descriptive, interpretive and the life world – and includes a comparative chapter which discusses the differences between these varied perspectives and methods. Each chapter focuses on how these approaches are used within midwifery research. The remaining chapters present a number of different research projects. These demonstrate how different phenomenological approaches have been used to explore and uncover experiences of childbirth and maternity as well as offering important insights into how women experience different facets of the birth experience during the antenatal, intra-partum and postnatal period.

A late Oligocene–early Miocene peak of deformation caused further uplift. The Incaic range formed a pop-up structure bounded by two thrusts systems of diverging vergencies; it represented a major paleogeographic feature that separated two domains with different tectonic and paleogeographic evolutions, and probably formed the Andean water divide. This range has been affected by intense erosion and was symmetrically flanked by two major basins, the Pampa del Tamarugal and the Altiplano. Magmatic activity remained located along the previous Late Cretaceous–early Eocene arc with slight eastward shift. Further compression caused westvergent thrusting and uplift along the western Eastern Cordillera bounding the Altiplano basin to the east by another pop-up shaped ridge. Eastward progression of deformation caused eastvergent thrusting of the Eastern Cordillera and Subandean zone.","The authors acknowledge the French Institute for Collaborative Research (IRD) and Departamento de Geología, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Universidad de Chile for their research facilities, and projects Fondecyt No. 1030965, and Anillo ACT No. 18 (Programa Bicentenario de Ciencia y Tecnología-CONICYT) for financial support.

94,pub.1098726719,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199651337.001.0001,,,Javier Marías's Debt to Translation,"This is a book about translation and literary influence. It takes as its subject Spain’s most important contemporary novelist, Javier Marías (1951), who worked as a literary translator for a significant portion of his early career. Since then, he has maintained that translation had a crucial impact on the development of his writing style and his literary frame of reference. It examines his claims to the influence of three writers whose works he translated: Laurence Sterne, Sir Thomas Browne, and Vladimir Nabokov. It does so by engaging in close reading of his translations, examining how he meets the linguistic, syntactic, and cultural challenges they present. His prolonged engagement with their prose is then set alongside his own novels and short stories, the better to discern precisely how and in what ways his works have been shaped by their influence and through translation. This study begins by asking why Marías should have turned to translation in the cultural landscape of Spain in the 1970s and how the ideological standpoints that animated his decision affect the way he translates. His translation of Sterne’s Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman is set alongside his pseudo-autobiographical novel Negra espalda del tiempo (Dark Back of Time), while his translation of Sir Thomas Browne’s Urn Burial is then analysed in tandem with that produced by Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares. Subsequent chapters examine how Browne’s prose has shaped Marías’s thinking on oblivion, posterity, and time. The final chapters offer an analysis of the partial translation and palimpsest of Lolita he undertook in the early 1990s and of his most ambitious novel to date, Tu rostro mañana (Your Face Tomorrow), as a work in which characterization is underpinned by both literary allusion and the hydridization of works Marías has translated.",,,,,,,2012-05-24,2012,,2012-05-24,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Wood, Gareth J.","Wood, Gareth J.

71,pub.1042242275,10.4324/9780203889725,,,"Structuring Mass Higher Education, The Role of Elite Institutions","Undoubtedly the most important development in higher education in recent years has been the seemingly inexorable expansion of national systems. In a comparatively short time period many countries have moved from an elite to a mass model. Furthermore, expansion has invariably changed the whole experience of higher education for all the interested parties from, presidents, rectors and vice-chancellors to first-term undergraduates. Structuring Mass Higher Education examines the impact of this change upon the existing national structures of higher education. It also defines and highlights what makes an ‘elite’ university – something which institutions must strive for in order to gain their position as global players. With case studies and contributions from a wide range of international authors, the book explores questions such as: Do higher education institutions retain a national significance, even though the vestiges of an international reputation have long faded? Has expansion undermined the quality of higher education because governments sought to expand ""on the cheap""? Is the elite institutional response to mass higher education perceived as a threat to be responded to with purposeful action that sustains their elite status? Does the emergence of the international league tables pose a challenge to those responsible for governing elite institutions? These are critical issues with which both policy-makers and institutional leaders will have to grapple over the next ten years, making Structuring Mass Higher Education a timely, relevant, and much needed text. It will appeal to policy makers and practitioners within higher education as well as student and scholars worldwide.",,,,,,,2012-10-12,2012,2012-10-12,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Palfreyman, David","Palfreyman, David ()",,"Palfreyman, David ()",4,0,,1.18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042242275,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

While recent contributions to feminist geography have challenged this, in India the engagement of geographers with gender, by being conservative in its choice of focus and orthodox in methodology, has been unable to destabilise the established disciplinary order. However, with younger scholars becoming increasingly interested in studying gender in geography, novel and innovative methods that include combinations of quantitative and qualitative analyses, visual sources and in-depth case studies are being tried out and accepted in geography despite its masculine legacy. This pioneering study brings together Indian geographers’ contributions to understanding gender, and through them, seeks to enrich the discipline of geography. It engages with the recent ‘spatial turn’ in the social sciences, which has reclaimed the explanatory power of space and place in social theory that had been nearly lost to deconstructive postmodernist scholarship. The volume draws entirely from the Indian scholarship, showcasing contextualised knowledge production, but hopes to initiate a a dialogue with scholars elsewhere working with feminist methodologies.",,,,,"Saraswati Raju, Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt",,2012-12-06,2012,2012-12-06,,,,,Closed,Monograph,,,,,15,3,,3.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047649856,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies; 4406 Human Geography; 4410 Sociology,5 Gender Equality

Geographic Information Systems (GISs) are now ubiquitous and relatively inexpensive. They have revolutionized the way people explore and understand the world around them. The capability they confer allows us to capture, manage, analyze, and display geographic data in ways that were undreamt of a generation ago. GIS has enabled users to make decisions and solve problems as diverse as designing bus routes, locating new businesses, responding to emergencies, and researching climate change. GIS is also having a major impact in the classroom. Students and teachers around the world are using this significant emerging technology in the secondary school classroom to study social and scientific concepts and processes, to broaden their technical skills, and to engage in problem solving and decision making about local and global issues. International Perspectives on Teaching and Learning with GIS in Secondary Schools brings together authors from 34 countries who profile the current status of GIS in secondary school teaching and learning in their country. Each chapter includes a summary of the country’s educational context, a case study illustrating how GIS is used in secondary schooling, and an assessment of the opportunities and challenges in teaching and learning with GIS now and in the future. The book demonstrates that GIS is not only a technological tool to be used in the classroom, but also a catalyst for motivation, encouragement, and cooperation in understanding and solving global problems. The most up to date and extensive survey of GIS in the secondary education landscape, covering both principles and practice.Professor David Maguire, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Birmingham City University, UK International Perspectives on Teaching andLearning With GIS in Secondary Schools is a highly relevant, critically important, reflective contribution to the literature, providing strong arguments supporting the inclusion for spatial studies for all in secondary school education.  Karl Donert, President, EUROGEO This is an invaluable and inspirational examination of innovation in geospatial technologies in secondary schools around the world. Each chapter contains practical models for how to integrate powerful tools for spatial analysis into a range of subjects. It will be useful to classroom teachers and administrators seeking pathways to implementation and teacher educators considering how to prepare the next generation to use geospatial technologies.

Few would argue that the standard narrative of the history of psychology has emphasized European and American traditions over others, but in today’s global culture, there is a greater need in psychology for international understanding. This book describes the historical development of psychology in countries throughout the world. Articles provide narratives that examine the political and socioeconomic forces that have shaped their nations' psychologies. Each story adds another element to our understanding of the history of psychology. The articles in this volume remind us that there are unique contexts and circumstances that influence the ways in which the science and practice of psychology are assimilated into our daily lives.

Their hidden origins trace back to the discovery of the neutron and the cascade of knowledge and applications released by the chain reaction. Unlike the atomic bomb which motivated their creation, nuclear specialists in the USA, Britain, and Canada did not burst into visibility at the end of the Second World War. Cosseted and cloistered by their governments, they worked in secrecy for a further decade to explore applications of atomic energy at a handful of national laboratories. The identities of these unusually voiceless experts—forming a uniquely state-managed discipline—were shaped in the context of pre-war nuclear physics, wartime industrial management, post-war politics, and utopian energy programmes. Even after their eventual emergence at universities and companies, nuclear workers carried the enduring legacy of their origins. Their shared experiences shaped not only their identities, but our collective memories of the nuclear age. And as illustrated by the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident seven decades after the Manhattan Project began, they are still seen conflictingly as selfless heroes or as mistrusted guardians of an unbottled and malevolent genie. Based on extensive archival research and interviews with participants, this bottom-up account tracks these shadowy specialists and how they evolved to influence late twentieth-century science, industry, and culture.",,,,,,,2012-04-26,2012,,2012-04-26,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Johnston, Sean F.","Johnston, Sean F.

                  The need for quality standards and rules of conduct concerning all aspects of the activities of psychology has long been acknowledged. In particular, over the last few years there has been a growing awareness of the need for and the advantage of internationally recognized ethical standards, particularly concerning research and practice and the well-being of individuals and societies. With this need in mind, this volume provides an assembly of facts and visions across the entire field of psychological ethics. The Oxford Handbook of International Psychological Ethics provides a source for information on psychological ethics worldwide, and offers an inclusive international review of contemporary and emerging ethical issues within the profession and science of psychology. The topics covered include: a history of ethical standards of psychology; developments and challenges in international psychological ethics, such as the search for universal ethical standards, ethical issues when working cross-nationally with immigrants and refugees, and ethical responses to security risks; ethical developments and issues within specific geographical regions; and research utilizing the new media.",,,,,"Andrea Ferrero, Yeşim Korkut, Mark M.

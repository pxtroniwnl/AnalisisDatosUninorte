An advantage of therapies that target FFA1 is their reduced risk of hypoglycemia relative to common type 2 diabetes treatments. In this work, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach was used to construct models to identify possible FFA1 agonists by applying four different machine-learning algorithms. The best model (M2) meets the Tropsha's test requirements and has the statistics parameters R2 = 0.843, Q2CV = 0.785, and Q2ext = 0.855. Also, coverage of 100% of the test set based on the applicability domain analysis was obtained. Furthermore, a deep analysis based on the ADME predictions, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations was performed. The lipophilicity and the residue interactions were used as relevant criteria for selecting a candidate from the screening of the DiaNat and DrugBank databases. Finally, the FDA-approved drugs bilastine, bromfenac, and fenofibric acid are suggested as potential and lead FFA1 agonists.","L.C. is grateful to the Instituto of Biomedicina of Universidad Católica Santiago de Guayaquil (UCSG), J.R.M. is grateful to the USFQ-POLI grants 2021–2022 for the financial support and Universidad del Norte, Colombia.

This paper describes the development of a BPS µPAD to detect and quantify the S100B biomarker from peripheral whole blood. The device uses NaCl functionalized VF2 filter paper as a sample collection pad, an MF1 filter paper for plasma retention, and an optimized microfluidic channel geometry. An inverted light microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and image processing software were used for visualizing BPS efficiency. A design of experiments (DOE) assessed the device's efficacy using an S100B ELISA Kit to measure clinically relevant S100B concentrations in plasma. The BPS device obtained 50 μL of plasma from 300 μL of whole blood after 3.5 min. The statistical correlation of S100B concentrations obtained using plasma from standard centrifugation and the BPS device was 0.98. The BPS device provides a simple manufacturing protocol, short fabrication time, and is capable of S100B detection using ELISA, making one step towards the integration of technologies aimed at low-cost POC testing of clinically relevant biomarkers.",We thank Universidad del Norte for facilitating the materials and equipment for all the performed experiments and Universidad Simón Bolívar for the financial support.,"This research was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757–2016 and by Gobernación del Atlántico call number 809-2018.

When the renal secretion capacity exceeds, calcium oxalate forms stones that accumulate in the kidneys. In this respect, detailed QSAR analysis, molecular docking, and dynamics simulations of a series of inhibitors containing glycolic, glyoxylic, and salicylic acid groups have been performed employing different regression machine learning techniques. Three robust models with less than 9 descriptors—based on a tenfold cross (Q2CV) and external (Q2EXT) validation—were found i.e., MLR1 (Q2CV = 0.893, Q2EXT = 0.897), RF1 (Q2CV = 0.889, Q2EXT = 0.907), and IBK1 (Q2CV = 0.891, Q2EXT = 0.907). An ensemble model was built by averaging the predicted pIC50 of the three models, obtaining a Q2EXT = 0.933. Physicochemical properties such as charge, electronegativity, hardness, softness, van der Waals volume, and polarizability were considered as attributes to build the models. To get more insight into the potential biological activity of the compouds studied herein, docking and dynamic analysis were carried out, finding the hydrophobic and polar residues show important interactions with the ligands. A screening of the DrugBank database V.5.1.7 was performed, leading to the proposal of seven commercial drugs within the applicability domain of the models, that can be suggested as possible PHT1 treatment.","The authors are grateful with the USFQ-POLI grants 2022-2023 for the financial support.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire based on the ""Noise Exposure Questionnaire"", plus 11 questions regarding hearing loss were sent to 730 randomly selected students. Participants self-reported time spent on different leisure noise activities and their subjective evaluation of the loudness of these activities, converted into equivalent noise levels, were used to estimate weekly noise exposure levels that were compared to occupational noise limits (> 85 dBA = hazardous). Inference statistics was applied to relate hearing symptoms and ""likely or having some degree of hearing loss"" with hazardous weekly leisure noise exposure levels.
RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants reported at least one hypoacusis symptom. The most frequent sound-related ear symptom was tinnitus (72%). Fifty-five percent of the individuals presented weekly exposure to noise >85 dBA. Symptoms of hearing loss were more prevalent in those exposed to weekly noise levels >85 dBA.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there may be hearing loss caused by exposure to high levels of leisure noise in a large part of the study population. Health promotion of hearing conservation should be emphasized at university level. Objective repeated measurement of hearing acuity should be part of integral health services for the youth population.",,,CoDAS,,,"Adolescent; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced; Humans; Leisure Activities; Noise, Occupational; Occupational Exposure; Students; Universities",2022,2022,2022,,34,1,e20200379,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escobar-Castro, Dellanira Isabel; De Jesús Vivas-Cortés, Michelle; Espinosa-Cepeda, Cindy Paola; Zamora-Romero, Alberto Mario; Peñuela-Epalza, Martha Elena","Escobar-Castro, Dellanira Isabel (Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte - Barranquilla (Atlántico), Colombia.); De Jesús Vivas-Cortés, Michelle (Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte - Barranquilla (Atlántico), Colombia.); Espinosa-Cepeda, Cindy Paola (Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte - Barranquilla (Atlántico), Colombia.); Zamora-Romero, Alberto Mario (Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Programa de Medicina, Universidad del Norte - Barranquilla (Atlántico), Colombia.); Peñuela-Epalza, Martha Elena (Departamento de Salud Pública, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Departamento de Salud Pública, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte - Barranquilla (Atlántico), Colombia.)","Peñuela-Epalza, Martha Elena (Universidad del Norte)","Escobar-Castro, Dellanira Isabel (Universidad del Norte); De Jesús Vivas-Cortés, Michelle (Universidad del Norte); Espinosa-Cepeda, Cindy Paola (Universidad del Norte); Zamora-Romero, Alberto Mario (Universidad del Norte); Peñuela-Epalza, Martha Elena (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,1.55,https://www.scielo.br/j/codas/a/rjwmsqLLmRng9X5v8t6L86F/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142632747,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

The analysis is performed in two classifier models, namely, a static (linear discriminant analysis, LDA) model and a dynamic (hidden conditional random field, HCRF) model. The impact of using the sliding window technique (SWT) in the static and dynamic models is also analyzed. The study proved that their combination with temporal features provides significant information to improve the classification in a two-class motor imagery task for LDA (average accuracy: 0.7192 no additional features, 0.7617 by adding correlation, 0.7606 by adding Jaccard distance; p < 0.001) and HCRF (average accuracy: 0.7370 no additional features, 0.7764 by adding correlation, 0.7793 by adding Jaccard distance; p < 0.001).

Previous studies have found that vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor (VDR) TaqI, BsmI, FokI, and ApaI gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence immune response and susceptibility to skin disorders.
AIM: To explore the role of VDR SNPs, and the association of vitamin D serum levels in a sample of Colombian Caribbean CSU patients. Methods: It is a case-control study. A group of CSU patients (n = 100) was compared with healthy individuals as a control group (n = 100). VDR polymorphisms were genotyped by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Taqman® probes. Allelic, genotypic, and haplotype associations were estimated. Serum vitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the presence of G allele in TaqI and A allele in FokI SNPs of VDR gene was found to be a risk factor for CSU (odds ratio (OR) estimated using logistic regression adjusted by gender: 2.08 and 1.61, respectively, all P values < 0.05). The individuals who carry GCCA haplotype showed decrease in vitamin D levels (11.34 ng/mL; P = 0.002) with the G allele of TaqI and A allele of FokI gene SNPs.
CONCLUSION: We reported for the first time the association of TaqI [rs731236] and FokI [rs2228570] VDR gene SNPs showing as a risk factor for CSU in a sample of multiethnic patients from the Colombian Caribbean population.",,,Allergologia et Immunopathologia,,,"Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Case-Control Studies; Chronic Urticaria; Quality of Life; Colombia; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; Vitamin D; Receptors, Calcitriol",2022-10-29,2022,2022-10-29,,50,SP2,8-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Egea, Eduardo; Domínguez-Vargas, Alex; Fang, Luis; Moreno-Woo, Sofia; Serrano, Carlos; García, Elizabeth; De Egea, Gloria Garavito","Egea, Eduardo (División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; dominguezaa@uninorte.edu.co.); Fang, Luis (División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Moreno-Woo, Sofia (División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Serrano, Carlos (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad ICESI, Cali, Colombia.); García, Elizabeth (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.); De Egea, Gloria Garavito (División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia.)",,"Egea, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Universidad del Norte); Fang, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Moreno-Woo, Sofia (Universidad del Norte); Serrano, Carlos (Icesi University); García, Elizabeth (Universidad de Los Andes); De Egea, Gloria Garavito (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Simón Bolívar)",2,2,,0.69,https://all-imm.com/index.php/aei/article/download/696/1082,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152345712,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology,

E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) measure through Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has been used to evaluate systolic function in echocardiography. We analyzed EPSS for diagnosis of Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction <50% and ≤40% in ED patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a convenience sample of patients presenting to ED with chest pain or dyspnea who underwent admission POCUS evaluation by Internal Medicine Specialist unaware of Transthoracic Echocardiogram. Accuracy was assessed with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR) and Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The best cut off point was calculated using Youden Index. Results: Ninety-six patients were included. Median EPSS and LVEF were 10mm and 41% respectively. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) to diagnose a LVEF <50% was 0.90 (IC95% 0.84-0.97). Youden Index was 0.71 with cut off point EPSS at 9.5mm, performing with a sensitivity of 0.80, a specificity of 0.91, a positive LR of 9.8 and a negative LR of 0.2. AUC-ROC to diagnose a LVEF ≤40% was 0.91 (IC95% 0.85-0.97). Youden Index was 0.71 with a cut off point EPSS at 9.5mm, performing with a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.80, a positive LR of 4.7 and a negative LR of 0.1.

By reducing biomass fluctuation, biodiversity could mitigate the impact of changing environmental conditions on rural incomes as long as people exploits a diverse set of natural assets. This effect is analogous to the risk-spreading function of financial portfolios. This paper presents evidence of the portfolio effect for an open-access artisanal fishery in an estuarine ecosystem, located in a Colombian Biosphere Reserve. Using catch statistics from 2002 to 2018, we evaluate the contribution of catch diversity to the stabilization of fishing income. We find that changes in catch composition are related to seasonal and interannual variations in salinity conditions. The portfolio effect arises from asynchronous fluctuations of fish species due to fluctuating environmental conditions. Catch diversification, instead of specialization, help achieve resilient fisheries.",,"Andrés Vargas and David Diaz received funding from Universidad del Norte, www.uninorte.edu.co.

The origin of this autoreactive response remains unclear. However, for several autoreactive responses, molecular mimicry between environmental antigens and human proteins is key to trigger autoantibodies and finally autoimmunity manifestations. Considering that PR3 is a serine protease and house dust mite (HDM) group 3 allergens share this biochemical activity, the aim of this study was to identify cross-reactive epitopes between serine proteases from human and mites using an in silico approach. Methods: Multi alignment among amino acid sequences of PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens was performed to explore identity and structural homology. ElliPro and BepiPred  in silico tools were used to predict B and T cell epitopes. Consurf tool was used to conduct identification of conserved regions in serine proteases family. Results: PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens shared moderate identity and structural homology (root mean square deviation < 1).

However less is known about pathogen avoidance mechanisms underlying stigma towards SMI, specially in samples of non-industrialised societies of Latin America and the Caribbean. The primary aim of this study was to examine pathogen-disgust sensitivity and danger appraisal mechanisms in responses of stigma towards SMI.MethodsCross-sectional design with convenience sampling. Using an online survey, volunteers at the Universidad del Norte in Colombia (N = 271) provided their sociodemographic data and completed the Three-Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS). Participants were randomised to different descriptions of someone with SMI that varied in terms of aggressiveness (with and without danger) and causes of the SMI. Then, following the attribution questionnaire (AQ-27), respondents reported affective and discriminatory responses to the person in the description.ResultsIncreased disgust sensitivity to pathogen stimuli resulted in stronger reports of anger (β = .14; p = .03), and fear (β = 0.27; p < 0.001). The relationship between disgust sensitivity and discriminatory responses was indirectly mediated by fear towards SMI (Bootstrapped CI =—.04,—.009). Dangerousness attributions in the description of SMI predicted stronger feelings of anger (β = .23; p = 0.001) and fear (β = .40; p < .001), as well increased support for coercion-segregation of SMI (β = .34; p = 0.04), but less intentions to help (β = -.26; p = 0.003). The relationship between dangerousness and support for coercion was mediated by fear (Bootstrapped CI = .72, 1.37) and anger (Bootstrapped CI = .06, .44), whereas pity (Bootstrapped CI = .03, .38) and fear (Bootstrapped CI = -1.39, -.69) mediated responses of support for coercion-segregation of SMI. Attributions about causes and personal responsibility were not significantly linked to stigma towards SMI (p > 0.05).ConclusionsFindings suggested that pathogen avoidance and danger appraisal systems interplay in the generation of discriminatory behaviour towards SMI.

Intimate partners commit IPV, people with whom the victim shares (or shared) a close personal or sexual relationship. This phenomenon has a great global and national impact. Thus, it is necessary to establish trends of the risk of physical violence to women by their current or former partner in each department of Colombia and its relationship with sociodemographic and health characteristics. This study uses an ecological approach at the departmental level, with victims of intimate partner violence treated at the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (INMLyCF). Potential factors were identified through Bayesian factor analysis and were included in the model to estimate risk. The findings show that the Casanare department had the highest risk of producing victims (SMR: 2.545). In departments where the educational level of women is at or below primary school, there is a high-risk β = 0.343 (0.285, 0.397) of them being assaulted. For the departments in which the employment of women is in sales and services or office workers, the associated factor presents a higher risk β = 0.361 (0.201, 0.485), as in the risk related to affiliation with the social security system β = 0.338 (0.246, 0.498), as well as sexual and reproductive life β = 0.143 (0.003, 0.322).

Concurrence with the inflammatory neuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is observed in 1:4,000 ZIKV cases. Whether the neurologic symptoms of ZIKV infection are immune mediated is unclear. We used rodent and human live cellular models to screen for anti-peripheral nerve reactive IgG and IgM autoantibodies in the sera of patients with ZIKV with and without GBS.
METHODS: In this study, 52 patients with ZIKV-GBS were compared with 134 ZIKV-infected patients without GBS and 91 non-ZIKV controls. Positive sera were taken forward for target identification by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and candidate antigens were validated by ELISA and cell-based assays. Autoantibody reactions against glycolipid antigens were also screened on an array.
RESULTS: Overall, IgG antibody reactivities to rat Schwann cells (SCs) (6.5%) and myelinated cocultures (9.6%) were significantly higher, albeit infrequent, in the ZIKV-GBS group compared with all controls. IgM antibody immunoreactivity to dorsal root ganglia neurones (32.3%) and SCs (19.4%) was more frequently observed in the ZIKV-GBS group compared with other controls, whereas IgM reactivity to cocultures was as common in ZIKV and non-ZIKV sera. Strong axonal-binding ZIKV-GBS serum IgG antibodies from 1 patient were confirmed to react with neurofascin 155 and 186. Serum from a ZIKV-infected patient without GBS displayed strong myelin-binding and putative antilipid antigen reaction characteristics. There was, however, no significant association of ZIKV-GBS with any known antiglycolipid antibodies.
DISCUSSION: Autoantibody responses in ZIKV-GBS target heterogeneous peripheral nerve antigens suggesting heterogeneity of the humoral immune response despite a common prodromal infection.","The authors thank Professors Peter Brophy and Sarosh Irani for kindly providing the anti-periaxin antibody and healthy human control sera, respectively.

Currently, national and international guidelines recommend using Omalizumab for cases refractory to management with antihistamines. Despite advances in the knowledge of Omalizumab for the management of CU, although there are few studies in underdeveloped countries, there are many studies evaluating the impact of Omalizumab treatment. There is not clinical information related with CSU-Omalizumab in patient settled in the Caribbean area. This research aims to evaluate the management of CU with Omalizumab in a real-life scenario in Colombia.
Methodology: We conducted an observational, descriptive, and retrospective study with patient recruitment between 2014 and 2017 of individuals diagnosed with Chronic Urticaria (CU) treating allergology specialists in five Colombian cities. We included patients with CU who failed to achieve disease control after treatment for 4 weeks with fourfold doses of second-generation H1-antihistamines, as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines and who received treatment with Omalizumab.
Results: We included 123 patients, 73.1% (n = 90) were women. The mean age was 47.1 years (Standard Deviation, SD: 16.2). The median of the total months of disease evolution was 30 (IQR = 13-58). 81.3 % (n = 100) of patients were diagnosed with chronic spontaneous urticarial (CSU). 4.8% (n = 6) had inducible CU (CIndU), and 13.8% (n = 17) reported mixed urticaria (spontaneous CU with at least one inducible component). Regarding emotional factors, 34.9% (n = 43) of subjects indicated anxiety symptoms, 34.1% (n = 42) had exacerbations associated with stress, and 14.6% (n = 18) manifested episodes of sadness. The percentage of patients with CSU controlled according to medical criteria at 3 months with Omalizumab were 80% (n = 80/100) and at 6 months 87% (n = 87/100). The frequency of adverse events was 29.2% (n = 36), with headache being the most frequent adverse event.
Conclusions: This real-life study with Omalizumab at CU describes percentages of effectiveness and safety similar to those observed in pivotal and real-life studies conducted in other regions around the world.","We thank the patients for their voluntary participation in the study.

It generates significant computational consumption, reducing the computational efficiency of the victim's computer. This attack has increased due to the rise of cryptocurrencies and their profitability and its difficult detection by the user. The identification and blocking of this type of malware have become an aspect of research related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology; in the literature, some machine learning and deep learning techniques are presented, but they are still susceptible to improvement. In this work, we explore multiple Machine Learning classification models for detecting cryptojacking on websites, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor, and XGBoost. To this end, we make use of a dataset, composed of network and host features' samples, to which we apply various feature selection methods such as those based on statistical methods, e.g., Test Anova, and other methods as Wrappers, not only to reduce the complexity of the built models but also to discover the features with the greatest predictive power. Our results suggest that simple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbor models, can achieve success rate similar to or greater than that of advanced algorithms such as XGBoost and even those of other works based on Deep Learning.",,This work was carried out with the support of the program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017- Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017” and the Universidad del Norte.,Sensors,,"Nima Karimian, Hossein Sayadi",Machine Learning; Algorithms; Logistic Models,2022-11-27,2022,2022-11-27,,22,23,9219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés; Álvarez, Daniel Povedano; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villalba, Luis Javier García","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja 150003, Colombia); Álvarez, Daniel Povedano (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Calle Profesor José García Santesmases 9, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andrés (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Álvarez, Daniel Povedano (Complutense University of Madrid); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Complutense University of Madrid); Villalba, Luis Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid)",4,4,1.88,2.24,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/23/9219/pdf?version=1669945926,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153190941,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

A descriptive and retrospective study of adult patients with glomerular diseases from the Colombian Caribbean region was made. All diagnoses by renal biopsy with light microscopy and immunofluorescence obtained between January 2008 and June 2018 were recorded. Eight hundred and seventy-one renal biopsies were obtained. The main clinical indication for biopsy was nephritic syndrome (36%). SGD was more frequent than PGD (55% vs. 45%). Within SGD group, lupus nephritis (LN) was the most frequent etiology (83%). Within PGD group, membranous nephropathy (33%) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (19%) were the most common glomerular diseases. At a 24-month follow-up, the patients with FSGS and paraproteinemia-mediated glomerular disease had the worst renal survival prognosis.

Nowadays, developing products for new business models based on renting and servitization practices is of paramount importance. Furthermore, durability enables the application of circularity strategies for product lifespan extension, including reuse, repair, refurbish, and remanufacture. However, despite the growing trend around durability, there is no precise tracing of its evolution, implementation, and potential benefits from the product design stage. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the existing literature about durability and its relationship with the circular economy concept starting from the product design process, uncovering potential research directions, challenges, and trends for its application. A total of 147 articles were selected and analyzed from 40 years of research using two main approaches. First, a keyword-based analysis was used to identify trending topics around the concept of durability. Second, a content-based analysis was used, encompassing four main aspects: objectives and methodology; actors involved and lifecycle phases; circular economy strategies; and design phase, design attributes, and type of products involved. The analysis identified how the concept has evolved during the last four decades, indicating that future trends envisage methodologies, assessment tools, and guidelines to support product life extension.",,"This work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación Universidad del Norte.",Heliyon,,,,2022-09-22,2022,2022-09-22,2022-09,8,9,e10734,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mesa, Jaime A.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Aguiar, Marina Fernandes; Jugend, Daniel","Mesa, Jaime A.

The catalysts were characterized by XRF, XRD, textural properties, XPS, Raman, Py-TPD, and EDS elemental mapping. The chemical analyses by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), EDS elemental mapping, and CHNS-O elemental analysis showed stoichiometric values Al/Mg = 38-40, Mo:Ni:P ∼ 1, and S ≤ 4.5 wt % (this value means that the molar ratio Mo:S ∼ 1.0:1.6, i.e., MoS2); also EDS elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Mo, Ni, Al, O, P, Mg, and S with good distribution on Al2O3-MgO. The impregnation of metals leads to a decrease in the surface area and pore volume as follows NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO < MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO < NiP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO < Al2O3-MgO < Al2O3 (unimodal pore size distribution), propitiating a pseudo bimodal pore size distribution with Dp-BJH between ∼5-7 nm and 11.8-14.2 nm for the presence of MgO. XRD confirmed differences between metallic phosphates and phosphides, and XPS confirmed the presence at the surface of Moδ+(0 < δ+ < 2), Mo4+, Mo6+, Niδ+(0 < δ+ < 2), Ni2+, S2-, SO4 2-, Pδ+, and P5+ species. Raman revealed the presence of MoS2 only in MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO and NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO, while the NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO catalyst had a more significant number of Brønsted and Lewis sites, although the increasing temperature decreased the Lewis sites. MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO was more active at HDO showing the highest production rate for octadecane of 53 mol/(gcat·h), whereas NiP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO was more active at HDCx-HDCn [45 mol/(gcat·h)] and HCK [6 mol/(gcat·h)]; meanwhile, NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO had a mix of HDO [47 mol/(gcat·h)] and HDCx-HDCn [41 mol/(gcat·h)]. This showed production towards octadecane, heptadecane, and light hydrocarbons, meaning that the fatty acids were deoxygenated through bifunctional sites for hydrogenation (HYD) and hydrogenolysis (HYG) as follows: MoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO (K1 = 0.08 and K2 = 0.03 L/mol) < NiMoP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO (K1 = 0.25 and K2 = 0.45 L/mol) < NiP-S/γ-Al2O3-MgO (K1 = 2.5 and K2 = 6.5 L/mol). For this reason, we considered that phosphide acts as a structural promoter with sulfur on its surface as a ""mixed phosphidic-sulphidic species"", allowing the largest generation of heptadecane and octadecane by the presence of BRIM sites for HYD and CUS sites for HYG.","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support by Universidad del Atlántico and Universidad del Norte, and the fine technical assistance of Catalysis Research Center-CICAT UIS.

Here, we present the Science Clubs Colombia (Clubes de Ciencia Colombia-SCC) program, a pioneering STEAM capacity-building initiative led by volunteer scientists to engage youth and children from underserved communities in science. The program brings together researchers based in Colombia and abroad to lead intensive project-based learning workshops for young students in urban and rural areas. These projects focus on channeling the students' technical and cognitive scientific aptitudes to tackle challenges of both local and global relevance. The program provides high-quality STEAM education adapted to communities' needs and articulates long-lasting international collaborations using the mobility of the Colombian diaspora. The program's success is tangible via its sustained growth and adaptability. Since its first version in 2015, 722 volunteer scientists living abroad or in Colombia have collaborated to create 364 clubs with the participation of 9,295 students. We describe elements of the SCC program that lead to a scalable and reproducible outcome to engage science diasporas in STEAM education. Additionally, we discuss the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the generation of international networks as potential science diplomacy outcomes. The SCC program strengthens the involvement of Latin American youth in science, demonstrates the potential of engaging scientific diasporas in science education, and enriches connections between the Global South and the Global North.","The authors acknowledge that data collection and analysis from the program execution comes from different sources of the impact assessment reports, internal data collection for the execution of the program once instructors accept to participate, and other sources that allow authors to complement the data analysis presented.

United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address this important gap by investing in an advance purchase commitment (APC) mechanism to accelerate the development and evaluation of Zika rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for case detection and surveillance. This paper describes the performance evaluation of five Zika RDTs eligible for procurement.
Methods: A network of European Union-funded ZikaPLAN sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America with access to relevant serum specimens were selected to evaluate RDTs developed for the UNICEF APC mechanism. A standardised protocol and evaluation panels were developed and a call for specimens for the evaluation panels issued to different sites. Each site contributed specimens to the evaluation from their biobank. Data were collated, analysed and presented to the UNICEF Procurement Review Group for review.
Findings: Three RDTs met the criteria for UNICEF procurement of sensitivity and specificity of 85% against a refence standard. The sensitivity/specificity of the ChemBio anti-Zika Virus (ZIKV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) test was 86.4 %/86.7% and the ChemBio ZCD system for anti-ZIKV IgM was 79.0%/97.1%, anti-dengue virus (DENV) IgM 90.0%/89.2%, anti-Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) IgM 90.6%/97.2%. The sensitivity/specificity of the SD Biosensor anti-ZIKV IgM was 96.8 %/90.8%, anti-DENV IgM 71.8%/83.5%, the DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) glycoprotein 90.0%/90.2%, anti- yellow fever virus (YFV) IgM 84.6%/92.4%, anti-CHIKV IgM 86.3%/97.5%.
Interpretation: Three RDTs fulfilled the performance thresholds set by WHO and were eligible for UNICEF procurement. These tests will improve the diagnosis of ZIKV and other arboviral infections as well as providing countries with better tools for surveillance and response to future epidemics.

This paper describes the development of a fully open-source, modular, wireless, battery-powered, smartphone-controlled, low-cost potentiostat capable of conducting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the electrochemical detection of the S100B protein captured in an ANTI-S100B functionalized thin-film gold interdigitated electrode platform to support traumatic brain injury diagnosis and treatment. EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL.

Some species exclusively affect humans, contaminating wounds, mucous membranes, and other tissues. It is a disease with marked socioeconomic connotations.
Case Presentation: The current case involves a 95-year-old woman, an inhabitant of the Andean region of Ecuador with a history of resection of basal cell carcinoma in the left zygomatic region and a diagnosis of chronic leukemia. The surgical wound was secondarily infested with Cochliomyia hominivorax fly larvae and the patient was readmitted to the hospital to treat this complication. A marked clinical improvement was observed after surgical debridement, removal of larvae and administration of ivermectin and antibiotics.
Conclusion: The determinants of this infestation were advanced age, neglect, and destitution in a patient with an open wound on the face after resection of a basal cell carcinoma. This case illustrates the appalling reality of the marginalized and excluded population of South America. Also of concern is the expansion of myiasis-producing fly populations to areas outside their natural humid and warm habitat.

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed using quinolinone and thiosemicarbazide as pharmacophoric nuclei; the best model showed statistical parameters of R2 = 0.83; F = 47.96; s = 0.31, and was validated by several different methods. The van der Waals volume, electron density, and electronegativity model results suggested a pivotal role in antituberculosis (anti-TB) activity. Subsequently, from this model a new series of quinolinone-thiosemicarbazone 11a-e was designed and docked against two tuberculosis protein targets: enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) and decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose-2'-oxidase (DprE1). Molecular dynamics simulation over 200 ns showed a binding energy of -71.3 to -12.7 Kcal/mol, suggesting likely inhibition. In vitro antimycobacterial activity of quinolinone-thiosemicarbazone for 11a-e was evaluated against M. bovis, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and six different strains of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. All compounds exhibited good to excellent activity against all the families of M. tuberculosis. Several of the here synthesized compounds were more effective than the standard drugs (isoniazid, oxafloxacin), 11d and 11e being the most active products. The results suggest that these compounds may contribute as lead compounds in the research of new potential antimycobacterial agents.","The authors thank Universidad del Norte, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá 111321, Universidad del Valle and MINCIENCIAS-Project Number: 201477758055 (contract.

Annual mortality data 2014–2019 by municipality of residence and pooled effect measures for total, natural and specific causes of mortality were used to calculate the number of annual avoidable deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) related to the excess of PM2.5 concentration over the current mean annual national standard of 25 µg/m3 and projected standard of 15 µg/m3.ResultsCompared to surface data from 28 municipalities with monitoring stations in 2019, ACAG and CAMSRA models under or overestimated annual mean PM2.5 concentrations. Estimations from ACAG model had a mean bias 1,7 µg/m3 compared to a mean bias of 4,7 µg/m3 from CAMSRA model. Using ACAG model, estimations of total nationally attributable deaths to PM2.5 exposure over 25 and 15 µg/m3 were 142 and 34,341, respectively. Cardiopulmonary diseases accounted for most of the attributable deaths due to PM2.5 excess of exposure (38%). Estimates of YPLL due to all-cause mortality for exceeding the national standard of 25 µg/m3 were 2,381 years.ConclusionComparison of two global air quality models for estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations during 2014–2019 at municipality scale in Colombia showed important differences. Avoidable deaths estimations represent the total number of deaths that could be avoided if the current and projected national standard for PM2.5 annual mean have been met, and show the health-benefit of the implementation of more restrictive air quality standards.","The authors would like to thank Yurley Rojas for her contribution to the generation of maps.

This is especially relevant if there are important gaps among these locations in terms of significant factors such as job opportunities, quality of health service, among others. This research presents a methodology to perform a recommended geographic redistribution of immigrants to improve their chances of socio-economic integration. The proposed methodology adapts a data-driven algorithm developed by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University to allocate immigrants based on a socio-economic integration outcome across available locations. We extend their approach to study the immigration process between two developing countries. Specifically, we focus on the case of the arrival of immigrants from Venezuela to Colombia. We consider the absorptive capacity of locations in Colombia and include the health and education needs of immigrants in our analysis. From the application in the Venezuelan-Colombian context, we find that the proposed redistribution increases the probability that immigrants access formal employment by more than 50%. Furthermore, we identify variables associated with immigrants' formal employment and discuss specific strategies to improve the probability of success of vulnerable immigrants.","We would like to specially thank Dr. Duncan Lawrence, Dr. Jens Hainmueller, and Jennifer Fei from the Immigration Policy Lab for accompanying us in this research and for providing their support and feedback.

In Colombia and Latin America, there are few studies on the immune response of the newborn against SARS-CoV-2.
AIM: To determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in umbilical cord blood in two hospital centers in Córdoba and Sucre.
METHODS: Between March and June 2021, a prospective descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out. Two hospitals from the departments of Córdoba and Sucre, located in the Northwest Caribbean area of Colombia, participated. Three hundred sixty umbilical cord blood samples were taken at the two hospitals. A commercial ELISA was performed to detect total IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. The ethics committee approved the study of the participating institutions.
RESULTS: Of 3.291 women who gave birth in the hospital centers included in the study, 360 (11%) participated. Complete clinical data were obtained for 223 women. The mean age of the women was 24 years (range, 15-42). 29.4% (106/360) of the umbilical cord samples had total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women did not have blood samples taken. 58% of the women were asymptomatic. There was no association between umbilical cord samples, clinical, epidemiological characteristics, and serological response to antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of umbilical cord blood samples was 29.4% for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

It has been associated with a high risk of contracting infectious diseases and with elevated mortality rates. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide and its prognosis is affected by a large number of recognizable risk factors. This narrative review updates the information on the impact of malnutrition, including both undernutrition and obesity, on the risk and prognosis of adults with CAP. Studies of CAP that have evaluated undernutrition have applied a variety of definitions when assessing the nutritional status of patients. Undernutrition has been associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, such as prolonged hospital stay, need for intensive care unit admission, and mortality; in contrast, most published studies have found that increased body mass index is significantly associated with higher survival in patients with CAP. However, some authors have presented divergent results, mainly in relation to the etiology of CAP (bacterial versus viral). Influenza infection, caused by influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, has been associated with worse prognosis in obese patients. The current data underscore the need for larger studies to examine the physiological mechanisms that explain the differential impact of malnutrition on outcomes.

Children are at a higher risk for progression to TB disease than adults. Isoniazid prophylaxis treatment period is long and can cause liver damage. Alternatives to isoniazid, such as rifamycin containing regimens, should be considered for prophylaxis. Previous systematic reviews, with different study designs and data combining results on children and adults, have evaluated the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens. We aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of all the different regimens available for the treatment of LTBI for children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, contacts of drug-susceptible TB, without HIV infection.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials without any language or publication date restriction. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of bias will be performed in duplicate with Cochrane Risk of Bias tool V.2. Pairwise meta-analysis of direct comparisons and network meta-analyses (NMAs) will be performed. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I2 and Cochrane thresholds. Direct and indirect estimates in an NMA will be combined if justifiable. Subgroups analyses will be performed in different mean age and study year groups. Sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias will be conducted. Publication bias will be investigated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will assess certainty of the evidence for the direct comparisons. GRADE approach for NMA will assess the quality of the evidence from the indirect and NMA.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. This systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines' effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia's strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Colombia; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Vaccination,2022-07-07,2022,2022-07-07,,11,,198,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo; Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, Bogota, Bogota, 110311, Colombia)","Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte)","Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection; Universidad del Norte); Arregocés-Castillo, Leonardo (Ministry of Health and Social Protection); Ruiz-Gómez, Fernando (Ministry of Health and Social Protection)",7,5,0.53,4.86,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-198/v3/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149313267,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Legionellosis is becoming increasingly important as a public health problem throughout the world; although it is an underreported disease, studies have consistently documented a high incidence. In addition, health costs associated with the disease are high. Diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is based mainly on the detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine. However, there have been advances in detection tests for patients with legionellosis. New methodologies show greater sensitivity and specificity, detect more species and serogroups of Legionella spp., and have the potential for use in epidemiological studies. Testing for Legionella spp. is recommended at hospital admission for severe community-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotics directed against Legionella spp. should be included early as empirical therapy. Inadequate or delayed antibiotic treatment in Legionella pneumonia has been associated with a worse prognosis. Either a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or a macrolide (azithromycin preferred) is the recommended first-line therapy for Legionnaires’ disease; however, little information is available regarding adverse events or complications, or about the duration of antibiotic therapy and its association with clinical outcomes. Most published studies evaluating antibiotic treatment for Legionnaires’ disease are observational and consequently susceptible to bias and confounding. Well-designed studies are needed to assess the usefulness of diagnostic tests regarding clinical outcomes, as well as randomized trials comparing fluoroquinolones and macrolides or combination therapy that evaluate outcomes and adverse events.","Acknowledgements

OBJECTIVE: To identify differentially expressed gene profiles of leukoplakia and its progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma, essential for the discovery of new biomarkers to predict and prevent the presence of diseases in the oral cavity.
METHODS: Initially, gene profiles of GSE85514 and GSE160042 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used. Differentially expressed genes were identified using GEO2R. The CLUEGO plugin in Cytoscape was used for DEG functionality and enrichment analysis. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Cytoscape from data collected online from the STRING server.
RESULTS: According to the MCC algorithm, the 10 most found gene sequences were HNRNPU, SMC1A, PAFAH1B1, EHMT1, SPTBN4, OLFM1, NCAM1, SF3B3, FGF2, and UBE2I; with HNRNPU, SMC1A, and PAFAH1B1 being the most representative of the modules.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to describe the gene sequences that promote the progression from leukoplakia to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Within these genes, the HNRNPU, SMC1A, and PAFAH1B1 constitute the main promising therapeutic targets to counteract the progression of oral cancer, they could also be important biomarkers for the diagnosis and classification of the disease.",We thank the computer time provided by the University of Cartagena and the Professors Antistio Alviz-Amador and Rafael Pineda-Aleman,,Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,,,"Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Computational Biology; Leukoplakia; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Gene Expression",2022-11-01,2022,2022-11-01,2022-11-01,23,11,3833-3842,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Avila, Jaime Guzman; Redondo, Carlos Silvera; Alviz-Amador, Antistio","de Avila, Jaime Guzman (Department of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, University of Cartagena Cartagena, Colombia.); Redondo, Carlos Silvera (Department of Genetics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Alviz-Amador, Antistio (Pharmacology and Therapeutic Group, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Cartagena, Health Science Campus, Colombia.)","Alviz-Amador, Antistio (University of Cartagena)","de Avila, Jaime Guzman (University of Cartagena); Redondo, Carlos Silvera (Universidad del Norte); Alviz-Amador, Antistio (University of Cartagena)",1,1,,0.49,http://journal.waocp.org/article_90375_a21f6087284bf5346bca4ba23b01d100.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153204503,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Nonetheless, CR decreases the workability of mixes by increasing the viscosity of the binder, leading to an increase in the production temperatures of asphalt mixes. However, warm mix technologies can reduce the temperature demand associated with these processes. The preceding explains the growing interest in producing rubberised asphalt binders incorporating warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives. In this research, the mechanical and rheological properties of a 60/70 penetration grade asphalt binder modified with CR (at a dosage of 15, 18 and 21% by the wet process) and WMA chemical additives (Evotherm M1 and Iterlow T) were investigated. Laboratory tests included penetration, softening point, rotational viscosity, frequency sweep through dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) tests. The results indicate that CR increases the stiffness of the asphalt binder, which is reflected in a lower penetration grade and improved softening point. It also improves its rutting resistance but decreases fatigue performance. Furthermore, it has been shown that under the conditions studied, the higher the CR content, the more elevated the degree of stiffness and performance of the asphalt binder. On the other hand, WMA technology decreases asphalt stiffness and performance at high temperatures.",,"The authors express their sincere gratitude to the Universidad del Norte and the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) for financing this investigation effort via “Research Project 745/2016, Contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105 “, and the company Humberto Quintero O.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor L3 (ADGRL3) gene are associated with increased susceptibility to developing ADHD worldwide. However, the effect of ADGRL3 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on the ADGRL3 protein function is vastly unknown. Using several bioinformatics tools to evaluate the impact of mutations, we found that nsSNPs rs35106420, rs61747658, and rs734644, previously reported to be associated and in linkage with ADHD in disparate populations from the world over, are predicted as pathogenic variants. Docking analysis of rs35106420, harbored in the ADGLR3-hormone receptor domain (HRM, a common extracellular domain of the secretin-like GPCRs family), showed that HRM interacts with the Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), part of the incretin hormones family. GIP has been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, and our analyses suggest a potential link to ADHD. Overall, the comprehensive application of bioinformatics tools showed that functional mutations in the ADGLR3 gene disrupt the standard and wild ADGRL3 structure, most likely affecting its metabolic regulation. Further in vitro experiments are granted to evaluate these in silico predictions of the ADGRL3-GIP interaction and dissect the complexity underlying the development of ADHD.","We express our highest appreciation to the families who, for the last 25 years, have participated in our genetic studies of ADHD.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the health care attributes respondents at 2 pediatric institutions rate as important when prioritizing machine learning model implementation. The secondary objective was to describe their perspectives on implementation using a qualitative approach.
METHODS: In this mixed methods study, we distributed a survey to health system leaders, physicians, and data scientists at 2 pediatric institutions. We asked respondents to rank the following 5 attributes in terms of implementation usefulness: the clinical problem was common, the clinical problem caused substantial morbidity and mortality, risk stratification led to different actions that could reasonably improve patient outcomes, reducing physician workload, and saving money. Important attributes were those ranked as first or second most important. Individual qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of respondents.
RESULTS: Among 613 eligible respondents, 275 (44.9%) responded. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 respondents. The most common important attributes were risk stratification leading to different actions (205/275, 74.5%) and clinical problem causing substantial morbidity or mortality (177/275, 64.4%). The attributes considered least important were reducing physician workload and saving money. Qualitative interviews consistently prioritized implementations that improved patient outcomes.

Consequently, a solution-based up-scalable synthesis approach is developed for polymeric quinone composites with graphene. Cellulose nanocrystals play a vital role in achieving greener processing and improving the composite electrochemical energy storage performance. The synthesis method emphasizes using aqueous reaction media, incorporates low-cost and biomass-derived feedstocks, avoids critical or scarce materials, and maintains temperatures below 200 °C. Stable aqueous graphene dispersions were obtained by hydrothermal reduction of electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxide in the presence of cellulose nanocrystals. Dispersions served as a reaction medium for quinone cationic polymerization, leading to core-shell type structures of polymer-covered mono-to-few layer graphene, thanks to the nanosheet restacking prevention effect provided by cellulose nanocrystal dispersions. A sample consisting of 5 wt% cellulose nanocrystals and 5 wt% graphene achieved storage metrics of 720.5 F g-1 and 129.6 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, retaining over 70% of the performance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles.",The authors would like to acknowledge Minciencias for the financial support given within the framework of the PhD National Scholarship Colciencias No. 617-2014 (UN-OJ-2014-26159).,,RSC Advances,,,,2022-03-21,2022,2022,2022-03-21,12,15,9416-9423,All OA; Gold,Article,"Illera-Perozo, Danny; Gomez-Vega, Humberto; Ram, Manoj","Illera-Perozo, Danny (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia Barranquilla Atlántico 081007 Colombia.); Gomez-Vega, Humberto (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Del Norte km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia Barranquilla Atlántico 081007 Colombia.); Ram, Manoj (PolyMaterials APP, LLC Tampa FL 33612 USA.)","Illera-Perozo, Danny (Universidad del Norte)","Illera-Perozo, Danny (Universidad del Norte); Gomez-Vega, Humberto (Universidad del Norte); Ram, Manoj (PolyMaterials APP, LLC Tampa FL 33612 USA.)",2,1,,0.5,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/ra/d2ra01232d,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146555543,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scale 2 (DSAS 2) was designed to specifically measure the stigma associated with this type of diabetes. However, the psychometric properties of its Spanish version have not yet been addressed.
Objective: To analyze the validity and reliability of the Spanish version of DSAS 2 in a Colombian population.
Materials and methods: In total, 501 patients with type 2 diabetes from Barranquilla answered the Spanish version of DSAS 2, a questionnaire with sociodemographic and clinical indicators, as well as instruments to measure depression, self-efficacy, and stress. We performed a factor analysis (exploratory and confirmatory) to determine the internal structure of the DSAS 2 in Spanish and used the alpha coefficient (α) to evaluate its reliability. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the DSAS 2 scores and the other variables under study.
Results: The three-factor structure (different treatment / judgment, guilt and shame) showed good fit to the data (RMSEA = 0.081, CFI = 0.959, TLI = 0.95) and good reliability (α = 0.76). Significant correlations of the scores of the DSAS 2 Spanish version were observed with self-efficacy (rs=-0.37, p<0.001), stress (rs =0.24 , p<0.001), and depression (rs=0.1, p=0.021). Besides, the scores showed variations associated with sociodemographic and clinical variables.
Conclusions: The Spanish version showed certain differences compared with the original version of the DSAS2 but there was adequate evidence of its validity and reliability to be used in Colombia.",,Universidad Andrés Bello.

We evaluated the potential role of the uplift of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) of the Colombian Andes and the Mérida Andes (MA) of Venezuela as drivers of vicariance between lowland populations co-distributed on both flanks. We synthesized published geological data and provided a new reconstruction showing that the EC-MA grew from north to south, reaching significant heights and separating drainages and changing sediment composition by 38-33 million years ago (Ma). A few lowland passes across the EC-MA may have reached their current heights (~1,900 m a.s.l.) at 3-5 Ma. We created a comparative phylogeographic data set for 37 lineages of lowland tetrapods. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, most divergences between sister populations or species across the EC-MA occurred during Pliocene and the Quaternary and a few during the latest Miocene, and coalescent simulations rejected synchronous divergence for most groups. Divergence times were on average slightly but significantly more recent in homeotherms relative to poikilotherms. Because divergence ages are mostly too recent relative to the geological history and too asynchronous relative to each other, divergence across the northern Andes may be better explained by organism-environment interactions concomitant with climate oscillations during the Pleistocene, and/or dispersal across portals through the Andes.",We are grateful to Michael J.

This study aims to assess the incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and evaluate the outcomes of patients with life-threatening arrhythmias (LTAs) in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy compared with those without LTA.
METHODS: We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases from inception to February 2021. The primary aim of the study was to determine the incidence of LTAs in TC patients. Other outcomes of interest were the odds of in-hospital, long-term mortality, and cardiogenic shock (CS) in TC patients with LTAs versus those without LTAs. For all statistical analyses, ReviewManager and MedCalc were used.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in this study involving 55,557 participants (2,185 with LTAs and 53,372 without LTAs). The pooled incidence of LTAs in the patients of TC was found to be 6.29% (CI: 4.70-8.08%; I2 = 94.67%). There was a statistically significant increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR = 4.74; CI: 2.24-10.04; I2 = 77%, p < 0.0001) and cardiogenic shock (OR = 5.60; CI: 3.51-8.95; I2 = 0%, p < 0.00001) in the LTA group versus the non-LTA group. LTA was not associated with long-term mortality (OR = 2.23; CI: 0.94-5.28; I2 = 53%, p = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: The pooled incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the patients of TC was found to be 6.29%.

The aeration process response variables are defined in terms of oxygen transfer and aeration efficiency through the standard volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa20), standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR), and standard aeration efficiency (SAE). Two methods of air injection were analyzed: 1. Air injection in the throat chamber of the Venturi generator; 2. air supplying in the suction side of the hydraulic pump of the aeration system. Experimental results indicate that the water renewal time variable (RT) is a statistically significant factor with respect to the KLa20, which can be maximized by decreasing RT. The effects of the variable flow ratio (FR) are greater than the effects of renewal time and area-volume ratio (AVR) concerning SOTR and SAE, indicating a maximum response with a minimum flow ratio, using the Venturi-Vortex microbubble generator. When the flow ratio decreases, the air flow increases, generating and transferring a greater amount of microbubbles (MB) into the water. It was found that increasing the air flow produced an increase in the standard oxygen transfer rate SOTR and standard aeration efficiency SAE. Results allow concluding that the injection of the air flow from the suction side of the pump promotes the generation of microbubbles (MB) for a maximum air flow allowed by the system. SOTR and SAE could be maximized whit the flow ratio factor and the Venturi-Vortex generator, supplying air flow from the suction side of the hydraulic pump.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-10-01,2022,2022-10-01,2022-10,8,10,e10824,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Oro Ochoa, Esteban; García, Mauricio Carmona; Padilla, Néstor Durango; Remolina, Andrés Martínez","De Oro Ochoa, Esteban (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); García, Mauricio Carmona (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Padilla, Néstor Durango (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Remolina, Andrés Martínez (Association for the Development of Aquaponics in Colombia “ADACOL”, Colombia)","García, Mauricio Carmona (Universidad del Norte)","De Oro Ochoa, Esteban (Universidad del Norte); García, Mauricio Carmona (Universidad del Norte); Padilla, Néstor Durango (Universidad del Norte); Remolina, Andrés Martínez (Association for the Development of Aquaponics in Colombia “ADACOL”, Colombia)",5,5,0.79,1.07,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9557901,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151524161,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

The variables of synthesis were the ethylene glycol:citric acid molar ratio and the pH. High reproducibility of the anatase and tenorite phase was obtained for all synthesis routes. The degree of purity of the powders was confirmed by XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis absorption and XPS spectra. SEM and TEM images revealed the powders are composed of micrometer grains that can have a spherical shape (only in the TiO2) or formed by a non-compacted nanocrystalline conglomerate. FTIR spectra only displayed vibrational modes associating TiO2 and CuO with nanoparticle behavior. UV-Vis absorption spectra revealed the values of maximum absorbance percentage of both systems are reached in the ultraviolet region, with percentages above 83% throughout the entire visible light spectrum for the CuO system, a relevant result for solar cell applications. Finally, XPS experiments allow the observation of the valence bands and the calculation of the energy bands of all oxides.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Fondo CTeI—Sistema General de Regalías, through project BPIN 2018000100092.

In this context, this work aimed to study the influence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) on dyes such as 7-(dimethylamino)-aza-coumarins, which have more than one basic site along their molecular structure. For this, three 3-styryl derivatives of 7-(dialkylamino)-aza-coumarin dyes (SAC1-3) were synthesized and characterized by NMR, ESI-HRMS and IR. The spectral behaviour of the SACs in the absence and presence of CB7 was studied. The results showed large shifts in the UV-vis spectrum in acid medium: a hypsochromic shift of ≈5400 cm-1 (SAC1-2) and ≈3500 cm-1 (SAC3) in the absence of CB7 and a bathochromic shift of ≈4500 cm-1 (SAC1-3) in the presence of CB7. The new absorptions at long and short wavelengths were assigned to the corresponding protomers by computational calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Additionally, the binding mode was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. Findings revealed that in the presence of CB7 the heterocyclic nitrogen was preferably protonated instead of the dialkylamino group. Namely, CB7 induces a change in the protonation preference at the basic sites of the SACs, as consequence of the molecular recognition by the macrocycle.",JJA is grateful for the CONICYT Doctoral Fellowship 21170793.

However, fruit structure is incompletely known within the family, thus the importance of this character is unclear. This study of fruit anatomy in the traditional tribe Canarieae examines the distribution of the tissues that correspond to the exo-, meso-, and endocarp. The detailed arrangement and measurement of the tissues are reported here for the first time in all eight genera in the tribe. The evidence suggests that in all cases except Pseudodacryodes, the endocarp has at least one layer of parenchyma cells within which a sclereid layer is evident and, in some cases, an inner epidermis. All Canarieae fruits exhibit secretory canals, and some taxa have epidermal glands with resin-like contents. Evidence of carpellar sutures was found for all Canarieae, and in Dacryodes, Haplolobus, Rosselia, and Santiria, an articulated plate is present that corresponds to an abortive locule. The anatomical and morphological characters presented here are useful in delimiting genera within Canarieae.","I thank Douglas C.

The urgent need for novel agents able to inhibit the function of both pumps, led us to evaluate this property in 137 extracts obtained from Argentinian plants.MethodsThe ability of the extracts to reverse efflux pump-mediated MDR was determined with an agar chemosensitization assay using fluconazole (FCZ) resistant Mdr1- and Cdr1-overexpressing clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains selectively expressing Mdr1 (AD/CaMDR1) or Cdr1 (AD/CaCDR1). The resistance-reversing activity of the most potent extracts was further confirmed using a Nile Red accumulation assay.ResultsFifteen plant extracts overcame the FCZ resistance of Candida albicans 1114, which overexpresses CaMdr1 and CaCdr1, and AD/CaMDR1, with those from Acalypha communis and Solanum atriplicifolium being the most effective showing 4- to 16-fold reversal of resistance at concentrations ≥ 25 µg/mL. Both extracts, and to a lesser extent that from Pterocaulon alopecuroides, also restored FCZ sensitivity in CgCdr1-overexpressing C. glabrata 109 and in AD/CaCDR1 with fold reversal values ranging from 4 to 32 and therefore demonstrating a dual effect against Mdr1 and Cdr1. Both, A. communis and S. atriplicifolium extracts at concentrations ≥ 12.5 and ≥ 25 µg/mL, respectively, increased the intracellular Nile Red accumulation in all yeast strains overexpressing efflux pumps.ConclusionsThe non-toxic and highly active extracts from A. communis and S. atripicifolium, provide promising sources of compounds for potentiating the antifungal effect of FCZ by blocking the efflux function of Mdr1 and Cdr1 transporters.",F.

Using H2 and diesel in a dual-fuel compression ignition engine appears as a more feasible approach. Here we report an experimental assessment of performance and emissions for a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled compression ignition engine operating with neat diesel and H2-diesel dual-fuel. Previous studies typically show the performance and emissions for a specific operation condition (i.e. a fixed engine speed and torque) or a limited operating range. Our experiments covered engine speeds of 3000 and 3600 rpm and torque levels of 3 and 7 Nm. An in-house designed and built alkaline cell generated the H2 used for the partial substitution of diesel. Compared with neat diesel, the results indicate that adding H2 decreased the air-fuel equivalence ratio and the Brake Specific Diesel Fuel Consumption Efficiency by around 14-29 % and 4-31 %. In contrast, adding H2 increased the Brake Fuel Conversion Efficiency by around 3-36 %. In addition, the Brake Thermal Efficiency increased in the presence of H2 in the range of 3-37 % for the lower engine speed and 27-43 % for the higher engine speed compared with neat diesel. The dual-fuel mode resulted in lower CO and CO2 emissions for the same power output. The emissions of hydrocarbons decreased with H2 addition, except for the lower engine speed and the higher torque. However, the dual-fuel operation resulted in higher NOx emissions than neat diesel, with 2-6 % and 19-48 % increments for the lower and higher engine speeds. H2 emerges as a versatile energy carrier with the potential to tackle current energy and emissions challenges; however, the dual-fuel strategy requires careful management of NOx emissions.",The authors want to acknowledge the support of the UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO through the project ING81- CII2019 “Estudio experimental de la sustitución parcial de combustible con HIDROXY (HHO) en motores térmicos de encendido por compresión y la influencia sobre sus prestaciones” and SPHERE ENERGY COMPANY - Colombia on the development of this research by providing access to their facility.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-04-16,2022,2022-04-16,2022-04,8,4,e09285,All OA; Gold,Article,"Estrada, L.; Moreno, E.; Gonzalez-Quiroga, A.; Bula, A.; Duarte-Forero, J.","Estrada, L.

However, few population-based seroprevalence surveys have been conducted to quantify attack rates and characterize drivers of transmission.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in ten cities in Colombia between September and December 2020. The study involved multi-stage cluster sampling at each city. Participants provided a serum sample and answered a demographic and risk factor questionnaire. Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained using the ""SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) Advia Centaur - Siemens"" chemiluminescence assay.
FINDINGS: A total of 17863 participants from 7320 households participated in the study. Seroprevalence varied substantially between cities, ranging from 26% (95%CI 23-29 %) in Medellín to 68% (95%CI 62-74 %) in Guapi. There were no differences in seroprevalence by sex, but seropositivity was higher in certain ethnic groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in seroprevalence within cities, driven to a large extent by a strong association between socioeconomic stratum and seropositivity.
INTERPRETATION: Colombia has been one of the Latin American countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study documented very high attack rates in several Colombian cities by the end of 2020 and identified key drivers of heterogeneities including ethnicity and socioeconomic stratum. Few studies of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted in Latin America, and therefore this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of the pandemic in the region.

Thus, we expect their association to vary as a function of other socially-embedded variables which have proven meaningful in the academic domain. The present study takes a critical theory approach to assess gender-related and contextual variability in the association between peer-assessed school performance and self-perceived cognitive competence. The sample consisted of 719 preadolescents (M age = 9.5 years, range = 9 to 12.5 years) living in lower- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada and Barranquilla, Columbia. Multigroup comparisons revealed that (a) peer-assessed school competence was more strongly associated with self-perceived cognitive competence for upper-middle-class than lower-middle-class participants from Barranquilla, whereas the opposite pattern was observed with Montreal participants, and (b) that the association between communal orientation and self-perceived cognitive competence was stronger for girls than for boys across the sample, especially in the upper-middle-class school in Montreal. These findings highlight the nuanced degree of gender differences in preadolescents' perceived academic competence and emphasize the role of SES in shaping self-perceptions.","We thank the schools, teachers, principals, parents, participants, and all those who helped with the data collection.",OK and WB were supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Fonds de recherche du Queìbec: Socieìteì et culture.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-11-03,2022,2022-11-03,,13,,919870,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kuzyk, Olivia; Gendron, Alice; Lopez, Luz Stella; Bukowski, William M.","Kuzyk, Olivia (Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada); Gendron, Alice (Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada); Lopez, Luz Stella (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bukowski, William M.

Individuals with ULEDs require assistive robots to fulfill all their activities of daily living (ADLs). However, a theory for the optimal design of assistive robots that reduces energy consumption while increasing the workspace is unavailable. Thus, this research presents an algorithm for the optimal link length selection of an assistive robot mounted on a wheelchair to minimize the torque demands of each joint while increasing the workspace coverage. For this purpose, this research developed a workspace to satisfy a list of 18 ADLs. Then, three torque indices from the literature were considered as performance measures to minimize; the three torque measures are the quadratic average torque (QAT), the weighted root square mean (WRMS), and the absolute sum of torques (AST). The proposed algorithm evaluates any of the three torque measures within the workspace, given the robot dimensions. This proposed algorithm acts as an objective function, which is optimized using a genetic algorithm for each torque measure. The results show that all tree torque measures are suitable criteria for assistance robot optimization. However, each torque measures yield different optimal results; in the case of the QAT optimization, it produces the least workspace with the minimum overall torques of all the joints. Contrarily, the WRMS and AST optimization yield similar results generating the maximum workspace coverage but with a greater overall torque of all joints. Thus, the selection between the three methods depends on the designer's criteria. Based on the results, the presented methodology is a reliable tool for the optimal dimensioning of assistive robots.",,"The contents of this research were supported by a grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR grant number 90DPGE0018-01-00).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 in real-world conditions in adults aged 60 years and older in Colombia.
Methods: In this retrospective, population-based, matched cohort study, we evaluated the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death in people aged 60 years and older. The full cohort consisted of every person who was eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in Colombia (the ESPERANZA cohort). The exposed cohort consisted of older adults who were fully vaccinated with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or CoronaVac, and who did not have a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The unexposed cohort were people aged 60 years and older who had not received any dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during the study period. Participant follow-up was done between March 11, 2021, and Oct 26, 2021. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 1- hazard ratio from cause-specific proportional hazards models in the presence of competing risks. We estimated the overall effectiveness of being fully vaccinated, as well as effectiveness for each vaccine, adjusting by main potential confounders. The effectiveness of each vaccine was also assessed by age groups (ages 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and ≥80 years).
Findings: 2 828 294 participants were assessed between March 11 and Oct 26, 2021. For all ages, the overall effectiveness across all assessed COVID-19 vaccines at preventing hospitalisation without subsequent death was 61·6% (95% CI 58·0-65·0, p<0·0001), 79·8% (78·5-81·1, p<0·0001) for preventing death after hospitalisation with COVID-19, and 72·8% (70·1-75·3, p<0·0001) for preventing death without previous COVID-19 hospitalisation. The effectiveness of all vaccines analysed at preventing death after hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 22·6% lower in adults who were aged 80 and older (68·4% [65·7-70·9], p<0·0001) compared with adults aged between 60 and 69 years (91·0% [89·0-92·6], p<0·0001).
Interpretation: All vaccines analysed in this study were effective at preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 in fully vaccinated older adults, which is a promising result for the national vaccination programme against COVID-19 in Colombia and in countries where these biologics have been applied. Efforts should be improved to increase coverage among older adults. In addition, given that we observed that the effectiveness of vaccines declined with increasing age, a booster dose is also justified, which should be prioritised for older adults.

This study's objective was to conduct a systematic review to determine theoretical and methodological underpinnings in behavioral economics that explain how stigmatization emerges within the relationship processes and social structures of individuals. Data from 1940 to 2019 were sourced from 12 relevant electronic databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. Following PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews, 26 studies out of 3459 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies applied experimental economics and were published between 2002 and 2018. Overall, the articles focus their research on the experiences of discrimination based on stereotypes and test their hypotheses through economic games. The data synthesis seems to reveal weak conceptual clarity, circular reasoning, and a hint of the problem of infinite regress. Thus, these issues open new and exciting avenues for future research to explore via an array of experimental applications.",,"7.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a voluntary sample of 469 university students (22.4 ± 0.19 years; 66% women). According to students' self-reports of physical activity and sedentary time, four behavioral profiles were created to investigate their association with subjective well-being and mental health using one-factor ANOVA that was adjusted to a multifactorial model.
RESULTS: The physically inactive and sedentary behavior profile presents the lowest levels of subjective well-being (p < 0.001), positive affective experiences (p < 0.001) and general mental health (p = 0.001). When adjusting for confounding variables, it was observed that the physically active and non-sedentary profile was associated with better general mental health (p < 0.01) in contrast to those who are physically active and sedentary.
CONCLUSIONS: Chilean university students with a physically inactive and sedentary profile during the pandemic presented worse well-being and mental health, with a sedentary lifestyle being one of the variables that most affects the mental health of these students. Therefore, measures should be implemented to encourage this population to maintain adequate levels of physical activity and reduce sedentary times.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Jennifer L.

Thus, to better understand the effects of oil exploitation activities on cytogenetic endpoint frequency, we conducted a biomonitoring study in the Hitnü indigenous populations from eastern Colombia by using the cytokinesis micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN-cyt). PAH exposure was also measured by determine urine 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) using HPLC. We also evaluated the relationship between DNA damage and 1-OHP levels in the oil exploitation area, as well as the modulating effects of community health factors, such as Chagas infection; nutritional status; and consumption of traditional hallucinogens, tobacco, and wine from traditional palms. The frequencies of the CBMN-cyt assay parameters were comparable between PZOI and Hitnü populations outside the zone of influence of mining activities (POZOI); however, a non-significant incremental trend among individuals from the PZOI for most of the DNA damage parameters was also observed. In agreement with these observations, levels of 1-OHP were also identified as a risk factor for increased MN frequency (PR = 1.20) compared to POZOI (PR = 0.7). Proximity to oil exploitation areas also constituted a risk factor for elevated frequencies of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and APOP-type cell death. Our results suggest that genetic instability and its potential effects among Hitnü individuals from PZOI and POZOI could be modulated by the combination of multiple factors, including the levels of 1-OHP in urine, malnutrition, and some traditional consumption practices.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the local authorities of Arauca department; Oscar Suárez, director of Universidad Nacional de Colombia Arauca; and all members of the settlements of Las Vegas, Monogarra, La Ilusión, Aspejená, Caño Jesús, and Bello Horizonte who decided to participate in this research.","This research was funded by MINCIENCIAS and MINSALUD Colombia (grant number 942/2019), Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad del Sinú (UNISINU).",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Hanns Moshammer, Guiying Li",Colombia; DNA Damage; Hallucinogens; Humans; Micronucleus Tests; Petroleum; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,2022-09-06,2022,2022-09-06,,19,18,11189,All OA; Gold,Article,"Galeano-Páez, Claudia; Ricardo-Caldera, Dina; Jiménez-Vidal, Luisa; Peñata-Taborda, Ana; Coneo-Pretelt, Andrés; Rumié-Mendoza, Margarita; Humanez Álvarez, Alicia; Salcedo-Arteaga, Shirley; Arteaga-Arroyo, Gean; Pastor-Sierra, Karina; Espitia-Pérez, Pedro; Avilés-Vergara, Paula A.; Tovar-Acero, Catalina; Soto-De León, Sara; Brango, Hugo; Bru-Cordero, Osnamir Elias; Jiménez-Narváez, Marvin; Stashenko, Elena E.; Gamboa-Delgado, Edna M.; Idrovo, Alvaro J.; Espitia-Pérez, Lyda","Galeano-Páez, Claudia (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Ricardo-Caldera, Dina (Grupo de Investigación Enfermedades Tropicales y Resistencia Bacteriana, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Jiménez-Vidal, Luisa (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Peñata-Taborda, Ana (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Coneo-Pretelt, Andrés (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Rumié-Mendoza, Margarita (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Humanez Álvarez, Alicia (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Salcedo-Arteaga, Shirley (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Arteaga-Arroyo, Gean (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Pastor-Sierra, Karina (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Espitia-Pérez, Pedro (Grupo de Investigación Biomédicas y Biología Molecular, Universidad del Sinú E.B.Z., Montería 230001, Colombia); Avilés-Vergara, Paula A.

Studies have linked inflammation to breast cancer development, but data is limited in premenopausal women, especially in Latin America.MethodsWe investigated the associations between serum biomarkers of chronic inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), leptin, adiponectin) and risk of premenopausal breast cancer among 453 cases and 453 matched, population-based controls from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression models. Analyses were stratified by size and hormonal receptor status of the tumors.ResultsIL-6 (ORper standard deviation (SD) = 1.33 (1.11–1.60)) and TNF-α (ORper SD = 1.32 (1.11–1.58)) were positively associated with breast cancer risk in fully adjusted models. Evidence of heterogeneity by estrogen receptor (ER) status was observed for IL-8 (P-homogeneity = 0.05), with a positive association in ER-negative tumors only. IL-8 (P-homogeneity = 0.06) and TNF-α (P-homogeneity = 0.003) were positively associated with risk in the largest tumors, while for leptin (P-homogeneity = 0.003) a positive association was observed for the smallest tumors only.ConclusionsThe results of this study support the implication of chronic inflammation in breast cancer risk in young women in Latin America. Largest studies of prospective design are needed to confirm these findings in premenopausal women.","The authors wish to acknowledge the substantial support provided by the research nurses and health workers as well as Tracy Lignini, Dacia Cristin, Cecile Le Duc, Jordi de Battle, Ana Cristina Ocampo, and Dr Talita Duarte-Salles for the logistics and data basis development.

There is no disease control program and no official therapeutic protocol. This situation contributes to an unknown disease prevalence and unmet needs of people disabled by this disease who seek access to treatment. This review provides an update on the subject with an emphasis on therapeutic advances in humans. All relevant studies that addressed epidemiology, diagnosis, or therapeutics of lobomycosis were considered. Seventy-one articles published between 1931 and 2021 were included for a narrative literature review on the epidemiology and quest for a cure. An effective therapy for lobomycosis has been found following decades of research led by the State Dermatology Program of Acre in the Amazon rainforest, where the largest number of cases occur. This discovery opened new avenues for future studies. The main recommendations here, addressed to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, are for lobomycosis to become a reportable disease to ensure that disease prevalence is measured, and that it be prioritized such that affected individuals may access treatment free-of-charge.",,This work was supported by Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [CNPq grant 307432/2019-0 to GZL].,Journal of Fungi,,"Alessandro C.

It is the first cause of inability worldwide, which entails high economic costs for the public system. Current evidence suggests that physical activity is an effective tool for the prevention and treatment of depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the cases of depressive symptoms and depression presented by the adult Spanish population and the days per week of physical activity and strength training that they perform.
DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional study with data from the European Health Survey of Spain 2020 (EESE 2020), consisting of 10,024 males and 11,126 females, between 18 and 84 years, which conformed the sample of 21,150 participants.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms and depression were related to days of PA per week, PA frequency per week and strength training days per week (p < 0.001), depressive symptoms and depression were found to have higher prevalence in the inactive groups than in the active groups (p < 0.05); this phenomenon was found in both sexes and age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms and depression were associated with physical activity in the general population, by sex and by age group too. The prevalence of both were higher in the inactive population than in the active population of all ages and sexes.

The Effect of Delivery Mode on Team-Based Learning of Clinical Reasoning in a Family Medicine Clerkship,"In health professions education, team-based learning (TBL) has been used to help learners develop clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions to move curriculum delivery from largely in-person to online. With the anticipated return to in-person instruction and arguments made in favor of online instruction in certain circumstances, evidence is needed to support decision making in curriculum planning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of delivery mode (in-person vs. online) on student learning of clinical reasoning and clinical decision-making (CR/CDM) in the family medicine clerkship. Data from three cohorts of third-year medical students were included in the study: 2018/2019 cohort, in-person; 2019/2020 cohort, half of the cohort in-person, half of the cohort online; 2020/2021 cohort, online. Students' performance data-individual readiness assurance test (IRAT) and group readiness assurance test (GRAT) scores-were used. The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis was performed. As expected, students scored higher in GRAT than IRAT across the three cohorts. No significant IRAT-GRAT differences were observed between in-person and online delivery of TBL sessions. Student learning of CR/CDM in TBL is comparable between the two modes of delivery in the family medicine clerkship. Future research in other clerkships, years of medical education, and professional programs is needed to inform decision making regarding the TBL delivery mode.",,This research was funded by the Northern Alberta Academic Family Physician Fund.,Medical Sciences,,Antoni Torres,"COVID-19; Clinical Reasoning; Educational Measurement; Family Practice; Humans; Pandemics; Problem-Based Learning; Students, Medical",2022-08-08,2022,2022-08-08,,10,3,41,All OA; Gold,Article,"Babenko, Oksana; Ding, Mao; Lee, Ann S","Babenko, Oksana (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.); Ding, Mao (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.); Lee, Ann S (Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.)","Babenko, Oksana (University of Alberta)","Babenko, Oksana (University of Alberta); Ding, Mao (University of Alberta); Lee, Ann S (University of Alberta)",6,6,2.69,4.2,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3271/10/3/41/pdf?version=1660028161,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150086380,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

It can lead to serious issues such as rickets, periodontitis, osteoporosis, weakness, muscle ache, and depression. This study was conducted to determine the vitamin D status of patients with CKD in Pakistan and evaluate the correlation between serum vitamin D and renal function progression. Methodology A retrospective study enrolled patients who visited Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2015 to January 2021 with a primary diagnosis of CKD. Anthropometric, laboratory, and demographic data were collected from the hospital management information system (HMIS). Results A total of 513 patients with CKD were included in the study. More than 50% of the patients were from stage 3 to stage 5 of CKD while the rest were from stage 1 and stage 2. Significant differences are in relation to calcium, phosphate, and albumin across categories of severity of CKD. Calcium is lowest in stage 5 while phosphate is highest in stage 5. Vitamin D deficiency was found in all participants, but serum vitamin D concentration was lowest in stage 5, i.e., 8.14+6.00. The changing of vitamin D level was associated with the severity of CKD staging (p-value=0.003). Conclusion The current study has shown that vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency, and hyperphosphatemia are more common in patients with CKD, but their severity is more common in advanced stages of CKD.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2022-01-13,2022,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,14,1,e21221,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kantas, Theodosios; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Babor, Sabir; Tamdin, Tenzin; Al-Rihani, Hady; Thalla, Anusha; Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel; Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed; Tousif, Sohaib; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño; Tanding, Tenzing","Kantas, Theodosios (); Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño (); Babor, Sabir (); Tamdin, Tenzin (); Al-Rihani, Hady (); Thalla, Anusha (); Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel (); Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed (); Tousif, Sohaib (); Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño (); Tanding, Tenzing ()","Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed ()","Kantas, Theodosios (); Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño (); Babor, Sabir (); Tamdin, Tenzin (); Al-Rihani, Hady (); Thalla, Anusha (); Abdelmawla, Ahmed Adel (); Muthanna, Fares Mohammed Saeed (); Tousif, Sohaib (); Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño (); Tanding, Tenzing ()",3,2,0.65,2.08,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/82236/20220317-1132-1ixzlhl.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144676958,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The research objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the Serion IgM ELISA EST125M against the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT = imperfect reference test); to assess its ability to diagnose acute leptospirosis infections and to detect previous exposure to leptospires in an endemic setting. In addition, to estimate the overall Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Wiwa indigenous population in North-East Colombia. We analysed serum samples from confirmed leptospirosis patients from the Netherlands (N = 14), blood donor sera from Switzerland (N = 20), and sera from a cross-sectional study in Colombia (N = 321). All leptospirosis ELISA-positive, and a random of negative samples from Colombia were tested by the MAT for confirmation. The ELISA performed with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 77% - 100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 83% - 100%) based on MAT confirmed Leptospira spp. positive and negative samples. In the cross-sectional study in Colombia, the ELISA performed with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 2-100%) and a specificity of 21% (95% CI 15-28%). Assuming a 5% Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in this population, the positive predictive value was 6% and the negative predictive value 100%. The Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Wiwas tested by the ELISA was 39%; however, by MAT only 0.3%. The ELISA is suitable to diagnose leptospirosis in acutely ill patients in Europe several days after onset of disease. For cross-sectional studies it is not recommended due to its low specificity. Despite the evidence of a high leptospirosis prevalence in other study areas and populations in Colombia, the Wiwa do not seem to be highly exposed to Leptospira spp.. Nevertheless, leptospirosis should be considered and tested in patients presenting with febrile illness.","We would like to thank Dr. Klaus Reither for his constant support, Dr. Tracy Glass for statistical advice (both Swiss TPH) and Dr. Alba Luz-Luque Lommel for her support in Colombia.

We used the significant improvement in the accuracy of protein structure prediction recently implemented in AlphaFold that incorporates novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints of protein structures. The wild-type (WT) sequence and the mutated sequence, missing the Phe233, were reconstructed. The predicted local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) for the PURAwt and the PURA-Phe233del showed that the occurrence of the Phe233del affects between 220-320 amino acids. The distortion in the PURA structural conformation in the ~5 Å surrounding area after the p.Phe233del produces a conspicuous disruption of the repeat III, where the DNA and RNA helix unwinding capability occurs. PURA Protein-DNA docking corroborated these results in an in silico analysis that showed a loss of the contact of the PURA-Phe233del III repeat domain model with the DNA. Together, (i) the energetic and stereochemical, (ii) the hydropathic indexes and polarity surfaces, and (iii) the hybrid Quantum Mechanics-Molecular Mechanics (QM-MM) analyses of the PURA molecular models demarcate, at the atomic resolution, the specific surrounding region affected by these mutations and pave the way for future cell-based functional analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo mutation underpinning a PURA syndrome in a Latin American patient and highlights the importance of predicting the molecular effects in protein structure using artificial intelligence algorithms and molecular and atomic resolution stereochemical analyses.",Our most profound acknowledgment to the patient and her parents.,Keralty (https://www.keralty.com/ (accessed on 22 June 2022)) funded this research.,Brain Sciences,,"Andrew Chih Wei Huang, Seong Soo A.

The group of participants were 302 students who are studying in different universities of the city and took their virtual or remote classes with a flipped classroom strategy. Students identified their learning styles, experiences and characteristics of the virtual or remote classes and their class preferences. In addition, they mentioned resources and learning spaces used by the teachers that promote collaboration and knowledge development and technology used by the university to develop classes. Given the results of the survey, it was determined that flipped classroom strategy is a useful method for the students because it allowed them to be more self-taught (independent learning) during pandemic. It was possible to identify their learning styles and to create spaces of greater participation with the teachers as guides. Flipped classrooms allow learning by doing, developing and participating and no memorizing (traditional method) supported by emerging technologies applied in university teaching. These technologies must be combined with different strategies that allow the development of skills, teamwork and comprehension of the topics.",,,Procedia Computer Science,,,,2022-08-12,2022,2022-08-12,2022,203,,575-582,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barrios, Tatiana Arrieta; Rojas, Shirley Llinás; Movilla, José Solórzano; Ibáñez, Samir Francisco Umaña; Taboada, Aida Huyke","Barrios, Tatiana Arrieta (Universidad de la Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Rojas, Shirley Llinás (Universidad de la Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Movilla, José Solórzano (Corporatión Universitaria Americana, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Ibáñez, Samir Francisco Umaña (Universidad de la Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Taboada, Aida Huyke (Universidad de la Costa CUC, Barranquilla, Colombia.)",,"Barrios, Tatiana Arrieta (University of the Coast); Rojas, Shirley Llinás (University of the Coast); Movilla, José Solórzano (Corporatión Universitaria Americana, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Ibáñez, Samir Francisco Umaña (University of the Coast); Taboada, Aida Huyke (University of the Coast)",8,7,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.07.082,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150191726,46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education

The factors affecting patients with early death remain poorly defined. We aimed to study the demographic and clinicopathologic pattern and to develop and validate a prediction model for PHEO/PGL patients with early death.
Methods: Data of 800 participants were collected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database as a construction cohort, while data of 340 participants were selected as a validation cohort. Risk factors considered included the year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, gender, marital status, race, insurance status, tumor type, primary location, laterality, the presence of distant metastasis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine the risk factors. R software was used to generate the nomogram. Calibration ability, discrimination ability, and decision curve analysis were analyzed in both construction and validation cohorts.
Results: PHEO and PGL patients accounted for 54.3% (N=434) and 45.7% (N=366), respectively. More than half of tumors (N=401, 50.1%) occurred in the adrenal gland, while 16.9% (N=135) were in aortic/carotid bodies. For the entire cohort, the median overall survival (OS) was 116.0 (95% CI: 101.5-130.5) months. The multivariate analysis revealed that older age (versus age younger than 31; age between 31 and 60: OR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.03-4.03, P=0.042; age older than 60: OR=5.46, 95% CI: 2.68-11.12, P<0.001), female gender (versus male gender; OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87, P=0.007), tumor located in aortic/carotid bodies (versus tumor located in adrenal gland; OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.87, P=0.015) and the presence of distant metastasis (versus without distant metastasis; OR=4.80, 95% CI: 3.18-7.23, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of early death. The predictive nomogram included variables: age at diagnosis, gender, primary tumor location, and distant metastasis. The model had satisfactory discrimination and calibration performance: Harrell's C statistics of the prediction model were 0.733 in the construction cohort and 0.716 in the validation cohort. The calibration analysis showed acceptable coherence between predicted probabilities and observed probabilities.
Conclusions: We developed and validated a predictive nomogram utilizing data from the SEER database with satisfactory discrimination and calibration capability which can be used for early death prediction for PHEO/PGL patients.",,The present study was sponsored by Natural Science Foundation of China (82011530050).,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2022-02-25,2022,2022-02-25,,12,,770958,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Huiyang; Abbas, Kirellos Said; Abdelazeem, Basel; Xu, Yao; Lin, Yile; Wu, Haixiao; Chekhonin, Vladimir P.; Peltzer, Karl; Zhang, Chao","Li, Huiyang (Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Female Reproductive Health and Eugenics, Tianjin, China; The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China); Abbas, Kirellos Said (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt); Abdelazeem, Basel (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; McLaren Health Care, Flint/Michigan State University, Michigan City, MI, United States); Xu, Yao (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China); Lin, Yile (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China); Wu, Haixiao (The Sino-Russian Joint Research Center for Bone Metastasis in Malignant Tumor, Tianjin, China; Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China); Chekhonin, Vladimir P.

METHODS: We compare national to diaspora IMRs over the period 1980-2018. National IMRs are death-to-birth ratios reported by the official vital statistics, whereas diaspora IMRs are calculated by using a semiparametric regression model on the summary birth histories collected in the population censuses. We analyse the diaspora IMRs according to whether their arrival corresponds to precrisis or crisis-driven migration.
RESULTS: During crises, diaspora IMRs show better health outcomes than those of non-migrants. The Colombian diaspora had an average annual IMR of -1.8 (95% CI -3.3 to 0.28) per year and the Venezuelan diaspora had -4.5 (95% CI -5.8 to -3.3). However, the protective role of migration is neither guaranteed nor consistent, as a crisis in the country of destination exposes immigrants to worse health outcomes than the non-migrant population.
CONCLUSION: Migration is a survival strategy that allows people to reduce the negative effects they face during a crisis in their country of origin. The distinction between crisis-driven and precrisis migration provides a framework for assessing the cross-border effects on health outcomes due to diaspora composition, particularly when populations face adverse conditions.",,"JA received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Excellent Science, Marie Skłodowska–Curie, Individual fellowship program 2019 (Grant agreement No: 892134).

Thus, the meta-analysis was conducted to report and review the association between PD-L1 and survival in penile cancer patients.
Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were all searched, screened, and reviewed by June 1, 2022. Hazard ratio (HR) was used to evaluate the relationship between PD-L1 and survival outcome, and odds ratio (OR) was for tumor features.
Results: Nine retrospective studies (1,003 patients) were incorporated. The prevalence of PD-L1 in patients with penile cancer was 51.4% (95% CI = 42.1%-60.8%, I 2 = 88.5%). Higher PD-L1 on tumor cells was related to shorter cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients (HR = 1.578, 95% CI = 1.227-2.029, I 2 = 23.3%), but had no associations with overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.123, 95% CI = 0.511-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis indicated that higher PD-L1 was related to shorter CSS in Caucasus (HR = 1.827, 95% CI = 1.355-2.465, I 2 = 0.0%) only. Furthermore, PD-L1 had associations with tumor stage (pT1 vs. pT2-4, OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.346-0.667, P = 0.001) and tumor grade (Well and moderate vs. Poor, OR = 0.377, 95% CI = 0.264-0.538, P < 0.001). PD-L1 positivity was also related to lymph node (LN) status (pN0/NX vs. pN1-3, OR = 0.541, 95% CI = 0.385-0.759, P = 0.001) and HPV status (Positive vs. Negative, OR = 0.510, 95% CI = 0.322-0.810, P = 0.003). A trend toward statistical significance between PD-L1 and histological types was also observed (Usual SCC vs. Others, OR = 1.754, 95% CI = 0.984-3.124, P = 0.070).
Conclusions: PD-L1 over-expression was related to worse survival outcomes and several clinicopathological features of penile cancer. PD-L1 expression can be applied to select appropriate treatment strategies for penile malignancies.

Experiencia de un centro de la ciudad de Medellín, Colombia","OBJETIVO: El objetivo de este estudio fue caracterizar la clasificación hemodinámica de la hipertensión pulmonar en una serie de pacientes llevados a cateterismo cardíaco derecho.
MÉTODOS: Se realizó un estudio retrospectivo y se revisaron los registros de los cateterismos cardíacos derechos practicados en personas mayores de 18 años entre enero de 2017 y diciembre del 2018. Se excluyó a aquéllos con datos incompletos o no concluyentes y se definieron los perfiles hemodinámicos de acuerdo con el resultado de la presión en cuña y la resistencia vascular pulmonar.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyó a 92 sujetos de los cuales se descartó hipertensión pulmonar en 4. El 26.1% se clasificó como precapilar, 31.8% como poscapilar y 42% como combinada. No hubo diferencias entre los tres grupos en edad y sexo; las presiones pulmonares fueron más elevadas en el grupo de hipertensión pulmonar precapilar. Se encontró presión en cuña elevada en el 73.8% de los pacientes y el cateterismo derecho reclasificó al 35% de los pacientes en un grupo hemodinámico diferente al esperado. En la mayor parte de estos casos se sospechaba HP precapilar por el diagnóstico anterior al procedimiento, pero los perfiles hemodinámicos encontrados correspondieron a hipertensión poscapilar o combinada.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study, we analyze the records of all right heart catheterizations performed between January 2017 and December 2018, all patient older than 18 years were included and those with incomplete or inconclusive data were excluded. We identify three hemodynamic profiles according to the result of right heart catheterization.
RESULTS: 92 subjects were included and pulmonary hypertension was ruled out in 4 of them; 26.1% were classified as precapillary, 31.8% postcapillary and 42% as combined pulmonary hypertesion. There were no differences between the 3 groups in age or sex, pulmonary pressures were higher in the precapillary pulmonary hypertension group, right catheterization reclassified 35% of the patients in a hemodynamic group in a different from that expected. Precapillary PH was suspected in most of these cases, but the hemodynamic profiles found in cardiac catheterization corresponded to post-capillary or combined pulmonay hypertension.

Falls have become a social and global public health concern due to the current aging population in Africa and across the globe. However, their prevalence and risk factors have received little attention in Africa.
Purpose: Thus, this study aimed to provide a baseline survey to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors for falls among older adults attending a primary care facility in Cape Coast, Ghana.
Results: Participants (n = 244) were patients aged 60 years and older who visited the University of Cape Coast Hospital. The prevalence of falls identified in this hospital-based study was 40.2%. The following independent variables were found to be statistically significant predictors of risk of falls among the participants when compared with their respective reference categories; age 80 years and above [OR = 3.707, 95% CI = 1.738 - 7.907, p = 0.001], participants who had a history of falls [OR = 2.234, 95% CI = 1.326 - 3.765, p = 0.003], participants with three or more co-morbidities [OR = 16.456, 95% CI = 2.099 - 129.020, p = 0.008] and obesity [OR = 2.211, 95% CI = 1.151 - 4.250, p = 0.017].

However, uncertainty in the staff demand challenges the accomplishment of that objective. This research studies the personnel assignment problem considering uncertain demand and multiskilled workforce configured through a 2-chaining strategy. We develop a two-stage stochastic optimization (TSSO) approach to calculate the multiskilling requirements that minimize the training costs and the expected costs of staff surplus/shortage. Later, we evaluate and compare the performance of the TSSO approach solutions with the solutions of two alternative optimization approaches under uncertainty - robust optimization (RO) and closed-form equation (CF). These two alternative approaches were published in Henao et al. [1] and Henao et al. [2], respectively. In addition, we compare the performance of the TSSO approach solutions with the solution of the deterministic (DT) approach and the solutions of myopic multiskilling approaches. To make performance comparisons between the different approaches, we used both real and simulated data derived from a retail store operating in Chile. The results show that, for different demand variability levels, TSSO, RO, and CF always belong to the set of approaches with the lowest average total cost. That is, in this group, there are no statistical differences from one approach to another, so these approaches are the most cost-effective. We also provide insights to retail decision-makers for addressing two key aspects. First, the methodology allows to address two fundamental multiskilling issues: how much multiskilling to add and how it should be added. Second, it is provided understanding on how to select the most suitable approach according to the balance between the conservatism and the reliability associated with the solutions delivered by each approach.

AIM: To determine the factors associated with a low level of physical activity in adults during confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adults from Chile, Colombia, México and Perú were invited through social networks to answer an online survey. Questions about sociodemographic, health status and lifestyle variables were included. The level of physical activity and sedentary behavior were determined through the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
RESULTS: The survey was answered by 3,362 adults aged between 18 and 60 years. Respondents more likely to be inactive were women, those with less than eight years of education, those with overweight or obesity, those who smoked at least one cigarette a day, consumed alcohol four or more times a week, slept less than six hours per day and spent more than 6 hours per day in sedentary behaviors.

The presence of this pathology in children leads to the appearance of different alterations (physical, psychological, social, etc.). Due to their high influence, the aim of this study is to understand these psychological and sociocultural determinants and their impact on the quality of life of asthmatic children. In order to determine the influence of these determinants on quality of life, a narrative review of 48 articles collected in different databases was carried out. Emotions are the most powerful precursor to producing an asthmatic attack. Anxiety and depression are the pathologies that appear frequently associated with childhood asthma, together with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. In addition, the personality of these children seems to be characterized by shyness and impulsivity, although exceptionally it has been associated with psychopathic behaviors, aggressiveness, and cases of psychosis. School performance is impaired and bullying occurs more frequently. Likewise, dysfunctional family relationships and lower socioeconomic status have a negative impact on the severity and management of asthma. In short, the quality of life of asthmatic children is lower due to the presence of the aforementioned psychological and sociocultural determinants.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

This article aims to compare the quality of three automatic online geocoding tools against a reference method. A subsample of 300 handwritten addresses from hospital records was geocoded using Bing, Google Earth, and Google Maps. Match rates were higher (> 80%) for Google Maps and Google Earth compared with Bing. However, the accuracy of the addresses was better for Bing with a larger proportion (> 70%) of addresses with positional errors below 20m. Generally, performance did not vary for each method for different socioeconomic status.

This paper was devoted to the optimization of the thumb prosthesis's mechanism by taking into consideration the manufacturing cost model based on machining cost theory which took into detail the shape of the workpieces and the strength reliability of all the parts composing the entire mechanism. Every optimization problem displays a particular set of an independent vector of optimal parameters, showing the impact of each objective function on the configuration of the prosthetic device. The multiobjective optimization showed that the mechanical reliability and the production cost included in any combination of the simultaneous optimization enabled the achievement of the same optimum variables design, though with some exceptions. With the inclusion of the labor charges, the depreciation rate of the equipment, and production assets in the mathematical's manufacturing cost model, the optimal manufacturing cost generated from the numerical simulation was 501.0021 USD. Therefore, the global manufacturing cost and the mechanical strength reliability of the whole prosthesis mechanism have a real impact on the customization of the structure, due to the stochastic nature of the trajectory of the cutting tools during the manufacturing processes.",,,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,,Francesca Cordella,,2022-09-05,2022,2022-09-05,2022-09-05,2022,,9647956,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tsamo, Nestor; Toko, Denis Tcheukam; Talla, Pierre Kisito","Tsamo, Nestor (Laboratory of Mechanics and Modelling of Physical Systems (L2MPS), Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.

Manifest simultaneously as Poland-Möbius (Poland-Moebius) syndrome, debate continues as to whether this is a distinct nosological entity or represents phenotypic variation as part of a spectrum of disorders of rhomboencephalic development. Etiological hypotheses implicate both genetic and environmental factors. The PLXND1 gene codes for a protein expressed in the fetal central nervous system and vascular endothelium and is thus involved in embryonic neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is located at chromosome region 3q21-q22, a locus of interest for Möbius syndrome.Case presentationWe present the first report of a patient with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a mutation in the PLXND1 gene. A child with Poland-Möbius syndrome and a maternally inherited missense variant (NM_015103.2:ex14:c.2890G > Ap.V964M) in the PLXND1 gene is described. In order to contextualize these findings, the literature was examined to identify other confirmed cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome for which genetic data were available. Fourteen additional cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome with genetic studies are described in the literature. None implicated the PLXND1 gene which has previously been implicated in isolated Möbius syndrome.ConclusionsThis report provides further evidence in support of a role for PLXND1 mutations in Möbius syndrome and reasserts the nosological link between Möbius and Poland’s syndromes.Level of evidenceLevel V, Descriptive Study.","The authors would like to thank Ms Anushka Hardas, librarian at Sidra Medicine for help with the literature search and acquisition of the source papers, Mr Carl Sulit, photographer at Sidra Medicine for the clinical images and Ms Julie Melville and Ms Rebecca Watson-Brown for therapeutic evaluation of the patient from the point of view of facial palsy (JM) and Poland’s syndrome (RW-B).

In the present research, we aimed to determine the internal consistency and validity of the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale for in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency workers. Methods: A quantitative, prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study including 269 emergency service professionals. Results: The scale was composed of 21 items, with a Cronbach’s α value of 0.908. The hospital workers (38.4 ± 10.8 vs. 35.1 ± 9.9, p = 0.014) and women (39.3 ± 11.4 vs. 34.2 ± 8.6, p < 0.001) had higher levels of stress. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the scale were adequate. Conclusion: In the present study, including in-hospital and out-of-hospital emergency workers, the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale presented appropriate usefulness, internal consistency, and validity, with optimal predictive ability. Higher levels of anxiety, female gender, being less optimistic, and working in hospital emergency departments were related to increased stress levels. Further studies are warranted to validate our results and potentially extend the Stress Factors and Manifestations Scale to other contexts.",We thank the health professionals who participated in this research study.,"This research study did not receive specific subsidies from the public, commercial, or non-profit sectors.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

Three well-studied ciliates include Oxytricha trifallax, Tetrahymena thermophila, and Paramecium tetraurelia, but only the Oxytricha lineage has a massively scrambled genome, whose assembly during development requires hundreds of thousands of precisely programmed DNA joining events, representing the most complex genome dynamics of any known organism. Here we study the emergence of such complex genomes by examining the origin and evolution of discontinuous and scrambled genes in the Oxytricha lineage. This study compares six genomes from three species, the germline and somatic genomes for Euplotes woodruffi, Tetmemena sp., and the model ciliate O. trifallax. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the germline and somatic genomes of E. woodruffi, which provides an outgroup, and the germline genome of Tetmemena sp. We find that the germline genome of Tetmemena is as massively scrambled and interrupted as Oxytricha's: 13.6% of its gene loci require programmed translocations and/or inversions, with some genes requiring hundreds of precise gene editing events during development. This study revealed that the earlier diverged spirotrich, E. woodruffi, also has a scrambled genome, but only roughly half as many loci (7.3%) are scrambled. Furthermore, its scrambled genes are less complex, together supporting the position of Euplotes as a possible evolutionary intermediate in this lineage, in the process of accumulating complex evolutionary genome rearrangements, all of which require extensive repair to assemble functional coding regions. Comparative analysis also reveals that scrambled loci are often associated with local duplications, supporting a gradual model for the origin of complex, scrambled genomes via many small events of DNA duplication and decay.","We thank Toshinobu Suzaki (Kobe University) for the gift of E. woodruffi (strain Iz01 from Shizuoka Prefecture) and Chlorogonium capillatum.

The aerial parts of the plant are used in traditional medicine to treat skin diseases such as irritations, infections, and wounds. In this study, the essential oil of this plant was characterized, and its antimicrobial activity was evaluated. This species has large glands in its leaves; therefore, for quality control purposes, an anatomical study of the leaves was performed. The essential oil was isolated from the aerial parts of the plant through hydro-distillation and analyzed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system. Its anti-yeast activity was evaluated against three Candida species and ten bacterial strains using the disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined using broth microdilution. Anatomical study was performed on the middle part of the leaf. A yield of 0.5% of the essential oil was obtained from the herb, and Eighteen compounds in the essential oil were identified, within them trans pinocamphone (29.5%), limonene (24.7%), pinocarvone (21.8%), and cis pinocamphone (8.0%) were the main components. The inhibition zones were between 10 mm and 20 mm, and the MIC and MFC against the three Candida species ranged from 60 to 500 μg/ml. The leaf anatomy showed anisocytic stomata, simple and glandular trichomes of different types, and large and elliptical-shaped lysigenous glands, which can be used for taxonomic identification.

In contrast to patient-specific sources of information, mass media may potentially reach healthy people, thus preventing them from becoming part of the diabetes statistics. Articles published within a selected corpus from the years 2013 to 2018 and related to awareness regarding diabetes were sampled, and their readability was scored using Flesch Kinkaid Reading Ease (FKRE). Features of three articles ranked as the best and worst for readability were qualitatively analyzed. The average readability for the materials is low at 49.6 FKRE, which may impede the uptake of information contained in the articles. Feature analysis of articles with the best and worst readability indicates that medical practitioners may not be the best spokesperson to reach the public. It also indicates that simple sentence structures could help improve readability. There is still much room for improvement in attaining good public health literacy through mass media communication.

Material and Methods: Cross-sectional analytical study; a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out at a national level. The Google Forms tool was used; a document was submitted using a national database. The instrument consisted of four sections: socio-demographic data, biopsychosocial symptoms, insomnia severity index (ISI), and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the zero-inflated negative binomial model.
Results: Of a total of 2,532 surveyed people, 29% were male; 43% was younger than 30 years old. The 50% of the sample suffers from sleepiness and 71% shows some type of insomnia. The marginal effects of the zero-inflated negative binomial model show that women, people aged 51 or older, who are neither studying a healthcare degree nor working in the healthcare sector, that are exposed to 4 or more hours per day to the news and that live in areas near or very near the riots, have significantly higher ISI (marginal effect 1.356, SE 0.381, p-value 0.000) and ESS scores (marginal effect 0.693, SE 0.320, p-value 0.030). To live/work in rioting areas has the greater marginal effect compared to other determinants. Finally, neither employment status nor educational level are associated with significant effects in the aforementioned scales.
Conclusion: The riots occurred during the social outbreak of October 2019 in Chile had an effect on insomnia and daytime sleepiness.

Recent studies have identified novel metabolites produced by Penicillium sclerotiorum that have antibacterial, antifouling and pharmaceutical activities. Here, we report the isolation of a P. sclerotiorum (LM 5679) from Amazonian soil and carry out a culture-based study to determine whether it can produce any novel secondary metabolite(s) that are not thus-far reported for this genus. Using a submerged culture system, secondary metabolites were recovered by solvent extract followed by thin-layer chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy. One novel secondary metabolite was isolated from P. sclerotiorum (LM 5679); the phenolic compound 5-pentadecyl resorcinol widely known as an antifungal, that is produced by diverse plant species. This metabolite was not reported previously in any Penicillium species and was only found once before in fungi (that time, in a Fusarium). Here, we discuss the known activities of 5-pentadecyl resorcinol in the context of its mode-of-action as a hydrophobic (chaotropicity-mediated) stressor.","The authors would like to recognize funding received from Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM - Universal Amazonas - EDITAL N.002/2018) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES - Pró-Amazônia 2012, N.47).

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Mixed method, explanatory study, with an initial quantitative and then qualitative sequence. The quantitative phase was carried out using validated instruments: characterization sheet of the person with chronic illness-family caregiver dyad; the Nkongho Caregiving Ability Inventory (CAI), and the Zarit burden scale. The qualitative phase was conducted with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach; the information was collected through in-depth interviews to understand the needs of the caregivers.
RESULTS.: The caregivers were mostly women, mainly mothers and daughters, home-occupied and self-employed, with basic primary education, low socioeconomic level and low caregiving skill level; a significant number of caregivers perceived some degree of overload. The themes identified in the analysis of the interviews were: feeling fear before the disease; the experience of caregiver fatigue; losing one's job: another cost of the disease; fear of delegating care; love: a support for the caregiver; needing support to care.

This is a cross-sectional investigation including 60 oncological patients with oral candidiasis, selected by convenience sampling, from whom samples were subjected to culture in Sabouraud chloramphenicol agar, CHROMagar® Candida and Sabouraud dextrose agar were taken. The antifungal susceptibility profile was then identified and established. Descriptive statistics, Chi square test, and bivariate analysis were conducted using the Statgraphics Centurion XVII software with odds ratio (OR) for the probability of occurrence. A total of 107 Candida strains were identified belonging to 15 species, C. albicans with 23%, C. glabrata with 18%, C. tropicalis 13%, C. krusei 10%, C intermedia, and C. lipolytica with 1.5%. Species other than C. albicans were identified in 77% of the cases. A relationship between reproductive system cancer and C. guilliermondii was identified (p = 0.0001, <0.05) OR: 17.0. Between C. colliculosa and respiratory cancer (p = 0.0003, <0.05) OR 19.5. With regard to antifungal susceptibility, 99% of the identified Candida species were susceptible to the following antifungals: fluconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin. Only one strain of C. krusei was resistant. It is concluded that there was a diversity of Candida species, either single or mixed in cancer patients, which could determine that only one species is not responsible for fungal infection in the oral cavity.","Agradecimientos A la Dra.

The present study aimed to determine the epidemiological pattern of trauma patients in a regional trauma center in the Midwest of Iran from 2014 to 2020.MethodsThis study was a retrospective study that was performed on 29,804 trauma patients admitted to Be′sat Hospital in Hamadan from January 2014 to December 2020. Data was collected using Health Information Management (HIM) Center of the Be′sat Hospital. For investigating the relationship of the characteristics of trauma patients and the mechanisms of trauma, Multiple Multinomial Logistic Regression (MMNLR) model was used. All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.ResultsThe mean age of all patients was 35.4 (SD = 21.9) years. Most of them were men (71.7%). The most common mechanism of trauma was road traffic accidents (RTAs) (39.6%) followed by falls (30.2%), other (19.7%), violence (6.2%), and burn (4.4%). 1.5% of the trauma patients expired. The results of multiple multinomial logistic regression indicated that significant affected factor on odds referring because of RTAs compared to other mechanism were: season and hospital length of stay (LOS); in falls and violence: age, sex, season, and LOS; and in burn: age, sex, season, evening time, and LOS (p < 0.05).ConclusionBased on the investigation of 29,804 trauma patients, in Iran as a developing country, RTAs and falls were two common mechanisms of trauma. It seems that as a short-term plan, it is possible to focus on road safety, to improve the quality of vehicles, to hold training courses for drivers. Also, as a long-term goal, considering that the elderly population in Iran is increasing, it is necessary to pay attention to fall reduction programs.",We appreciate the Health Information Management (HIM) Center of the Be′sat Hospital for providing this database.,The current study has financially supported by the Modeling of Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (No. 9904242617).,BMC Emergency Medicine,,,"Aged; Male; Humans; Adult; Female; Trauma Centers; Iran; Retrospective Studies; Accidents, Traffic; Burns; Wounds and Injuries",2022-12-26,2022,2022-12-26,,22,1,210,All OA; Gold,Article,"Roshanaei, Ghodratollah; Khoshravesh, Sahar; Abdolmaleki, Sajjad; Bathaei, Tayebeh; Farzian, Mahnaz; Saatian, Mohammadreza","Roshanaei, Ghodratollah (Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Modeling of Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Khoshravesh, Sahar (Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Abdolmaleki, Sajjad (Department of Neurosurgery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Bathaei, Tayebeh (Department of Operating Room, School of Para Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran); Farzian, Mahnaz (Clinical Supervisor, Be’sat hospital, Hamadan, Iran); Saatian, Mohammadreza (Department of Neurosurgery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran; School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Shaheed Fahmideh Ave, Hamadan, Islamic Republic of Iran)","Saatian, Mohammadreza (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences; Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)","Roshanaei, Ghodratollah (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Khoshravesh, Sahar (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Abdolmaleki, Sajjad (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Bathaei, Tayebeh (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences); Farzian, Mahnaz (Clinical Supervisor, Be’sat hospital, Hamadan, Iran); Saatian, Mohammadreza (Hamedan University of Medical Sciences; Hamedan University of Medical Sciences)",6,6,2.76,3.05,https://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12873-022-00756-9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153990847,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study reported in line with the STROBE guidelines.
METHODS: Nursing students were invited to complete an online questionnaire at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year using convenience sampling. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic factors, work, and life experiences in relation to COVID-19, habits and lifestyle using the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Generalized Anxiety disorder-7 scale. Variables related to anxiety were analysed using multiple lineal regression analysis, RESULTS: The prevalence of low psychological well-being in the 203 students was 44.3% and of anxiety 55.7%. In the multivariate analysis the variables associated with anxiety were having worked in the pandemic, having had symptoms of COVID-19 and having been afraid of getting infected.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing students have been high, and levels of psychological well-being have been low. The fact of having worked during the pandemic, having had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or being afraid of getting infected are associated with the highest scores for anxiety.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study gives more evidence on the psychological impact on nursing students during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain. This can be used to design anxiety management programmes for inclusion into teaching syllabuses. It also gives arguments for the setting up of psychological and emotional support services for these students and other healthcare professionals working during the pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the staff and students of the Sant Joan de Déu Teaching Campus University Nursing School who participated voluntarily in this study and the Information Technology Department for their help in administrating it.

Additionally, these patients suffer hormonal alterations that are associated with psychological symptoms (e.g., changes in mood, emotional instability, and memory loss). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling to reduce anxiety and depression related to the treatment in patients with DTC.
Methods: A non-randomized controlled study, with two groups [experimental group (EG), n = 37, and control group (CG), n = 38] and baseline and posttreatment measures, was designed. Patients in the EG received a psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling in addition to the standard treatment. The independent variable was the assigned group and the dependent one was the evolution of anxiety and depression, which were analyzed separately, and both were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Other relevant covariables related to the quality of life (QoL) were also analyzed using Short Form-36 Health Survey and Psychological General Wellbeing Index scales.
Results: The difference of the posttreatment-baseline variation showed a statistically significant reduction in anxiety and depression in the EG in relation to the CG (p < 0.001). The mean of the Psychological General Wellbeing Index scales score increased significantly in the EG (p < 0.001) and decreased significantly in the CG (p < 0.001). All the baseline and the posttreatment scores of the variables evaluated showed a statistically significant improvement in the EG vs. the CG.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates significant benefits of psycho-oncological intervention based on counseling in anxiety, depression, QoL, and wellbeing of the patient with differentiated thyroid carcinomas.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-02-25,2022,2022-02-25,,13,,767093,All OA; Gold,Article,"Javaloyes, Nuria; Crespo, Aurora; Redal, M.

The list of variables that influence walkability showed a good consensus among the experts at the end of the process. This list was formed by 48 items and organized in six factors: traffic and safety (eleven items), signage (eight items), sidewalk (ten items), transport consistency (five items), activity (five items), and finally, urban planning (nine items). The experts agreed on the need to analyze the environments of educational centers and measure the variables that affect walkability. This study has identified the most important barriers. In the future, a measurement instrument should be developed that allows centers to be compared with others in terms of their levels of walkability. Moreover, it might be a resource for more policies to be developed with the aim to promote active commuting to school.",Thanks to all the experts who collaborated in the preparation of this study.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Stefania Toselli, Pasqualino Maietta Latessa, Sofia Marini",Environment Design; Residence Characteristics; Delphi Technique; Transportation; Walking; Schools,2022-10-30,2022,2022-10-30,,19,21,14201,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cerro-Herrero, David; Prieto-Prieto, Josué; Vaquero-Solis, Mikel; Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ángel; Sánchez-Miguel, Pedro Antonio","Cerro-Herrero, David (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Teacher Training, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain); Prieto-Prieto, Josué (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, School of Education and Tourism, University of Salamanca, 05003 Ávila, Spain); Vaquero-Solis, Mikel (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain); Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ángel (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain); Sánchez-Miguel, Pedro Antonio (Department of Didactic of Musical, Plastic and Body Expression, Faculty of Teacher Training, University of Extremadura, 10071 Cáceres, Spain)","Cerro-Herrero, David (University of Extremadura)","Cerro-Herrero, David (University of Extremadura); Prieto-Prieto, Josué (University of Salamanca); Vaquero-Solis, Mikel (University of Extremadura); Tapia-Serrano, Miguel Ángel (University of Extremadura); Sánchez-Miguel, Pedro Antonio (University of Extremadura)",2,2,,1.16,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/21/14201/pdf?version=1667897157,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152350723,33 Built Environment and Design; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

The nonlinearity and spatiotemporal variability of the interactions between different flow phases makes the multi-phase flow measurement a challenging task. Two Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) schemes are proposed in this study for the state estimation of a decentralized multi-phase flow measurement system. The developed observers are shown to be theoretically valid and numerically applicable for a real-life case study data. The multi-phase flow system considered in this paper can be described as two interconnected sub-systems including fluid and gas sub-systems, and two scenarios are considered in the design of the observers. The first scenario considers the interconnections as bounded disturbance (SMOD), while the second scenario considers the interconnections as an uncertainty (SMOU). Hence, the Sliding Mode Observers are adopted to mitigate the effects of disturbance in the system and uncertainties in the parameters. Numerical simulations are conducted using MATLAB and dynamic HYSYS simultaneously, using the data obtained from field-based multi-phase flow measurements. The results demonstrate the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of the multi-phase fluid specifications including the density, velocity, and the volume phases fraction in each subsystem. The analysis of the results highlights that the proposed model is computationally efficient with fast transient response, accurate tracking capability of the real process data, and very low steady-state error. This study shows that choosing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovsky function results in the asymptotic stability of the decentralized system and improves the performance of the proposed observers. Uncertainty analysis is conducted on the velocity estimation results obtained from the Sliding Observers. Overall, SMOU method shown better performance with RMSE of 0.24%, while RMSE of 0.46% was achieved for the SMOD. Comparison of the numerical results with the field-based flow measurement, as a benchmark, shows that although uncertainty in SMOU is approximately half of the uncertainty in SMOD, state estimation for both schemes was achieved in a finite time with high order of precision. It was shown that both observers developed in this study are well capable of estimating the multi-phase flow variables and states.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2022-01-19,2022,2022-01-19,2022-02,8,2,e08768,All OA; Gold,Article,"Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani; Abolfathi, Soroush","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Faculty of Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran); Abolfathi, Soroush (School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK)","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Shahid Beheshti University)","Farahani, Abolfazl Varvani (Shahid Beheshti University); Abolfathi, Soroush (University of Warwick)",14,10,0.68,7.73,https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/162034/13/WRAP-Sliding-mode-observer-design-decentralized-multi-phase-flow-estimation-2022.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144778627,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies,"Objectives: The objective of the present work was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between periodontal disease (PD) and urogenital cancer (UC) risk.
Materials and methods: An electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted using MeSH terms to identify cohort studies published before May 17, 2022. Cohort studies examining the association between PD and UC risk were included. We used a random-effects model to summarize the effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the included studies with PD as the indicator and UC as the outcome.
Results: Eleven cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Our results suggest that PD patients increases the risk of UC by 1.24-fold (hazard ratio (HR), 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.31; I2, 22.4%). The strength of the sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the results.
Conclusion: We found that PD is a potential risk factor for UC. Our results indicate that along with the decrease in the incidence of PD,PD treatment may help prevent UC. We hope that our study will raise awareness of periodontal health, thereby reducing the incidence of UC.

In addition, the subjects with HIV scored significantly lower than the diabetic subjects on all the variables of psychological well-being. Subjects with HIV used problem-solving coping, social support seeking, positive reappraisal, religious coping and avoidance coping with less frequency than diabetic subjects. However, they used more negative auto-focused coping compared to diabetic subjects.

It affects 5% of the adult population in the world and is the leading cause of disability, with an annual cost of USD one trillion. In Spain, its prevalence is 13.4%, costing EUR 6000 million a year. Physical inactivity has been linked to an increase in depressive symptoms, with physical activity associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life. Objective: To calculate the odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) of suffering from depression and taking antidepressants in the inactive Spanish population compared to groups with a higher level of physical activity. Method: 17,141 individuals aged 18−69 years residing in Spain and interviewed in the 2017 Spanish National Health Survey were included in this cross-sectional investigation. Results: Dependence relationships were found between the level of physical activity and the prevalence of depression and taking antidepressants (p < 0.001). We found elevated ORs and RRs for depression and antidepressant use in inactive people compared to those with a high/very high level of physical activity (Depression: OR: 4.32. CI95%: 3.35−5.57.

During the construction and analysis of the psychometric characteristics of the scale, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were performed. To test EES scores based on gender and school year, the T-Student test for independent samples and ANOVA were used, respectively. To verify the relationship between the scores of the different types of emotions and academic performance, the Pearson correlation test was performed. A total of 562 students belonging to the 5th (n = 228) and 6th (n = 186) primary school year and the 1st (n = 134) and 2nd (n = 94) secondary school year participated in the research. Age between 10 and 15 years old (mean = 11.66, standard deviation = 1.206) both males (50.5%) and females (49.5%). The results offered support for the three-factor structure. The analysis of invariance with respect to gender showed that the factor structure was invariant. Boys scored higher on the positive emotions factor and lower scores on anxiety than girls. Regarding school year, negative emotions and anxiety related to exams increase in the secondary courses compared to Primary while for positive emotions it is primary school students who obtain higher scores. The correlation coefficient between negative emotions (as well as anxiety) and school performance is negative whereas the correlation coefficient between positive emotions and academic performance is positive. EES scale is an instrument with scientific rigor and with adequate reliability and validity to be able to know the emotions that primary and secondary school students suffer when they are subjected to evaluation processes in the academic context.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Carlos Salavera, Pablo Usán Supervía, Víctor Murillo Lorente, Mário Rui Domingues Ferreira da Cruz",Adolescent; Child; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Schools; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-06-01,2022,2022-06-01,,19,11,6770,All OA; Gold,Article,"Obregón-Cuesta, Ana Isabel; Mínguez-Mínguez, Luis Alberto; León-del-Barco, Benito; Mendo-Lázaro, Santiago; Fernández-Solana, Jessica; González-Santos, Josefa; González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.","Obregón-Cuesta, Ana Isabel (Department of Mathematics and Computing, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain;, aiobregon@ubu.es); Mínguez-Mínguez, Luis Alberto (Department of Education Sciences, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain); León-del-Barco, Benito (Department of Psychology and Anthropology, University of Extremadura, 10071 Caceres, Spain;, bleon@unex.es, (B.L.-d.-B.);, smendo@unex.es, (S.M.-L.)); Mendo-Lázaro, Santiago (Department of Psychology and Anthropology, University of Extremadura, 10071 Caceres, Spain;, bleon@unex.es, (B.L.-d.-B.);, smendo@unex.es, (S.M.-L.)); Fernández-Solana, Jessica (Department of Health Sciences, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain;, jfsolana@ubu.es, (J.F.-S.);, mjgonzalez@ubu.es, (J.G.-S.);, jejavier@ubu.es, (J.J.G.-B.)); González-Santos, Josefa (Department of Health Sciences, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain;, jfsolana@ubu.es, (J.F.-S.);, mjgonzalez@ubu.es, (J.G.-S.);, jejavier@ubu.es, (J.J.G.-B.)); González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.

This was a multicentre, prospective, cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the 30-day mortality. The heart rate variability and more specifically the relative parasympathetic activity (ANIm), and the SDNN (Energy), were measured. To predict severity and mortality multivariate analyses of ANIm, Energy, SOFA score, and RASS scales were conducted. 112 patients were collected, the survival group (n = 55) and the deceased group (n = 57). The ANIm value was higher (p = 0.013) and the Energy was lower in the deceased group (p = 0.001); Higher Energy was correlated with higher survival days (p = 0.009), and a limit value of 0.31 s predicted mortalities with a sensitivity of 71.9% and a specificity of 74.5%. Autonomic nervous system and heart rate variability monitoring in critically ill patients with COVID-19 allows for predicting survival days and 30-day mortality through the Energy value.

This has had a major effect on climate change and global environmental catastrophe. In many countries, the strategy of closing various activities such as tourism and industrial production stopped normal life, transportation, etc. This closure has a positive impact on the environment. However, the massive use of masks and personal protection could significantly increase pollution worldwide. The impact on the environment needs to be calculated to have information for public health actions.

In Colombia, this challenge intersects with wider challenges facing post-conflict reconstruction. Our pilot study will explore the feasibility and acceptability of a participatory approach to developing community-led participatory interventions for community mental health systems strengthening and mental health improvement, in two sites in Caquetá, Colombia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project is divided into three distinct phases aligned with community participatory action research cycles: diagnostic, intervention and evaluation. This allows us to use a participatory approach to design a community-led, bottom-up intervention for mental health systems strengthening and the promotion of mental health and well-being.The diagnostic phase explores local understandings of mental health, mental distress and access to mental health services from community members and health providers. The intervention stage will be guided by a participatory Theory of Change process. Community priorities will inform the development of a participatory, learning and action (PLA) informed group intervention, with a community linkage forum. The pilot of the PLA intervention will be evaluated using MRC process evaluation guidelines.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project has received ethical approval from two sources. Universidad de Los Andes (2021-1393) and the University College London (16127/005). Dissemination of findings will include academic publications, community forums, policy briefs and visual media (cartoons, pod casts and short films).",,"This work is funded by an UKRI/ESRC Newton Award, grant number ES/V013211 and a MINCIENCIAS award, grant number 856-2020.",BMJ Open,,,Humans; Community Mental Health Services; Pilot Projects; Colombia; Research Design; Health Services Research; Polyesters,2022-12-22,2022,2022-12-22,2022-12,12,12,e069329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Burgess, Rochelle; Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios; Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío; Fonseca, Laura; San Juan, Norha Vera; Lucumí, Diego; González-Gort, Mónica; Melgar, Mónica Carreño; Gaviria, María Fanny; Tovar, Diego Ferney; Jovchelovitch, Sandra","Burgess, Rochelle (UCL Institute for Global Health, London, UK); Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Fonseca, Laura (Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK); San Juan, Norha Vera (UCL Institute for Global Health, London, UK; Rapid Research Appraisal and Evaluation Lab, University College London, London, UK); Lucumí, Diego (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); González-Gort, Mónica (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Melgar, Mónica Carreño (School of Government, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Gaviria, María Fanny (Corporación Manigua, Florencia, Colombia); Tovar, Diego Ferney (Cooperativa Multiactiva Para El Buen Vivir Y La Paz Del Caquetá, Florencia, Colombia); Jovchelovitch, Sandra (Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK)","Burgess, Rochelle (University College London)","Burgess, Rochelle (University College London); Sanguineti, María Cecilia Dedios (Universidad de Los Andes); Maldonado-Carrizosa, Darío (Universidad de Los Andes); Fonseca, Laura (London School of Economics and Political Science); San Juan, Norha Vera (University College London; University College London); Lucumí, Diego (Universidad de Los Andes); González-Gort, Mónica (Universidad de Los Andes); Melgar, Mónica Carreño (Universidad de Los Andes); Gaviria, María Fanny (Corporación Manigua, Florencia, Colombia); Tovar, Diego Ferney (Cooperativa Multiactiva Para El Buen Vivir Y La Paz Del Caquetá, Florencia, Colombia); Jovchelovitch, Sandra (London School of Economics and Political Science)",6,6,1.26,3.56,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/12/e069329.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153897247,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this context, this study aimed to uncover the consequences of conflict on victims' health and on health service provision, and their perceived health status during the post-accord stage in the Meta region, located in the country's eastern plains. Historically, this region has been one of the territories most affected by the presence of conflict-related groups and armed confrontations. Through focus groups, this research explored the health perceptions and experiences of victims of armed conflict. Ten focus groups were conducted with men and women, victims of the armed-conflict, in four municipalities with different degrees of armed conflict intensity. The focus group transcripts were coded using NVivo. The results show that the way women have experienced conflict and the effects of conflict on mental health in general for men, women, and children were recurrent themes in the dialogue of victims. Likewise, it highlights the need to understand the barriers that the current health model imposes on the right to health itself. From the victim's perspective, they experience stigmatization, discrimination, and revictimization when accessing health services. These barriers co-occur along with structural limitations of the health system that affect the general population.","We would like to thank the participants, the victims’ organizations, the public officers from the department of Meta Governor’s Office, and the Secretary of Health, partners that facilitated and supported data collection in the territory.","This paper is a result of a project that was funded by the UK Medical Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, DFID and Wellcome Trust (Joint Health Systems Research Initiative).

As future health professionals, medical students will be a relevant generating opinion group and will have an important role in the organ requesting process. The goals of this meta-analysis were to obtain polled rates of medical students who are in favor, against, or indecisive toward cadaveric organ donation in the studies conducted around the world, and to explore sociocultural variables influencing the willingness to donate. Electronic search and revision of references from previous literature allowed us to locate 57 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent investigators. Pooled estimations were computed assuming a random-effects model. Despite the fact that willingness to donate was elevated in medical students, estimated rates in studies from different geographical areas and sociocultural backgrounds exhibited significant differences. The age and the grade of the students also influenced the rate of students in favor. Donation campaigns should take into account cultural factors, especially in countries where certain beliefs and values could hamper organ donation. Also, knowledge and skills related to organ donation and transplant should be acquired early in the medical curriculum when a negative attitude is less resistant to change.",,,Transplant International,,,"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Organ Transplantation; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tissue Donors; Tissue and Organ Procurement",2022-06-28,2022,2022-06-28,,35,,10446,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iniesta-Sepúlveda, Marina; López-Navas, Ana I.; Gutiérrez, Pedro R.; Ramírez, Pablo; Ríos, Antonio","Iniesta-Sepúlveda, Marina (Department of Psychology, Catholic University of Murcia, UCAM, Murcia, Spain); López-Navas, Ana I.

The main objective of this study is to provide new empirical evidence about the validity and reliability of the CERQ via a sample of 271 Spanish adolescents (136 female, 135 male) aged from 15 to 18 years (M = 15.7, SD = 0.76). The analytical process was carried out in two phases. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the polychoric correlation matrix between items. Four possible alternative models were contrasted: two models with nine factors and two models with two second-order factors and nine first-order factors, with 36 and 27 items, respectively. The model with nine correlated factors and 27 items obtained the best indices of overall fit. Subsequently, the reliability of the measurements was estimated on this model. The results reaffirm the validity of the 27-item version of the CERQ over the original 36-item structure. The findings also confirm that the CERQ is a reliable instrument for the evaluation of emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.","This research has been supported by the Spanish Government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) and by a doctoral grant (Formación de Profesorado Universitario, FPU 17/01994) awarded to the first author (E.B.).",This research has received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Cognition; Emotional Regulation; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires,2022-03-18,2022,2022-03-18,,19,6,3602,All OA; Gold,Article,"Betegón, Elena; Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo; del-Valle, Macarena; Irurtia, María Jesús","Betegón, Elena (Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, mjirurtia@uva.es); Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo (Department of Pedagogy, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, jairo.rodriguez.medina@uva.es); del-Valle, Macarena (Institute of Basic and Applied Psychology and Technology (IPSIBAT), National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), National University of Mar del Plata (UNMDP), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, Mar del Plata 7600, Argentina;, mdelvalle1989@gmail.com); Irurtia, María Jesús (Department of Psychology, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Valladolid (UVa), Recognized Research Group (GIR) Psychology and Health, 47011 Valladolid, Spain;, mjirurtia@uva.es)","Betegón, Elena (University of Valladolid)","Betegón, Elena (University of Valladolid); Rodríguez-Medina, Jairo (University of Valladolid); del-Valle, Macarena (National University of Mar del Plata); Irurtia, María Jesús (University of Valladolid)",11,10,2.46,6.97,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/6/3602/pdf?version=1647588000,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146439261,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

METHODS: We carried out a secondary data analysis of the National Health Services Users' Satisfaction Survey (ENSUSALUD), 2016. This nationally representative survey evaluates doctors and nurses working in clinical settings. We defined scientific activity as i) having published an original article (journal indexed in Web of Science, Scopus or Medline); and ii) having authored an abstract in a national or international conference. We estimated crude and adjusted disparities prevalence ratios (aDPR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
RESULTS: We included 2025 doctors and 2877 nurses in the analysis; 71% of doctors doctor were male, and 93% of nurses were female (p<0.001). Among doctors, 13.9% had published an article, and 8.4% presented an abstract at a conference in the last two years, while these proportions were 0.6% and 2.5% for nurses, respectively. The adjusted models showed that doctors, when compared to nurses, were approximately 27 times likely to have published a paper (aDPR = 27.86; 95% CI 10.46 to 74.19) and twice as likely to have authored a conference abstract (aDPR = 2.51; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.53).
CONCLUSIONS: There are important disparities in scientific activity between doctors and nurses working in clinical settings in Peru. Disparities are more significant for article publication than for authoring in conference abstracts. We suggest public policies that promote research dissemination between health professionals, with emphasis on nurses.",To Dr. Tomasa Cajas-Bravo for her help with revision and suggestions.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Monica Guberti,Bibliometrics; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Peru; Physicians; Research,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,17,9,e0273031,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara-Mejía, Angélica; Niño-Garcia, Roberto; Zeta-Solis, Ludwing; Soto-Becerra, Percy; Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali; Pereyra-Elías, Reneé; Cabieses, Báltica; Mezones-Holguin, Edward","Vergara-Mejía, Angélica (Universidad Nacional Hemilio Valdizán, Escuela de Postgrado, Huánuco, Perúa; Seguro Social en Salud (EsSalud), Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen, Lima, Peru); Niño-Garcia, Roberto (Universidad Nacional de Piura, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Piura (SOCIEMUNP), Piura, Peru); Zeta-Solis, Ludwing (Universidad Nacional de Piura, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Sociedad Científica de Estudiantes de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional de Piura (SOCIEMUNP), Piura, Peru); Soto-Becerra, Percy (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru); Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru); Pereyra-Elías, Reneé (Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Oxford, United Kingdom; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Cabieses, Báltica (Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Programa de Estudios Sociales en Salud-Instituto de Ciencias e Innovación en Salud, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Lima, Peru; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)","Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)","Vergara-Mejía, Angélica (Universidad Nacional Hemilio Valdizán, Escuela de Postgrado, Huánuco, Perúa; EsSALUD); Niño-Garcia, Roberto (Universidad Nacional de Piura); Zeta-Solis, Ludwing (Universidad Nacional de Piura); Soto-Becerra, Percy (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru); Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Pereyra-Elías, Reneé (University of Oxford; Peruvian University of Applied Sciences); Cabieses, Báltica (Universidad del Desarrollo); Mezones-Holguin, Edward (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola; Epi-gnosis Solutions, Piura, Peru)",2,2,0.85,1.4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273031&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150701566,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Vulnerable school populations are distinguished by having predisposing factors to overweight and obesity, which results in a greater risk of suffering from the disease and its ravages. Additionally, the effects of the COVID-19 contingency can worsen the situation. Previous reviews of prevention, treatment and control of the disease have focused on schoolchildren from high- and middle-income countries. The objective of this review was to gather the evidence from the studies that evaluate the effectiveness of multicomponent lifestyle intervention programs (MLIP) on adiposity indicators in vulnerable populations. Five electronic databases were searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The eligibility criteria were schoolchildren (5 to 12 years old), inhabitants of rural area, with low socioeconomic level and/or belonging to an indigenous community. Randomized and quasi-experimental controlled trials were included. Interventions that included two or more of the following components were considered: physical activity, nutrition, psychology, school meals and/or family/community involvement. Of the 11 interventions included 73 % had significant improvements in at least one variable related to adiposity. The most successful interventions had components of nutrition, physical activity and family/community involvement, the majority (80 %) had a duration of ≥ 6 months and were provided, in 80 % of the cases, by previously trained teachers. In conclusion, there is evidence that MLIPs are effective in improving indicators of adiposity in vulnerable schoolchildren.",,,Nutrición Hospitalaria,,,"Adiposity; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Overweight",2022,2022,,2022,39,5,1122-1134,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dórame López, Norma Alicia; Esparza Romero, Julián","Dórame López, Norma Alicia (Diabetes Research Unit.

Of 74,270 papers found on 13 search engines between 12 August 2020, and 2 November 2021, we identified six studies (n = 1392 and 1097 were women). We found several results on the perception of both variables during the pandemic. First, physical activity tended to decrease or have negative changes, either because they dedicated less time to it, decreased the type of intensity or because they dedicated more time to sedentary activities. In addition, women were more physically active than men, since men perceived a decrease in their levels of physical activity. Secondly, there were also slight changes in the perception of body image; several students perceived that they gained weight and others had an increase in their BMI. It is even noted that those who were physically active or who were older in the population studied had a better perception of their actual physical condition. Similarly, we found that a concern for body image and even negative changes in the perception of appearance during confinement were reported. In conclusion, we found changes in the perception of physical activity and body image in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.",The authors acknowledge the support of the Nesh Hubbs Qualitative Unit team.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

Negative pulsed-pressure myofascial vacuum therapy (vacuum treatment (VT)) devices mobilize tissue according to previously programmed parameters of force, time and frequency. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of VT combined with core therapeutic exercise versus a physical therapy program (PTP) based only on core therapeutic exercise. Fifty participants with chronic non-specific low back pain were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, the VT group (n = 25) or the PTP group (n = 25). Pain, pressure-pain threshold, range of motion, functionality and quality of life were measured before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at one-month and three-month follow-ups. Both groups received 15 therapy sessions over 5 weeks. Statistically significant differences in favor of the VT group were shown in the results.

Desde el primer reporte en la provincia de Wuhan (China) en el año 2019, el SARS-CoV-2 se ha diseminado por todo el mundo, provocando un enorme impacto en la salud pública. Para su diagnóstico, la Organización Mundial de la Salud ha incentivado el desarrollo de pruebas rápidas, de simple ejecución, sensibles y específicas, que complementan la RT-qPCR como prueba de referencia. La prueba RT-LAMP ha mostrado ser una excelente alternativa para la detección del SARS-CoV-2 en diferentes biofluidos.
OBJETIVO: Validar la técnica RT-LAMP colorimétrica en muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo previamente confirmadas por RT-qPCR, usando el protocolo Charité, Berlín, Alemania. Materiales y métodos. Un total de 153 muestras de hisopado nasofaríngeo de individuos con sospecha de COVID-19 se sometieron a RT-qPCR y RT-LAMP, usando un estuche comercial colorimétrico (NEB, Germany). La RT-LAMP se practicó con las muestras de ARN extraídas del hisopado nasofaríngeo y con muestras crudas sin previa extracción de ARN. El resultado fue evaluado por un simple cambio de color en la reacción.
RESULTADOS: La sensibilidad y especificidad de la técnica RT-LAMP para detectar el gen N del SARS-CoV-2 mediante un set de cebadores previamente reportados (set de Broughton), arrojó valores de 0,97 (0,85-1,00) y 0,81 (0,65-0,92), respectivamente, con un intervalo de confianza del 95%. Otro set de cebadores dirigidos contra otra región del mismo gen (set de Lalli) arrojó valores de sensibilidad y especificidad de 0,96 (0,78-1,00) y 0,77 (0,55-0,92), respectivamente. Sin previa extracción de ARN, se encontró que la sensibilidad fue del 0,95 (0,74-1,00) y la especificidad del 0,88 (0,64-0,99).
CONCLUSIONES: Estos resultados evidencian que la técnica RT-LAMP podría considerarse una prueba diagnóstica rápida, de fácil ejecución, libre de equipos sofisticados, sensible y específica, para el diagnóstico del SARS-CoV-2 en muestras de hisopados nasofaríngeos.","Agradecemos a la Secretaría de Salud del Distrito de Barranquilla, a la Secretaría de Salud del Departamento del Atlántico y al Instituto Nacional de Salud, por el apoyo logístico en relación con las muestras clínicas y su remisión a la Unidad de Genética y Biología Molecular de la Universidad Simón Bolívar.

We specifically focus on melanoma and heart murmurs. We use a comparative study of two convolution networks in the Complex and Real numerical domains. The idea is to obtain a powerful approach for building portable systems for early disease detection. Two similar algorithmic structures were chosen so that there is no bias determined by the number of parameters to train. Three clinical data sets, ISIC2017, PH2, and Pascal, were used to carry out the experiments. Mean comparison hypothesis tests were performed to ensure statistical objectivity in the conclusions. In all cases, complex-valued networks presented a superior performance for the Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and Specificity metrics in the detection of associated anomalies. The best complex number-based classifier obtained in the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) space presents a Euclidean distance of 0.26127 with respect to the ideal classifier, as opposed to the best real number-based classifier, whose Euclidean distance to the ideal is 0.36022 for the same task of melanoma detection. The 27.46% superiority in this metric, as in the others reported in this work, suggests that complex-valued networks have a greater ability to extract features for more efficient discrimination in the dataset.",CEIBA and Government of Nariño Colombia.

The work of public health policies is aimed at reducing its prevalence as well as its pharmaceutical cost. Physical activity (PA) programs are interventions with a high potential for effectiveness.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the relationships between physical activity and the prevalence of depression and antidepressant intake in the Spanish population.
DESIGN: We performed a correlational study that was based on data from the European Health Survey Spain 2020 with 20,287 participants, aged 18-84 years, living in Spain.
RESULTS: Dependency relationships were found between the prevalence of depression, and: the frequency of PA, the number of days of PA per week, and the number of days of muscle strengthening in the population, in both sexes, and in all age groups (p < 0.001). Dependency relationships were found between the three PA variables and the prevalence of taking antidepressants (p < 0.001). An elevated prevalence of depression and antidepressant taking were found in the inactive groups compared to those who performed PA (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There is an inverse relationship between physical activity and the probability of suffering from depression and the intake of antidepressants. Performing PA 3-4 days/week, including 1-2 days of strength work, could be the best proposal to reduce the prevalence of depression in the Spanish population.",This article has been made possible thanks to the project “Observatorio El Ejercicio Te Cuida” signed between the Fundación Jóvenes y Deporte de la Junta de Extremadura and the University of Extremadura.,"Proyecto 4IE + (0499_4IE_PLUS_4_E); Programa Interreg VA España-Portugal (POCTEP) 2014–2020: 0499_4IE_PLUS_4_E; Desarrollo del Observatorio El Ejercicio Te Cuida (02/03/2021–01/03/2023); The author Á.D.-Z.

Uma estratégia para o tratamento de quadros graves da COVID-19 foi o uso de plasma convalescente, obtido de doadores convalescentes da doença, com alta produção de anticorpos, de forma a permitir a neutralização do vírus e melhora no quadro clínico. Embora muitos estudos destaquem o uso do plasma convalescente, poucos descrevem propostas para coletar plasma com concentração de anticorpos anti-Spike aceitáveis para o uso em indivíduos acometidos com a forma grave da COVID-19. Dessa forma, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os fatores sociodemográficos ligados à produção de anticorpos IgG anti-Spike em candidatos à doação de plasma convalescente na cidade de Manaus-AM. Material e métodos Foram incluídos no estudo 123 candidatos à doação de plasma convalescente, do gênero masculino, que tiveram o diagnóstico da COVID-19 30 dias antes da doação, sem histórico de vacinação prévia. Foi realizada uma coleta de 4 mL do sangue periférico para obtenção do soro, utilizado para quantificação de anticorpos IgG anti-Spike por quimioluminescência, expressos em AU/mL, através do kit Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott). Os doadores foram segregados com base na concentração de anticorpos em baixa produção (< 50 AU/mL), produção intermediária (50-1,280 AU/mL) e alta produção (> 1,280 AU/mL), segundo informações do kit, e recomendação internacional. Os dados sociodemográficos de idade, gênero, cor de pele, índice de massa corporal (IMC), uso de ventilação mecânica e dias internados foram utilizados para fins de comparação entre os grupos. Foi realizado o teste de ANOVA, Qui-Quadrado e teste exato de Fisher para comparação dos dados sociodemográficos, além dos testes de correlação de Spearman. Resultados Nossos dados demonstraram uma maior prevalência de doadores com alto índice de IMC na população de alto produtores de anticorpos (p = 0.0254). Além disso, também observamos que a concentração dos anticorpos IgG anti-Spike apresentou grau de correlação positiva com a idade (r = 0.240; p = 0.008) e IMC (r = 0.247; p < 0.006). Discussão Nossos resultados demonstram uma relação entre a idade e o IMC na produção de anticorpos anti-Spike em doadores convalescentes com alta concentração de anticorpos. Essa relação pode estar atrelada à efeitos de imunomodulação, bem como ao grau de lesão tecidual e sistêmico apresentado pelos pacientes mais velhos e/ou com maior IMC. A relação desses fatores com a produção de anticorpos ainda é uma área pouco explorada, o que salienta a necessidade de compreender os mecanismos imunológicos associados à produção de anticorpos, junto com a proteção dos pacientes convalescentes. Conclusão Nosso estudo demonstrou que o IMC dos acometidos pela COVID-19 pode contribuir para a alta produção de anticorpos de classe IgG anti-Spike. No entanto, estudos adicionais são necessários para compreender os aspectos imunológicos associados à maior proteção da população, bem como produção de anticorpos com maior eficácia pelos indivíduos acometidos pela COVID-19. *AM e AGC contribuíram igualmente para este trabalho.",,,Hematology Transfusion and Cell Therapy,,,,2022-10-15,2022,2022-10-15,2022-10,44,,s393,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva-Junior, AL; Oliveira, LS; Costa, TCC; Xabregas, LA; Dias, S; Crispim, MAE; Sabino, EC; Fraiji, NA; Malheiro, A; Costa, AG","Silva-Junior, AL (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Oliveira, LS (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Costa, TCC (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Xabregas, LA (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Dias, S (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Crispim, MAE (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Sabino, EC (Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), São Paulo, Brasil); Fraiji, NA (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Malheiro, A (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, AM, Brasil); Costa, AG (Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM), Manaus, AM, Brasil; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA), Manaus, AM, Brasil)",,"Silva-Junior, AL (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Oliveira, LS (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Costa, TCC (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Xabregas, LA (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Dias, S (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Crispim, MAE (Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas; University of the State of Amazonas); Sabino, EC (Federal University of São Paulo); Fraiji, NA (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas); Malheiro, A (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas; University of the State of Amazonas); Costa, AG (Federal University of Amazonas; Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas; University of the State of Amazonas)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2022.09.665,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151924064,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of socioeconomic conditions on self-rated health from a generational perspective, its differential effect on gender, and its influence on the gender gap in order to explore health diversity using a multidisciplinary approach and considering policy implications in Eastern European countries.
METHODS: We used data drawn from the European Health Interview Survey for eight Eastern European countries and EUROSTAT from 2006 through to 2009. We conducted multilevel analyses to understand the individual and national health determinants of self-rated health by gender and to determine whether national differences remain after controlling for micro variables. In order to analyze the role of equity (Gini quartile) in gender differences, Oaxaca analyses were used.
RESULTS: The self-rated health gender gap increases with age. Individual characteristics, such as educational level or smoking, influence citizens' perceived health, and have a stronger effect on women than on men. Knowing both the characteristics (endowment effects) and the effects of individual characteristics (coefficient effects) on health is important in order to understand gender gaps among people from the silent generation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicates that random effects are greater for men than for women. Moreover, random effects might be explained to a certain extent by economic equity (Gini index). The combined effects of gender, cohort, and geographical differences on self-rated health have to be taken into account to develop public health policies.",,"This research was funded by the Government of Aragón (Reference Group BYCS S16_17R) and co-financed with Feder 2014–2020 “Building Europe from Aragón” and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, Government of Spain, grant number: “CSO2017-82110-R”.

There is a need in academia to address workers' health issues at the time of graduation. Nearpod is an educational application founded on a web-based learning tool. In the field of Health Sciences, the use of Nearpod has been scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the level of satisfaction with using this interactive tool and to assess the influence of using Nearpod in class on students' performance while dealing with the topic of musculoskeletal disorders in third-year Degree in Physiotherapy students during the 2021-2022 academic year. The participants were students at the University of Cadiz. They were randomly divided into two groups, a control group using a PowerPoint presentation and an experimental group using the interactive Nearpod application. The experimental group took two surveys to determine their satisfaction with the method used. Students also took a multiple-choice test to assess the knowledge acquired. In the surveys, a high percentage of satisfaction was obtained (97.62% and 99.39%). There were no significant differences in the scores obtained by the two groups, although there were significant differences in response time in favor of the experimental group (p = 0.022). Although studies should be carried out with larger samples and on different subjects, it seems that Nearpod is a tool with great potential for teaching the study of musculoskeletal disorders.",Our thanks to Silvia Viñolo Gil for her help in translating the manuscript.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Humans; Students; Personal Satisfaction; Physical Therapists; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Physical Therapy Modalities,2022-12-21,2022,2022-12-21,,20,1,99,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus; García-Campanario, Ismael; Lagares-Franco, Carolina; Gonzalez-Medina, Gloria; Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel; Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier","Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain; Research Unit, Biomedical Research and Innovation Institute of Cadiz (INiBICA), Puerta del Mar University Hospital, University of Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain; Rehabilitation Clinical Management Unit, Interlevels-Intercenters Hospital Puerta del Mar, Hospital Puerto Real, Cadiz Bay-La Janda Health District, 11006 Cadiz, Spain); García-Campanario, Ismael (Group PAIDI UCA CTS391, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cadiz, 11003 Cadiz, Spain); Lagares-Franco, Carolina (INiBICA Group CO15 Population and Health: Determinants and Interventions, PAIDI UCA Group: CTS553, Department of Statistics and Operations Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cadiz, 11510 Cádiz, Spain); Gonzalez-Medina, Gloria (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain; Research Unit, Biomedical Research and Innovation Institute of Cadiz (INiBICA), Puerta del Mar University Hospital, University of Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain; CTS-986 Physical Therapy and Health (FISA), University Institute of Research in Social Sustainable Development (INDESS), 11009 Cadiz, Spain); Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain; Rehabilitation Clinical Management Unit, Interlevels-Intercenters Hospital Puerta del Mar, Hospital Puerto Real, Cadiz Bay-La Janda Health District, 11006 Cadiz, Spain); Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Cadiz, 11009 Cadiz, Spain)","Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar)","Vinolo-Gil, Maria Jesus (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar; University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar); García-Campanario, Ismael (University of Cádiz); Lagares-Franco, Carolina (University of Cádiz); Gonzalez-Medina, Gloria (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar; University of Cádiz; CTS-986 Physical Therapy and Health (FISA), University Institute of Research in Social Sustainable Development (INDESS), 11009 Cadiz, Spain); Rodríguez-Huguet, Manuel (University of Cádiz; Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar); Martín-Vega, Francisco Javier (University of Cádiz)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/99/pdf?version=1672496218,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153924303,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,

DESIGN: A scoping review was performed according to the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute.
STUDY SELECTION: All studies about intervention programmes for PA and nutritional behaviours in Colombia were included.
METHODS: Searches in Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scielo and Lilacs, using MeSH, Decs and Emtree terms, were performed up to August 2020. Additionally, a manual search was made in specialised national journals. An internet documentary search of the official websites on policies and programmes by departmental, district and municipal secretariats was also performed.Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Then, the full texts were reviewed to select documents to be included.Data management relevant information from selected documents and articles was extracted. A descriptive analysis was considered.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven documents and 70 published articles were found. The programmes were identified in 13 initiatives, 7 in the area of PA and 6 with a nutrition focus. They were on physical and social environmental modifications such as the 'muévete' ('get moving') programmes in Bogota, Quindio and Cartagena; a modification of 'ciclovía'; or bicycle path programmes as well as nutrition programmes in schools, universities and companies.
CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified national programmes and policies in Colombia in the area of nutrition and PA from the environmental perspective in different scenarios: from schools to workplaces and communities. The need to implement such programmes from public and private institutions is also noted, promoting the practice of PA and healthy eating in every scenario in the national territory. New research to determine the impact of these programmes is essential to get a glimpse of the effects of these programmes and the implications for public health.","EDH is a PhD candidate in Methodology of Biomedical Research and Public Health program, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain.","The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",BMJ Open,,,Colombia; Delivery of Health Care; Exercise; Humans; Public Health; Schools,2022-09-19,2022,2022-09-19,2022-09,12,9,e060085,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernandez, Edgar D; Guzman, Cristian Arvey; Seron, Pamela","Hernandez, Edgar D (Facultad de Medicina, Human Movement Department, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Guzman, Cristian Arvey (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; Physical Therapy Department, Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia); Seron, Pamela (Departamento de Ciencias de la Rehabilitación & CIGES, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile)","Seron, Pamela (University of La Frontera)","Hernandez, Edgar D (National University of Colombia); Guzman, Cristian Arvey (National University of Colombia; Hospital Universitario Nacional de Colombia); Seron, Pamela (University of La Frontera)",3,2,1.21,1.45,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/9/e060085.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151130544,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 112 parents of children and AYAs who had been diagnosed with cancer and who received treatment in Malaga participated in the study. In the study, participated all parents who voluntarily agreed to fulfil the questionnaire. The main inclusion criterion was that their child had cancer. Instruments used were Questionnaire on the Frequency of and Satisfaction with Social Support (QFSSS), Paediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP), Life Satisfaction Scale and Family Satisfaction Scale.
RESULTS: In the mean difference analyses, male parents showed 3.38 (SD = 0.56) in social support received and female parents showed M = 3.08 (SD = 0.72). Conversely, in social support provided, female parents showed 3.22 and male parents showed M = 3.55 (p = 0.020). Significant differences were also found in family satisfaction, where female parents (M = 3.64) feel more satisfied than male parents (M = 3.06; p = 0.027). Parents of children aged between 0 and 14 years (M = 3.06) feel more stress than those parents of children aged 15-21 (M = 2.61; p = 0.021). The correlation analysis shows that there is a negative and significant relation between stress levels experienced by parents when facing different situations related to the child's disease and both types of support, received r = -0.411, p < 0.001 and provided r = -0.282, p < 0.01. There is also a positive and significant relation between life satisfaction and social support received r = 0.292, p < 0.01, and social support provided r = 0.409, p < 0.001. There is a positive and significant relation between family satisfaction and social support received r = 0.330, p < 0.01, in the same way as with social support provided r = 0.222, p < 0.05. The regression analysis related to stress levels of parents indicates that social support received predicts levels of stress significantly p < 0.001, with the variable of number of children being the one that showed to be significant p < 0.05. Social support provided showed the most significant results p = 0.001, meaning that social support provided increased life satisfaction. Social support received explains family satisfaction (p = 0.50), as it increases the family satisfaction of parents of children with cancer.
DISCUSSION: Analysing social support received and provided, as well as sociodemographic and clinical variables, allowed us to broaden the knowledge on the effect social support has on stress levels, life satisfaction and family satisfaction in parents of children and AYAs diagnosed with cancer. This may have relevant practical implications for the design of interventions that would improve parents' lives.","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Fundación Olivares (Malaga, Spain) and to all the parents who participated in this study.",,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-02-07,2022,2022-02-07,,13,,728733,All OA; Gold,Article,"Melguizo-Garín, Anabel; Martos-Méndez, Mª José; Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel; Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain); Martos-Méndez, Mª José (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain); Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain); Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván (Department of Social Psychology, University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain)","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel (University of Malaga)","Melguizo-Garín, Anabel (University of Malaga); Martos-Méndez, Mª José (University of Malaga); Hombrados-Mendieta, Isabel (University of Malaga); Ruiz-Rodríguez, Iván (University of Malaga)",4,4,1.37,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.728733/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145352326,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,

The design and implementation of appropriate protection systems for MG and ADN must be addressed, which imposes new technical challenges. This paper presents the implementation and validation aspects of an adaptive fault detection strategy based on neural networks (NNs) and multiple sampling points for ADN and MG. The solution is implemented on an edge device. NNs are used to derive a data-driven model that uses only local measurements to detect fault states of the network without the need for communication infrastructure. Multiple sampling points are used to derive a data-driven model, which allows the generalization considering the implementation in physical systems. The adaptive fault detector model is implemented on a Jetson Nano system, which is a single-board computer (SBC) with a small graphic processing unit (GPU) intended to run machine learning loads at the edge. The proposed method is tested in a physical, real-life, low-voltage network located at Universidad del Norte, Colombia. This testing network is based on the IEEE 13-node test feeder scaled down to 220 V. The validation in a simulation environment shows the accuracy and dependability above 99.6%, while the real-time tests show the accuracy and dependability of 95.5% and 100%, respectively.

Nevertheless, more research is needed with cross-national samples concerning the differential effects of lifestyles on life satisfaction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to analyze the associations between the frequency of playing sports/exercise or playing electronic games on life satisfaction in a sample of 12-year-old children from nine countries from the European Union. The data used in this publication come from the third wave of the Children's Worlds project, an international survey of children's lives and well-being whose administration started in 2017. The sample was composed of 10,626 children (50.9% boys) from Estonia, Belgium, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Spain. They completed the Student Life Satisfaction Scale and answered two questions to assess the frequency of playing sport or exercise, and the frequency of playing electronic games. The results indicated notable scores in life satisfaction in all participating countries. The results showed some differences between boys and girls, and among the countries, in the frequency of sport practice and electronic games in the leisure time, as well as in the overall level of life satisfaction. The results also underlined that sport practice had a greater positive effect on life satisfaction than the use of electronic games. Thus, this study highlights the need to design programs to promote sport practice in leisure time for 12-year-old children in Europe, in order to protect their subjective well-being.","The data used in this publication come from the third wave of the Children’s Worlds project, an international survey of children’s lives and well-being (www.isciweb.org, accessed on 1 August 2022).

To achieve this, teachers must display high levels of socioemotional skills that ensure their own personal, social, and career well-being and, as a result, that of their students. This study seeks to gain an insight into the levels of socioemotional skills of emotional perception, emotional understanding, and emotional regulation and how these are linked to the sociodemographic and career profile of teachers in infant and primary education. For this, we surveyed 351 teachers-310 female and 41 male-aged between 20 and 69. We used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) together with a questionnaire (ad hoc) to determine the sociodemographic and career profile of participating teachers. Statistical analysis of the data showed that gender impacts on emotional regulation and emotional perception, while age and number of the children were also seen to have significant difference on emotional regulation and emotional perception. In contrast, professional qualifications were only seen to affect emotional perception. The variable reflecting the level at which staff teach showed significant difference on emotional perception and emotional understanding, while administrative posts held by teachers also demonstrated significant difference on their emotional understanding. The results confirm that sociodemographic and work-related variables impact the level of socioemotional skills of infant and primary education teachers. These aspects should be taken into account in the structure and planning of training aimed at developing socioemotional skills in order to ensure their success.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Carlos Salavera,Achievement; Adult; Aged; Child; Emotional Intelligence; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; School Teachers; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2022-08-11,2022,2022-08-11,,19,16,9882,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L; Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á; Martín-Antón, Luis J; Molinero-González, Paula","Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Martín-Antón, Luis J (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.); Molinero-González, Paula (Grupo de Investigación de Excelencia GIE-179, Departamento de Psicología, Facultad de Educación, Universidad de Valladolid, Paseo Belén N 1, 47011 Valladolid, Spain.)","Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid)","Arteaga-Cedeño, Wendy L (University of Valladolid); Carbonero-Martín, Miguel Á (University of Valladolid); Martín-Antón, Luis J (University of Valladolid); Molinero-González, Paula (University of Valladolid)",7,5,1.09,10.02,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/9882/pdf?version=1660197267,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150177667,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric property of the GDS-15 and a simplified version among a large representative longevous population in China.MethodsA total of 1624 individuals (786 oldest-old persons aged from 80 to 99 years; 838 centenarians aged 100+ years) participated in this study. Home interviews with structured questionnaires were conducted to collect sociodemographic data. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Chinese GDS-15 version. We implemented mixed methods for the psychometric evaluation of the GDS-15. Cronbach’s α coefficient and item-total correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the internal consistency. A standard expert consultation was conducted to test the content validity of each item. Multiple factor analyses were used to explore the optimal factor structure and measurement invariance.ResultsThe α coefficient of the GDS-15 was 0.745, while two items impaired the overall consistency reliability. Nineteen experts rated the applicability for each item and provided removal suggestion. Five items with less validity were removed, and a simplified 10-item GDS model with three-factor structure was proposed as an optimal solution. The GDS-10 model showed factorial equivalence across age, sex, residence, and education in multi-group confirmatory factor analyses.ConclusionsThe original GDS-15 has acceptable internal reliability, known-group validity, and concurrent validity among Chinese community-dwelling oldest-old and centenarians; however we provided preliminary evidence indicating that individual items related to somatic function or social activities may not be applicable for this population. The modified GDS-10 can be proposed as a potentially more practical and comprehensible instrument for depression screening.","We thank all the staff of the China Hainan Centenarian Cohort Study for their joint efforts and cooperation.

The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for predicting the trend of stock value based on the relationship between the fluctuation of Tobin's Q by sector as a trend index and the stock price variation of the Columbia stock market. To this end, a quantitative quasi-experimental survey will be conducted on shares traded by December 30, 2019. This is at least 90% of the time we have traded in the last 5 years. From the average Q value of the relevant economic sector, the value of each company's stock is adjusted to calculate the estimated price of the company's stock. If there is a disparity between the estimated value of the stock and the value at time t, you can forecast the stock price transition. If the computation yields a more significant result than what is now witnessed in the market, the next period's development will be positive; if it yields a lower result, its development will be negative. The results allow us to establish a significant influence of industry results on the performance of corporate Tobin's Q at the individual level. The significance level is greater than 50% in all cases, and profitability does not go below 30% in any sector, even reaching 100%.

In this work, we evaluated the effect of other non-viable L. rhamnosus strains and their peptidoglycans on the respiratory immune response and their impact on primary and secondary respiratory infections. In addition, the duration of the protective effect induced by NV1505 and PG1505 as well as their ability to protect against different Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes were evaluated. Our results showed that among the five selected L. rhamnosus strains (CRL1505, CRL498, CRL576, UCO25A and IBL027), NV1505 and NVIBL027 improved the protection against viral and pneumococcal infections by modulating the respiratory immune response. Of note, only the PG1505 presented immunomodulatory activities when compared with the other purified peptidoglycans. Studies on alveolar macrophages showed that NV1505 and PG1505 differentially modulated the expression of IL-6, IFN-γ, IFN-β, TNF-α, OAS1, RNAseL and IL-27 genes in response to RSV infection, and IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL10 and IL-27 in response to pneumococcal challenge. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NV1505 and PG1505 treatments protected mice against secondary pneumococcal pneumonia produced by different serotypes of S. pneumoniae until 30 days after stimulation with poly(I:C). This work advances the characterization of the protective effect of NV1505 and PG1505 by demonstrating that they increase resistance against the pneumococcal serotypes 3, 6B, 14 and 19F, with an effect that lasts up to 30 days after the primary viral inflammation. The results also confirm that the immunomodulatory properties of NV1505 and PG1505 are unique and are not shared by other members of this species, and suggest the existence of a capacity to stimulate trained immunity in alveolar macrophages.",,"This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (19H00965) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the research program on development of innovative technology grants (JPJ007097) from the Project of the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN), and by Japan Racing Association (JRA) Livestock Industry Promotion Project to Haruki Kitazawa.

Objective: The objective of this study was to relate nursing workloads to professional job satisfaction. Methods: This is an observational, analytical, descriptive, concurrent and quantitative study, which used the Overall Job Satisfaction scale and subscales therein, to identify global satisfaction-intrinsic or related to motivational factors and extrinsic or associated with hygienic factors-in nursing professionals (n = 104) from eight Inpatient Units of Internal Medicine and Surgery, in four hospital centers, to describe job satisfaction in the professionals studied and to find statistically significant associations between job satisfaction and workload (measured with the scale MIDENF®) in the inpatient units where they work. Results: There were higher levels of satisfaction in the variables ""relationship with immediate boss"" and ""relationship with fellow workers"", and lower levels in ""relationship with senior management"" and ""organizational system of the unit"". In the inferential analysis, the scores were 75.63 for overall satisfaction, 35.28 for intrinsic satisfaction, and 40.36 for extrinsic satisfaction.

Two of these styrylquinolines are new and were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. The chemopreventive potential of these compounds was evaluated against SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cells, its metastatic derivative SW620, and normal cells (HaCaT). According to the results, compounds 3a and 3d showed antiproliferative activity in SW480 and SW620 cells, but their effect seemed to be caused by different mechanisms of action. Compound 3a induced apoptosis independent of ROS production, as evidenced by increased levels of caspase 3, and had an immunomodulatory effect, positively regulating the production of different immunological markers in malignant cell lines. In contrast, compound 3d generated a pro-oxidant response and inhibited the growth of cancer cells, probably by another type of cell death other than apoptosis. Molecular docking studies indicated that the most active compound, 3a, could efficiently bind to the proapoptotic human caspases-3 protein, a result that could provide valuable information on the biochemical mechanism for the in vitro cytotoxic response of this compound in SW620 colon carcinoma cell lines. The obtained results suggest that these compounds have chemopreventive potential against CRC, but more studies should be carried out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of each of them in depth.","The authors thank Pontifical Bolivarian University, MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT, ICETEX, University of Antioquia, Corporation for Biological Research and the sustainability grant from the Research Committee (CODI) of the University of Antioquia for their support.","This work has been funded by MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT and ICETEX through the Program Ecosistema Científico Cod.

The teaching profession requires programmes that are geared towards emotional education that will enable teachers to develop emotional intelligence in order to foster their general well-being. The aims of this paper were: firstly, to test the effectiveness of the programme in emotional education implemented through group segmentation based on teachers' sociodemographic and work profile factors, and secondly, to ascertain whether there were any significant differences in the factors that make up the model of emotional intelligence with regard to the sociodemographic and work variables of teachers in the experimental group in a pre-post analysis study. The design of the research was experimental. The sample was made up of 351 infant and primary education teachers, 190 in the experimental group and 161 in the control group. We used the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 together with a questionnaire to define teachers' sociodemographic and work profiles. Implementing the emotional education programme led to significant differences in the three factors of emotional intelligence (perception, understanding and emotional regulation) depending on the sociodemographic and work profile of the teachers in the experimental group. Applying segmentation allows us to conclude that intervention programmes should be adapted to the sociodemographic and work profile of the participant group.

In relation to chemotherapy treatment, the most used drug is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); however, the use of this drug generates various toxic effects at the systemic level. For this reason, new therapeutic strategies are currently being sought that can be used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatments. Recent research has shown that natural compounds, such as genistein, have chemotherapeutic and anticancer effects, but the mechanisms of action of genistein and its molecular targets in human colon cells have not been fully elucidated. The results reported in relation to non-malignant cell lines are also unclear, which does not allow evidence of the selectivity that this compound may have. Therefore, in this work, genistein was evaluated in vitro in both cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 and in the non-malignant cell line HaCaT. The results obtained show that genistein has selectivity for the SW480 and SW620 cell lines. In addition, it inhibits cell viability and has an antiproliferative effect in a dose-dependent manner. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also found, suggesting an association with the cell death process through various mechanisms. Finally, the encapsulation strategy that was proposed made it possible to demonstrate that bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is capable of protecting genistein from the acidic conditions of gastric fluid and also allows the release of the compound in the colonic fluid. This would allow genistein to act locally in the mucosa of the colon where the first stages of CRC occur.","The authors thank Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, MINCIENCIAS, MINEDUCACIÓN, MINCIT, ICETEX and Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas for their support.","This research was funded by the Ministry of Sciences MINCIENCIAS, Ministry of Education MINEDUCATION, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism MINCIT and Colombian Institute of Educational Credit and Technical Studies Abroad ICETEX, through the Scientific Ecosystem component of the Colombia Científica Program (NanoBioCáncer alliance Cod FP44842-211-201-2018, project numbers 58478 and 58674).",Molecules,,Alejandro Baeza,"Humans; Genistein; Reactive Oxygen Species; Cell Line, Tumor; Fluorouracil; Colorectal Neoplasms; Apoptosis",2022-10-19,2022,2022-10-19,,27,20,7042,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rendón, Juan Pablo; Cañas, Ana Isabel; Correa, Elizabeth; Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa; Osorio, Marlon; Castro, Cristina; Naranjo, Tonny W","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Cañas, Ana Isabel (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Correa, Elizabeth (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.); Osorio, Marlon (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Castro, Cristina (School of Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Circular 1 # 70-01, Medellin 050031, Colombia.); Naranjo, Tonny W (Medical and Experimental Mycology Group, CIB-UPB-UdeA-UDES, Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas, Carrera 72 A # 78B-141, Medellin 050034, Colombia.; School of Health Sciences, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Calle 78 B # 72 A-109, Medellin 050034, Colombia.)","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Naranjo, Tonny W (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas; Pontifical Bolivarian University)","Rendón, Juan Pablo (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Cañas, Ana Isabel (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Correa, Elizabeth (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Bedoya-Betancur, Vanesa (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas); Osorio, Marlon (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Castro, Cristina (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Naranjo, Tonny W (Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas; Pontifical Bolivarian University)",12,12,1.82,3.15,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/20/7042/pdf?version=1666576725,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152069478,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

This systematic review updates information on the causative agents of VAP and resistance to antibiotics in COVID-19 patients. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed/MEDLINE, and LILACS databases from December 2019 to December 2021. Studies that described the frequency of causative pathogens associated with VAP and their antibiotic resistance patterns in critically ill COVID-19 adult patients were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used for critical appraisal. The data are presented according to the number or proportions reported in the studies. A total of 25 articles were included, involving 2766 VAP cases in COVID-19 patients (range 5-550 VAP cases). Most of the studies included were carried out in France (32%), Italy (20%), Spain (12%) and the United States (8%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequent causative pathogens of VAP (range of incidences in studies: P. aeruginosa 7.5-72.5%, K. pneumoniae 6.9-43.7%, E. cloacae 1.6-20% and A. baumannii 1.2-20%). S. aureus was the most frequent Gram-positive pathogen, with a range of incidence of 3.3-57.9%. The median incidence of Aspergillus spp. was 6.4%. Few studies have recorded susceptibility patterns among Gram-negative causative pathogens and have mainly reported extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC, and carbapenem resistance. The median frequency of methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolates was 44.4%. Our study provides the first comprehensive description of the causative agents and antibiotic resistance in COVID-19 patients with VAP. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens causing VAP. Data on antibiotic resistance patterns in the published medical literature are limited, as well as information about VAP from low- and middle-income countries.",,"CIBERINFEC (CB21/13/00009), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.

In conclusion, the territorialities and reterritorializations generated by former guerrilla members during the post-agreement period show processes of representation, redistribution, and recognition aimed at peace based on social justice; they also contribute to the restoration of social relations in areas historically affected by the war, as a pedagogical and political example for the region and the country.",,,Civitas - Revista de Ciências Sociais,,,,2022-11-30,2022,2022-11-30,,22,,e40977-e40977,All OA; Gold,Article,"Revelo, Diana Rico; Cruz, Beatriz Nates","Revelo, Diana Rico (Universidad del Norte (Uninorte), Barranquilla, Colombia); Cruz, Beatriz Nates (Universidad de Caldas (UCaldas), Manizales, Colombia)",,"Revelo, Diana Rico (Universidad del Norte); Cruz, Beatriz Nates (University of Caldas)",1,1,,0.66,https://doi.org/10.15448/1984-7289.2022.1.40977,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153255340,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The health-related quality of life in these patients is not systematically evaluated.
Objectives: The present study sought to describe the health-related quality of life and complications in children who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pediatric transplanted survivors. Health-related quality of life was measured using the KIDSCREEN-27 scale and Short Form-12 (SF-12) in patients between 8 and 14 years of age and those over 14 years, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 12 software. We used the Rasch model person parameter estimates translated into T-values to score the questionnaire.
Results: A total of 42 children answered the questionnaires. The most frequent adverse events were chronic graft Vs. host disease and endocrine complications. According to European norm data in the KIDSCREEN-12 scale, scores for the school dimension and social and peer support were below the 50th. percentile. The group administered immunosuppressants had lower scores on the physical component of the SF-12™ scale.
Conclusions: In general, the KIDSCREEN-27 does appear to suggest some quality-of-life deficit in younger children. The scales showed reliability in this population.",,Fundación Valle del Lili,Biomédica,,,Child; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,42,3,531-540,All OA; Gold,Article,"Medina-Valencia, Diego; Castillo-Martínez, Alejandro; Beltrán, Estefanía; Manzi, Eliana; Chantre-Mostacilla, Amparo; Guerrero-Fajardo, Gloria Piedad; Estacio, Mayra; Franco, Alexis A","Medina-Valencia, Diego (Departamento Materno-infantil, Unidad de Trasplante de Médula Ósea, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia. trasplantemedulaoseapediatrico@fvl.org.co.); Castillo-Martínez, Alejandro (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia; Departamento de Psiquiatría, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.); Beltrán, Estefanía (Centro de Investigaciones Clínicas, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.); Manzi, Eliana (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia; Centro de Investigaciones Clínicas, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.); Chantre-Mostacilla, Amparo (Departamento Materno-infantil, Unidad de Trasplante de Médula Ósea, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.); Guerrero-Fajardo, Gloria Piedad (Departamento Materno-infantil, Unidad de Trasplante de Médula Ósea, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.); Estacio, Mayra (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia; Centro de Investigaciones Clínicas, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.); Franco, Alexis A (Departamento Materno-infantil, Unidad de Trasplante de Médula Ósea, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia. biomedica@ins.gov.co.)",,"Medina-Valencia, Diego (Fundación Valle del Lili; Icesi University); Castillo-Martínez, Alejandro (Icesi University; Fundación Valle del Lili); Beltrán, Estefanía (Fundación Valle del Lili); Manzi, Eliana (Icesi University; Fundación Valle del Lili); Chantre-Mostacilla, Amparo (Fundación Valle del Lili); Guerrero-Fajardo, Gloria Piedad (Fundación Valle del Lili); Estacio, Mayra (Icesi University; Fundación Valle del Lili); Franco, Alexis A (Fundación Valle del Lili; Icesi University)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/6403/5094,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151145806,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

AIM: To determine the association between educational attainment and suspicion of cognitive imparirment in older Chilean population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 2,005 adults aged ≥ 60 years assessed during 2016-2017 Chilean National Health Survey were included. Education was self-reported and categorized as primary: ≤ 8 years; secondary: 9 to 12 years and beyond secondary: > 12 years. suspicion of cognitive imparirment was assessed with the Mini-Mental questionnaire.
RESULTS: Men and women with low education attainment had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (33% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 24; 41] and 27% [95% CI: 21; 33], respectively). Men who reported less schooling (≤ 8 years) were more likely to be at risk of suspicion of cognitive imparirment (Odds ratio (OR): 4.53 [95% CI: 1.10, 18.62]) compared to their peers. Women showed a substantially higher magnitude of association than men. The probability of suspicion of cognitive imparirment increased 9-times (OR: 9.96 [95% CI: 1.24; 79.6]) for 9-12 years and 18-times for ≤ 8 years of education (OR: 18.8 [95% CI: 2.42; 146.1]) compared to women with higher education.

Materials and methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive observational study of records of pregnant women between 35 and 41 years of age affiliated to the Cauca Indigenous Association Health Benefit Plan Management Organization-I (EAPB AIC-I) and registered in the prenatal care program, between 2016 and 2018. Duplicate records and records with incomplete information were excluded. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, as well as program outcomes, were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and their confidence intervals were calculated.
Results: In 1016 patients between 35 and 41 years of age, a frequency of 61.3 % of non-adherence to at least six prenatal visits was found. History of abortion (adjusted OR: 0.46; 95 % CI 0.33-0.64) and pregnancy of five or more (adjusted OR: 3,22; IC 95 % 1,50-6,91) were the associated factors.
Conclusions: Non-adherence to prenatal care by pregnant women of 35 years or more affiliated to the Cauca EAPB AIC-I is high. Further qualitative studies are needed to examine the cultural and social factors present in these communities that may affect adherence to prenatal monitoring, together with prospective studies to confirm the exploratory analysis of factors associated with non adherence.

Methods: Ethnographic data was obtained through the application of in-depth interviews centered on topics such as migration history, personal experience with COVID-19 and beliefs about the pandemic. This information was further analyzed through a narrative approach and Atlas Ti.
Main findings: US Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) have stranded thousands of individuals in the US-Mexico border region, a situation that has overcrowded the available shelters in the area and forced many of the immigrants to live on the streets and in improvised encampments. Thus, exposing them to a higher risk of contagion. Furthermore, the majority of the interviewed Central American and Caribbean immigrants consider that Mexico is more lenient when it comes to the enforcement of sanitary measures, especially when compared to their countries of origin. Finally, vaccination hesitancy was low among the interviewees, mainly due to the operative aspects of the vaccination effort in Mexico and the fear of ruining their chances to attain asylum in the US. These findings are backed up by the discovery of five recurring narratives among the interviewees regarding: (1) The pandemic's psychological impact. (2) The uncertainty of being stranded in Mexico and the long wait. (3) Their fear of violence over the fear of contagion. (4) The perceived leniency of Mexico with the pandemic when compared to their countries of origin, and (5) their beliefs about the pandemic and vaccines.
Key finding: The mental health of stranded Central American and Caribbean immigrants in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic is mostly affected by their inability to make it across the US-Mexico border using legal means.",We would like to acknowledge the role and guidance provided by our group of colleagues that participated in the aforementioned research project.,"Funding was provided by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), as part of a grant issued to the COVID-19's differential impact on the mental and emotional health of Indigenous Peoples and Newcomers: A socioeconomic analysis of Canada, US and Mexico project.",Frontiers in Public Health,,,Humans; Mental Health; COVID-19; Mexico; Cities; Pandemics; Emigrants and Immigrants,2022-11-09,2022,2022-11-09,,10,,982389,All OA; Gold,Article,"Piñeiro, Rodolfo Cruz; Ibarra, Carlos S.","Piñeiro, Rodolfo Cruz (Population Studies Department, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, Tijuana, Mexico); Ibarra, Carlos S.

This study examines the influence of the organisational context on the implementation of a psycho-educational programme and an academic levelling module at Colombian schools. Specifically, we evaluate the work design characteristics of teachers and their impact on the fidelity, effectiveness, and sustainability of the intervention. Information was collected from 102 teachers who acted as facilitators in the implementation of these interventions at a total of 72 schools in the city of Barranquilla. With a work design questionnaire, the characteristics of the task and working conditions of the teaching staff were analysed. To evaluate the implementation of the programme, indicators of fidelity, dose, frequency, and perceived effectiveness of the intervention were obtained. The results show that the autonomy and intrinsic characteristics of the task are positively related to the fidelity of the implementation. A certain influence of the working conditions of the teaching staff was also observed in the dose of the educational activities performed. Complementary to this, we describe the impact of confinement during the coronavirus pandemic on the implementation of programmes. Work design influences the process of implementing programmes in educational contexts. Both active hierarchical supervision and the motivational characteristics of teachers’ work affect the sustainability of interventions, especially in crisis circumstances. To conclude, we reflect on the organisational characteristics that facilitate the sustainability of the interventions.","This study was supported by the grant provided by the Andalusian Research Plan (PAIDI in Spanish) to the Research Group “Laboratory of Personal Networks and Communities” (2019/HUM-059).

Su importancia surge cuando se analizan las conductas de los seres humanos en el mbito de la interaccin social y se trata de comprender y dar significados a sus actos, guindonos para la interpretacin y comprensin de sus actuaciones en el marco de lo social. As conductas de tipo conflictivas, cooperativas y competitivas nos muestran diversos modos de comportamientos, pero tambin diversas formas a travs de los cuales las personas solucionan sus conflictos, los cuales finalmente derivan en la mayora de los casos, del sistema jurdico propio de cada pas, que se caracterizan por la intervencin o no, de terceros que actan como facilitadores o decisores del conflicto.

Abstract Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms demand an analysis of the relationship between conflict and the Law. Its importance arises when the behaviors of human beings in the field of social interaction are analyzed and the meaning of their actions discovered, guiding us to interpret and understand their actions within the social framework. Thus, behaviors of a conflictive, cooperative and competitive type show us not only different modes of behavior but also different ways through which people solve their conflicts, in accord and framed by the legal system of each country. Different conflict styles are characterized by the intervention or not of third parties who act as facilitators or decision makers of the conflict solving. This paper aims to analyze how the Law defines the conflict while at the same time regulates it, using data from my doctoral research. It analyzes legal developments differing from the judicial process but having the same legal effects in relation to the resolution of the conflict, and in countries like Colombia, they turn out to be forms of administration of justice, separated and different from the judicial process, operated by individuals who have the power to administer justice occasionally and temporarily. In this way, the State has the duty to guarantee, whenever there is a conflict, that the parties can access both ordinary justice but also alternative mechanisms to solve them. Hence, the Law performs one of its most important functions, promoting the resolution of conflicts.",,,Ius et Praxis,,,,2022-04,2022,2022-04,,28,1,236-253,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Jess Illera Santos, Mara","de Jess Illera Santos, Mara ()",,"de Jess Illera Santos, Mara ()",4,3,,4.71,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/iusetp/v28n1/0718-0012-iusetp-28-01-236.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147981882,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

We show that in this case, the nonlinear optics processes (absorption and scattering) along the optical path can be described using an analogy with the kinetic processes that occur in a chemical reaction. A key result is that it is possible to define an apparent equilibrium constant that regulates the competition of the photonic processes that take place, an idea conceptually similar to Einstein’s model for spontaneous emission and how it can be connected to induced emission in atoms and molecules but including an extension to nonlinear optical and relaxation processes. Our model can be generalized to describe a variety of phenomena in nano-photonics and plasmonic systems.","The authors (J.L.P., M.L.) are grateful to the UNMSM collaboration, Grant No. C21071281.

The characteristics of the pump-power dependence of the nonlinear signal are reproduced by a theoretical model based on the coupling between pump-probe, considering signal fields and propagation effects. The effect of the intramolecular coupling on the nonlinear intensity of the FWM signal is studied using a model molecule consisting of two-coupled harmonic curves of electronic energies with minima displaced in energy and nuclear positions. Two-vibrational states are considered while including non-adiabatic effects for the two-state model. Moreover, the coupling among the field components, as well as the propagation effects, are studied by considering a constant pump-intensity. Our calculation scheme, considering both the intramolecular coupling effects in the description of the molecular structure and the effects produced by the propagation of the FWM signal along the optical length, allows the exponential dependence of the latter, as the intensity of the pumping beam increases. Our treatments do not require the inclusion of other non-resonant processes outside the RWA approximation, due to the consideration of an adiabatic basis.","The authors (JLP, ML) are grateful to the UNMSM collaboration, grants C21071281.

These factors may be altered either positively or negatively as a result of an implementation experience of online learning. This risk is even more evident in scenarios such as the sanitary emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, when instructors suddenly had to adjust their learning environments into an online modality without enough time for preparation. This study aims at exploring how university faculty beliefs and their conceptions about en online teaching change after implementing a remote learning experience in the context of the sanitary emergency in a Colombian higher education institution. For this purpose, a pretest - posttest survey design was used to identify how instructors’ self-efficacy, their attitudes towards a reflective practice, their perceptions of institutional support, and their conceptions about online learning changed after completed the academic semester in remote modality; and the extent to which the instructors’ experience affects these changes. The results from this study suggest that the remote education experience increased the instructors’ self-efficacy and decreased their perceptions about institutional support.

There is a growing number of studies with multimodal approaches in the management of these patients, combining physical and behavioral therapies such as osteopathic manipulative treatment, associating pain education and clinical hypnosis. The aim of the present study will be to evaluate the effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) associated with pain neuroscience education (PNE) and clinical hypnosis (CH) on pain and disability in participants with CLBP compared to PNE, CH, and sham therapy.MethodsA randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in participants aged 20–60 years with CLBP who will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will receive PNE and CH associated with OMT, and G2 will receive PNE, CH, and sham therapy. In both groups, 4 interventions of a maximum of 50 min and with an interval of 7 days will be performed. As primary outcomes, pain (numerical pain scale), pressure pain threshold (pressure algometer), and disability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) will be evaluated and, as a secondary outcome, global impression of improvement (Percent of Improvement Scale), central sensitization (Central Sensitization Questionnaire), biopsychosocial aspects (Start Beck Toll Questionnaire), and behavior of the autonomic nervous system (heart rate variability) will be assessed. Participants will be evaluated in the pre-intervention moments, immediately after the end of the protocol and 4 weeks after the procedures. Randomization will be created through a simple randomized sequence and the evaluator will be blinded to the allocation of intervention groups.DiscussionThe guidelines have been encouraging multimodal, biopsychosocial approaches for patients with CLBP; in this sense, the results of this study can help clinicians and researchers in the implementation of a model of treatment strategy for these patients. In addition, patients may benefit from approaches with minimal risk of deleterious effects and low cost. In addition, it will enable the addition of relevant elements to the literature, with approaches that interact and do not segment the body and brain of patients with CLBP, allowing new studies in this scenario.Trials registrationDate: September 4, 2021/Number: NCT05042115.",Not applicable.,The authors own the funding.,Trials,,,"Humans; Low Back Pain; Manipulation, Osteopathic; Pain Measurement; Educational Status; Hypnosis; Chronic Pain; Treatment Outcome; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2022-12-30,2022,2022-12-30,,23,1,1066,All OA; Gold,Article,"Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana; da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França; Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges; de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi; Jassi, Fabrício José","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França (Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil; Post-doctoral Program of São Paulo State University (UNESP), Faculty of Science and Technology, Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); Jassi, Fabrício José (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)","Luchesi, Guilherme Luis Santana (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva, Anne Kastelianne França (Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil; São Paulo State University); Amaral, Otávio Henrique Borges (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); de Paula, Vanessa Cristina Godoi (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil); Jassi, Fabrício José (Postgraduate Program in Human Movement Sciences at the Health Sciences Center of the State University of the North of Paraná, Alameda Padre Magno, n° 841 - Nova Jacarezinho, 86400-000, Jacarezinho, Paraná, Brazil; Docusse Institute of Osteopathy and Manual Therapy (IDOT), Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil)",2,2,0.38,1.63,https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13063-022-07040-y,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154065333,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,4 Quality Education

Objective: To determine the characteristics and factors associated with mortality due to rare diseases in Chile from 2002 to 2017.
Materials and methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study based on secondary mortality database from the Departamento de Estadística e Información en Salud (DEIS), Ministerio de Salud de Chile (Department of Statistics and Health Information, Chile Ministry of Health) from 2002 to 2017. The specific mortality rates adjusted by age and sex were calculated. A normality analysis was conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In addition, a chi-square test of independence for associations and multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine the probability of death.
Results: Between 2008 and 2012 there were 10,718 deaths due to rare diseases, 53.2% of them occurred among women. The average annual mortality rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants: 4.1 in women and 3.8 in men. The main causes of mortality among women were Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, anencephaly and autoinmune hepatitis, and among men, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, muscular dystrophy and anencephaly. Women are 1.75 times more likely to die than men (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.69 - 1.82). The highest probability of dying occurred among children aged 0-4 years (aOR = 15.30; 95% CI: 14.10 - 19.20).
Conclusion: Overall, the burden of mortality due to rare disease was higher among women of all ages in Chile between 2002 and 2017.","Al Departamento de Estadística e Información en Salud del Ministerio de Salud de Chile, por proveer las bases de datos con cifras oficiales consolidadas sobre mortalidad para el periodo 2002 a 2017.",No se recibió financiación para la elaboración de este artículo.,Biomédica,,,Anencephaly; Child; Chile; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Rare Diseases,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,42,3,508-521,All OA; Gold,Article,"Avila, Jahir Andrés; Martínez, Julio César","Avila, Jahir Andrés (Hospital Base de Valdivia, Unidad de Diálisis, Valdivia los Ríos, Chile, Hospital Base de Valdivia, Unidad de Diálisis, Valdivia los Ríos, Chile); Martínez, Julio César (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia)","Avila, Jahir Andrés (Hospital Base)","Avila, Jahir Andrés (Hospital Base); Martínez, Julio César (Industrial University of Santander)",1,1,,0.59,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/6281/5095,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151145801,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

The ultimate objective of this research was to be able to implement actions to improve students' reading comprehension skills using the resources available. To achieve this objective, the results of the Saber 9 National tests for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 were examined. An ICT maturity level survey was also conducted in 10 schools from the sample and key qualitative criteria were identified and quantified. At the same time, the Meta­plan® technique was applied with 67 teachers in a school from the sample, to collect opinions on the domains and main causes that affect reading comprehension, and be able to cross these with the theory. The results of this analysis show that two factors are necessary to improve performance in reading comprehension: a) the explicit teaching of reading comprehension strategies, and b) the integration of ICT for learning.

La enfermedad de Chagas y la leishmaniasis tradicionalmente se han considerado zoonosis endémicas de áreas rurales del país. Sin embargo, la aparición de casos de estas enfermedades en áreas urbanas sugiere nuevos ciclos de circulación de estos parásitos. Por esta razón, se ha propuesto a los perros como centinelas de estos agentes zoonóticos, dado su rol como huéspedes accidentales o reservorios. Objetivo. Evaluar la circulación silenciosa de Leishmania spp. y Trypanosoma cruzi en perros de zonas urbanas de la ciudad de Sincelejo, Sucre. Materiales y métodos. Se analizaron 100 muestras de sangre de perros para amplificar la región ITS1 de Leishmania spp. Las muestras positivas se utilizaron para amplificar la región conservada del minicírculo del ADN del cinetoplasto de Leishmania infantum y para el análisis de polimorfismos de longitud de fragmentos de restricción con la endonucleasa HaeIII. Por otra parte, se amplificó un fragmento del ADN satelital de T. cruzi. Además, se evaluó la presencia de infecciones por Ehrlichia canis y Anaplasma platys, como potencialmente modificadoras de las manifestaciones clínicas. Resultados. De los 100 perros estudiados, se detectó: Leishmania spp. en 32, T. cruzi en 12, ambos parásitos en 7 y L. infantum en 18. Se encontraron infecciones por anaplasmatáceos en 18, y coinfecciones por bacterias y parásitos en 8 de los perros.

An inductive method was applied, which started from the question: Is it possible to market water, a human right, a non-renewable natural resource and good for public use in stock markets or does its nature of human right impose limitations? The hypothesis developed is, focusing on the analysis of the Colombian case, that it is not appropriate and it is contradictory to transform the access and disposal of water to a tradable commodity.

Flowers,"In the present study, we identified the Bacillus subtilis strain annotated Fa17.2 isolated from Bromelia flower inflorescences collected from the subtropical humid mesothermal region, Santo Domingo de Los Tsachilas Province, Ecuador. The probiotic capacity and antimicrobial potential against four foodborne pathogens were assessed. The cell culture of Fa17.2 is highly resistant to synthetic gastric acid (pH 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5), bile salts (0.3%), tolerating different sodium chloride concentrations (1, 3, and 5%), and growth conditions (15 °C and 45 °C), suggesting its potential probiotic features. The isolate showed no antibiotic resistance and was considered safe as no hemolysis was detected on sheep blood agar. The optimum medium for bacterial growth and the release of antimicrobial compounds was MRS with 10% glucose. The active components released in the neutralized crude extract (NCE) were insensitive to organic solvents, surfactants, and nonproteolytic enzymes and sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting their proteinaceous nature. The antimicrobial activity was enhanced by heat and maintained active over a wide range of pH (2.0-8.0). Moreover, the crude extract (CE) showed inhibitory activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The molecular weight of partially purified precipitated bacteriocin-like substances (BLISs) was about 14 kDa in 20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The CE obtained from Fa17.2 inhibits the growth of four foodborne pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Kosaconia cowanii, and Shigella dysenteriae, which implies its potential as an antimicrobial producer strain.",The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North for funding this research.,"This research was funded by Technical University of the North, Grant No. 2929/2019.",Microorganisms,,Sabina Fijan,,2022-04-21,2022,2022-04-21,,10,5,860,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tenea, Gabriela N; Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth; Moreno, Jose Luis","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Moreno, Jose Luis (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)","Tenea, Gabriela N (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Gonzalez, Gabriela Lizeth (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.); Moreno, Jose Luis (Biofood and Nutraceutics Research and Development Group, Faculty of Engineering in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Technical University of the North, Av. 17 de Julio s-21, Barrio El Olivo, Ibarra 100150, Ecuador.)",9,9,1.55,2.75,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/5/860/pdf?version=1650531949,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147347701,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 3107 Microbiology,

This study evaluates the antimicrobial potential of several combinations of peptide-protein extracts (PCs) consisting of peptide extracts from three native probiotic strains, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UTNGt2, Lactococcus lactis UTNGt28, and L. plantarum UTNGt21A, alone or in combination with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC1026 and Citrobacter freundii UTNB3Sm1. Based on the antimicrobial assay, among the 19 tested PCs, two (PC11 and PC17) produced a greater zone of inhibition against both pathogens in vitro. Time-killing assays indicated the rapid death of S. aureus after exposure to PC11 and PC17, while C. freundii was rapidly inhibited by PC11 and PC1 (UTNGt2 only), suggesting that the inhibitory action is pathogen and dose-dependent of a particular molecule present in the extract. A marginal inhibitory effect was observed when the peptides were combined with EDTA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the structural membrane damage of both target strains upon interaction with individual peptide extracts. Different degrees of cell deformation, condensed cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and ghost cell formation with visibly broken cell walls were observed in S. aureus. Likewise, the separation of the cytoplasmic membrane from the outer membrane, ghost cells, along with ovoid and deformed cells with undulated cell walls were observed for C. freundii. Furthermore, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed different wrinkled and deformed cells covered by debris. A leakage of aromatic molecules was detected for both pathogens, indicating that PCs disrupted the cell wall integrity, inducing cell death. Given their inhibitory action and capacity to induce damage of the cytoplasmic membrane, the selected PCs may serve to slow bacterial growth in vitro; further research is required to prove their efficiency ex vitro to battle against food poisoning and subsequent human infection.",The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North for funding this research.

A total of 21,906 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in UTNGt21A, while 17,610 were disclosed in the UTNGt2 genome. The comparative genomic analysis revealed a greater number of deletions, transversions, and transitions within the UTNGt21A genome, while a small difference in the number of insertions was detected between the strains. A divergent number of types of variant annotations were detected in both strains, and categorized in terms of low, moderate, and high modifier impact on the protein effectiveness. Although both native strains shared common specific genes involved in the stress response to the gastrointestinal environment, which may qualify as a putative probiotic (bile salt, acid, temperature, osmotic stress), they were different in their antimicrobial gene cluster organization, with UTNGt21A displaying a complex bacteriocin gene arrangement and dissimilar gene variants that might alter their defense mechanisms and overall inhibitory capacity. The genome comparison revealed 34 and 9 genomic islands (GIs) in the UTNGt21A and UTNGt2 genomes, respectively, with the overrepresentation of genes involved in defense mechanisms and carbohydrate utilization. In addition, pan-genome analysis disclosed the presence of various strain-specific genes (shell genes), suggesting a high genome variation between strains. This genome analysis illustrates that the bacteriocin signature and gene variants reflect a niche-inherent pattern. These extensive genomic datasets will guide us to understand the potential benefits of the native strains and their utility in the food or pharmaceutical sectors.","The author acknowledges the Technical University of the North, Centre of Research (CUICYT), for funding this work, and expresses their sincere gratitude to D.

In Colombia, online learning depends on academic and non-academic factors, and this dependence makes e-learning even more difficult. This paper aimed to study the students' viewpoint of Anatomy teaching at Universidad del Norte, Colombia, during the Covid-19 pandemic. One hundred sixteen students answered a questionnaire about their opinions on several topics related to online learning of Anatomy. The strongest correlation observed showed that the students agree that online anatomy classes make the subject more difficult to learn when compared to face-to-face lectures. Negative attitudes toward motivation, lack of personal contact with classmates, and complaints about being taught without laboratory sessions with cadavers were among the principal negative attitudes in students. After almost one year, motivation to participate in online classes went down; however, students improved their judgment about remote anatomy learning and their views about using authentic anatomy images during online sessions and substituting real anatomy images for apps. Anatomy sessions will have to adapt their learning tools to e-learning as time constraints allow, creating a new environment for students to participate, learn, and take advantage of this change.

This article analyses what has been the evolution of these fields of knowledge and practice in the Colombian context, from historical, disciplinary, professional and academic standpoints. For this, a documentary analysis has been carried out methodologically in the two areas of knowledge, with a historical and theoretical review of the disciplines in the country, as well as of the relevant national undergraduate and graduate programmes. This article concludes by establishing that social work has a longer historical trajectory in the country to provide social responses to complex problems and violence, with vocational professionalisation, scientific intervention and wide academic recognition in careers present in the country’s universities. In contrast, social pedagogy has had some attempts at being instituted into careers in the country and presents a great diversification of professions from popular or community education, and has struggled to become professionalised due to the prominence given to social work by public policy and education. Nonetheless, our analysis demonstrates that with the historical influence of critical pedagogies and recent global contributions, there is currently a significant upward trajectory of social pedagogy in Colombia, with two Master’s degrees existing since 2019 (which train educators and social workers in socio-educational action).",,,International Journal of Social Pedagogy,,,,2022-10-31,2022,2022-10-31,,11,1,10,All OA; Gold,Article,"del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José; Amashta, Giselle Paola Polo","del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José (Research Professor of Department of Theory of Education and Social Pedagogy, Faculty of Education, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), Madrid, Spain); Amashta, Giselle Paola Polo (Assistant Researcher, Universidad del Norte, Asociación Colombiana de Pedagogía Social y Educación Social (ASOCOPESES), Barranquilla, Colombia)","del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José (National University of Distance Education)","del Pozo Serrano, Francisco José (National University of Distance Education); Amashta, Giselle Paola Polo (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://uclpress.scienceopen.com/document_file/36d3159a-bbdf-4a41-ae62-fdddb0a312ce/ScienceOpen/IJSP-11-10.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152653184,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 44 Human Society; 4409 Social Work",4 Quality Education

In silico analysis has led to identifying a wide range of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and metabolic compounds. The genome had a total of 3,558,611 bp with GC of 43.96%, harboring 3,449 protein-coding genes, among which 3,209 were assigned by the EggNOG database, and 240 hypothetical proteins have no match in the BLASTN database. It also contains 68 tRNAs, 1 23S rRNA, 1 16S rRNA, 6 5S rRNA, and 1 tmRNA. In addition, no acquired resistance genes nor virulence and pathogenic factors were predicted, indicating that UTNGt21A is a safe strain. Three areas of interest (AOI) consisting of multiple genes encoding for bacteriocins and ABC transporters were predicted with BAGEL4, while eight secondary metabolite regions were predicted with the antiSMASH web tool. GutSMASH analysis predicted one metabolic gene cluster (MGC) type pyruvate to acetate-formate, a primary metabolite region essential for anaerobe growth. Several lanthipeptides and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) clusters were detected in the UTNGt21A but not the reference genomes, suggesting that their genome diversity might be linked to its niche-specific lineage and adaptation to a specific environment. Moreover, the application of a targeted genome mining tool (RiPPMiner) uncovered a diverse arsenal of important antimicrobial molecules such as lanthipeptides. Furthermore, in vitro analysis indicated that the crude extract (CE) of UTNGt21A exerted a wide spectrum of inhibition against several pathogens. The results indicated that the possible peptide-protein extract (PC) from UTNGt21A induces morphological and ultrastructural changes of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741, compatible with its inhibitory potential. Genome characterization is the basis for further in vitro and in vivo studies to explore their use as antimicrobial producers or probiotic strains.",We acknowledged Technical University of the North for funding this research and would like to express their sincere gratitude to D.

The new skills focus for university teaching grants a central role to critical thinking in new study plans; however, using these skills well requires a certain degree of conscientiousness and its regulation. Metacognition therefore plays a crucial role in developing critical thinking and consists of a person being aware of their own thinking processes in order to improve them for better knowledge acquisition. Critical thinking depends on these metacognitive mechanisms functioning well, being conscious of the processes, actions, and emotions in play, and thereby having the chance to understand what has not been done well and correcting it. Even when there is evidence of the relation between metacognitive processes and critical thinking, there are still few initiatives which seek to clarify which process determines which other one, or whether there is interdependence between both. What we present in this study is therefore an intervention proposal to develop critical thinking and meta knowledge skills. In this context, Problem-Based Learning is a useful tool to develop these skills in higher education. The ARDESOS-DIAPROVE program seeks to foment critical thinking via metacognition and Problem-Based Learning methodology. It is known that learning quality improves when students apply metacognition; it is also known that effective problem-solving depends not only on critical thinking, but also on the skill of realization, and of cognitive and non-cognitive regulation. The study presented hereinafter therefore has the fundamental objective of showing whether instruction in critical thinking (ARDESOS-DIAPROVE) influences students' metacognitive processes. One consequence of this is that critical thinking improves with the use of metacognition. The sample was comprised of first-year psychology students at Public University of the North of Spain who were undergoing the aforementioned program; PENCRISAL was used to evaluate critical thinking skills and the Metacognitive Activities Inventory (MAI) for evaluating metacognition. We expected an increase in critical thinking scores and metacognition following this intervention. As a conclusion, we indicate actions to incentivize metacognitive work among participants, both individually via reflective questions and decision diagrams, and at the interactional level with dialogues and reflective debates which strengthen critical thinking.",,This study was partly financed by the Project FONDECYT no. 11220056 ANID-Chile.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-06-15,2022,2022-06-15,,13,,913219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivas, Silvia F.; Saiz, Carlos; Ossa, Carlos","Rivas, Silvia F.

Relying on the theory of equalising differences, we uncover which workers perceive the highest utility from holding a formal job. Our research sheds light on how workers derive utility from formal and informal job sectors' benefits and to which extent informal workers are willing to accept a lower (or higher) wage to get a job in the formal sector. We also analyse the factors increasing the likelihood to seek employment in the formal sector. Results suggest that, on average, informal workers in the study region are willing to switch to a formal job only if they are offered a salary higher than their current income but are also willing to accept a salary slightly lower than the legal minimum wage in the formal sector.

The objective of this study was to determine the reasons that led the community of Libertad to rise in arms and repel the abuses of armed groups by testing two hypotheses: (1) the frequency of victimizing acts consisting of sexual violence against the women of the Libertad village provoked the community to take up arms; (2) the presence of social agents, here called provocateurs of the community response, motivated the community’s social cohesion and armed uprising. The research is developed using a qualitative methodology with a narrative approach that involved a sample of 49 informants, including two focus groups. We provide empirical findings which are pivotal to understanding the reasons why defenseless civilians made the decision to defend themselves with arms against illegal armed groups that invaded their territory and harassed their communities, especially when dealing with an ethnic minority such as Afro-descendants.",,"This research was funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia and the Universidad del Norte.

While the political dimension concerns the construction of socio-political relations, the interpersonal dimension focuses on intergroup relationships. Empirical evidence shows that reconciliation should not assign primacy to one dimension over another; rather, it should address the interaction between them. However, research on this topic is scarce. There is a need to develop an instrument to assess the political and interpersonal dimensions of reconciliation in peacebuilding contexts. This study developed the Political and Interpersonal Reconciliation Scale (PIRS) and assessed its psychometric properties based on a sample of Colombian population after the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group. The results show the validity of a factorial structure for two components as well as an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha. Concerning external validity, in line with the existing literature, the scale under study was positively related to confidence in the peace agreement, trust in the ex-combatants, willingness to share with the adversary and community identification. This study provides evidence that the Political and Interpersonal Reconciliation Scale is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating reconciliation in peacebuilding contexts.",,"This research was funded by the Fundación Universidad del Norte, grant number 2018-14.

1922,pub.1152550077,10.1109/access.2022.3220223,,,A Study on Control Strategies for Aggregated Community Energy Storage Systems in Medium Voltage Distribution Networks,"Community Energy Storage Systems (CESSs) emerge as an innovative way to integrate batteries into Low Voltage (LV) and Medium Voltage (MV) distribution networks to provide ancillary services and improve the quality of energy received by the end user. However, since CESSs are still emerging technologies, there is much research space in this field for proposing innovative and economic control algorithms for such devices. Thus, this paper presents a study of four control strategies applied to an MV distribution network, i.e., peak shaving, line losses control, line congestion reduction, and system voltage control, through an Aggregated Community Energy Storage System (ACESS), which is represented as the sum of multiple CESSs connected in LV systems, viewed from MV side. The proposed strategies are based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), a technique that, using the future demand forecast data, calculates the dispatch of ACESS. The results show, with respect to the base case, an improvement between 12.8% and 15.1% for the line losses control strategy, a reduction of 31.5% on the maximum demand for the peak shaving control strategy, a maximum lowering of 12% on the currents of some lines for the congestion control strategy, and an enhancement of 0.15% for the voltage control strategy. Moreover, for estimating the service lifetime of the ACESS after applying the control algorithms, the Rainflow Counting Algorithm (RCA) is used, exhibiting that, regardless of the control strategy, the degradation is inversely proportional to the storage capacity.",,This work was supported by Universidad del Norte through Internal Research Agendas Program.,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-11-07,2022-01-01,10,,119321-119332,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén; Restrepo, Mauricio; Arango-Manrique, Adriana","Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia)","Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Yepes-Fernéndez, Hernén (Universidad del Norte); Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)",5,5,,2.51,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09940955.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152550077,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The application of physically-based models is an effective method to predict landslide susceptibility, which is of great importance in hazard assessments and urban-planning studies. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare landslide susceptibility scenarios created with SHALSTAB and SINMAP at two large watersheds (Mogi and Perequê) in Cubatão, Latin America’s largest petrochemical site. Model calibration is based on the landslide scars inventory of the 1985 event, the geotechnical parameters derived from soil samples and the topography sourced from a 5 m resolution DEM. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis to assess model performance, SHALSTAB emerges as the best-fit model for both watersheds due to higher concentration of landslide scars in unstable areas (true positive results) and higher global accuracy. Even though SINMAP had similar degree of success, it was slightly less accurate and failed more often in the identification of potentially unstable areas. Comparative performance studies of physically-based models are fundamental to support effective and reliable hazard assessments in mountain regions, providing an outlook in how to proceed with more detailed studies.",,,Revista Brasileira de Geomorfologia,,,,2022-04-06,2022,2022-04-06,,23,2,1394-1419,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabral, Victor Carvalho; Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira; Mendoza, Carolina Martinez; Oliveira, Alan","Cabral, Victor Carvalho (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen / Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""); Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira (Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP); Mendoza, Carolina Martinez (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte); Oliveira, Alan (Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP)",,"Cabral, Victor Carvalho (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen / Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""); Reis, Fábio Augusto Gomes Vieira (São Paulo State University); Mendoza, Carolina Martinez (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte); Oliveira, Alan (São Paulo State University)",8,8,,5.39,https://rbgeomorfologia.org.br/rbg/article/download/2084/386386729,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146924817,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics,15 Life on Land

To improve reliability in rural areas, microgrids (MGs) are being integrated into conventional power systems. This study evaluates the effect on the reliability of rural distribution systems when MGs are introduced considering different penetration levels for renewable and nonrenewable distributed generation, and under rated power of energy storage. Here, we first formulate a reliability model for a rural distribution system with MGs. Based on this model, an interactive method using a sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed and applied to calculate different conventional reliability indices. We show that this approach facilitates the selection of the parameters of the different systems constituting the MGs in order to comply with a predefined reliability objective. For instance, by introducing only photovoltaic distributed generation systems to the rural distribution systems under study, achieving the reliability objective is next to impossible. However, when correctly dimensioned-hybrid MGs are introduced, such an objective is successfully achieved. In the future, our model and the results provided herein could be combined with technical and economic studies to obtain an optimal solution that meets a certain reliability objective.",,The work of Jose L.

Geographical codification techniques, like Geohash, can be used to protect individual locations altering the precision of the location so it represents wide area that contains the user’s location but does not give out the exact coordinate. However, this transformation creates some problems when a simple range-based query wants to be performed over coded data: neighbor points may have quite different representations if they fall in different quadrants. This problem, named lack of locality, has been solved by extending the search area of the query by projecting the user’s location in all adjacent grid cells and use the common prefix of the code to identify all the points in the adjacent cells, but the result set increases substantially, creating a problem for the user which needs to filter the useful results from the set returned by the extended query. In this work, the Hall of Mirrors, or HoM strategy is presented, which creates multiple representations of the points of interest in adjacent quadrants. This allows, not only the execution of the traditional common prefix query, but also distance-based queries from the user’s location, using the numerical code difference, which overcomes the locality problem by obtaining the relevant points of interest - PoI and reduces the number of total results. Four PoI projection techniques are introduced and compared to the Adaptive Hilbert-Geohash, or AHG technique and the regular geographic query. The results of the experiments performed on a dataset of 827 points of interests in Bogota, Colombia, show that, compared to regular common prefix queries, distance-based HoM generates from 29% up to 91% fewer irrelevant results in the best scenarios. In addition, results show that HoM techniques can find the relevant points faster than the AHG technique, due to the nature of the points projection and better distance correspondence.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-06-03,2022-01-01,10,,61769-61783,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wightman, Pedro; Zurbaran, Mayra; Salazar, Augusto; Garcia, Lorena","Wightman, Pedro (School of Engineering, Science and Technology, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, 111711, Colombia); Zurbaran, Mayra (Seidor, 21027, Ispra, Italy); Salazar, Augusto (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Garcia, Lorena (School of Engineering and Basic Sciences, Universidad Central, Bogotá, 110311, Colombia)","Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Rosario)","Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Rosario); Zurbaran, Mayra (Seidor, 21027, Ispra, Italy); Salazar, Augusto (Universidad del Norte); Garcia, Lorena (Central University)",0,0,,0.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09787498.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148415381,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Results: The main findings indicate that all the elements of strategic thinking were found in the organizations under study, while only two were present in industrial restructuring. In addition, this research found that there is a positive bidirectional relationship between strategic thinking and industrial restructuring. Discussion: Although the study showed that all the elements of strategic thinking and industrial restructuring were present, one of the elements of strategic thinking had no correlation with the elements of industrial restructuring. Conclusions: The resulting model showed that four out of five elements of strategic thinking have a direct and bidirectional correlation with the three elements of productive restructuring, which means that taking strategic measures based on any of these four elements will affect the elements of industrial restructuring, and vice versa.",,,Desarrollo Gerencial,,,,2022-04-08,2022,2022-04-08,,14,1,1-20,All OA; Gold,Article,"González-Mendoza, Julio Alfonso; Sánchez-Molina, Jorge; Cárdenas-García, Maribel","González-Mendoza, Julio Alfonso (Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia); Sánchez-Molina, Jorge (Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia); Cárdenas-García, Maribel (Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia)",,"González-Mendoza, Julio Alfonso (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Sánchez-Molina, Jorge (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Cárdenas-García, Maribel (Francisco de Paula Santander University)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.17081/dege.14.1.4995,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148129161,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Method: An empirical and correlational case study was carried out with 76 students enrolled for the 2019-2020 period at the University of Cadiz (Universidad de Cádiz) (Spain), to whom a structured questionnaire was given online. Results and Discussions: This study found that most respondents have a higher level of personal happiness as students; they consider that their personal happiness influences their academic performance, and they believe that upon completion of their degree program they will be able to get a job in the business world. However, this study found that students who pursue the degree due to a personal calling are happier than those who choose this field of study as a second option. Conclusions: It is inferred that the greater the personal happiness, the greater the happiness as a management student, which confirms to the directors of the corresponding universities how important it is to contribute more decisively to the overall well-being of their students.

Infrared-transparent membrane films emerged as a viable alternative to improve hybrid radiant cooling by preventing moisture condensation. This case study assesses the potential of membrane-assisted radiant cooling in a rural school building in Santa Lucia, Atlántico (Colombia), a location with a hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year. The study evaluates different cooling strategies, including natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, hybrid radiant cooling, and membrane-assisted radiant cooling using EnergyPlus® software. Results for a radiant surface temperature of 4 °C below the dew point show that membrane-assisted radiant cooling could reduce annual discomfort hours by 3–6% compared to conventional radiant cooling. Further experimental and modeling studies should focus on the lowest achievable temperature below the dew point without condensation. Our results suggest that radiant cooling with infrared-transparent membranes is a potentially cost-effective alternative for improving thermal comfort in rural school buildings in hot and humid climates.","The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte and Minciencias through Convocatoria Doctorados Nacionales 727 of Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento para la Ciencia, la Tecnología e Innovación FCTeI, by Sistema General de Regalías SGR for supporting this research.",,International Journal of Thermofluids,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,16,,100214,All OA; Gold,Article,"Albuja, Rafael; Foliaco, Blanca; Bula, Antonio; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo","Albuja, Rafael (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Foliaco, Blanca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Bula, Antonio (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia)","Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)","Albuja, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Foliaco, Blanca (Universidad del Norte); Bula, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte)",7,7,,7.15,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijft.2022.100214,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151034805,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture,

Individuals with ULEDs require assistive robots to fulfill all their activities of daily living (ADLs). Thus, this research presents an objective function for base placement optimization of assistive robots to increase the workspace required to fulfill ADLs (workspace coverage). The workspace coverage was determined using the xArm 6 robot and experimenting with different ADLs. Also, an object collision algorithm is implemented to avoid collisions between the robot and the user within the workspace. Moreover, the algorithm determines the existence of singularities within the workspace by computing the manipulability index. However, since the manipulability index computation depends on the Jacobian matrix’s eigenvalues yielding incongruences in the units, we divided the Jacobian matrix into two parts; one for the angular and another for the linear velocity. Finally, using the objective function with a genetic algorithm (GA), the optimal base placement for the robot is obtained and validated experimentally.","The contents of this research do not necessarily represent the policy of NIDILRR, ACL, or HHS, and they should not assume endorsement by the Federal Government.","This work was supported in part by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) under Grant 90DPGE0018-01-00; and in part by the NIDILRR Center within the Administration for Community Living (ACL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).",IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-12-23,2022-01-01,10,,134536-134548,All OA; Gold,Article,"De, Javier Dario Sanjuan; Sunny, Samiul Haque; Montenegro, Elias Jose Muñoz; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Rahman, Mohammad H.","De, Javier Dario Sanjuan (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Sunny, Samiul Haque (Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Montenegro, Elias Jose Muñoz (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Ahmed, Helal Uddin (Biorobotics Laboratory, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, 53212, USA); Rahman, Mohammad H.

It is one of the most frequent overgrowth syndromes. Macrocephaly and tall stature are typical characteristics of these children. It is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance (broad and prominent forehead with a dolichocephalic shape, sparse frontotemporal hair, among others), learning disabilities, and body overgrowth. Treatment is aimed at promoting neurological development. Clinical case: we present the case of a preschooler who, in the infant stage, showed an increased head circumference and poor progress in neurodevelopment, with dolichocephaly, bulging forehead, narrow fissures, hypoplastic spine, nostrils pointing upwards, intact palate, posteriorly rotated pinnae, and significant lumbar kyphosis. The molecular test identified a heterozygous variant, missense type: c.5165G>C; p.Cys1722Ser in the NSD1 gene. The patient receives multidisciplinary support with progress in neurodevelopment. Conclusion: Despite its worldwide distribution, Sotos syndrome may not be reported. In addition to its characteristic clinical picture, molecular genetic testing is highly recommended for diagnosis.",,,Pediatría,,,,2022-07-16,2022,2022-07-16,,55,1,46-49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meza, Yulys Carolina Redondo; Garcia, Teresa Josefina Lopez; Toro, John Carlos Molina; Gonzalez, Gisel Gordillo","Meza, Yulys Carolina Redondo (Pediatra – universidad del norte – CEO mundo pediátrico CTG - miembro sociedad colombiana de pediatría, Cartagena, Colombia); Garcia, Teresa Josefina Lopez (Residente de III año universidad del Sinú - seccional Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Toro, John Carlos Molina (Pediatra universidad del Sinú – seccional Cartagena - miembro sociedad colombiana de pediatría, Cartagena, Colombia); Gonzalez, Gisel Gordillo (Genetista - miembro asociación colombiana de médicos genetistas - profesora universidad cooperativa de Colombia, barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Meza, Yulys Carolina Redondo (Pediatra – universidad del norte – CEO mundo pediátrico CTG - miembro sociedad colombiana de pediatría, Cartagena, Colombia); Garcia, Teresa Josefina Lopez (Universidad del Sinú); Toro, John Carlos Molina (Universidad del Sinú); Gonzalez, Gisel Gordillo (Genetista - miembro asociación colombiana de médicos genetistas - profesora universidad cooperativa de Colombia, barranquilla, Colombia)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistapediatria.emnuvens.com.br/rp/article/download/278/210,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158173437,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

By studying rocks used for stone tools and other everyday artifacts, we explore the volcanic landscapes of early hunter-gatherer groups (11,500–9,500 cal BP) of the highlands of the Atacama Desert (22–24°S/67–68°W). Petrological classification of the lithic assemblages of three Early Holocene archaeological sites showed the procurement of a great diversity of volcanic and subvolcanic rocks, including pumice, granitic rocks, micro-diorites, a large variety of tuffs and andesites, dacites, cherts, basalts, obsidians, among others. Field surveys enabled us to detect many of their sources related to volcanic features such as craters, maars, caldera-domes, lava flows, probable hydrothermal deposits, and ignimbrites. In these places, we also document large quarry-workshops and campsites from different periods, indicating intense and repeated human occupation over time. By comparing the artifacts with geological samples collected in the field, it was possible to assign the source of origin of a large part of the archaeological assemblages. Our data suggest that the volcanic features of the Atacama highlands were integrated into the mobility and interaction networks of ancient hunter-gatherer groups at an early date.","First of all, we would like to acknowledge that this research was conducted on the traditional lands of the Lickanantay People.

It has been detected in different water sources, including drinking water, which could be generating potential damage to human health. In the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, intensive rice cultivation is predominant, and as it grows in flooded areas, the use of herbicides has greater contact with water bodies, which are used as sources of supply. Based on this, the concentration of glyphosate was quantified in five sampling points of surface and drinking water of the Pamplonita and Zulia rivers, using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, establishing that the concentration found in drinking water (216 and 204.5 µg/L) was below the maximum allowable limits of countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia and above those of the European Union and the United Kingdom. Once the occurrence was identified, the removal capacity of glyphosate was evaluated using membrane technology through reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) in a pilot plant, for which response surface optimization models were implemented, and 100% removals were obtained, with repeatability close to 1% with respect to other reported investigations, highlighting that the NF process was more efficient even though the molecular weight of glyphosate was below the limit of the membrane. In contrast, it was determined that, according to the concentrations found in the drinking water supplied to the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, this has a low risk according to the guidelines for drinking water quality in Canada and a moderate risk according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The conventional systems currently used for water purification are insufficient to remove traces of contaminants such as herbicides. Therefore, it is necessary to implement new technologies.",,"The authors would like to give special thanks to Minciencias and Universidad del Norte for their support to the research from which this work was derived, by means of the funding granted through Call No. 753 for the Department of Norte de Santander.

We investigate the role of morphodynamic changes in the flooding of a micro-tidal dissipative beach for both current and sea level rise scenarios. By considering beach morphodynamics and flood processes associated with highly energetic waves, the study allows one to evaluate threats to coastal zones. Coupling of SWAN and XBeach models is employed to propagate offshore wave conditions to the swash zone, estimating morphological changes and flooding associated with wave conditions during cold fronts and hurricanes that affected Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). The numerical models were calibrated from previous research in the study area. The results indicate that numerical modeling of flooding on microtidal dissipative beaches under extreme wave conditions should be approached by considering beach morphodynamics, because ignoring them can underestimate flooding by ∼ 15 %. Moreover, model results suggest that beach erosion and flooding are intensified by sea level rise, resulting in the most unfavorable condition when extreme events are contemporaneous with high tides. In this case, the increase in erosion and flooding is ∼ 69 % and ∼ 65 %, respectively, when compared with the present conditions of sea level.","We thank the Colombian Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and Innovation – Minciencias for partially funding the study.

1753,pub.1147056218,10.1063/5.0089325,,,Predicting new potential antimalarial compounds by using Zagreb topological indices,"Molecular topology allows describing molecular structures following a two-dimensional approach by taking into account how the atoms are arranged internally through a connection matrix between the atoms that are part of a structure. Various molecular indices (unique for each molecule) can be determined, such as Zagreb, Balaban, and topological indices. These indices have been correlated with physical chemistry properties such as molecular weight, boiling point, and electron density. Furthermore, their relationship with a specific biological activity has been found in other reports. Therefore, its knowledge and interpretation could be critical in the rational design of new compounds, saving time and money in their development process. In this research, the molecular graph of antimalarials already in the pharmaceutical market, such as chloroquine, primaquine, quinine, and artemisinin, was calculated and used to compute the Zagreb indices; a relationship between these indices and the antimalarial activities was found. According to the results reported in this work, the smaller the Zagreb indices, the higher the antimalarial activity. This relationship works very well for other compounds series. Therefore, it seems to be a fundamental structural requirement for this activity. Three triazole-modified structures are proposed as possible potential antimalarials based on this hypothesis. Finally, this work shows that the Zagreb indices could be a cornerstone in designing and synthesizing new antimalarial compounds, albeit they must be proved experimentally.",The authors acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Universidad del Norte (Internal Project No. 2019-017) as well as supporting the open access invoice.,,AIP Advances,,,,2022-04-01,2022,2022-04-13,2022-04-01,12,4,045017,All OA; Gold,Article,"Brito, Daniel; Marquez, Edgar; Rosas, Felix; Rosas, Ennis","Brito, Daniel (Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad de Oriente, Núcleo de Sucre, Cumana, Venezuela); Marquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química y Biología, Departamento de Química y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Rosas, Felix (Laboratorio de Fisicoquímica Orgánica, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas, Caracas, Venezuela); Rosas, Ennis (Departamento de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Brito, Daniel (Universidad de Oriente); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte); Rosas, Felix (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas); Rosas, Ennis (University of the Coast)",4,4,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0089325,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147056218,40 Engineering; 51 Physical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

ABE is equivalent to the number of strong acids, other than lactate, which are present in the plasma in abnormal concentrations, negative ABE being associated with higher mortality in sepsis. Hemoperfusion (HPF) is an extracorporeal procedure that involves the passage of blood through an adsorption cartridge, where solutes are removed by direct binding to the sorbent material. Then, it was decided to explore the influence of HPF on negative ABE value in sepsis. Materials and methods: Basal values of ABE, standard base excess (SBE), and lactate (mean, standard deviation [SD]) were obtained. The difference between these parameter values before and after four sessions of HPF (HA330) (delta value) was evaluated. Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon test were applied. Results: From 32 patients (age: 57±13) suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 who were treated with HPF in the critical care unit of Clinica de la Mujer, Bogotá (Colombia), 6 patients presented with metabolic acidosis with negative ABE value (‒2.7±1) with negative SBE (‒4.7±1) and high lactate serum value (2±0.7 mmol/L). Delta ABE, SBE, and lactate were: 7.7 (p = 0.005), 6.1 (p = 0.003), and 1.6 (p = NS), respectively. Thus, negative ABE was significantly reversed by HPF, since SBE value turned positive without significant change in lactate. Conclusion: Negative alactic parameter was significantly reversed by HPF in septic patients. It is necessary to carry out evaluations in larger groups to estimate their impact on clinical outcomes.",,,Giornale di Clinica Nefrologica e Dialisi,,,,2022-12-19,2022,2022-12-19,,34,,122-124,All OA; Gold,Article,"Musso, Carlos Guido; Cordoba, Juan P.; Aroca-Marinez, Gustavo; Terrasa, Sergio; Barriga-Moreno, Adriana P.; Lozano-Sanchez, Marcela; Barón-Alvarez, Rafael A.; Gonzalez-Torres, Henry; Cantos, Joaquin; Huespe, Iván","Musso, Carlos Guido (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolivar, Barranquilla - Colombia and Research Department, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires - Argentina); Cordoba, Juan P.

1748,pub.1146169669,10.3390/app12062807,,,Design and Validation of a Low-Cost Structural Health Monitoring System for Dynamic Characterization of Structures,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is essential to identifying problems that may cause human and material losses produced by disastrous and unexpected structural failures. The dynamic characterization of civil structures adopting SHM systems provides, at a particular moment, accurate information about the current structural response. When considering a proper SHM strategy and affordable economic investment for the maintenance required by structures, it is possible to safeguard the original structural parameters and avoid potential failures. However, traditional SHM systems are not desirable due to the large economic investments involved and demand for exhausting fieldwork. This research presents the design, implementation, and validation of a low-cost SHM system composed of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and a base station in order to identify dynamic properties from the measured structural response. A set of small- and full-scale experimental tests were conducted to validate the WSN system using a wired traditional SHM system. Vibration data recorded through the low-cost SHM system were processed and compared to determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping properties of different structures by computing modal identification techniques, frequency analysis, and logarithmic decrement. The obtained dynamic characterization results from small- and full-scale experimental testing conclude that the low-cost SHM system can reliably identify the dynamic properties of the tested structures. This proposal provides an inexpensive, functional, and innovative alternative for SHM regarding traditional monitoring systems.",The authors would like to thank Universidad del Norte for providing the National Instrument data acquisition system and PCB Piezotronics accelerometers for the instrumentation of large-scale civil structures.,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2022-03-09,2022,2022-03-09,,12,6,2807,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caballero-Russi, David; Ortiz, Albert R.; Guzmán, Andrés; Canchila, Carlos","Caballero-Russi, David (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA); Ortiz, Albert R.

The transition also caused faculty to reevaluate their professional development (PD). This qualitative exploratory study focused on the pd experienced by a group of foreign language university instructors in Colombia during this crisis. Specifically it identified the challenges encountered and how these were tackled. Data were collected through an open-ended survey and analyzed using content analysis. Results show ten main challenges, which were then categorized into three themes: (a) adaptation to emergency remote teaching, (b) promotion of student engagement, and (c) handling of emotions. Conclusions reveal that professors embraced the crisis with a positive attitude, engaging in different PD opportunities, displaying agency, responsibility, and flexibility. Therefore, the challenges and their reaction to them fostered their PD and learning.

The viability of two native LAB (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UTNGt2 and Lactiplantibacillus pentosus UTNGt5) was assessed in comparison with two references (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC11474 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM17938) strains in supplemented CSMFs throughout storage with refrigeration. The optimum conditions to produce novel beverages supplemented with native LAB were pH 6.6, 42°C, and 1 h of fermentation. Moreover, the effect of LAB strains fortification on pH, titratable acidity, total solids (°Brix), total polyphenolic compounds (TPC), antioxidant capacity (AOX), and ascorbic acid content (AAC), total proteins and fat, at initial and final storage was evaluated. The addition of two native LAB strains did alter the physicochemical quality of CSMFs to a lesser extent, where the bioactive molecules improved significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase of cocoa concentration and depending on the supplied strain. Although a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in cell counts was recorded during storage, the LAB cells were found to be viable up to 21 days of storage at 4°C (>6 logCFU/ml), which is sufficient in number to prove their stability in vitro. Overall organoleptic results suggested that LAB supplementation had a significant impact on sensory attributes with satisfactory acceptability (>78%) of PBs containing the native strains and 1-2% cocoa, while CSMFs counterparts were less appreciated (40%) as perceived off-flavor. It appears that supplying bacteria to CSMF preserves flavor in the final product. Furthermore, the final beverages were free of harmful bacteria; thus, they comply with consumer safety regulations. This study concludes that CSMF can be used as a carrier of native LAB strains, maintaining cell viability, unaltered physicochemical properties, and improved functional and sensory characteristics, for which final beverages can be regarded as functional food. From the application standpoint, these formulations are an alternative to delivering native LAB strains and could help the cocoa and dairy industry to develop more attractive products for the growing regional market.","The authors acknowledge Ing.

In this interface problem, different sets of Maxwell equations must be solved both in the obstacle and outside it, while the tangential components of both electric and magnetic fields are continuous across the interface. We describe an asymptotic procedure, applied for large conductivity, which reflects the skin effect in metals. The key to our method is a special integral equation procedure for the exterior boundary value problems corresponding to perfect conductors. The asymptotic procedure leads to a great reduction in complexity for the numerical solution, since it involves solving only the exterior boundary value problems. Furthermore, we introduce a FEM/BEM coupling procedure for the transmission problem and consider the implementation of Galerkin’s elements for the perfect conductor problem, and present numerical experiments.","This research was supported in part by the ALECOL-DAAD Program and COLCIENCIAS through contract number CT 793-2013, and code 1215-569-33876.

Plenty of risk and new causative genes for COPD have been identified in patients of the Chinese Han population. In contrast, we know considerably little concerning the genetics in the Kashi COPD population (Uyghur). This study aims at clarifying the genetic maps regarding COPD susceptibility in Kashi (China). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to analyze three Uyghur families with COPD in Kashi (eight patients and one healthy control). Sanger sequencing was also used to verify the WES results in 541 unrelated Uyghur COPD patients and 534 Uyghur healthy controls. WES showed 72 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), two deletions, and small insertions (InDels), 26 copy number variants (CNVs), and 34 structural variants (SVs), including g.71230620T > A (rs12449210T > A, NC_000,016.10) in the HYDIN axonemal central pair apparatus protein (HYDIN) gene and g.61190482A > G (rs777591A > G, NC_000002.12) in the ubiquitin-specific protease 34 (USP34) gene.

In 50% of children the first febrile seizure occurs at 2 years and in 90% before 3 years, anemia is also a frequent pathology in pediatric patients, in fact, the figures of the World Health Organization (WHO), point out that iron deficiency anemia attacks children under five years of age, occurring worldwide around 799 million, an average, in the last 10 years, of 42%. And in Latin America, the figure is 23%. Iron deficiency anemia can predispose to the development of febrile seizures because iron plays a crucial role in the transport of oxygen to all tissues, its deficiency also produces a dysfunction of myelination, tyrosine, and tryptophan synthesis hydroxylase, which are necessary for the release of neurotransmitters, therefore, if said neurotransmitters are not released, the brain synapse can be altered and lead to a seizure.

The most widely accepted theoretical and measurement model in personality study is the Big Five Personality Test, designed to measure five traits: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness. One of the most commonly used instruments for evaluating personality in children and adolescents is the BFQ-C. However, its applicability may be limited by its length. The short version of the test has shown stability across different cultures but there is no empirical evidence on its psychometric properties to enable it to be used in the Latin American context. Objective. This study seeks to validate the short version of the Big Five Questionnaire for Children (BFQ-C) in the Colombian population. Method. The questionnaire was administered to 844 adolescents (55% boys and 45% girls) aged between 11 and 16 (M = 13.55 and SD = 2.30). Seven possible models were obtained from a series of exploratory and confirmatory analyses to explain the factorial structure of the test, which were compared with each other to find the model with the best statistical fit. Results. The model with the best absolute fit coincided with the five-factor proposal of the scale, for which empirical evidence is provided for the universality of the Big Five model. The factors showed adequate levels of reliability. Discussion and conclusion. The short version of the BFQ-C has good psychometric properties in adolescents and constitutes a useful instrument for measuring personality in the Latin American context.

There are several forecasting models for forecasting time series data, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, which has been considered the most-used regression model in time series prediction for the last four decades, although the ARIMA model cannot estimate non-linear regression behavior caused by high volatility in the time series. In addition, the support vector regression (SVR) model is a pioneering machine learning approach for solving nonlinear regression estimation procedures. For this reason, this paper proposes using a hybrid model benefiting from ARIMA and support vector regression (SVR) models to forecast daily and cumulative returns of selected Colombian companies. For testing purposes, close prices of Bancolombia, Ecopetrol, Tecnoglass, and Grupo Aval were used; these are relevant Colombian organizations quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).",,L.R. is supported by Universidad del Norte.

One of the most used indices to evaluate the drought is the standardized precipitation index (SPI) due to its practicality and evaluation in a variety of time scales, however, this uses precipitation as the only variable, depending on the deviations in the precipitation values. This is important when evaluating the SPI, because in some ecosystems close to the equatorial zone, there are very warm periods with low rainfall, in which a large proportion of the data collected by the meteorological stations corresponds to zero. In this research, the SPI was calculated in the Pechelín basin located in Colombia, in which there is zero precipitation in a large proportion of the data, registering zero precipitation in the month of January and February in 67% and 70% respectively. As a result, the SPI values increased to “wet” ranges, only when the amount of data with zero precipitation exceeded half of the total data; this means that the SPI determines wrong values when it is calculated with zero-precipitation data in large proportions. Based on this finding, this study aims to modify the index by typing the distribution (using a correction factor K), finally correcting the SPI values, this correction was called SPI-C. The results indicate that the SPI-C improved the identification of drought, obtaining corresponding values that better represent the high frequency of zero precipitation existing in the study area.","The first author is grateful to the Universidad del Norte, Colombia for allowing me to study for a PhD in Engineering.

The literature shows that postpartum hemorrhage is a strong conditioner of death and, therefore, has become the second cause of maternal death in Brazil considering the studies by Lima (2019). Moreover, postpartum hemorrhage is understood as any type of bleeding with a lost blood volume greater than 500 ml after vaginal deliveries and 100 after cesarean deliveries. Still on the subject, trauma of the vaginal canal, as well as placental retention or coagulation problems are considered the main conditioning factors. In this sense, the present study aimed to analyze the main practices of prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage considering the current literature. We opted for integrative literature review, considering the main original studies published between 2019 and 2022, as well as from the descriptors postpartum hemorrhage, prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage and women's health. Of the 60 papers found, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were used for analysis. The results showed that the management and selection of technique varies according to the patient's situation and that use of medication, management of the umbilical cord; uterine massage are the most recurrent.

La muestra para supervisados fue compuesta por 26 estudiantes, seleccionados de tipo censal (Otzen & Manterola, 2017), siendo 17 hombres y nueve mujeres, que constituyeron el 100% de la población de cuarto año de una Universidad del Norte de Chile; y para supervisores la muestra estuvo compuesta por 11 docentes, siendo siete hombres y cuatro mujeres. Cada cuestionario contó con 11 preguntas para determinar los componentes que afectan la relación teórica-práctica en la FID. Se validó por análisis confirmatorio y la fiabilidad se determinó por consistencia interna. Como resultado se obtuvo que los instrumentos son válidos, confiables y sirven para valorar los factores que inciden en la supervisión de prácticas.

Abstract. In Chile and Latin America, until this moment doesn’t exist a questionnaire that could be used for showing the level of knowledge about the theoretical-practical relationship that is produced by the supervisión within the initial teacher training, for its main actors, like supervisors and supervisees. That instrument will give information to the Universities and they will take decisions about the factors that most affect the process inside the FID. The objective of this study is to validate two questionnaires that measure the influencing factors on the supervision of pedagogical practices, checking reliability and developing normative values for each category. The sample for supervisees was composed of 26 students, selected by census type (Otzen & Manterola, 2017), being 17 men and nine women, they constituted the 100% of student population of four year of one university in the north of Chile and for supervisors the sample was made of 11 teachers, being seven men and four women. Each questionnaire had 11 questions to determine the components that affect the theoretical-practical relationship in the initial teacher training. It was validated by the confirmatory analysis and reliability was determined by internal consistency. As a result it was obtained that the instruments developed are valid and reliable and it helps to value the factors influencing supervision of pedagogical practices. Besides, the proposed rules could help the professionals of the educational system to assess the supervision of practices in similar populations.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors associated with mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in young people in northern Chile. The sample consisted of 1315 young people between the ages of 14 and 18. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were performed to identify the risk factors associated to the considered symptomatology. Depressive symptomatology was reported at 36.3%, anxiety at 6%, and social phobia at 27.8%. Adolescent females reported a higher probability of presenting depressive (OR, 3.409), anxious (OR, 3.949), and social phobia (OR, 3.027) symptomatology. Young women between the ages of 17 and 18 were more likely to present anxiety (OR, 2.172); moreover, being a migrant was related to lower odds of presenting anxiety (OR, 0.259) and depression (OR, 0.662). Having a family member diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with depressive symptomatology (OR, 1.369). The COVID-19 pandemic can have serious repercussions on the mental health of adolescents. It is important to generate interventions to meet the needs of youth during the post-confinement period.","The authors would like to thank the Children and Youth Observatory team and the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness of the Regional Government of Antofagasta, Chile.","This work was supported by the Children and Youth Observatory of the Universidad Católica del Norte de Antofagasta, Chile (Tel.: +56-(55)-235-5825) and the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness of the Regional Government of Antofagasta, Chile.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,,,2022-12-29,2022,2022-12-29,,12,1,269,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo; Portilla-Saavedra, Diego; Castillo-Morales, Katherin; Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo; Pastén, Sandra Sandoval","Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Portilla-Saavedra, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile; Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Castillo-Morales, Katherin (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Pastén, Sandra Sandoval (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile)","Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Portilla-Saavedra, Diego (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Santo Tomás); Castillo-Morales, Katherin (Universidad Santo Tomás); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Catholic University of the North); Pastén, Sandra Sandoval (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,0.48,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/1/269/pdf?version=1672307031,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154105572,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Therefore, the objective was to determine the relationship of the severity of climacteric symptomatology with depression and sexual function in women.
Materials and methods: It was a descriptive, cross-sectional study, with a sample of 60 women between 40 and 65 years old. The Female Sexual Function Questionnaire-2, the Menopause Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory were used.
Results: The mean age of the women was 49.1 ±5.6 years. 21.7% of the women had severe depression, 28.3% moderate, and 50% mild/minimal. Changes in sleep habits (1.73 ±0.88) and in appetite (1.63 ±0.73) were the most severe manifestations. Difficulty sleeping (1.05 ±0.99), physical and mental fatigue (1.48 ±0.98), and vaginal sequelae (1.45 ±1.26) were the most serious complaints in the somatic, psychological, and urogenital domains, respectively. 60% presented severe sexual dysfunction regarding genital pain and 55% in vaginal penetration. Communicating sexual preferences to the partner was common in 75% of women. 88.3% had frequent sexual activity, but 63.3% had zero or low sexual satisfaction.
Conclusions: Climacteric symptomatology is related to depression but not to women's sexual function.",The study was approved by a research Ethics Committee.,,Menopausal Review,,,,2022-09-28,2022,2022-09-28,2022,21,3,165-169,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lińan-Bermudez, Alexandra; Chafloque-Chavesta, Jhony; Pastuso, Pamela Leon; Pinedo, Kiaraliz Huambachano; Barja-Ore, John","Lińan-Bermudez, Alexandra (Academic Department, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); Chafloque-Chavesta, Jhony (Academic Department, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); Pastuso, Pamela Leon (Academic Department, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); Pinedo, Kiaraliz Huambachano (Academic Department, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú); Barja-Ore, John (Academic Department, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú)","Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North)","Lińan-Bermudez, Alexandra (National University of San Marcos); Chafloque-Chavesta, Jhony (National University of San Marcos); Pastuso, Pamela Leon (National University of San Marcos); Pinedo, Kiaraliz Huambachano (Private University of the North); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North)",1,1,0.42,0.69,https://www.termedia.pl/Journal/-4/pdf-47886-10?filename=Severity of climacteric.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151474140,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The previuos is a sign of the different cultures that García Márquez (Gabo) lived with. Since Gabo was a child or in his childhood, he experienced a bicultural (colombian and Wayuu) vision where the supernatural, the mythological and the ordinary life were part of his existence. Among these, the Wayuu culture stands out, an indigenous influence that deeply marks the writer's work, because, just as García Márquez feels close to the language of the “Guajiros”, some of his characters seek to communicate only in the Wayuu's mother tongue: Wayuunaiki. In this sense, this article establishes five categories to analyze the symbolic role of bones, life in death, the prediction of the future, the clairvoyance of the dream world and the role of some characters as shamans in that specific social group. These elements of the Wayuu’s culture, which are found explicitly and implicitly in One Hundred Years of Solitude, constituting a great dialogic fabric or unit, in which two cultures of the Colombian Caribbean intersect ways of living and thinking; and the characters do not fully fit into neither the common indigenous canon nor the Western ones.",,,Jangwa Pana,,,,2022-05-19,2022,2022-05-19,,21,2,123-131,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gómez, Cindy Juliana García; Bohórquez, María Isabel Salazar","Gómez, Cindy Juliana García (Universidad Industrial de Santander); Bohórquez, María Isabel Salazar (Universidad Industrial de Santander)",,"Gómez, Cindy Juliana García (Industrial University of Santander); Bohórquez, María Isabel Salazar (Industrial University of Santander)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.unimagdalena.edu.co/index.php/jangwapana/article/download/4632/3502,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152202387,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

In this sense, the Colombian Constitutional Court carried out an exceptional, automatic, and unique review of five legislative acts (AL) that were issued to legally implement what was politically agreed. This article analyzes Sentence C-076/2018 with which the constitutional review of AL 05 of 2017 was made, this review being issued for the implementation of the AFP. Since AL 05 of 2017 amended Article 22 of the Constitution including an express prohibition for the creation, financing, and support for groups of armed civilians with illegal purposes, a question is raised: Is it possible to forbid the forbidden? Methodologically, we display the tensions between the derived constituent and the Court and the application of the constitutional substitution judgment. We conclude that the Court's review was particular not only because of the exceptional nature of the rules, but also because it issued a symbolic sentence.

The aim of this study was to revalidate the scale of basic psychological needs (S-PNTS) in order to recognize whether it is sufficiently adequate to apply and obtain results with guaranteed success in trainee teachers and to study the inference of socio-demographic and personal variables in frustration and psychological needs. A quantitative methodology has been used following a survey method with a non-experimental design, applied to a sample of 598 university students of the degrees of Teacher in Early Childhood Education and Primary Education, and of the Master’s Degree in Teacher Training in Compulsory Secondary Education of two Spanish universities (one in the north and one in the south) and of equivalent degrees in a Chilean university, with an age range between 18 and 54 years old. The programs used were SPSS.24, Factor.10, MPlus.7 and G*Power 3. After carrying out the factor analyses, the result was that the scale was configured with one less item than the original one but maintaining the three-dimensional scale. The results also reveal that trainee teachers in Primary Education show a greater approximation to frustration than those in Early Childhood and Secondary Education. On the other hand, students from the south of Spain feel less competent, more autonomous and perceive a better relationship in the teaching environment than the rest.

Designated as black fungus for public health services in India, where reported data reflects an increase of more than eighty times the expected increase for Rhizopus among the communities. The disease has become even more worrisome due to the high mortality already established as an opportunistic infection, coupled with the reserved prognosis for all those infected and hospitalised by the SARS-CoV-2 severity criteria. This patient, who was submitted to corticosteroid therapy, in an excessive dose, therefore immunosuppressive, developed a severe, disseminated clinical form. It was verified the progression of the lesions and thus the high risk of trans- surgical lethality, or, also, by the insufficiency of conduct in removing the lesions to their satisfaction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental, in vitro, longitudinal, analytical, and prospective study was carried out. Subsequently, the following groups were formed: Streptococcus mutans vs Vitis® Sensible. S. mutans vs Sensodyne® Repair and Protect. Also, S. mutans vs Colgate® Sensitive Pro-ReliefTM and S. mutans vs Colgate Total 12® at 100, 50, 25, and 12.5%. Each Petri dish was properly labeled with the letter corresponding to the toothpaste and was placed in the incubator for 24 hours at 37°C. A 0.12% chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control and distilled water as a negative control. The manuscript was written following the checklist for reporting in vitro studies (CRIS) guidelines.
RESULTS: It was found that when comparing the inhibition halos of the desensitizing toothpaste against S. mutans, Colgate® Sensitive Pro-ReliefTM 100% paste had the highest efficacy at 24 and 48 hours with an average of 25.2 ± 1.0 and 23.5 ± 1.1 mm, respectively. On the other way, Sensodyne paste had no efficacy at any of its concentrations 100, 50, 25, and 12.5%. Finally, it was found that there were statistically significant differences between each of the groups evaluated with a p < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that mainly the 100% pure concentrations of the desensitizing pastes had antibacterial efficacy against S. mutans. However, Sensodyne® Repair and Protect paste had no effect.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This research has clinical relevance because the use of desensitizing pastes is highly frequent. Therefore, it is necessary to know if these pastes offer an efficient antibacterial effect to control the main microorganisms of the oral cavity.",,,The Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice,,,Streptococcus mutans; Toothpastes; Dentifrices; Prospective Studies; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Sodium Fluoride,2022-11-10,2022,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,23,7,669-673,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romo, Mariela; Mendoza, Roman; Mauricio, Franco; Chiong, Lucy; Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo; Barja-Ore, John; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank","Romo, Mariela (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Mendoza, Roman (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Mauricio, Franco (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Chiong, Lucy (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru.); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (Department of Academic, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru.); Barja-Ore, John (Research Directorate, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru.); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Department of Postgraduate, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Peru, Phone: +51 1214-2500, e-mail: fmaytat@cientifica.edu.pe.)",,"Romo, Mariela (Federico Villarreal National University); Mendoza, Roman (Federico Villarreal National University); Mauricio, Franco (Federico Villarreal National University); Chiong, Lucy (Federico Villarreal National University); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Scientific University of the South)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3375,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152665275,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

This work focuses on an industrial-scale rotary kiln for Ferronickel production via the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) process. Rotary kilns are prone to mechanical failure exacerbated by thermal effects, mainly during transient operation, such as preheating and cooling. However, few studies have tackled the impact of the transient operation on the stress state in the rotary kiln wall. Therefore, we evaluate the thermal and mechanical behavior of the rotary kiln wall during preheating. Actual operation data and a thermal model enable to obtain the temperature distribution along the kiln length. This temperature distribution is the starting point for calculating the stress state of the shell and refractory. The maximal thermal gradient occurs at 10 m from the hot end, with temperatures at the outer and inner surfaces of 200 °C and 820 °C, respectively. The von Mises stress shows a maximum of 121 MPa at the wheel position in the hot region of the refractory and a range of 30–60 MPa in the shell. In addition, the compressive stress is higher than the ultimate compressive strength of the refractory. However, it does not necessarily represent refractory detachment due to the plastic deformation undergone by the refractory under high temperatures. This work paves the way towards developing a tool for accurately predicting rotary kiln mechanical failure, which can help optimize operating conditions and assist in programming maintenance.",The research leading to these results has received funding from MINCIENCIAS under the project “Incremento en la Capacidad Operativa y Eficiencia de Producción de CERRO MATOSO S.A&quot; with contract number 4684-786-66497.,,Results in Engineering,,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,14,,100396,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillin-Estrada, Wilson D.; Albuja, Rafael; Dávila, Ivan B.; Rueda, Bernardo S.; Corredor, Lesme; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Maury, Heriberto","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson D.

We generated a de novo genome assembly of the Psidium guajava, the super fruit ""apple of the tropics"", and successfully transferred 14,268 SNP probesets from Eucalyptus to Psidium at the nucleotide level, to detect genomic loci linked to resistance to the root knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne enterolobii derived from the wild relative P. guineense. Significantly associated loci with resistance across alternative analytical frameworks, were detected at two SNPs on chromosome 3 in a pseudo-assembly of Psidium guajava genome built using a syntenic path approach with the Eucalyptus grandis genome to determine the order and orientation of the contigs. The P. guineense-derived resistance response to RKN and disease onset is conceivably triggered by mineral nutrients and phytohormone homeostasis or signaling with the involvement of the miRNA pathway. Hotspots of mapped resistance quantitative trait loci and functional annotation in the same genomic region of Eucalyptus provide further indirect support to our results, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of genomes across genera of Myrtaceae in the adaptation to pathogens. Marker assisted introgression of the resistance loci mapped should accelerate the development of improved guava cultivars and hybrid rootstocks.","We would like to thank Dr. Alexandre Pio Viana, from the State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro for providing leaf tissue of the P. guajava selfed S2 plant UENFGO8.1–10 used to generate the de novo P. guajava genome assembly.

Yet, scaling bioproducts and bioenergy to industrial practice requires further investigation, especially for environmental impact minimization and improved process safety. This work assesses two alternatives for valorizing cassava residues via acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Two ABE fermentation routes are assessed. In Route 1, pretreatment and purification involve dilute-acid pretreatment and multi-effect distillation and decantation operations, while Route 2 includes steam explosion and reactive distillation. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Waste Reduction Algorithm (WAR) were applied to assess ABE fermentation. Simulation results indicate butanol yields of 0.10–0.12 kg/kg feedstock and net energy ratio (NER) <1. Route 2 shows the highest total output of Potential Environmental Impacts (PEI) with 5.56 PEI/kg butanol. Both ABE fermentation routes obtained Fire and Explosion Damage Index (FEDI) values above 300 for acetone and ethanol recovery/purification stages. Both routes are classified as “hazardous” considering the flammability of handled substances, and their relative safety performance is remarkably similar. These results pave the way toward deploying both routes for adding value to the cassava residues in North Colombia by applying safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly transformation technologies.",The authors thank the University of Cartagena for providing the financial support to conduct this research.

Although the inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have been utilized as potent anti-cancer agents, their efficacy in clinical trials varied among patient groups and has often been unpredictable. Such outcome cannot be interpreted solely by the inability to keep PARP-driven DNA repair in check. The focus of studies on PARP-driven tumorigenesis have recently been shifted toward PARP-dependent regulation of transcription. Here we utilized the controlled overexpression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a sole pADPr-degrading enzyme, to investigate pADPr-dependent gene regulation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. We demonstrated that PARG upregulation reduces pADPr levels and inhibits the expression of genes in key tumor-promoted pathways, including TNFα/NF-kB, IL6/STAT3, MYC, and KRAS signaling, the genes involved in inflammation response, especially chemokines, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition. The observed effect of PARG on transcription was consistent across all tested prostate cancer cell lines and correlates with PARG-induced reduction of clonogenic potential of PC-3 cells in vitro and a significant growth inhibition of PC-3-derived tumors in nude mice in vivo.","We thank Dr. Diane Darland for valuable comments on the paper, and our colleagues in the University of the North Dakota Department of Biomedical Sciences for stimulating discussions.

For instance, some may be susceptible to a 51% attack, also known as a majority attack, which may suppose a high risk to the trustworthiness of the blockchains. Although this attack is theoretically possible, executing it in practice is often regarded as arduous because of the premise that, with sufficiently active members, it is not ’straightforward’ to have much computing power. Since it represents a possible vulnerability, the community has made efforts to solve this and other blockchain problems, which has resulted in the birth of alternative consensus protocols, e.g., the proof of accuracy protocol. This paper presents a detailed proposal of a proof-of-accuracy protocol. It aims to democratize the miners’ participation within a blockchain, control the miners’ computing power, and mitigate the majority attacks.",,This work was carried out with the support of the program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017-Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017” and the Universidad del Norte.,Mathematics,,,,2022-07-19,2022,2022-07-19,,10,14,2504,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, faponte@uninorte.edu.co; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja 150003, Colombia); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, faponte@uninorte.edu.co)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)",4,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/14/2504/pdf?version=1658215810,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149617599,49 Mathematical Sciences,

Traditionally, this assessment was entrusted to peers with a recognized track record, eligibility and prestige. However, bibliometric indicators have been used for several years to eliminate subjectivity, which aim at a measurable, objective and multi-dimensional qualification (1,3).  Bibliometric indicators (BI) can be defined as quantifiers of the bibliographic information available in scientific and academic documents susceptible to being analyzed in terms of production and consumption (1,2). There is a typological variety of BI (1,2) based on the object to be examined (researcher, journal or research group) and, in some cases, they are cross-sectional to it. In this way, personal indicators (age, gender and background of the authors) only apply to researchers or groups, while productivity and impact also apply to journals. For journals, the productivity (quantity) and, more so, impact (“quality”) indicators, are routinely used to classify journals and compare them, with the increasingly controversial purpose of measuring their academic and/or social pertinence and relevance (4).",,,Medunab,,,,2022-05-10,2022,2022-05-10,,25,1,5-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero; Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara","Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero (Universidad del Magdalena); Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara (Universidad del Magdalena)",,"Wilches-Visbal, Jorge Homero (University of Magdalena); Castillo-Pedraza, Midian Clara (University of Magdalena)",3,3,,4.19,https://revistas.unab.edu.co/index.php/medunab/article/download/4363/3582,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147976578,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

In this context, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following the infection and vaccination campaign. Using a three-stage stratified sampling, we performed a population-based cross-sectional serosurvey based on a representative sample of three Chilean cities. Selected participants were blood-sampled on-site and answered a short COVID-19 and vaccination history questionnaire using Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA to determine seroprevalence. We recruited 2198 individuals aged 7-93 between 5 October and 25 November 2021; 2132 individuals received COVID-19 vaccinations (97%), 67 (3.1%) received one dose, 2065 (93.9%) received two doses, and 936 received the booster jab (42.6%). Antibody seroprevalence reached 97.3%, ranging from 40.9% among those not vaccinated to 99.8% in those with booster doses (OR = 674.6, 154.8-2938.5).

Among the journals with the highest production, the majority was from the United States and the United Kingdom, and the Journal of Dental Research has the highest impact (14.9 citations per publication) and the most publications (31). In addition, the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (FWCI: 8.24) and Krois Joachim (FWCI: 10.09) from Germany were the institution and author with the highest expected performance relative to the world average, respectively. The United States is the country with the highest number of published papers.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is an increasing tendency to increase the scientific production on artificial intelligence in the field of dentistry, with a preference for publication in prestigious scientific journals of high impact. Most of the productive authors and institutions were from Japan. There is a need to promote and consolidate strategies to develop collaborative research both nationally and internationally.",The authors wish to thank the Universidad Científica del Sur for its constant support in the preparation of this scientific paper.,Source of support: Nil Conflict of interest: None,The Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice,,,Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dentistry; United States,2022-11-29,2022,2022-11-29,2022-11-29,23,8,761-767,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velasquez, Ricardo; Barja-Ore, John; Salazar-Salvatierra, Emma; Gutiérrez-Ilave, Margot; Mauricio-Vilchez, Cesar; Mendoza, Roman; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank","Velasquez, Ricardo (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Barja-Ore, John (Research Direction, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Salazar-Salvatierra, Emma (School of Obstetrics, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Gutiérrez-Ilave, Margot (Academic Department of Preventive and Social Stomatology, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Mauricio-Vilchez, Cesar (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Mendoza, Roman (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Unidad de Revisiones Sistemáticas y Metaanálisis, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru)","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)","Velasquez, Ricardo (Federico Villarreal National University); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Salazar-Salvatierra, Emma (National University of San Marcos); Gutiérrez-Ilave, Margot (National University of San Marcos); Mauricio-Vilchez, Cesar (Federico Villarreal National University); Mendoza, Roman (Federico Villarreal National University); Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)",2,2,,1.82,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3386,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153226860,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

1551,pub.1140667727,10.1016/j.aej.2021.08.036,,,Improving the rotary kiln-electric furnace process for ferronickel production: Data analytics-based assessment of dust insufflation into the rotary kiln flame,"Ferronickel contains 60–80 wt% Fe and 40–20 wt% Ni and is a feedstock for manufacturing stainless steel and other ferrous alloys. The primary pyrometallurgical route to produce ferronickel from laterite nickel ores is the Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) process. In the RKEF process, minerals undergo calcination and partial reduction in a rotary kiln. Large amounts of mineral dust leave the kiln entrained in flue gases. Dust insufflation is a potential solution in which dust particles enter directly into the burner flame. The aim is that the insufflated dust softens, agglomerates, and finally joins the minerals stream that goes into the electric furnace. We applied data analytics techniques to a 1-year operation database to assess the operation before and after dust insufflation in an industrial rotary kiln furnace. Bootstrapping revealed statistically significant differences in the operation with and without dust insufflation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering were used as exploratory techniques. PCA showed subsets of variables that significantly influence the dataset variance, and k-means allowed distinguishing operation conditions for dust insufflation with encouraging results for the calcine-to-fresh mineral and the natural gas-to-calcine ratios. These results pave the way towards successfully implementing dust insufflation in the RKEF process.",The research leading to these results has received funding from MINCIENCIAS under the project “Incremento en la Capacidad Operativa y Eficiencia de Producción de CERRO MATOSO S.A” with contract number 4684-786-66497.,,Alexandria Engineering Journal,,,,2022-04,2022,,2022-04,61,4,3215-3228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romero, Johanna M.; Pardo, Yuleisy S.; Parra, Maricel; De J.

However, relevant discussion in the field indicates that ILTE configurations are grounded on conceptual frameworks that fail to represent the complex nature of teacher preparation.Gap in knowledge and Purpose of the study: In this systematic review we explore whether recent conceptual ILTE understandings are acknowledged in current research as this information is relevant for stakeholders in education.Method: For this reason, this systematic review aims at analysing what teacher education components are addressed in such research in nationally ranked academic journals from 2014 to 2019 and how those components were researched.Findings and value added: Findings indicate areas related to student teachers’ learning are still at the forefront in ILTE. Additionally, that area is still inquired from a disjoint and discreet perspective.

Esta mutación predispone al desarrollo de tumores benignos y malignos que afectan diferentes órganos, a causa de una ausencia de la inhibición de la vía de la tumorigénesis mediada por el factor inducible por hipoxia. La prevalencia de esta enfermedad es de 2 a 3 por 100.000 personas y las neoplasias se localizan con mayor frecuencia en retina, sistema nervioso central, cabeza y cuello, páncreas, riñón, glándula suprarrenal y órgano reproductor. Se clasifica en 2 tipos dependiendo de la presencia o ausencia de feocromocitoma. El feocromocitoma y las neoplasias pancreáticas constituyen las manifestaciones endocrinas más frecuentes. El feocromocitoma se presenta entre el 10-30% de los casos. Puede cursar desde una entidad asintomática hasta una sintomatología variable que incluye la triada clásica de cefalea, palpitaciones y diaforesis. El diagnostico se realiza mediante pruebas bioquímicas que confirman niveles elevados de catecolaminas y estudios imagenológicos. Las lesiones pancreáticas son con frecuencia asintomáticas y se detectan de forma incidental en estudios de imagen realizados en los pacientes con VHL. Aunque las características clínicas y bioquímicas de estas neoplasias no son patognomónicas, pueden ser útiles para sugerir la enfermedad VHL como la etiología subyacente.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2022-12-05,2022,2022-12-05,2022-12-05,38,03,875-890,All OA; Gold,Article,"Román González, Alejandro; Padilla Zambrano, Huber Said; Builes Barrera, Carlos","Román González, Alejandro (); Padilla Zambrano, Huber Said (); Builes Barrera, Carlos ()",,"Román González, Alejandro (); Padilla Zambrano, Huber Said (); Builes Barrera, Carlos ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/13248/214421446260/214421464566,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153380370,,

Algunas bacterias pueden sobrevivir a esta terapia; entre las comúnmente detectadas en fallas endodónticas se encuentra el E. faecalis. Los cementos biocerámicos se presentan como una alternativa eficiente en la terapia de endodoncia debido a su capacidad de sellado y sus propiedades antimicrobianas. Métodos: Estudio experimental in vitro, en el que se sembró la bacteria (E. faecalis) en una caja de Petri, se tomaron de 5 a 10 cepas y se disolvieron en caldo de Mueller Hinton, para luego depositar el inóculo más el cemento en diferentes concentraciones en una placa de 96 pozos y medir el nivel de absorbancia de cada muestra en un espectrofotómetro. Para el análisis estadístico se utilizaron las pruebas no paramétricas de Mann-Whitney y Kruskal Wallis. Resultados: Al comparar de dos en dos los datos obtenidos no se obtuvieron datos esta-dísticamente significativos, pero al comparar las diferentes concentraciones de ambos cementos se obtuvo que el cemento de Grossman al 2 % tiene mayor efecto antimicrobiano.

La revisión sistemática tiene como objetivo describir el impacto de los cuidados esenciales del neonato en la transmisión posnatal del SARS-CoV-2. Métodos: Se realizó una revisión sistemática en bases de datos electrónicas, se incluyeron estudios observacionales, serie de casos y reporte de casos. Dos investigadores de forma independiente evaluaron los criterios de inclusión, la calidad metodológica y la extracción de datos. Resultados: Se tamizaron 208 estudios para una inclusión final de 9 artículos relevantes. El reporte de transmisión del virus SARS-CoV-2 está centrado en la posibilidad de transferencia por la leche materna y ausencia de información acerca de la transmisión por otros cuidados esenciales, sin embargo, se observa un bajo uso en la práctica clínica de los cuidados esenciales del recién nacido hijo de madre con COVID- 19. Conclusiones: La información es limitada sobre la posible transmisión del SARS-CoV-2 a través de los cuidados esenciales del recién nacido, sin embargo, la pandemia ha impactado de forma importante los mismos.

Clinical  conditions like depression, cognitive alterations, anxiety, distress, fear of cancer, sleep di-sorders, and fatigue may persist in cancer survivors. Therefore, psychological interventions are an essential treatment for breast cancer.  Objective: To identify psychological interventions and psychological outcomes for women with breast cancer.   Methods: Five databases were searched: EMBASE, ScienceDirect, MEDLINE (Ovid), CENTRAL(Ovid) y PsycINFO (APAPsyNET), from Jan 2014 to Jun 4th, 2018. Two authors reviewed all title articles and abstracts in databases and selected potentially eligible studies. A narrati-ve synthesis of results was used due to the heterogeneity in randomized controlled trials, population characteristics, psychotherapies applied, outcomes, and timing of assessments.   Results: This overview included 14 randomized controlled trials which comprise 1914 par-ticipants (included non-metastatic and metastatic), across 21 articles. The most common psychological  interventions  were  cognitive-behavioral  based.  The  principal  psychological  outcomes assessed were depression, quality of life, fatigue, and anxiety.   Conclusion: Results from this review are useful to clarify an overview of intervention in psychological morbidities in breast cancer.

Colombia se ubica como uno de los países en el que anualmente se practica un alto número de procedimientos estéticos invasivos; sin embargo, también se ha establecido que esta especialidad presenta frecuentes complicaciones cuyos riesgos necesitan ser registrados y sistematizados. Objetivo. Proponer un modelo adicional de sistematización de riesgos en cirugía estética que fortalezca los comúnmente empleados en Colombia. Metodología. El método utilizado fue el de estrategias de prevención de riesgos aplicadas al ámbito médico, empleando para este trabajo las dos primeras etapas, es decir, la sistematización de fuentes de información a partir de datos obtenidos de la gaceta jurisprudencial publicada por el Tribunal Nacional de Ética Médica; y, la identificación de la taxonomía de los eventos y errores médicos en cirugía estética. Resultados. En total se analizaron 57 providencias de las gacetas del Tribunal Nacional de Ética Médica sobre cirugía plástica y estética (privilegiando los procedimientos estéticos invasivos), pertenecientes a los años 2012, 2015 y 2017, de estas 34 cumplieron los criterios de selección; posteriormente, se realizó la sistematización de los riesgos hallados. Conclusiones. El modelo de tecnovigilancia empleado en Colombia resulta insuficiente a la hora de registrar los eventos y errores que se producen en procedimientos estéticos invasivos, por lo que es necesario emplear métodos adicionales que permitan garantizar una mayor seguridad en el paciente, prevenir daños lesivos y disminuir los procesos judiciales en contra del personal sanitario.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2022-09-01,2022,2022-09-01,2022-09-01,38,02,402-420,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vallejo Jiménez, Geovana Andrea; Tamayo Palacio, Ana Isabel","Vallejo Jiménez, Geovana Andrea (); Tamayo Palacio, Ana Isabel ()",,"Vallejo Jiménez, Geovana Andrea (); Tamayo Palacio, Ana Isabel ()",1,1,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/14353/214421446132/214421463064,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150706802,,

Materials & Methods: The study analyzed secondary data from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination  Survey  2017-18.  This  study  examined  a  population  of  9,254  resi-dents aged 1 and older. The Chi-Square Test of Independence was used to test significance among the variables of last visit to the dentist, received fluoride drops or tablets, gender, and educational level. Results: The study found no statistically significant differences in health of teeth and gums with respect to intake of fluoride drops or tablets, gender, and educational level. However, the study did find a statistically significant difference in the health of teeth and gums with regard to the last visit to the dentist among residents of the US. Individuals who have visi-ted the dentist in the last six months have rated their health of teeth and gums as excellent as compared to those who did not visit the dentist in the last six months.Conclusions: Future studies should review other factors affecting oral health such as high sugar  intake,  diabetes,  chronic  diseases,  and  genetics.

Este estudio pretende evaluar el impacto inicial de una intervención basa-da en esta técnica. Métodos: Estudio exploratorio pre- y post- intervención (n=34 enfermeros). Se implementó una intervención para reducir el estrés basada en atención plena (MBSR) de 8 sesiones según lo propuesto por Shapiro y Carlson. Se midió burnout y nivel de Atención Plena. Para evaluar  las  diferencias  en  los  niveles  de  Atención  Plena  y  burnout  se  utilizó  prueba  t  para  muestras relacionadas. Finalmente se analizó la correlación entre la asistencia a las sesiones y el cambio en los niveles de burnout y mindfulness de los participantes. Resultados: El nivel de atención plena se incrementó en promedio 12,62 puntos (p<0.001). No se observó diferencia en el nivel global de burnout. Sin embargo, existieron variaciones en el nivel de culpa e indolencia, los cuales disminuyeron significativamente posterior a la intervención. Además se apreció una correlación positiva entre el porcentaje de asistencia y el cambio en el nivel de atención plena de los participantes.

La comunicación familiar demostró ser un predictor significativo del estrés. En ese sentido, encontramos específicamente que la comunicación abierta entre los miembros del hogar se asocia con una reducción del estrés negativo (r = -,103***). En cambio, cuando la comunicación en casa está mediada por ofensas frecuentes (? = ,719***) y se combina con preocupaciones de salud (? = ,723***) y convivencia familiar (? = ,657***), aumenta predictivamente el estrés negativo alto hasta en un 37,9% de la varianza total.Conclusión: Estos hallazgos instan a fortalecer el diálogo familiar y las estrategias de afrontamiento colectivo para disminuir el estrés y aprender a manejar mejor las preocupaciones en este contexto pandémico rodeado de miedos e incertidumbres.

It is worth mentioning that the myocardial injury prior to the syndrome may be cardiotomy, although the general approach is post-infarction, there are references that refer to postcardiotomy syndrome. The pathophysiology is uncertain. It may be due to an interaction between the complement system and the affected tissue. To date, there are no pathognomonic signs or consensus criteria, presuming a strong challenge for the clinician. Diagnosis requires a history of myocardial or pericardial injury, along with inflammatory markers and electrocardiographic abnormalities; the images are useful to rule out differentials and complications.

In 2020, there were 280 million international migrants in the world. Undoubtedly, Mexico plays a fundamental role in transnational migration due to the large flow  of  migrants  who  transit  through  its  borders.  Research  on  mental  health  and  migra-tion suggests a high prevalence of mental disorders due to the conditions of the migration process; this scenario may be aggravated as result of the health contingency caused by CO-VID-19.  Methodology:  This  research  is  intended  to  identify  the  relationship  between  the  mental health of migrants, the migratory process, and the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, it is a qualitative study with a deductive approach. A sample evaluation of Central Ameri-can  migrants  living  in  a  shelter  in  Tabasco,  Mexico  in  December  2020  was  used.  Results:  Some factors impact the mental health of migrants in the place of origin and during transit (forced migration, persecution, and the lack of possibilities to achieve a decent standard of living...). Moreover, positive, and negative manifestations were reported in the dimensions of mental health, because of the migratory process and COVID-19. Conclusions: Migration has become an option for survival and well-being given the limited opportunities that exist in the regions of origin. Efforts must be made to develop migration and health policies that benefit this group. Unfortunately, some limitations of data collection emerged due to Covid 19.

Materiales y Métodos: Se empleó datos de corte transversal de la Encuesta Nacional de Hogares y la Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud Familiar ENDES del año 2018. En la estimación del efecto del consumo de alimentos sobre la concentración de hemoglobina se empleó el modelo de regresión lineal múltiple; mientras que para medir el efecto de consumo de alimentos sobre el riego de anemia se empleó el modelo de regresión probit. Resultados. Se encontró que el consumo de lechuga, apio y beterrega (verduras), hígado (carne roja), papaya (fruta) contribuyen positivamente sobre la concentración de hemoglobina y la reducción del riesgo de anemia. La papa (tubérculo) contribuye positivamente en el incremento de la hemoglobina y la reducción del riesgo de anemia para niveles de consumo por debajo de 50 kilogramos por año. Entre las variables de control resultaron altanamente significativos las características biológicas de la madre y el niño, las características socioeconómicas del hogar, y las características de la región y comunidad. Conclusión. El mayor consumo de hígado de res, lechuga y beterraga produce mayores niveles de hemoglobina, mientras el consumo de papa por debajo de 50 kg en promedio anual contribuye a la reducción del riesgo de anemia, y mayor consumo de apio y papaya genera una menor probabilidad de riesgo de contraer anemia.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2022-02-16,2022,2022-02-16,2022-02-16,37,02,407-421,All OA; Gold,Article,"Calatayud Mendoza, Alfredo Pelayo; Inquilla Mamani, Juan; Paredes Mamani, René Paz","Calatayud Mendoza, Alfredo Pelayo (); Inquilla Mamani, Juan (); Paredes Mamani, René Paz ()",,"Calatayud Mendoza, Alfredo Pelayo (); Inquilla Mamani, Juan (); Paredes Mamani, René Paz ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/13654/214421445556/214421458900,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145643472,,

Por esta razón, es fundamental tener claro que el desarrollo de un adecuado problema de investigación es un proceso complejo y va a estar compuesto por cinco partes. En primer lugar, se debe definir la condición clínica de interés y tener total claridad sobre ella; se recomienda escribir una pequeña descripción de la enfermedad que sirva como marco de referencia para el problema. Posteriormente, se debe expresar el problema en términos de una situación adversa o negativa (morbilidad, mortalidad, costos, entre otros), bien sea para el paciente, su familia, el sistema de salud o la sociedad. En tercer lugar, el problema de investigación implica que haya un vacío o discrepancia en el conocimiento sobre dicha situación negativa; para identificarlo, es necesario llevar a cabo una revisión sistemática de la literatura con el fin de tener presente las respuestas encontradas en investigaciones previas. Luego, se deben estimar las implicaciones o beneficios prácticos que pueda traer el resolver dicho problema. Finalmente, el problema de investigación se debe concretar de forma justificada y estructurada dando lugar a la pregunta de investigación. Además, el investigador debe estar en la capacidad de determinar si su pregunta de investigación cumple con los elementos necesarios para ser adecuada, las cuales se resumen en la mnemotecnia FINER (factible, interesante, novedosa, ética y relevante).",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2022-12-05,2022,2022-12-05,2022-12-05,38,03,919-931,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara-Jaimes, Silvia Margarita; Botero-Bolívar, Sara; Donado Gómez, Jorge Hernando","Vergara-Jaimes, Silvia Margarita (); Botero-Bolívar, Sara (); Donado Gómez, Jorge Hernando ()",,"Vergara-Jaimes, Silvia Margarita (); Botero-Bolívar, Sara (); Donado Gómez, Jorge Hernando ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/14525/214421446262/214421464568,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153380363,,

KF was applied on young Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora plants before their transition from nursery to full sunlight during autumn and summer. The effects of KF were evaluated through the responses of leaf temperature (Tleaf), net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (g s), transpiration (E), WUE, crop water stress index (CWSI), index of relative stomatal conductance (Ig), initial fluorescence (F0), and photosynthetic index (PI) in the first 2-3 weeks after the plant transitions to the full sun. All measurements were performed at midday. In Coffea plants, KF decreased the Tleaf up to 6.7°C/5.6°C and reduced the CWSI. The plants that were not protected with KF showed lower A, g s, E, and Ig than those protected with KF. C. canephora plants protected with KF achieved higher WUE compared with those not protected by 11.23% in autumn and 95.58% in summer. In both Coffea sp., KF application reduced F0, indicating reduced physical dissociation of the PSII reaction centers from the light-harvesting system, which was supported with increased PI. The use of KF can be recommended as a management strategy in the transition of Coffea seedlings from the nursery shade to the full sunlight, to protect leaves against the excessive solar radiation and high temperatures, especially in C. canephora during the summer.",,"This work was supported by CNPq fellowships (02.09.20.008.00.00 and 02.13.02.042.00.00 for DA; Visiting Researcher fellowship, process 312959/2019-2 for MR, and PQ fellowship 303166/2019-3 for EC); Fundação Carlos Chagas de Apoio à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) grants (E-26/202.759/2018, E-26/210.309/2018, and E-26/210.037/2020, EC); and by Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc.",Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,2022-01-07,2022,2022-01-07,,12,,784482,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino; de Matos Roda, Newton; de Abreu, Gideao Pelegrino; de Paula Bernado, Wallace; Rodrigues, Weverton Pereira; Campostrini, Eliemar; Rakocevic, Miroslava","de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); de Matos Roda, Newton (Department of Exact, Environmental and Technological Sciences (CEATEC), Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil); de Abreu, Gideao Pelegrino (Business School and Polytechnic School, MBA in Business Technology, Data Science and Big Data, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil); de Paula Bernado, Wallace (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rodrigues, Weverton Pereira (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Center of Agricultural, Natural and Literary Sciences, State University of the Tocantina Region of Maranhão (UEMASUL), Estreito, Maranhão, Brazil); Campostrini, Eliemar (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rakocevic, Miroslava (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","Campostrini, Eliemar (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rakocevic, Miroslava (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); de Matos Roda, Newton (State University of Campinas); de Abreu, Gideao Pelegrino (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul); de Paula Bernado, Wallace (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rodrigues, Weverton Pereira (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Center of Agricultural, Natural and Literary Sciences, State University of the Tocantina Region of Maranhão (UEMASUL), Estreito, Maranhão, Brazil); Campostrini, Eliemar (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Rakocevic, Miroslava (Laboratory for Plant Genetic Breeding (LMGV), State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)",5,4,,2.5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.784482/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144497947,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,15 Life on Land

Materiales y métodos: estudio descriptivo, transversal, predictivo, de comprobación de modelo con análisis de mediación. La muestra fue de 274 adultos internos en Centros de Rehabilitación contra las Adicciones (CRCA). Los instrumentos utilizados fueron una Cédula de Datos Sociodemográficos, Cuestionario de Craving por Alcohol, Inventario de Cociente Emocional y Cuestionario de Variables Predictoras de Abandono y Adhesión al Tratamiento.  Resultados: existe una relación inversa entre la IEP, el riesgo de recaída (r = -,381, p <.001) y el craving (r = -,354, p <.001). El craving y el riesgo de recaída se relacionaron positivamente (r = ,218, p <.001). Se reporta un efecto total significativo del craving sobre el riesgo de recaída cuando es mediado por la IE el cual explica el 11% de la varianza (B= ,1389; t = ,5,688; p <,001).  Conclusiones: los resultados de este estudio indican que IEP se asocia inversamente con el craving y el riesgo de recaída, además de que la IEP desempeña un papel significativo como mediador en esta relación.

The most common affections were to the infrastructure, reduction in the number of healthcare personnel, conservation of vaccines and medicines, access to health care, the inability to do preventive activities and the poor presence of the government in the PCN area. Moreover, the displacement of the population to areas where the vector abounds increases the probability to get sick.Conclusions:  This  study  found  an  inversely  proportional  relationship  between  the  fre-quency of malaria cases and armed conflict. This situation could show that maybe the “con-flict” controls malaria. However, it is important to clarify that it could be only masking the reality of the PCN, because the situation that this region was facing stopped the population from accessing the malaria prevention programs and health services, making it difficult to diagnose, treat, and notify the public health surveillance systems.

Selection of  studies: Exploratory  and  cross-sectional  study.Data  extraction: The  authors  collected  the information between January and February 2018. Participants answered the Jefferson Medical Scale of Empathy, the Spanish version for medical students (S version), validated and adapted for nursing students in Colombia.Results. Synthesis of the data: Cronbach’s alpha was satisfactory (not typifed = 0.891 and typified = 0.886), from which it is inferred that the data has internal reliability. The inter-class correlation coefficient was 0.891; CI [0.87, 0.909] (F = 9.15, p = 0.005): confirms the good reliability. The authors observed that in empathy, this coefficient was highly signifi-cant in all three factors, with the eta-square value satisfactory and a high power observed.

However, fexA variants mediating resistance only to chloramphenicol have been identified, such as in the case of a Staphylococcus aureus isolate recovered from poultry meat illegally imported to Germany. The effects of the individual mutations detected in the fexA sequence of this isolate were investigated in this study. A total of 11 fexA variants, including prototype fexA and variants containing the different previously described mutations either alone or in different combinations, were generated by on-chip gene synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs were inserted into a shuttle vector and transformed into three recipient strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium). Subsequently, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of florfenicol and chloramphenicol were determined. In addition, protein modeling was used to predict the structural effects of the mutations. The lack of florfenicol-resistance mediating properties of the fexA variants could be attributed to the presence of a C110T and/or G98C mutation. Transformants carrying fexA variants containing either of these mutations, or both, showed a reduction of florfenicol MICs compared to those transformants carrying prototype fexA or any of the other variants. The significance of these mutations was supported by the generated protein models, indicating a substitution toward more voluminous amino-acids in the substrate-binding site of FexA. The remaining mutations, A391G and C961A, did not result in lower florfenicol-resistance compared to prototype fexA.",We would like to thank Richard Novick for kindly providing vector pCN33.,,Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2022-01-07,2022,2022-01-07,,12,,794435,All OA; Gold,Article,"Müller, Anja; Sakurai, Keisuke; Seinige, Diana; Nishino, Kunihiko; Kehrenberg, Corinna","Müller, Anja (Institute for Veterinary Food Science, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany); Sakurai, Keisuke (Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan); Seinige, Diana (Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety, Wardenburg, Germany); Nishino, Kunihiko (SANKEN, Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan); Kehrenberg, Corinna (Institute for Veterinary Food Science, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany)","Kehrenberg, Corinna (University of Giessen)","Müller, Anja (University of Giessen); Sakurai, Keisuke (Osaka University); Seinige, Diana (Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety); Nishino, Kunihiko (Osaka University); Kehrenberg, Corinna (University of Giessen)",1,0,0.27,0.44,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.794435/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144495919,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,

Adjusting for sex, it was observed that,  in  men,  the  20-29  years  group  has  the  strongest  growth  and  growth  forecast  of  all  groups, followed by men aged 50-59 years. In the case of women, the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups are the fastest growing, however, it is a slower growth in relation to the men’s group. Conclusions:  Chile  has  one  of  the  fastest  growing  HIV  epidemics  in  the  world.  We  esti-mate that the most incidental groups are linked to the mining population, which denotes the importance of the relationship between mining activity and the high incidence of HIVinfection. The results suggest the need for prevention and early detection of the sources of HIV infection and the need to adapt strategies in this population. It is necessary to close the gap of HIV-positive people who do not know their health status, in order to stop the spread of HIV among miners and in the communities surrounding the mining industry.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2022-05-05,2022,2022-05-05,2022-05-05,38,01,217-230,All OA; Gold,Article,"San Martín Roldán, David; Correa Rodríguez, Paola Cecilia; López Labarca, Claudio; San Martín Roldán, Pablo; Calzadilla Núñez, Aracelis; Cuello-Pérez, Margarett; Díaz Narváez, Víctor Patricio","San Martín Roldán, David (); Correa Rodríguez, Paola Cecilia (); López Labarca, Claudio (); San Martín Roldán, Pablo (); Calzadilla Núñez, Aracelis (); Cuello-Pérez, Margarett (); Díaz Narváez, Víctor Patricio ()",,"San Martín Roldán, David (); Correa Rodríguez, Paola Cecilia (); López Labarca, Claudio (); San Martín Roldán, Pablo (); Calzadilla Núñez, Aracelis (); Cuello-Pérez, Margarett (); Díaz Narváez, Víctor Patricio ()",0,0,,0.0,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/14328/214421445926/214421461352,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147670647,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Unexpected variants unrelated to referral are being increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals through ECS. In this study, we reported an asymptomatic male with duplication of exons 56-61 in the DMD gene through ECS using whole-exome sequencing (WES), which was also detected in a male patient diagnosed with typical Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Breakpoint analysis was then performed to explore the potential mechanisms of phenotypic differences using long-read sequencing (LRS), PacBio single-molecule real-time (PacBio SMRT) target sequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Complex structural variations (SVs) on chromosome X were identified in the asymptomatic male, which revealed that the duplication occurred outside the DMD gene; whereas, the duplication in the patient with DMD was a tandem repeat. The phenotypic differences between the two men could be explained by the different breakpoint junctions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a breakpoint analysis of DMD duplication in two men with different phenotypes. Breakpoint analysis is necessary when the clinical phenotypes are inconsistent with genotypes, and it applies to prenatal testing.","The authors are very grateful to the families for participating in this study and appreciate Beijing GrandOmics Biosciences Biotechnology Co., Ltd., for the technical support in Nanopore LRS and PacBio SMRT target sequencing.",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (grant number 2018YFC1002203).,Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2022-05-09,2022,2022-05-09,,13,,878806,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bai, Ying; Liu, Ju; Xu, Jinghan; Sun, Yue; Li, Jingjing; Gao, Yong; Liu, Lina; Jia, Cangcang; Kong, Xiangdong; Wang, Li","Bai, Ying (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Liu, Ju (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Xu, Jinghan (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Sun, Yue (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Li, Jingjing (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Gao, Yong (GrandOmics Biosciences, Beijing, China); Liu, Lina (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Jia, Cangcang (GrandOmics Biosciences, Beijing, China); Kong, Xiangdong (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Wang, Li (Genetic and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China)","Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Wang, Li (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)","Bai, Ying (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Liu, Ju (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Xu, Jinghan (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Sun, Yue (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Li, Jingjing (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Gao, Yong (Grandomics (China)); Liu, Lina (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Jia, Cangcang (Grandomics (China)); Kong, Xiangdong (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University); Wang, Li (First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University)",8,7,1.36,3.4,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.878806/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147724769,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

The focus was made on investigating the suitability of this material for the seismic retrofitting application. The commercially available in the Colombian market fibers assessed involved five steel plus three synthetic ones. The series analyzed encompassed mono-fiber and binary multi-scale fiber-reinforcement systems. Experimental results of mono-fiber-reinforced UHPC with a fiber volume fraction of 2.0% of high-strength smooth steel fibers with a slenderness of 65 showed strain values at peak stress in tension (εpc) similar to those from other researchers, notwithstanding the reduction in cement and silica fume by 35% and 50%, respectively, of the low-cost and sustainable cementitious matrix used. Nonetheless, a significant drop in the energy absorption capacity (g) values are observed, which can be explained by the decrease in cement and silica fume. Outcomes also pointed out the relevant synergy between the hooked end fibers and the high-strength smooth ones. The results indicated that only the hybrid blend of high-strength smooth fibers (l f /d f =65) and hooked end fibers achieved the required ductility parameters (g≥50 kJ/m3 and ε pc ≥0.3%) for seismic retrofitting applications.","The author of this article would like to thank the support of the Research, Development, and Innovation Directorate of the Universidad del Norte through the &quot;research agenda&quot; code 2021-007.

1493,pub.1148577000,10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01228,,,Study of nonlinear relationships between dosage mixture design and the compressive strength of UHPC,"With advances in building materials research, new materials more suitable for specific applications due to their superior durability and mechanical properties are emerging to meet the requirements of infrastructure construction and maintenance. In this sense, ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is considered one of the most promising materials for concrete construction. However, a traditional UHPC mixture contains large amounts of cement, silica fume, superplasticizer, and other expensive and high carbon footprint components. Hence, several researchers have focused on developing alternative UHPC dosages using locally available materials, including several mineral admixtures, to obtain a more affordable and sustainable UHPC. Therefore, deep knowledge about the relationships between the UHPC dosage and its resulting properties could help to improve these developments. However, these relationships are nonlinear and complex. This paper aims to address this gap by using a random forest model trained with a 931 UHPC mixture collection with 17 input variables and a unique response, namely the UHPC compressive strength. After adjusting a regression model, different tools, such as input variable importance analysis and partial dependence plots, were used to assess the nonlinear relationships between the dosage of UHPC and its resulting compressive strength. In most cases, a proper alignment was observed when the findings provided by these analyses were contrasted with the results provided by other researchers. The results indicated that the inputs with the highest significance on UHPC compressive strength are those related to water content, the packing density, and the quartz powder and superplasticizer dosages, followed by the cement content. Furthermore, mineral admixtures with high amorphous SiO2 content, such as RHA and SF, presented a relevant contribution to the compressive strength, while the other admixtures would seem to have a more modest contribution to it. Finally, it is also worth noting that the machine learning model created might help to create novel UHPC dosages by decreasing the duration and expenses of the experimental campaign by permitting the pre-selection of those components with a superior model response.","The authors of this article would like to thank the support of the Research, Development, and Innovation Directorate of the Universidad del Norte through the “Research Agenda” Code 2021-007.",,Case Studies in Construction Materials,,,,2022-12,2022,,2022-12,17,,e01228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abellán-García, Joaquín","Abellán-García, Joaquín (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Abellán-García, Joaquín (Universidad del Norte)",25,23,,10.93,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01228,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148577000,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,
1492,pub.1145338239,10.1016/j.esr.2022.100816,,,Are the current incentives sufficient to drive the use of solar PV in the Colombian residential sector? - An analysis from the perspective of the game theory,"It is necessary to increase the use of renewable energy sources to supply the world's energy demand to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. Many countries have incorporated the use of solar energy on a large scale. However, the use of photovoltaic (PV) systems at the residential level has been rather limited because many barriers to their implementation persist (e.g., high investment costs, insufficient government policies and incentives, and lack of knowledge in the implementation and operation of these systems). This paper aims to investigate how the interaction between prosumers and consumers can drive the use of PV systems at the residential level. The interaction is analyzed from the field of game theory. The payoffs of the players' strategies determine not only the Nash equilibrium but also the desirability of the interaction for both investment in the case of prosumer and consumption costs in the case of the consumer. Prosumer strategies consisted of selling power to the grid and to the consumer; selling only to the consumer; selling only to the grid; selling to the grid and giving to the consumer; and only giving to the consumer. The consumer strategies were to buy only from the grid or to buy from both the grid and the prosumer. The prosumer's investment in three sizes of PV systems (2.3, 2.7 and 3.6 kW) were analyzed; the amount of electricity produced was estimated using PVWatts and data from a Typical Meteorological Year in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. The Net Present Value of each investment was calculated considering the prosumer's strategies and this indicator was taken to an equivalent annual cost to represent the prosumer's payment in the Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, for the consumer's payments, the annual energy purchase costs to supply their demand were used, according to the consumer's strategies. Analysis found that PV systems that can produce surpluses can be attractive to the prosumer if the tax on revenues received from the sale of energy to the grid is eliminated. Profitability is further improved if the prosumer is allowed to sell their surplus to other consumers, with the purchase price to the grid being the maximum price at which they can sell to other consumers. In turn, the cost savings for consumers will be greater to the extent that they can buy cheaper energy from prosumers. Based on these findings, countries such as Colombia, where there has not been a massive use of solar photovoltaic energy at the residential level, can stimulate investments in this sector by eliminating the income tax on the sales of surplus energy of small prosumers, without representing a loss of income for these countries.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Colombia.",Energy Strategy Reviews,,,,2022-03,2022,,2022-03,40,,100816,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzman, Luceny; Henao, Alvin","Guzman, Luceny (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Antigua a Puerto Colombia, Area Metropolitana de Barrranquilla, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Antigua a Puerto Colombia, Area Metropolitana de Barrranquilla, Colombia)","Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte)","Guzman, Luceny (Universidad del Norte); Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte)",8,5,,5.18,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2022.100816,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145338239,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Objetivo: Determinar la asociación entre velocidad de la marcha y sospecha de deterioro cognitivo en población mayor chilena. Métodos:Se incluyeron 1.788 personas mayores de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud (ENS) 2016-2017 que tenían información sobre velocidad de marcha y sospecha de deterioro cognitivo. La velocidad de la marcha fue auto-reportada y categorizada como marca lenta, normal y rápida.  Sospecha de deterioro cognitivo fue evaluado a través del cuestionario Mini-Mental abreviado. La asociación entre marcha y deterioro cognitivo fue investigada mediante análisis de regresión logística. Resultados: En comparación a las personas mayores que reportaron una velocidad de marcha rápida, aquellas que reportaron una marcha lenta presentaron 2,67 veces mayor probabilidad de tener deterioro cognitivo (OR: 2,67 [95% IC:1,62; 4,42], p<0,001).

Furthermore, FTIR analysis had similar vibrational frequencies, which was verified with the electronic distribution. Thus, this nanocomposite would have excellent physical and thermal stability, and it does not have reactions to polar solvents such as water so that it could be used in the human body.",The authors declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Polímeros,,,,2022,2022,2022,,32,3,e2022027,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campos-Cruz, Juan Ramon; Rangel-Vázquez, Norma Aurea; Zavala-Arce, Rosa Elvira; Márquez-Brazon, Edgar","Campos-Cruz, Juan Ramon (Instituto Tecnológico de Aguascalientes, México); Rangel-Vázquez, Norma Aurea (Instituto Tecnológico de Aguascalientes, México); Zavala-Arce, Rosa Elvira (Instituto Tecnológico de Toluca, México); Márquez-Brazon, Edgar (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"Campos-Cruz, Juan Ramon (Instituto Tecnológico de Aguascalientes); Rangel-Vázquez, Norma Aurea (Instituto Tecnológico de Aguascalientes); Zavala-Arce, Rosa Elvira (Instituto Tecnológico de Toluca); Márquez-Brazon, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.scielo.br/j/po/a/69WcsVdRsKxJtr7Z5GXS5FK/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153666173,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology,

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to establish the relationship between the perception of the teaching-learning process (TLP) and the attitude toward scientific research among midwifery students.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted on 250 students from second to fourth year of study selected by convenience sampling. The data were collected with two self-administered Likert-type scales that were validated in content and construct, both with high reliability. Descriptive statistics were carried out; the Spearman correlation test was used prior to the application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Kendall's tau-b test.
RESULTS: The favorable perception of the TLP was greater among second-year students (42.6%), in addition, 15.2% agreed that the advice of teachers contributes to the elaboration of the research protocol. The attitude of indifference toward research was more frequent in third-year students (58.2%) and 28.4% were deemed in disagreement to be able to identify and operationalize the variables. In the analysis of dimensions, the role of the student had a moderate relationship with the research design (rho = 0.536; P < 0.001), while a weak relationship was demonstrated between media and techniques with ethical and scientific value (rho = 0.104; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The TLP perceived by midwifery students and their attitudes toward scientific research had a direct and significant correlation. The proportion of students with favorable perception was greater among those with a favorable attitude.","The authors express gratitude to the midwifery students who participated in the study.

Using Vis-NIR-SWIR Hyperspectroscopy","High-throughput and large-scale data are part of a new era of plant remote sensing science. Quantification of the yield, energetic content, and chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) remains laborious and is of great interest to physiologists and photobiologists. We propose a new method that is efficient and applicable for estimating photosynthetic performance and photosystem status using remote sensing hyperspectroscopy with visible, near-infrared and shortwave spectroscopy (Vis-NIR-SWIR) based on rapid multivariate partial least squares regression (PLSR) as a tool to estimate biomass production, calorimetric energy content and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. The results showed the presence of typical inflections associated with chemical and structural components present in plants, enabling us to obtain PLSR models with R2P and RPDP values greater than >0.82 and 3.33, respectively. The most important wavelengths were well distributed into 400 (violet), 440 (blue), 550 (green), 670 (red), 700−750 (red edge), 1330 (NIR), 1450 (SWIR), 1940 (SWIR) and 2200 (SWIR) nm operating ranges of the spectrum. Thus, we report a methodology to simultaneously determine fifteen attributes (i.e., yield (biomass), ΔH°area, ΔH°mass, Fv/Fm, Fv’/Fm’, ETR, NPQ, qP, qN, ΦPSII, P, D, SFI, PI(abs), D.F.) with high accuracy and precision and with excellent predictive capacity for most of them. These results are promising for plant physiology studies and will provide a better understanding of photosystem dynamics in tobacco plants when a large number of samples must be evaluated within a short period and with remote acquisition data.","Thanks are also due to Eliemar Campostrini and Guilherme Rodrigues de Souza at State University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro (UENF) for supporting JIP-test and Dra.

Methods: This was a retrospective bibliometric study. The unit of analysis was made up of Peruvian dentistry publications indexed in the Scopus database during the last 10 years. Records with metadata (410) corresponding to the period 2011-2020 were downloaded and standardized and refined by analyzing the metadata. The search strategy was developed based on the individual profiles of each Peruvian institution that has a dental school or college. It was evaluated according to the AF-ID of each institution in the Scopus database. In addition, the information provided by the Scopus SciVal tool was used. Finally, publications, impact, and collaboration indicators were used, such as total number per document, per author, average of citations, h-index, collaboration rate, number of institutions, the Source Normalized Impact per Paper indicator, the CiteScore, and the Scopus Field-Weighted Citation Impact.
Results: The greatest increase was evident in 2018, with 2019 and 2020 being the maximum peak of scientific publication growth. However, sustained growth has not been evidenced in relation to the female sex. The analysis of coauthorship by the authors revealed four large clusters, of which the first three were represented by male researchers, such as Arriola-Guillen L., Mayta-Tovalino F., and Mendoza-Azpur G., and one by a female, Guerrero María E. Evaluating the national scientific publication in dentistry according to the CiteScore, it was found that most of the publications (145) from Peru were published in Q4 journals, although 90 manuscripts were published in Q1 journals.
Conclusions: The Peruvian national dental publication in the last 10 years was mainly supported by male dentists, which invites us to reflect on the need to equalize opportunities so that female researchers can also reduce these gaps.",,,BioMed Research International,,Iole Vozza,Bibliometrics; Dentistry; Female; Humans; Male; Metadata; Peru; Retrospective Studies,2022-06-26,2022,2022-06-26,2022-06-26,2022,,7854479,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayta-Tovalino, Frank; Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel; Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel; Mendoza, Roman; Mauricio, Franco; Barja-Ore, John; Guerrero, Maria Eugenia","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel (Unidad de Investigación en Bibliometría, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru, unfv.edu.pe); Mendoza, Roman (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru, unfv.edu.pe); Mauricio, Franco (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru, unfv.edu.pe); Barja-Ore, John (Dirección de Investigación, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Guerrero, Maria Eugenia (Academic Department of Medical and Surgical Stomatology, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru, unmsm.edu.pe)","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Pacheco-Mendoza, Josmel (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel (Federico Villarreal National University); Mendoza, Roman (Federico Villarreal National University); Mauricio, Franco (Federico Villarreal National University); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North); Guerrero, Maria Eugenia (National University of San Marcos)",0,0,,0.0,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/7854479.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148983022,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

This event represents an important public health problem in developing countries due to its high frequency and severity. Snakes of the genus Bothrops are responsible for the majority of accidents, and this is partly due to their wide geographic distribution and aggressive behavior when threatened. Acute kidney injury is an importantcause of mortality in patients with snake bites of this genus. Purpose: To describe the case of a female patient with bothrops snakebite-induced acute kidney injury. Simultaneously, the most relevant epidemiological data of said entity, its risk factors, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms that explain its genesis, its diagnosis and clinical management are detailed. The importance of its early identification and timely treatment is highlighted. Case presentation: We present the case of a 40-year-old female patient who was admitted to a fourth level of complexity institution due to acute kidney injury and consumption coagulopathy secondary to bothrops snakebite, with the presence of vaginal bleeding and hematuria that progressed to anuria and hematemesis; requiring transfusion of blood products and renal replacement therapy, measures with which she presented a favorable clinical evolution. Conclusion and discussion: Acute kidney injury associated with the bite of bothrops snakes is a common and life-threatening clinical complication that should not be overlooked. The pathophysiological events responsible for this complication include immunological mechanisms, coagulation disorders, pigmenturia, direct nephrotoxicity, and the inflammatory response with systemic and renal hemodynamic effects.

Javier Auyero y Katherine Sobering","Auyero and Sobering start from an accurate characterization of the role played by the State in its intervention in territories dominated by drug trafficking: it is neither a “strong” nor a “weak” presence, but rather a deeply ambivalent organization. In the deployment of the actions carried out by the agencies of the penal system, persecution coexists with collusion, investigation and arrests with “letting go” and “liberated zones”. One of the merits of the book is to make transparent the logics that underlie this apparent illogical behavior. Moments and actors that need to guarantee both the flow of illegal goods and their confiscation can well coexist in the same space and time, both the lights and cameras on large police operations and the shadows on the permanent rearrangement of the illicit drug market.

Firstly, detailed information on research articles on this topic was obtained from the Scopus database. Secondly, the information was analyzed using Excel through the direct comparison and analysis of graphs with references and theories related to intellectual capital. Finally, the results exposed that Colombian scientific production is associated with 32 public universities, representing 45,029 elaborate documents by 9,758 authors on three relevant topics: physics and astronomy, agricultural and biological science, and medicine. Also, the data obtained exposed that 56.61% of the institutions are above the average considering the overall public institutions. However, this behavior depends on the institution’s number of researchers and full-time teachers related to intellectual capital.

The work was developed as a qualitative research with a hermeneutic phenomenology. To make it possible, two interview guides were designed to talk with the ex-combatants and some community leaders as well as a guide for discussion groups between them. As total, 16 interviews were made to ex-combatants, 10 to community leaders and 4 discussion groups. The information was analyzed through a hermeneutic method, guided by premade categories. The results shows that three things are necessary to create peace in this reconciliation process: daily life interactions that implies that the ex-combatants finished the armed conflict against the state, a social inclusion that tries to improve life conditions, and the creation of spaces where the ex-combatants can recognize their acts. Under this perspective, for the ex-combatants and its surrounding communities, the peace in the territory is not only the war that has finish, but also the opportunity of having an improving welfare. In order to have an improving welfare it is necessary that the Colombian government makes its part of the peace agreement.",,,Hallazgos,,,,2022-11-04,2022,2022-11-04,2023-01-01,20,39,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gómez, Juan David Villa; Álvarez, Yohan","Gómez, Juan David Villa (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana - Medellín); Álvarez, Yohan ()",,"Gómez, Juan David Villa (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Álvarez, Yohan ()",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.usantotomas.edu.co/index.php/hallazgos/article/download/7469/7519,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156302961,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 44 Human Society,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This study assesses the relationships between ecosystems and people in the rapidly expanding Barranquilla Metropolitan Area (BMA) and extracts lessons for its planning as a BiodiverCity. Using 22 interviews and 400 face-to-face surveys we evaluated: 1) the perception of positive and negative contributions of specific types of ecosystems to human well-being (HWB); 2) the importance and vulnerability of multiple ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (EdS); and 3) the relationships between ES, EdS and relational values (RV), and the influence of socioeconomic factors in providing HWB, using a Structural Equation Model (SEM). Open-ended answers in the survey showed that rural and certain natural ecosystems, such as wetlands, mangroves and tropical dry forest were the least valued ecosystems and included some EdS. In contrast, urban and peri-urban ecosystems, namely the river, beaches, crops, urban green, and backyards, were the most valued. Overall, regulating ES were perceived as critical, as well as important and vulnerable. The results of the SEM model indicate that HWB is not only explained by socioeconomic factors such as income and education, but also by ES. We argue that the necessary sustainable socio-economic development of the BMA should be coupled with an urban planning that integrates ES and their contributions to HWB.",We wish to thank all the people who were interviewed.

We deal with two well-known quantum interactions that operate within an exactly solvable model. This model is able to adequately describe some aspects of fermion-dynamics, particularly level-crossings. We describe things via employment of Gibbs' canonical ensemble strictures. We show that judicious manipulation of the energy cost associated to statistical order (disorder) variations generates useful information-quantifiers.

1389,pub.1154727437,10.24265/horizmed.2022.v22n4.13,,,Riesgo de enfermedad cardiovascular y cerebrovascular a largo plazo en mujeres con antecedente personal de abrupción placentaria,"Maternal and perinatal health is one of today’s global health priorities. Cardiovascular disease and stroke are the leading causes of maternal mortality. Placental abruption remains a critical concern for maternal morbidity because it has been associated with long-term vascular disease. However, there is neither much literature available in Spanish nor recent evidence elucidating some questions on this topic. Thus, this review aims to synthesize recent evidence on the long-term risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in women with a personal history of placental abruption. It was found that, through complex pathophysiological mechanisms involving the structure and functionality of the placental vascular network with subsequent extension of vascular injury and production of proinflammatory and procoagulant factors which remain after delivery, major cardiovascular events are precipitated in the medium and long term. High-quality evidence has shown that the risk of maternal complications in women with placental abruption accounts for 2.14, rising even higher for those with severe placental abruption. In the medium and long term, the mortality risk caused by coronary heart diseases is 2.64 and by cerebrovascular disorders is 1.70, with equal risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It can therefore be concluded that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk is imminent in women with a history of placental abruption due to a number of vascular pathophysiological mechanisms. However, this risk is considerably increased when associated with traditional and non-traditional modifiable factors.",,,HORIZONTE - Revista de Estudos de Teologia e Ciências da Religião,,,,2022-12-07,2022,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,22,4,e1992-e1992,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez, Ivan David Lozada; Peña, María Teresa Navarro; Cortes, Adriana Isabel Castiblanco; Villalobos, Angela María Torres; Varela, Juan Pablo Duque; Motta, Natalia Bautista; Navarro, Carol Juliana Parra; Vargas, Germán Felipe Aponte; Tiria, Maickol Tocarruncho","Martínez, Ivan David Lozada (Grupo Prometheus y Biomedicina Aplicada a las Ciencias Clínicas, School of Medicine, Universidad de Cartagena.

To analyze the debate on the construction of the object of the social sciences and its implications in the training of teachers. Discussion. At first, a conceptualization of the social sciences is proposed by defending the juxtaposed ontology of its object; likewise, epistemological and methodological considerations are debated in terms of totality. Then, it is reflected on the place of the subject who practices the social sciences and its consequences in the production of knowledge. Finally, considerations are raised on the training of teachers in social sciences. Conclusions. The curricular design to train teachers in social sciences must go through the construction of spaces that lead to two actions: first, to problematize aspects of reality without being reduced to compartmentalization of the departments; and second, to generate an epistemological awareness that leads them to account for their order of intellection or policies of interpretation in the production of knowledge.",,,Revista Electrónica Educare,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-01-01,,26,1,1-13,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cuesta-Moreno, Óscar Julián; Meléndez-Labrador, Sandra Mireya","Cuesta-Moreno, Óscar Julián (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Meléndez-Labrador, Sandra Mireya (Universidad del Norte)",,"Cuesta-Moreno, Óscar Julián (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Meléndez-Labrador, Sandra Mireya (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.revistas.una.ac.cr/index.php/EDUCARE/article/download/14381/24062,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145643907,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

A total of 3888 papers published between January 2000 and June 2021, distributed in four clusters—RTA + HA + SA (SA, n = 399); RTA + HA + ML (ML, n = 858); RTA + HA + SC (TESC, n = 2327); and RTA + HA + GIS (GIS, n = 304)—were analyzed. We identified Accident Analysis and Prevention as the most important journal, Fred Mannering as the main author, and The Statistical Analysis of Crash-Frequency Data: A Review and Assessment of Methodological Alternatives as the most cited publication. Although the negative binomial regression method was used for several years, we noticed that other regression models as well as methods based on deep learning, convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, 5G technology, Internet of Things, and intelligent transport systems have recently emerged as suitable alternatives for RTA analysis. By introducing a new approach based on computational algorithms and data visualization, this SLR fills a gap in the area of RTA analysis and provides a clear picture of the current scientific production in the field. This information is crucial for projecting further research on RTA analysis and developing computational and data visualization tools oriented to the automation of RTA predictions based on intelligent systems.","CMFV was supported by COLCIENCIAS, project “Design of a framework for Integral Road Traffic Accident Management in Smart Cities,” project # 785 of 2017, contract 84-091-894.",,Journal of Advanced Transportation,,Elżbieta Macioszek,,2022-07-08,2022,,2022-07-08,2022,,1-17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ferreira-Vanegas, Carlos M.; Vélez, Jorge I.; García-Llinás, Guisselle A.","Ferreira-Vanegas, Carlos M.

1375,pub.1147324286,10.1109/access.2022.3169696,,,Demand-Shifting Strategies to Optimize the Performance of the Wholesale Electricity Market: A Dominican Republic Study Case,"The dimensions of the costs and incentives necessary for integrating demand response into the wholesale electricity market are subject to energy policies and bulk system operation. The electricity industry must gain operational flexibility to support the energy transition caused by renewable energy and decarbonization. Complementary services and technologies of demand response programs can be optimized by exploiting the variety of uses of this resource. The main objective of this work is to apply the concept of elasticity of substitution in a strategic demand shift program to promote the integration of renewable energies and the reduction of non-served power, considering an economical and safe generation dispatch. The methodology is analyzed through a case study applied in the Dominican Republic’s electricity market, in which the elasticity of substitution coefficients is used to adjust variations below 10.49% of the base demand in the peak period. These variations reduce the generation operating cost by 8.4%, marginal cost by 30.19%, and non-served power by 19.1% when renewable energy increases by 5%. The inclusion of the cost of CO2 emissions in the simulation of the operating cost function makes the objective function higher than the baseline function. For relative variations in operating cost ranging from 7.27% to 16.03%, the reduction in tons of CO2 equivalent varies from 2.77 to 28.02. This study contextualizes the economic effect of the CO2 emissions control, giving new possibilities to optimize system operation and the wholesale electricity market based on demand response programs that encourage flexible consumption, with favorable economic and environmental results.",The authors would like to acknowledge Organismo Coordinador del Sistema Eléctrico Nacional Interconectado (OC).

It was framed in the post-positivist paradigm, under the Pedagogical Action Research method. Its design was deployed in three phases: deconstruction of the pedagogical practice (reflection, diagnosis, and reflection); reconstruction (action and observation); and evaluation of the effectiveness of the practice (self-reflection). The population consisted of 30 students. A written test for diagnosis and a field diary for systematization were used as instruments. A didactic strategy of interaction based on mathematics was designed, entitled ‘With social networks, we learn mathematics’. Results indicate that the students mastered the activities developed correctly. Therefore, it is concluded that the planned mathematical competencies were consolidated and the students achieved significant learning.",,,Revista Criterios,,,,2022-09-22,2022,2022-09-22,,29,2,202-221,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lara, Mónica Patricia Saballet; Palomino, Aixa Enic Baleta; de Armas Duarte, Dorixy","Lara, Mónica Patricia Saballet (Institución Educativa Bello Horizonte – Sede Villa Yaneth (Valledupar, Cesar)); Palomino, Aixa Enic Baleta (Universidad Popular del Cesar); de Armas Duarte, Dorixy (Universidad Popular del Cesar; asesora de proyectos de grado de Maestría en Pedagogía en la Universidad Mariana)",,"Lara, Mónica Patricia Saballet (Institución Educativa Bello Horizonte – Sede Villa Yaneth (Valledupar, Cesar)); Palomino, Aixa Enic Baleta (Popular University of Cesar); de Armas Duarte, Dorixy (Universidad Popular del Cesar; asesora de proyectos de grado de Maestría en Pedagogía en la Universidad Mariana)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.umariana.edu.co/index.php/Criterios/article/download/3059/3379,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151839014,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,

Estudia las creencias culturales sobre la violencia intrafamiliar en Colombia previas al periodo de la pandemia generada por el Covid-19; busca visibilizarlas, mostrar sus efectos e invitar a intervenirlas. La muestra la componen 81 artículos académicos. En los resultados se encontró que la inequidad en el uso del poder, las conductas violentas aprendidas en la familia y la dependencia tanto económica como emocional aparecen entre sus principales factores causantes. Lo hallado resulta significativo porque para entender este tipo de violencia y diseñar programas prevención además de analizar las causas biológicas, económicas y sociales también se requiere conocer e intervenir las creencias que circulan en los contextos sociales donde esta violencia hace presencia.",,,Question,,,,2022-09-01,2022,2022-09-01,,3,72,e729-e729,All OA; Gold,Article,"Reyes, Gonzalo Rojas","Reyes, Gonzalo Rojas (Docente - Investigador)",,"Reyes, Gonzalo Rojas (Docente - Investigador)",0,0,,,https://perio.unlp.edu.ar/ojs/index.php/question/article/download/7415/6597,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150902342,,

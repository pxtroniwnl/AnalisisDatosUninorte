251,pub.1169998670,10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-12573-4,,,Alleviating both H0 and σ8 tensions in Tsallis cosmology,"We present how Tsallis cosmology can alleviate both H0$$H_0$$ and σ8$$\sigma _8$$ tensions simultaneously. Such a modified cosmological scenario is obtained by the application of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, but using the non-additive Tsallis entropy, instead of the standard Bekenstein–Hawking one. Hence, one obtains modified Friedmann equations, with extra terms that depend on the new Tsallis exponent δ$$\delta $$ that quantifies the departure from standard entropy. We show that for particular δ$$\delta $$ choices we can obtain a phantom effective dark energy, which is known to be one of the sufficient mechanisms that can alleviate H0$$H_0$$ tension. Additionally, for the same parameter choice we obtain an increased friction term and an effective Newton’s constant smaller than the usual one, and thus the σ8$$\sigma _8$$ tension is also solved. These features act as a significant advantage of Tsallis modified cosmology.","M.P. is supported by the Basic Research program of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA, PEVE) 65232600-ACT-MTG: Alleviating Cosmological Tensions Through Modified Theories of Gravity.

We used data from a 5-year (2018-2022) worldwide (84 countries) program to identify brands found on plastic items in the environment through 1576 audit events. We found that 50% of items were unbranded, calling for mandated producer reporting. The top five brands globally were The Coca-Cola Company (11%), PepsiCo (5%), Nestlé (3%), Danone (3%), and Altria (2%), accounting for 24% of the total branded count, and 56 companies accounted for more than 50%. There was a clear and strong log-log linear relationship production (%) = pollution (%) between companies' annual production of plastic and their branded plastic pollution, with food and beverage companies being disproportionately large polluters. Phasing out single-use and short-lived plastic products by the largest polluters would greatly reduce global plastic pollution.","This study could not have been conducted without the numerous hours of global volunteer effort by community groups working with Break Free From Plastic.

259,pub.1169894017,10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-12582-3,,,Cosmology of f(Q) gravity in non-flat Universe,"We investigate the cosmological implications of f(Q) gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity based on non-metricity, in non-flat geometry. We perform a detailed dynamical-system analysis keeping the f(Q) function completely arbitrary. As we show, the cosmological scenario admits a dark-matter dominated point, as well as a dark-energy dominated de Sitter solution which can attract the Universe at late times. However, the main result of the present work is that there are additional critical points which exist solely due to curvature. In particular, we find that there are curvature-dominated accelerating points which are unstable and thus can describe the inflationary epoch. Additionally, there is a point in which the dark-matter and dark-energy density parameters are both between zero and one, and thus it can alleviate the coincidence problem. Finally, there is a saddle point which is completely dominated by curvature. In order to provide a specific example, we apply our general analysis to the power-law case, showing that we can obtain the thermal history of the Universe, in which the curvature density parameter may exhibit a peak at intermediate times. These features, alongside possible indications that non-zero curvature could alleviate the cosmological tensions, may serve as advantages for f(Q) gravity in non-flat geometry.",This research was partially supported by the UTAR Research Fund Scheme.

However, the coverage rates of diagnostic codes and their variability across institutions are underexplored. The primary objective was to describe lab- and diagnosis-based labels for 7 selected outcomes at three institutions. Secondary objectives were to describe agreement, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnosis-based labels against lab-based labels.MethodsThis study included three cohorts: SickKids from The Hospital for Sick Children, and StanfordPeds and StanfordAdults from Stanford Medicine. We included seven clinical outcomes with lab-based definitions: acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. For each outcome, we created four lab-based labels (abnormal, mild, moderate and severe) based on test result and one diagnosis-based label. Proportion of admissions with a positive label were presented for each outcome stratified by cohort. Using lab-based labels as the gold standard, agreement using Cohen’s Kappa, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each lab-based severity level.ResultsThe number of admissions included were: SickKids (n = 59,298), StanfordPeds (n = 24,639) and StanfordAdults (n = 159,985). The proportion of admissions with a positive diagnosis-based label was significantly higher for StanfordPeds compared to SickKids across all outcomes, with odds ratio (99.9% confidence interval) for abnormal diagnosis-based label ranging from 2.2 (1.7–2.7) for neutropenia to 18.4 (10.1–33.4) for hyperkalemia. Lab-based labels were more similar by institution. When using lab-based labels as the gold standard, Cohen’s Kappa and sensitivity were lower at SickKids for all severity levels compared to StanfordPeds.ConclusionsAcross multiple outcomes, diagnosis codes were consistently different between the two pediatric institutions. This difference was not explained by differences in test results. These results may have implications for machine learning model development and deployment.",Not applicable.,No external funding was received for the study.,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,,Humans; Delivery of Health Care; Hyperkalemia; Machine Learning; Neutropenia; Sensitivity and Specificity,2024-02-14,2024,2024-02-14,,24,1,51,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guo, Lin Lawrence; Morse, Keith E.; Aftandilian, Catherine; Steinberg, Ethan; Fries, Jason; Posada, Jose; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Lemmon, Joshua; Jessa, Karim; Shah, Nigam; Sung, Lillian","Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Morse, Keith E.

This systematic review encompasses a comprehensive analysis of WBT utilization in educational settings over a 10-year span (2012-2022), highlighting the evolution of this field to address challenges in education by integrating technology to solve specific educational challenges, such as enhancing student engagement, monitoring stress and cognitive load, improving learning experiences, and providing real-time feedback for both students and educators. By exploring these aspects, this review sheds light on the potential implications of WBT on the future of learning. A rigorous and systematic search of major academic databases, including Google Scholar and Scopus, was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The articles selected were assessed for methodological quality and bias using established tools. The process of data extraction and synthesis followed a structured framework. Key findings include the shift from theoretical exploration to practical implementation, with EEG being the predominant measurement, aiming to explore mental states, physiological constructs, and teaching effectiveness. Wearable biosensors are significantly impacting the educational field, serving as an important resource for educators and a tool for students.

Methods: A total of 405 Peruvian consumers were surveyed. Most of them were between the ages of 18 and 30 and single. To test the hypotheses, partial least squares (PLS-SEM) were used using the SamrtPls4 software. The results show the significant positive effect of EA on ATT and PBC. The positive and significant effect of ATT, SN, and PBC on WP was also tested A total of 405 Peruvian consumers were surveyed. Most of them were between 18 and 30 years old and single. To test the hypotheses, partial least squares (PLS-SEM) was used using SamrtPls4 software.
Results: The results show the positive and significant effect of AD on ATT and PBC. The positive and significant effect of ATT, SN and PBC on WP was also tested.
Discussion: The research provides antecedents that allow evaluation of the possibility that companies and governments adjust the dissemination strategies and related public policies regarding the impact of environmentally responsible behavior in order to contribute to the development of environmental awareness as a variable that promotes the disposition of consumers to pay for environmentally friendly products.",,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2024-01-05,2024,2024-01-05,,14,,1282383,All OA; Gold,Article,"García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Escobar-Farfán, Manuel; Gómez-Bayona, Ledy; Moreno-López, Gustavo; Valencia-Arias, Alejandro; Gallardo-Canales, Rodrigo","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Faculty of Management Sciences, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima, Peru); Escobar-Farfán, Manuel (Department of Administration, Faculty of Administration and Economics, University of Santiago of Chile, Santiago, Chile); Gómez-Bayona, Ledy (Faculty of Business, Universidad de San Buenaventura, Medellín, Colombia); Moreno-López, Gustavo (Faculty of Business, Institución Universitaria Marco Fidel Suarez, Bello, Colombia); Valencia-Arias, Alejandro (Escuela de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Señor de Sipán, Chiclayo, Peru); Gallardo-Canales, Rodrigo (Departamento de Tecnologías de Gestión, Facultad Tecnológica, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile)","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Valencia-Arias, Alejandro (Universidad Señor de Sipán)","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Escobar-Farfán, Manuel (University of Santiago Chile); Gómez-Bayona, Ledy (Universidad de San Buenaventura); Moreno-López, Gustavo (Faculty of Business, Institución Universitaria Marco Fidel Suarez, Bello, Colombia); Valencia-Arias, Alejandro (Universidad Señor de Sipán); Gallardo-Canales, Rodrigo (University of Santiago Chile)",6,6,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1282383/pdf?isPublishedV2=False,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167676728,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Our focus lies in exploring the implications of the conformal transformation, as we derive the conformal equivalent theory in the Einstein frame, distinct from the minimally coupled scalar field theory. The fundamental principle of the conformal transformation suggests the mathematical equivalence of the related theories. However, to thoroughly analyze the impact on physical variables, we investigate the spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker geometry, defining the connection in the non-coincidence gauge. We construct exact solutions for the cosmological model in one frame and compare the physical properties in the conformal related frame. Surprisingly, we find that the general physical properties of the exact solutions remain invariant under the conformal transformation. Finally, we construct, for the first time, an analytic solution for the symmetric teleparallel scalar–tensor cosmology.","The author thanks the support of Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico (Vridt) at Universidad Católica del Norte through Núcleo de Investigación Geometría Diferencial y Aplicaciones, Resolución Vridt No—098/2022.",,European Physical Journal C,,,,2024-02-06,2024,2024-02-06,,84,2,125,All OA; Gold,Article,"Paliathanasis, Andronikos","Paliathanasis, Andronikos (Institute of Systems Science, Durban University of Technology, 4000, Durban, South Africa; Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

Among various TES methods, the use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) has emerged as a promising approach to store energy in latent form and enhance the thermal capacity of buildings, thereby improving thermal comfort. This study aims to evaluate the sensible and latent energy accumulation in cement mortars by incorporating microencapsulated phase change materials (10–20% by weight) as a substitute for fine aggregates. The experimental investigation involved density measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, and accumulated energy tests. The results indicate that the PCM content increases, the heating and cooling rates are lower, and the temperature difference between the ambient exposed face and the not-exposed face of tested slabs increases. Additionally, the latent heat energy contribution increases when the material is exposed to lower temperature gradients, coinciding with the temperature range at which phase change occurs. The total energy accumulated in mortars with 10% and 20% PCM content increases in 238–330%, respectively, for a 5 ºC temperature gradient. However, when a 15 ºC temperature gradient is used, the accumulated energy increases at 70% and 88%, respectively.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Recently predicted altermagnetic phase features an unconventional and attractive combination of a strong T$${{{{{{{\mathcal{T}}}}}}}}$$-symmetry breaking in the electronic structure and a zero or only weak-relativistic magnetization. In this work, we experimentally observe the anomalous Hall effect, a prominent representative of the T$${{{{{{{\mathcal{T}}}}}}}}$$-symmetry breaking responses, in the absence of an external magnetic field in epitaxial thin-film Mn5Si3 with a vanishingly small net magnetic moment. By symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations we demonstrate that the unconventional d-wave altermagnetic phase is consistent with the experimental structural and magnetic characterization of the Mn5Si3 epilayers, and that the theoretical anomalous Hall conductivity generated by the phase is sizable, in agreement with experiment. An analogy with unconventional d-wave superconductivity suggests that our identification of a candidate of unconventional d-wave altermagnetism points towards a new chapter of research and applications of magnetic phases.","The authors acknowledge the Czech Science Foundation project no. 22-17899K and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) project no. 452301518.

The genome maintenance mechanisms responsible for GBM chemoresistance and hypermutation are unknown. We show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18 (a proximal regulator of TLS) is activated in a Mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent manner in TMZ-treated GBM cells, promoting post-replicative gap-filling and survival. An unbiased CRISPR screen provides an aerial map of RAD18-interacting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways deployed by GBM to tolerate TMZ genotoxicity. Analysis of mutation signatures from TMZ-treated GBM reveals a role for RAD18 in error-free bypass of O6mG (the most toxic TMZ-induced lesion), and error-prone bypass of other TMZ-induced lesions. Our analyses of recurrent GBM patient samples establishes a correlation between low RAD18 expression and hypermutation. Taken together we define molecular underpinnings for the hallmark tumorigenic phenotypes of TMZ-treated GBM.","The authors thank Dr. Russell O.

The research utilized a quantitative, correlational, cross-sectional methodology with 430 millennials participating. A 20-item survey was administered face-to-face at shopping centers in Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador. The validity of the research model was established through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), employing SPSS 20 and AMOS 24 for statistical evaluations. Findings reveal that green advertising significantly shapes environmental attitudes (β: 0.245) and awareness (β: 0.110), as well as directly influences the purchasing behavior (β: 0.154) towards green products. While eco-labels do not exert a direct effect on purchasing behavior (β: 0.128), they significantly inform attitudes (β: 0.406) and ecological awareness (β: 0.277) of millennials who purchase organic products. This paper is among the pioneering research to delineate the correlation between green advertising elements and the purchasing patterns of green products among millennials in a developing nation. It concludes that marketing strategies centered on green advertising and eco-labels do affect millennials' attitudes and environmental consciousness, but only advertising has a direct impact on purchasing behaviors, contrary to eco-labels. The research bears social significance as it affirms that millennials are attentive to environmental issues and are actively engaged in promoting sustainability.","We thank the College of Economists of Cajamarca—Peru, for having endorsed this research through its college’s ethics committee.",This research received no external funding.,Foods,,,,2024-01-11,2024,2024-01-11,,13,2,228,All OA; Gold,Article,"Carrión-Bósquez, Nelson; Veas-González, Iván; Naranjo-Armijo, Franklin; Llamo-Burga, Mary; Ortiz-Regalado, Oscar; Ruiz-García, Wilfredo; Guerra-Regalado, Wilson; Vidal-Silva, Cristian","Carrión-Bósquez, Nelson (Departamento de Administración, Facultad de Economía y Administración, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, iveas@ucn.cl); Veas-González, Iván (Departamento de Administración, Facultad de Economía y Administración, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, iveas@ucn.cl); Naranjo-Armijo, Franklin (Carrera de Administración de Empresas, Instituto Superior Tecnológico Japón, Santo Domingo 170120, Ecuador;, fnaranjo@itsjapon.edu.ec); Llamo-Burga, Mary (Escuela Profesional de Ingeniería en Agronegocios, Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06001, Peru;, mllamob@unc.edu.pe, (M.L.-B.);, oortizr@unc.edu.pe, (O.O.-R.);, wruizg@unc.edu.pe, (W.R.-G.)); Ortiz-Regalado, Oscar (Escuela Profesional de Ingeniería en Agronegocios, Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06001, Peru;, mllamob@unc.edu.pe, (M.L.-B.);, oortizr@unc.edu.pe, (O.O.-R.);, wruizg@unc.edu.pe, (W.R.-G.)); Ruiz-García, Wilfredo (Escuela Profesional de Ingeniería en Agronegocios, Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06001, Peru;, mllamob@unc.edu.pe, (M.L.-B.);, oortizr@unc.edu.pe, (O.O.-R.);, wruizg@unc.edu.pe, (W.R.-G.)); Guerra-Regalado, Wilson (CENTRUM Catolica Graduate Business School, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Lima 15088, Peru;, wguerrar@pucp.edu.pe); Vidal-Silva, Cristian (Escuela de Computación e Informática, Facultad de Ingeniería, Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Santiago 8370993, Chile;, cristianvidal@docente.ubo.cl)","Carrión-Bósquez, Nelson (Catholic University of the North)","Carrión-Bósquez, Nelson (Catholic University of the North); Veas-González, Iván (Catholic University of the North); Naranjo-Armijo, Franklin (Carrera de Administración de Empresas, Instituto Superior Tecnológico Japón, Santo Domingo 170120, Ecuador;, fnaranjo@itsjapon.edu.ec); Llamo-Burga, Mary (National University of Cajamarca); Ortiz-Regalado, Oscar (National University of Cajamarca); Ruiz-García, Wilfredo (National University of Cajamarca); Guerra-Regalado, Wilson (Pontifical Catholic University of Peru); Vidal-Silva, Cristian (Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/2/228/pdf?version=1704952729,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167891116,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology",

To address these challenges, this study investigates the impact of waste glass and limestone powder as partial substitutes for silica fume and cement in UHPC. For this, three distinct formulations are studied (Control, Optimized-1, and Optimized-2), representing different dosages of waste glass and limestone powder. The research focuses on six critical properties (compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, initial surface absorption, density absorption, voids, and chloride ion penetration) evaluated at different ages (1, 7, 28, and 90 days for compressive strength, and 7, 28, and 90 days for the remaining properties). So, a total of 171 test specimens were examined, with 3 samples for each age and formulation. Statistical analysis, using ANOVA, assessed and confirmed the significance of the factors in the experimental results. The findings provide comprehensive insights into the UHPC formulations, highlighting the influence of waste glass and limestone powder on specified properties over varying ages. The research reveals that, despite the optimized blends exhibiting lower compressive strength values, all mixes surpass the 150 MPa threshold for cylindrical samples at the 90-day mark. Moreover, the Control mix consistently outperforms the optimized blends in modulus of elasticity at all ages, meeting ACI 239 criteria. The void content analysis shows encouraging trends, with all formulations displaying voids of less than 5% on the seventh day, improving during the curing process. Notably, Optimized-2 demonstrates superior performance over the Control mix after 90 days. Chloride ion penetration is minimal for all blends after 90 days, confirming the effectiveness of mineral admixtures. ANOVA analysis confirms significant impacts of formulation and age on various UHPC characteristics, emphasizing the consistent reduction in performance with alternative mineral additions. The interaction between formulation and age implies variations in property evolution, suggesting potential convergence with alternative formulations.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

These methods must obtain a new set of coefficients for each tool position relative to the workpiece, which becomes cumbersome for surface machining with multiple tool-to-workpiece orientations, which is typical for LPBF parts. As a first step to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a new methodology for calculating cutting coefficients sensitive to material shear strength changes when the tool changes orientation. To this end, a vector inverse model based on the instantaneous contact area is presented. The shear coefficients obtained from the present model make physical sense and provide the basis for predicting cutting coefficients for multiple tool orientations from recently developed microstructure-based models. For the model verification, prismatic IN718 LPBF samples were manufactured and machined with a peripheral endmill for three tool orientations (cases). The material was characterized with SEM and EBSD, and the plastic anisotropy was verified. The coefficients obtained with the proposed model presented a high correlation (0.97) with the cutting resistance in contrast to those obtained with the linear inverse model, which establishes that the vector-based mechanistic coefficients are more appropriate for anisotropic materials. The simulated cutting forces from the coefficients obtained through the proposed model were compared with the experimental forces, observing similar patterns and levels. The coefficients obtained with the model allow average forces to be obtained with a prediction error between 5 and 15 %, depending on the percentage of instantaneous data used to estimate the mean value of the coefficients.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Engineering Science and Technology an International Journal,,,,2024-04,2024,,2024-04,52,,101650,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pérez-Ruiz, José David; de Lacalle, Luis Norberto López; Urbikain, Gorka; Álvarez, Hugo; Pacheco, Jovanny","Pérez-Ruiz, José David (Universidad del País vasco, Bilbao, Spain; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain); de Lacalle, Luis Norberto López (Universidad del País vasco, Bilbao, Spain; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain); Urbikain, Gorka (Universidad del País vasco, Bilbao, Spain; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain); Álvarez, Hugo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Pacheco, Jovanny (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Pérez-Ruiz, José David (University of the Basque Country; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain)","Pérez-Ruiz, José David (University of the Basque Country; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain); de Lacalle, Luis Norberto López (University of the Basque Country; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain); Urbikain, Gorka (University of the Basque Country; Centro de fabricación avanzada aeronáutica, CFAA, Zamudio, Spain); Álvarez, Hugo (Universidad del Norte); Pacheco, Jovanny (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2024.101650,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170106226,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

Various protection schemes that allow correct operation of microgrids have been proposed for individual systems in different topologies and connections. Nevertheless, protection schemes for networked microgrids are still in development, and further research is required to design and operate advanced protection in interconnected systems. Interconnection of these microgrids in different nodes with various interconnection technologies increases fault occurrence and complicates protection operation. This paper aims to point out challenges in developing protection for networked microgrids, potential solutions, and research areas that need to be addressed for their development. First, this article presents a systematic analysis of different microgrid clusters proposed since 2016, including several architectures of networked microgrids, operation modes, components, and utilization of renewable sources, which have not been widely explored in previous review papers. Second, the paper presents a discussion on protection systems currently available for microgrid clusters, current challenges, and solutions that have been proposed for these systems.

We first confront the scenario with various datasets, from the Hubble function (OHD), Pantheon, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and their joint observations, and we show that η has a preference for a non-zero value, namely, a deviation from ΛCDM cosmology is favored, although the zero value is marginally inside the 1σ confidence level. However, we find that the present Hubble function value acquires a higher value, namely, H0=66.624−0.013+0.011 Km s−1 Mpc−1, which implies that the H0 tension can be partially alleviated. Additionally, we perform a cosmographic analysis, showing that the universe transits from deceleration to acceleration in the recent cosmological past; nevertheless, in the future, it will not result in a de Sitter phase since it exhibits a second transition from acceleration to deceleration. Finally, we perform the statefinder analysis. The scenario behaves similarly to the ΛCDM paradigm at high redshifts, while the deviation becomes significant at late and recent times and especially in the future.",J. K. Singh wishes to thank M.

In contrast to traditional methods that split the data into separate training and testing sets, here we propose an innovative approach where subsets of the original data are randomly selected to train the model multiple times. This iterative training process aims to identify a representative data subset, leading to improved inferences about the population. Additionally, we introduce a novel distance-based kernel specifically designed for binary-type features based on a similarity matrix that efficiently handles both binary and multi-class classification problems. Computational experiments on publicly available datasets of varying sizes demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the distance-based kernel achieves superior performance compared to other well-known kernels from the literature and those used in previous studies on the same datasets. These findings validate the effectiveness of our proposed classification method and distance-based kernel for SVMs. By leveraging random subset selection and a unique kernel design, we achieve notable improvements in classification accuracy.

Consequently, there is growing interest in understanding the what, the why and the how for designing AR applications in practice to boost ecotourism experiences, with the purpose of enhancing customer value creation and organizations differentiation. Consequently, the authors conducted an eleven-month practical theoretical study in 10 ecotourism SMEs purposefully recruited in Latin America, adopting service design as a main research framework. Using interviews, contextual analyses, buyer personas, observation, storytelling creation sessions, prototyping sessions and accompaniment sessions as research methods, researchers studied, (1) what were the key facilitators and hinderers for designing AR in practice at the SMEs ecotourism context following a service design lens and, (2) how the inherent principles of service design influence ecotourism SME's for the strategically adoption of AR in their service experiences. The study suggests key elements that can facilitate or hinder designing AR at ecotourism SME's Experiences in practice. Furthermore, the authors suggest a practical protocol for designing AR for ecotourism SMEs from the lens of service design (SD), User Experience (UX), and Augmented Reality (AR). Finally, the study also contributes to shade light on the marketing role and potential adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) in practice in SME's through a service design lens.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Mario Giraldo reports financial support was provided by Alianza 4U (Universidad del Norte, Universidad Icesi, Universidad EAFIT, CESA).

The natural lignocellulosic fibers (NLFs) used in these composites have advantages such as reduced density, reduced fragmentation and concrete cracking, thus improving flexural performance and durability. Coconut-fiber is one of those natural fibers and its use presents technical, ecological, social and economic benefits, as it is improperly disposed of, representing a large waste of natural resources, in addition to causing environmental pollution.. Thus, composites reinforced with natural fibers are promising materials for the construction industry, as in addition to meeting the sustainability of buildings, there will also be a reduction in urban solid waste generated and gains for structures with the use of environmentally friendly materials that meet to active efforts and with greater durability. This work aims to evaluate the tensile behavior of green coconut-fibers subjected to different drying temperatures through chemical, thermal (TG/DSC), morphological, visual and mechanical analysis. Drying temperatures of 70 °C, 100 °C and 130 °C were analyzed and the results indicated that the drying temperature at 70 °C was satisfactory, providing fiber-reinforced composites with good tensile strength, combined with good ductility.","The authors would like to thank Ifes for the opportunity and for all the infrastructure offered to carry out the mechanical tests, thermogravimetric analysis and optical microscopy and the Laboratory of Cellular Ultrastructure Carlos Alberto Redins (LUCCAR) and the Laboratory of Plant Physiology of UFES for carrying out the micrographs scanning electronics and chemical analysis, respectively.

Previous Karenia events with devastating effects on caged salmon and the wild fauna of Chilean Patagonia had been restricted to offshore waters, eventually reaching the southern coasts of Chiloé Island through the channel connecting the Chiloé Inland Sea to the Pacific Ocean. This event occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 lockdown when monitoring activities were slackened. A few salmon mortalities were related to other fish-killing species (e.g., Margalefidinium polykrikoides). As in the major Karenia event in 1999, the austral summer of 2020 was characterised by negative anomalies in rainfall and river outflow and a severe drought in March. Karenia spp. appeared to have been advected in a warm (14-15 °C) surface layer of estuarine saline water (S > 21). A lack of daily vertical migration patterns and cells dispersed through the whole water column suggested a declining population. Satellite images confirmed the decline, but gave evidence of dynamic multifrontal patterns of temperature and chl a distribution. A conceptual circulation model is proposed to explain the hypothetical retention of the Karenia bloom by a coastally generated eddy coupled with the semidiurnal tides at the mouth of Pitipalena Fjord. Thermal fronts generated by (topographically induced) upwelling around the Tic Toc Seamount are proposed as hot spots for the accumulation of swimming dinoflagellates in summer in the southern Chiloé Inland Sea. The results here provide helpful information on the environmental conditions and water column structure favouring Karenia occurrence. Thermohaline properties in the surface layer in summer can be used to develop a risk index (positive if the EFW layer is thin or absent).","The authors thank Jaime Valencia of the Fisheries Research Program, Universidad Austral, for all the technical assistance provided during the sampling campaign.

These controllers are designed using sliding mode control principles with built-in predictive structures. Previous studies have already demonstrated the effectiveness of these controllers in non-self-regulating systems with non-dominant delays. However, in this study, we investigate the extension of these controllers to systems with time-dominated time-delay processes. To thoroughly evaluate the performance of both approaches, we conduct extensive tests involving set-point changes and perturbations. The results indicate that the proposed methods outperform conventional techniques in both scenarios. The evaluation metrics used include integral squared error (ISE), total control variation (TVU), settling time, and maximum overshoot. In general, the new dynamic sliding mode controllers exhibit superior capabilities in handling systems with significant delays compared to standard controllers.","Declaration of Competing Interest The author declares that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this manuscript.

In this regard, an exploratory bibliometric study was carried out to examine the utilization of smart conversational agents, ChatGPT, and artificial intelligence bots in medical education. Methods A retrospective, observational, cross-sectional bibliometric analysis was employed to assess the scientific publications listed in Scopus. This study was conducted on March 11, 2023 in search for information in Scopus. A total of 220 relevant documents were identified that were available in the Scopus database during the period between 2017 and 2022. Elsevier's SciVal software was used. Subsequently, statistical tables and graphs were prepared for presentation in Bibliometrix software. Results Among the authors, Timothy W. Bickmore, from the United States, has the highest number of publications (10) and citations received (172), and an h-index of 45, suggesting a significant influence in the field of study. The subcategory with the highest academic output is Health Informatics with 133 publications, while Geriatrics and Gerontology has the least with only 3. Most of the analyzed publications (44.2%) originated from collaborations within the same country. Notably, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and Imperial College London stood out with 12 publications each that received over 200 citations indicating their significant impact on their respective fields. Despite having the highest number of academic publications (15), Brazil had a relatively low field-weighted citation impact (0.64) and received the lowest number of citations (81). A clustering analysis was performed on a sample of 10 concepts using 2 dimensions. The results indicated that all terms were part of the same cluster. Notably, the terms 'conversational agents', 'chatbots', 'conversational agent', and 'chatbot' were closely related. Conclusions It was found that the American Bickmore, Timothy W., led the top-10 researchers, and that the Health Informatics subject area was the most predominant. However, Brazil and Germany were the leading countries in terms of research output that was mainly published in high impact journals (Q1).",,,Educación Médica,,,,2024-03,2024,,2024-03,25,2,100873,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayta-Tovalino, Frank; Espinoza-Carhuancho, Fran; Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel; Mauricio-Vilchez, Cesar; Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo; Barja-Ore, John","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Faculty of Systems and Computer Engineering, Department of Master’s in information and Knowledge Management, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú); Espinoza-Carhuancho, Fran (Grupo de Bibliometria, Evaluación de evidencia y Revisiones Sistemáticas (BEERS), Human Medicine Career, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Perú); Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel (Postgraduate Department, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Perú); Mauricio-Vilchez, Cesar (Postgraduate Department, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Perú); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Barja-Ore, John (Academic Department, Dirección de Investigación, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú)","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (National University of San Marcos)","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (National University of San Marcos); Espinoza-Carhuancho, Fran (Scientific University of the South); Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel (Federico Villarreal National University); Mauricio-Vilchez, Cesar (Federico Villarreal National University); Munive-Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Barja-Ore, John (Private University of the North)",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edumed.2023.100873,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166480877,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

In particular, we consider a vector field in the metric on a Lorentz tangent bundle, and thus the curvatures of horizontal and vertical spaces, as well as the extra contributions of torsion and non-linear connection, provide an intrinsic richer geometrical structure, with additional degrees of freedom, that lead to extra terms in the field equations. Applying these modified field equations at a cosmological setup we extract the generalized Friedmann equations for the horizontal and vertical space, showing that we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the richer underlying structure of the tangent bundle. Additionally, as it is common in Finsler-like constructions, we obtain an effective interaction between matter and geometry. Finally, we consider a specific model and we show that it can describe the sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, and that the dark-energy equation of state can lie in the quintessence or phantom regimes, or cross the phantom divide.","The authors acknowledge the contribution of the LISA CosWG, and of COST Actions CA18108 “Quantum Gravity Phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach” and CA21136 “Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics (CosmoVerse)”.",,European Physical Journal C,,,,2024-05-28,2024,2024-05-28,,84,5,538,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kapsabelis, E.; Saridakis, Emmanuel N.; Stavrinos, P.

We introduce the deformed Schwarzschild black hole solution, which depends on the noncommutative parameter Θ. We then extract the master equation as a Schrödinger-like equation, giving the explicit expression of the effective potential which is modified due to the noncommutative corrections. After that, we solve the master equation numerically. The significance of these results is twofold. Firstly, our results can be related to the detection of gravitational waves by the near future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA, which will have a significantly increased accuracy. In particular, these observed gravitational waves produced by binary strong gravitational systems have oscillating modes which can provide valuable information. Secondly, our results can serve as an additional tool to test the predictions of GR, as well as to examine the possible detection of this kind of gravitational corrections.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Emmanuel Saridakis reports financial support was provided by European Cooperation in Science and Technology (CA18108).

A fundamental aspect of healthy aging, intrinsic capacity, is the primary focus of this study. Our objective is to evaluate the social inequalities connected with the trajectories of intrinsic capacity, shedding light on the impacts of socioeconomic position, gender, and ethnicity.MethodsOur dynamic cohort study was rooted in three waves (2009, 2014, 2017) of the World Health Organization’s Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health in Mexico. We incorporated a nationally representative sample comprising 2722 older Mexican adults aged 50 years and over. Baseline measurements of socioeconomic position, gender, and ethnicity acted as the exposure variables. We evaluated intrinsic capacity across five domains: cognition, psychological, sensory, vitality, and locomotion. The Relative Index of Inequality and Slope Index of Inequality were used to quantify socioeconomic disparities.ResultsWe discerned three distinct intrinsic capacity trajectories: steep decline, moderate decline, and slight increase. Significant disparities based on wealth, educational level, gender, and ethnicity were observed. Older adults with higher wealth and education typically exhibited a trajectory of moderate decrease or slight increase in intrinsic capacity. In stark contrast, women and indigenous individuals were more likely to experience a steeply declining trajectory.ConclusionsThese findings underscore the pressing need to address social determinants, minimize gender and ethnic discrimination to ensure equal access to resources and opportunities across the lifespan. It is imperative for policies and interventions to prioritize these social determinants in order to promote healthy aging and alleviate health disparities. This approach will ensure that specific demographic groups receive customized support to sustain their intrinsic capacity during their elder years.",Not applicable.,"SAGE is supported by WHO and the US National Institute on Aging through Interagency Agreements (OGHA04034785, YA1323-08-CN-0020, and Y1-AG-1005-01) and a competitive grant: R01AG034479.

Methods: Demographics, diagnosis, comorbidities, disease activity, treatments and PROMIS instrument data were analysed. Primary outcomes were PROMIS Global Physical Health (GPH) and Global Mental Health (GMH) scores. Factors affecting GPH and GMH scores in IIMs were identified using multivariable regression analysis.
Results: We analysed responses from 1582 IIM, 4700 non-IIM AIRD and 545 nrAID patients and 3675 controls gathered through 23 May 2022. The median GPH scores were the lowest in IIM and non-IIM AIRD patients {13 [interquartile range (IQR) 10-15] IIMs vs 13 [11-15] non-IIM AIRDs vs 15 [13-17] nrAIDs vs 17 [15-18] controls, P < 0.001}. The median GMH scores in IIM patients were also significantly lower compared with those without autoimmune diseases [13 (IQR 10-15) IIMs vs 15 (13-17) controls, P < 0.001]. Inclusion body myositis, comorbidities, active disease and glucocorticoid use were the determinants of lower GPH scores, whereas overlap myositis, interstitial lung disease, depression, active disease, lower PROMIS Physical Function 10a and higher PROMIS Fatigue 4a scores were associated with lower GMH scores in IIM patients.
Conclusion: Both physical and mental health are significantly impaired in IIM patients, particularly in those with comorbidities and increased fatigue, emphasizing the importance of patient-reported experiences and optimized multidisciplinary care to enhance well-being in people with IIMs.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

One worrisome type of cancer is bone cancer, such as osteosarcoma and Ewing tumors, which occur more frequently in infants. This study shows an active interest in the use of graphene oxide and its derivatives in therapy against bone cancer. We present a systematic review analyzing the current state of the art related to the use of GO in treating osteosarcoma, through evaluating the existing literature. In this sense, studies focused on GO-based nanomaterials for potential applications against osteosarcoma were reviewed, which has revealed that there is an excellent trend toward the use of GO-based nanomaterials, based on their thermal and anti-cancer activities, for the treatment of osteosarcoma through various therapeutic approaches. However, more research is needed to develop highly efficient localized therapies. It is suggested, therefore, that photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and the use of nanocarriers should be considered as non-invasive, more specific, and efficient alternatives in the treatment of osteosarcoma. These options present promising approaches to enhance the effectiveness of therapy while also seeking to reduce side effects and minimize the damage to surrounding healthy tissues. The bibliometric analysis of photothermal and photochemical treatments of graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide from January 2004 to December 2022 extracted 948 documents with its search strategy, mainly related to research papers, review papers, and conference papers, demonstrating a high-impact field supported by the need for more selective and efficient bone cancer therapies. The central countries leading the research are the United States, Iran, Italy, Germany, China, South Korea, and Australia, with strong collaborations worldwide. At the same time, the most-cited papers were published in journals with impact factors of more than 6.0 (2021), with more than 290 citations.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a valuable marker for identifying patients at high risk of age-related mortality and various disorders and diseases. However, its association with poor patient outcomes following hip fractures has yet to be fully established. Hence, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate and gain a better understanding of the relationship between RDW levels and the risk of mortality after hip fractures. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and other databases were comprehensively searched until April 2023 to identify relevant studies. The meta-analysis included observational studies finding the association between RDW at admission or preoperation and short-term and long-term mortality rates following hip fractures. The results were presented in terms of odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: This meta-analysis included 10 studies involving 5834 patients with hip fractures. Patients with preoperative RDW of over 14.5% had higher risks of 1-year (OR: 5.40, 95% CI: 1.89-15.48, p = 0.002) and 3-month (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.42-5.95, p = 0.004) mortality. Higher admission or preoperative RDW was significantly associated with an 11% higher mortality risk after 1 year (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17, p < 0.00001). Patients with higher preoperative RDW had a significantly higher risk of 6-month mortality, which was three times that of those with lower preoperative RDW (OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.60-5.61, p = 0.0006). Higher preoperative RDW was correlated to a higher 30-day mortality risk (OR: 6.44, 95% CI: 3.32-12.47, p < 0.00001). Conclusions: Greater RDW values at admission or before surgery were associated with a higher risk of short-term and long-term mortality following hip fractures. Because RDW can be easily measured using a routine blood test at a low cost, this parameter is promising as an indicator of mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures.",The authors are grateful to Wan Fang Hospital and Taipei Medical University (Grant numbers A-112-002-W and 113-wf-eva-31) for financially supporting this research.,This research was funded by Wan Fang Hospital and Taipei Medical University (Grant numbers A-112-002-W and 113-wf-eva-31).,Medicina,,Vassilios S.

Large, diverse, and clean data are essential for learning these types of algorithms. Although data can be collected automatically, the data cleaning process is time-consuming. This study aims to provide the model with the ability to learn even when the data are not completely clean. For this purpose, we extend the Attentive Feature MixUp method to enable its learning on noisy multi-label food data. The extension was based on the hypothesis that during the MixUp phase, when a pair of images are mixed, the resulting soft labels should be different for each ingredient, being larger for ingredients that are mixed with the background because they are better distinguished than when they are mixed with other ingredients. Furthermore, to address data perturbation, the incorporation of the Laplace approximation as a post-hoc method was analyzed. The evaluation of the proposed method was performed on two food datasets, where a notable performance improvement was obtained in terms of Jaccard index and F1 score, which validated the hypothesis raised.

The use of health services supported by information technology is increasing worldwide, and Latin America is no exception. Factors such as needing more specialists in peripheral cities, large geographic areas, and socio-cultural aspects limit the possibility of receiving timely and quality medical care services. Information Technology (IT) for health purposes, such as e-health, is a cost-effective solution for equitable access to quality healthcare services and optimization of the rising associated costs. As an e-health service, telemedicine facilitates and mediates distance communication between the patient and medical staff. Even though Latin America is at the beginning of the development of telemedicine, it would have a relevant impact, given the geographic and socioeconomic conditions of the population in this part of the world. Drawing on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) theory, we developed a theoretical model to identify the latent factors influencing the public acceptance of telemedicine and examined their interrelationships. A survey questionnaire was designed and administered to 391 residents in Antofagasta, a mine region of Chile. After that, structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the survey data. The results reveal that the UTAUT2 factors' performance expectancy, social influence, and price value significantly impact the intention to use (R2 = 0.693). Additionally, the model presented a good fit. This study enriches the existing theoretical research on the acceptance of telemedicine services and offers insights into understanding and managing technology in the Chilean health sector.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Projections for SDG7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all) indicate a slowdown in the pace of electrification. Thus, the problem of poverty will persist in many regions as long as access to electricity remains difficult. This work analyzes some solutions to the lack of electricity supply in a rural community using organic waste from its economic activity and the integration of other available renewable sources to make electricity affordable and reliable. A model that minimizes the levelized cost of energy and restricts the proportion of annual energy not supplied to less than 5% of the community’s annual demand optimizes the performance of off-grid and on-grid systems. These systems have in common the production of electricity from biogas produced from swine manure, supplemented with wind and solar generation. Batteries and diesel generators support the operation of off-grid systems. As expected, the grid-connected system presented the best performance; however, the result reaffirms the need for governments to ensure the policy and infrastructure conditions that facilitate the grid connection of vulnerable communities to achieve SDG7.","We thank the community that lives in the village of Las Nubes for their willingness to collaborate.

1149,pub.1172903903,10.3390/su16125077,,,A Comprehensive Overview of Recycled Glass as Mineral Admixture for Circular UHPC Solutions,"This review article analyzes the influence of recycled glass (as sand and powder) beyond the durability, rheology and compressive strength of plain UHPC, even exploring flexural and direct tensile performance in fiber-reinforced UHPC. Interactions with other mineral admixtures like limestone powder, rice husk ash, fly ash, FC3R, metakaolin and slags, among others, are analyzed. Synergy with limestone powder improves rheology, reducing superplasticizer usage. Research highlights waste glass–UHPC mixtures with reduced silica fume and cement content by over 50% and nearly 30%, respectively, with compressive strengths exceeding 150 MPa, cutting costs and carbon footprints. Furthermore, with the proper fiber dosage, waste glass–UHPC reported values for strain and energy absorption capacity, albeit lower than those of traditional UHPC formulations with high cement, silica fume and quartz powder content, surpassing requirements for demanding applications such as seismic reinforcement of structures. Moreover, durability remains comparable to that of traditional UHPC. In addition, the reported life cycle analysis found that the utilization of glass powder in UHPC allows a greater reduction of embedded CO2 than other mineral additions in UHPC without jeopardizing its properties. In general, the review study presented herein underscores recycled glass’s potential in UHPC, offering economic and performance advantages in sustainable construction.","Special thanks go to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Universidad del Norte for their invaluable support and assistance throughout the research process.

This work intends to examine the viability of a novel recycling alternative for fly ashes as a component of fire-resistant plates. To lessen the quantity of heavy metal leaching, the fly ash was utilized after being washed using a water/fly ash ratio of 2 for one hour. Subsequently, an inexpensive, straightforward molding and curing process was used to create a plate, with a composition of 60%wt of MSWI-FA, 30%wt of gypsum, 0.5%wt of glass fiber and 9.5%wt of vermiculite. The plate exhibited high fire resistance. Furthermore, it demonstrated compression, flexural strength and surface hardness slightly lower than the requirements of European Standards. This allows for manufacturing plates with a high washed MSWI-FA content as fire protection in firewalls and doors for homes and commercial buildings. A Life Cycle Assessment was carried out. The case study shows that a 60% substitution of gypsum resulted in an environmental impact reduction of 8-48% for all impact categories examined, except four categories impacts (marine eutrophication, human toxicity (cancer), human non-carcinogenic toxicity and water depletion, where it increased between 2 and 718 times), due to the previous washing of MSWI-FA. When these fly ashes are used as a raw material in fire-resistant materials, they may be recycled and offer environmental advantages over more conventional materials like gypsum.",,This research was funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain under project number PID2019-110928RB-C33.,Materials,,,,2024-04-15,2024,2024-04-15,,17,8,1813,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peceño, Begoña; Luna-Galiano, Yolanda; Varela, Fabiola; Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé; Leiva, Carlos","Peceño, Begoña (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, begopc@ucn.cl, (B.P.);, fabiola.varela@ucn.cl, (F.V.)); Luna-Galiano, Yolanda (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Ambiental, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería, Universidad de Sevilla, Camino de los Descubrimientos s/n, 41092 Seville, Spain;, yluna@us.es, (Y.L.-G.);, bernabeaf@us.es, (B.A.-F.)); Varela, Fabiola (Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, begopc@ucn.cl, (B.P.);, fabiola.varela@ucn.cl, (F.V.)); Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Ambiental, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería, Universidad de Sevilla, Camino de los Descubrimientos s/n, 41092 Seville, Spain;, yluna@us.es, (Y.L.-G.);, bernabeaf@us.es, (B.A.-F.)); Leiva, Carlos (Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Ambiental, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería, Universidad de Sevilla, Camino de los Descubrimientos s/n, 41092 Seville, Spain;, yluna@us.es, (Y.L.-G.);, bernabeaf@us.es, (B.A.-F.))","Leiva, Carlos (University of Seville)","Peceño, Begoña (Catholic University of the North); Luna-Galiano, Yolanda (University of Seville); Varela, Fabiola (Catholic University of the North); Alonso-Fariñas, Bernabé (University of Seville); Leiva, Carlos (University of Seville)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/8/1813/pdf?version=1713188921,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170743875,40 Engineering,
1066,pub.1170825258,10.3390/w16081139,,,Influence of Fluvial Discharges and Tides on the Salt Wedge Position of a Microtidal Estuary: Magdalena River,"The linkage between the salt wedge, tidal patterns, and the Magdalena River discharge is established by assessing the ensuing parameters: stratification (ϵ), buoyancy frequency (β), potential energy anomaly (φ), Richardson number by layers (RL), and bottom turbulent energy production (P). The salinity, temperature, density, and water velocity data utilized were derived from MOHID 3D, a previously tailored and validated model for the Magdalena River estuary. To grasp the dynamics of the river, a flow regime analysis was conducted during both the wet and dry climatic seasons of the Colombian Caribbean. The utilization of this model aimed to delineate the estuary’s spatial reach, considering flow rates spanning from 2000 to 6500 m3/s across two tidal cycles. This approach facilitates the prediction of the position, stability, and stratification degree of the salt front. Among the conclusions drawn, it is highlighted that: 1. The river flow serves as the principal conditioning agent for the system, inducing a strong estuary response to weather stations; 2. The extent of wedge intrusion and the river discharge exhibit a non-linear, inversely correlation; 3. Tidal waves cause differences of up to 1000 m in the horizontal extent of the wedge; 4. Widespread channel erosion occurs during the rainy season when the salt intrusion does not exceed 2 km; 5. Flocculation processes intensify during the transition between the dry and wet seasons; 6. The stability of the salt layering and the consolidation of the FSI–TMZ are contingent upon the geometric attributes of the channel.",,This research received no external funding.,Water,,,,2024-04-17,2024,2024-04-17,,16,8,1139,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cordero-Acosta, Jhonathan R.; Otero Díaz, Luis J.; Higgins Álvarez, Aldemar E.","Cordero-Acosta, Jhonathan R.

Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient affecting plant growth and metabolism; however, its regulation of color-related metabolites in pepper fruit has not been fully elucidated. This study analyzed the effects of N supply (0, 250, and 400 kg N ha-1) on the growth, fruit skin color, and targeted and non-target secondary metabolites of field-grown pepper fruits at the mature red stage. Overall, 16 carotenoids were detected, of which capsanthin, zeaxanthin, and capsorubin were the dominant ones. N application at 250 kg ha-1 dramatically increased contents of red pigment capsanthin, yellow-orange zeaxanthin and β-carotene, with optimum fruit yield. A total of 290 secondary metabolites were detected and identified. The relative content of most flavonoids and phenolic acids was decreased with increasing N supply. Correlation analysis showed that color parameters were highly correlated with N application rates, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, and coumarins. Collectively, N promoted carotenoid biosynthesis but downregulated phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, which together determined the spectrum of red color expression in pepper fruit. Our results provide a better understanding of the impact of N nutrition on pepper fruit color formation and related physiology, and identification of target metabolites for enhancement of nutritional quality and consumer appeal.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The use of betamethasone (10, 20, and 60 mg), dexamethasone (4 and 8 mg), methylprednisolone (16, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 125 mg), and prednisolone (10 and 20 mg) by different routes and likewise of celecoxib (200 mg), diclofenac (25, 30, 50, 75, and 100 mg), etoricoxib (120 mg), ibuprofen (400 and 600 mg), ketorolac (30 mg), meloxicam (7.5, 10, and 15 mg), nimesulide (100 mg), and rofecoxib (50 mg) administered by oral, intramuscular, and intravenous routes were found to reduce pain, edema, and trismus in patients undergoing third molar surgery. Data on adverse effects were poorly reported. Conclusion: Further randomized clinical trials should be conducted to confirm these findings, given the wide variety of drugs, doses, and routes of administration used.",,"The authors declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,,,2024-01-24,2024,2024-01-24,,14,,1303382,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pimenta, Régis Penha; Takahashi, Cristiane Midori; Barberato-Filho, Silvio; McClung, Delaine Cristina Ferreira; da Silva Moraes, Fabio; de Souza, Isabela Muniz; de Cássia Bergamaschi, Cristiane","Pimenta, Régis Penha (Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Course, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil); Takahashi, Cristiane Midori (Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Course, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil); Barberato-Filho, Silvio (Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Course, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil); McClung, Delaine Cristina Ferreira (Dental School, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil); da Silva Moraes, Fabio (Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Course, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil); de Souza, Isabela Muniz (Dental School, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil); de Cássia Bergamaschi, Cristiane (Pharmaceutical Sciences Graduate Course, University of Sorocaba, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil)","de Cássia Bergamaschi, Cristiane (Universidade de Sorocaba)","Pimenta, Régis Penha (Universidade de Sorocaba); Takahashi, Cristiane Midori (Universidade de Sorocaba); Barberato-Filho, Silvio (Universidade de Sorocaba); McClung, Delaine Cristina Ferreira (Universidade de Sorocaba); da Silva Moraes, Fabio (Universidade de Sorocaba); de Souza, Isabela Muniz (Universidade de Sorocaba); de Cássia Bergamaschi, Cristiane (Universidade de Sorocaba)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1303382/pdf?isPublishedV2=False,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168187165,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

Museums play an essential role in preserving and disseminating culture and history, and augmented reality has emerged as a powerful technological tool to enrich the visitor experience and ensure the sustainable preservation of cultural heritage. The fundamental objective of this literature review is to explore and understand the key contributions that are being made in the field of augmented reality applied to museums, with a focus on sustainability. The literature related to this topic is dispersed in various sources of information, which motivates the need to carry out a detailed and systematic analysis incorporating sustainability aspects. To carry out this analysis, the metaphor of the “tree of science” is used. This metaphor provides a structured approach that is applied in two complementary ways. Firstly, it focuses on collecting and analyzing scientometric statistics that cover data on countries, authors, academic institutions, and research centers involved in developing augmented reality applications for museums with sustainable methodologies. This quantitative perspective offers a global view of the contributions and their geographical scope including their sustainability impact. Secondly, an evolutionary analysis based on the “tree of science” is carried out. This historical approach examines the origin and evolution of contributions in the field of augmented reality applied to museums, from its first manifestations to the most recent innovations, with an emphasis on sustainable practices. This historical approach is essential to understanding the trajectory and development of augmented reality applications in the museum context and their role in promoting sustainable cultural heritage preservation. This review aims to provide a complete and contextualized view of the use of augmented reality in museums for the sustainable preservation and communication of cultural heritage. Through a multidimensional approach encompassing scientometric statistics and historical analysis, we seek to shed light on this technology’s most significant contributions and evolution in the museum sector, with a particular focus on sustainability.",,"This research was funded by the project “Strengthening the Social Appropriation of Culture and Cultural Identity Making Use of Augmented Reality in the Cultural Heritage of the Department of Cesar”, financed by the General Royalties System of Colombia for the Department of Cesar.

Objective: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of suicidal behavior and describe its related factors in the Coquimbo Region, Chile, between 2018 and 2020.
Methods: 2190 suicide attempt notifications from the regional epidemiological surveillance system were analyzed, corresponding to 1781 people, along with 217 reports from the Forensic Medical Service of people who died by suicide.
Results: The overall suicide rate for the region during that period was 9.79 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants. The 2018 rates were standardized according to available information, with direct methods for the regional rate (9.55 per 100 000 inhabitants) and indirect methods for the communes. Rural communes presented higher rates than urban ones. Women showed a higher risk of attempts (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.33) and a lower risk of suicide compared to men (0.086; 0.06 to 0.13). Young people had a higher risk of suicide attempts and a lower risk of suicide compared to older people. The increased suicide rates in older people (70 to 79 years) during 2020 are noteworthy. Basic education level is a risk variable for suicide (2.21; from 1.15 to 4.23), compared to having higher education. Previous suicide attempts and psychiatric pathology are risk factors.
Conclusions: Suicide prevalence and related factors are similar to those reported in other studies and national reports, highlighting rurality and higher risk in older male adults. In contrast to suicides, attempts are more frequent in women and young people. A history of mental health problems, previous attempts, and family violence are risk factors for both outcomes. Knowing the patterns of suicidal behavior in the population is fundamental for its prevention.",,,Medwave,,,"Adult; Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Adolescent; Suicidal Ideation; Chile; Suicide, Attempted; Educational Status; Public Health",2024-03-05,2024,2024-03-05,,24,02,e2770-e2770,All OA; Gold,Article,"Paz-Soto, Patricia; Games-Díaz, Larry; Ramírez-Santana, Muriel","Paz-Soto, Patricia (Subdepartamento de Salud Mental, Dirección de Servicio de Salud Coquimbo, La Serena, Chile.); Games-Díaz, Larry (Escuela de Arquitectura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Ramírez-Santana, Muriel (Departamento de Salud Pública, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile.)",,"Paz-Soto, Patricia (Subdepartamento de Salud Mental, Dirección de Servicio de Salud Coquimbo, La Serena, Chile.); Games-Díaz, Larry (Catholic University of the North); Ramírez-Santana, Muriel (Catholic University of the North)",2,2,,,https://www.medwave.cl/medios/investigacion/estudios/2770/medwave_2023_2770.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169454406,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The total phenolics content (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), anthocyanin (TAC) and glucosinolates (TGC) were determined by spectrophotometry. The profiles of phenolic acids, amino acids and fatty acids were determined by HPLC-UV-DAD, LC-DAD and GC-FID, respectively. Antioxidant potential was verified by DPPH and ORAC assays. The antiproliferative activity was measured in the human gastric cell line (AGS). Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and arachidonic acid models. VD showed high values of TPC = 11.89 ± 0.28 mg GAE/g d.m.; TFC = 11.30 ± 0.9 mg QE/g d.m.; TAC = 0.265 ± 0.01 mg Cya3glu/g d.m.; and TGC = 51.15 ± 3.31 µmol SE/g d.m. Caffeic acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid were identified. The predominant amino acid and fatty acid were glutamic acid and γ-linolenic acid, respectively.

We perform a detailed analysis of the scalar and tensor perturbations. We impose the requirement that the two scalar potentials, whose ratio is the post-Newtonian parameter γ$$\gamma $$, should deviate only minimally form general relativity. Additionally, concerning tensor perturbations we impose satisfaction of the LIGO-VIRGO and Fermi Gamma-ray Burst observations, and thus we result to a gravitational-wave equation with gravitational-wave speed equal to the speed of light, and where the only deviation from general relativity appears in the dispersion relation. Furthermore, we show that cubic gravity exhibits an effective Newton’s constant that depends on the model parameter, on the background evolution, and on the wavenumber scale. Hence, by requiring its deviation from the standard Newton’s constant to be within observational bounds we extract the constraints on the single coupling parameter β$$\beta $$.","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme “Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning” in the context of the project “Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research” (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).

Twenty PC mixtures considering four coarse aggregate granulometries (D máx and granulometric distribution) and varying compaction levels were produced. The molding process follows the Risson et al. (2021) method, which focuses on density control, for then asses the density, porosity, permeability, compressive strength, and flexural tensile strength of these mixtures. An analytical model to correlate the density (ρ) and the compaction blows number (N) was proposed. This model demonstrates that grain size influences both the minimum and maximum density, with smaller sizes (B0 =9.5 mm ) achieving higher densities during compaction. Furthermore, a comprehensive protocol for the analysis of PC, enabling a thorough characterization of PC using the same specimen was introduced. To assist construction professionals, a user-friendly graphical tool that offers predictive insights into PC performance (both hydraulic and mechanical) based on the key correlations found in the literature was devised. This tool reveals that, for hydraulic and mechanical correlations, granulometry is not the preeminent factor, and the data can be adjusted using a single curve that depends on the initial production conditions of the PC. This valuable tool aids in predicting performance in two ways: first, by considering the initial compaction level of the PC to determine its hydraulic and mechanical properties, and second, by determining the compaction level required to meet specific technical requirements.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon M PBH and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as Ω PBH , f , may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by τ ¯ NL , and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum P R ( k ) , which reads as τ ¯ NL P R ( k ) < 4 × 10 − 20 Ω PBH , f − 17 / 9 ( M PBH 10 4 g ) − 17 / 9 .","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Theodoros Papanikolaou reports financial support was provided by Foundation for Education and European Culture.

We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of f(T) theory, which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from general relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter Q, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red galaxies to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density profiles using the Navarro–Frenk–White profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract Q=−2.138−0.516+0.952×10−5 Mpc−2 at 1σ confidence. This result indicates that f(T) corrections on top of general relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the Akaike and Bayesian ones, and although the dependence of f(T) gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that f(T) gravity is more efficient in fitting the data compared to general relativity and the ΛCDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.","We thank Geyu Mo, Zhaoting Chen, Shurui Lin, Hongsheng Zhao, and Dongdong Zhang for valuable discussions.

In this literature review, a search for articles related to the metaverse in education, published in 2022 and 2023, has been conducted across six databases: Scopus, EBSCO Host, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis Online, IEEE Xplore, and Springer. The PRISMA methodology was used to analyze and systematize the manuscripts found. The aim of this research was to examine how integrating the metaverse into education can enhance educational accessibility and equity by enabling students to utilize virtual learning resources and opportunities. In addition, they can engage in interactions with others to learn and create interactive content during the teaching and learning process. This requires a commitment from the student because a connection between the student and the machine will be established through the use of emerging technologies. These technologies offer unique opportunities to enhance teaching quality, broaden access to education, and prepare individuals for an increasingly digital and evolving world. The analysis identified 14 emerging technologies: artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, blockchain, augmented reality, extended reality, virtual reality, 5G, EON-XR, digital twins, 3D virtual reality, and immersive virtual reality. These technologies offer immersion (simulation of a real world in a virtual world), interactivity (interaction with different people), improvement of the educational environment (innovative presentation of content), and motivation for learning (capturing attention). When it comes to the different types of learning, there are six categories: experiential (based on experience), collaborative (involving a guide to lead the process), cooperative (involving teamwork), significant (building on existing knowledge), explicit (self-directed learning), and emotional (involving the regulation of emotions).",,,International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy (iJEP),,,,2024-01-30,2024,2024-01-30,,14,1,61-81,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores-Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella; Olaya-Cotera, Sandro; Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando","Flores-Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella (UNIVERSIDAD CESAR VALLEJO); Olaya-Cotera, Sandro (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú)",,"Flores-Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella (Universidad César Vallejo); Olaya-Cotera, Sandro (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú)",2,2,,,https://online-journals.org/index.php/i-jep/article/download/42421/14537,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168411213,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,4 Quality Education
185,pub.1172672976,10.1038/s41612-024-00675-5,,,Extreme coastal El Niño events are tightly linked to the development of the Pacific Meridional Modes,"Coastal El Niño events—marine heatwaves instances in the far eastern Tropical Pacific during otherwise basin-scale neutral or cold conditions—can have severe societal impacts for countries along the west coast of South America, as exemplified by the 2017 and 2023 Peru-Ecuador floods. Due to the brevity of the observational record, it is not well understood whether these events are driven by local or large-scale processes. Here, to overcome this limitation we use a data-driven modeling approach to address their return period and forcing mechanisms. It is shown that extreme coastal El Niño events are a local manifestation in the eastern tropical Pacific of the constructive interactions of the Pacific Meridional Modes (PMM). Specifically, the North PMM yields a dipole-like anomaly SST pattern along the equator that favors its development, while the positive phase of the South PMM reinforces it. A smaller group of more moderate coastal events are remotely driven by zonal wind anomalies in the western tropical Pacific without the PMMs’ influence. The role of PMMs in the development of extreme coastal El Niño suggests that they may be more predictable than previously thought.","C.M. acknowledges support from Proyecto ANID Fondecyt Postdoctorado código 3200621, Data Observatory Foundation ANID Technology Center No. DO210001, Fondecyt Regular No. 1231174 and Research Office, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez.

Currently, there is no single test that can diagnose AD, especially in understudied populations and developing countries. Instead, diagnosis is based on a combination of medical history, physical examination, cognitive testing, and brain imaging. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles, primarily composed of RNA, that participate in physiological processes related to AD pathogenesis such as cell proliferation, immune response, and neuronal and cardiovascular function. However, the identification and understanding of the potential role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in AD diagnosis remain largely unexplored. Here, we clinically, cognitively, and genetically characterized a sample of 15 individuals diagnosed with AD (cases) and 15 controls from Barranquilla, Colombia. Advanced bioinformatics, analytics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques were used to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed between cases and controls. The expression of 28,909 lncRNAs was quantified. Of these, 18 were found to be differentially expressed and harbored in pivotal genes related to AD. Two lncRNAs, ENST00000608936 and ENST00000433747, show promise as diagnostic markers for AD, with ML models achieving > 95% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in both the training and testing datasets. These findings suggest that the expression profiles of lncRNAs could significantly contribute to advancing personalized AD diagnosis in this community, offering promising avenues for early detection and follow-up.","We express our highest appreciation to all individuals, their relatives, and their caregivers, who voluntarily participated in this study.

Because of this, different typologies of caregivers have been identified according to HLH during middle childhood and adolescence. However, the available studies have focused on aspects such as nutrition, physical activity, and rest, ignoring other HLHs that are equally important for children's well-being. Likewise, few studies address HLH during the first five years of life and how caregivers affect children's health. In a sample of 544 caregivers of children aged zero to five years from low-income Colombian communities, we established a typology of attitudes toward different HLHs. The results indicate the presence of three clusters that grouped caregivers with (1) positive attitudes toward all HLHs, (2) toward some HLHs, and (3) relatively low positive attitudes toward all HLHs.

While IgE epitopes of TM contribute to sensitization, T-cell (MHC-II) epitopes polarize the Th2 immune response. This study aimed to identify linear B and T consensus epitopes among house dust mites, cockroaches, Ascaris lumbricoides, shrimp, and mosquitoes, exploring the molecular basis of cross-reactivity in allergic diseases. Amino acid sequences of Der p 10, Der f 10, Blo t 10, Lit v 1, Pen a 1, Pen m 1, rAsc l 3, Per a 7, Bla g 7, and Aed a 10 were collected from Allergen Nomenclature and UniProt. B epitopes were predicted using AlgPred 2.0 and BepiPred 3.0. T epitopes were predicted with NetMHCIIpan 4.1 against 10 HLA-II alleles. Consensus epitopes were obtained through analysis and Epitope Cluster Analysis in the Immune Epitope Database. We found 7 B-cell epitopes and 28 linear T-cell epitopes binding to MHC II. A unique peptide (residues 160-174) exhibited overlap between linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes, highly conserved across tropomyosin sequences. These findings shed light on IgE cross-reactivity among the tested species. The described immuno-informatics pipeline and epitopes can inform in vitro research and guide synthetic multi-epitope proteins' design for potential allergology immunotherapies.

The calculations revealed that the adsorption energies of Ti-CO2-CO and O2 were -9.6, -12.5, and -2.32 Kcal/mol, respectively. Using the density functional theory in quantum calculations, the impacts of electronic properties and molecular structure on the adsorption of CO, O2, and CO2 on the Ziegler-Natta catalyst were thoroughly explored. Additionally, the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of adsorption were examined. It was discovered that strong adsorption and a significant energy release (-16.2 kcal/mol) during CO adsorption could explain why this gas caused the most substantial reductions in the ZN catalyst productivity.

Within the realm of health, a myriad of applications exists, contingent upon the nature of experimentation, the activities under scrutiny, and the methodology employed for data and information acquisition. This diversity opens doors to multifaceted applications, including support for the well-being and safeguarding of elderly individuals afflicted with neurodegenerative diseases, especially in the context of smart homes. Within the existing literature, a multitude of datasets from both indoor and outdoor environments have surfaced, significantly contributing to the activity identification processes. One prominent dataset, the CASAS project developed by Washington State University (WSU) University, encompasses experiments conducted in indoor settings. This dataset facilitates the identification of a range of activities, such as cleaning, cooking, eating, washing hands, and even making phone calls. This article introduces a model founded on the principles of Semi-supervised Ensemble Learning, enabling the harnessing of the potential inherent in distance-based clustering analysis. This technique aids in the identification of distinct clusters, each encapsulating unique activity characteristics. These clusters serve as pivotal inputs for the subsequent classification process, which leverages supervised techniques. The outcomes of this approach exhibit great promise, as evidenced by the quality metrics' analysis, showcasing favorable results compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Two different catalysts have been studied: CatY.0.00 was obtained from the standard zeolite (Y-0.00-M: without alkaline treatment) and CatY.0.20 was prepared from the desilicated zeolite (Y-0-20-M: treated with 0.20 M NaOH). The cracking tests were carried out in a microactivity test (MAT) unit with a fixed-bed reactor at 550 °C in the 20-50 s reaction time range, with a catalyst mass of 3 g and a mass flow rate of VGO of 2.0 g/min. The products obtained were grouped according to their boiling point range in dry gas (DG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), naphtha, and coke. The results showed a greater conversion and selectivity to gasoline with the CatY.0.20 catalyst, along with improved quality (RON) of the C5-C12 cut. Conversely, the CatY.0.00 catalyst (obtained from the Y-0.00-M zeolite) showed greater selectivity to gases (DG and LPG), attributable to the electronic confinement effect within the microporous channels of the zeolite. The nature of coke has been studied using different analysis techniques and the impact on the catalysts by comparing the properties of the fresh and deactivated catalysts. The coke deposited on the catalyst surfaces was responsible for the loss of activity; however, the CatY.0.20 catalyst showed greater resistance to deactivation by coke, despite showing the highest selectivity. Given that the reaction occurs in the acid sites of the zeolite and not in the matrix, the increased degree of mesoporosity of the zeolite in the CatY.0.20 catalyst facilitated the outward diffusion of products from the zeolitic channels to the matrix, thereby preserving greater activity.",,The authors thankfully acknowledge Universidad del Atlántico and Universidad del Norte for also supporting this project.,Molecules,,"Maria Bernardo, Márcia G.

While traditional therapeutic methods like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have demonstrated success in inhibiting tumor cell growth, their side effects often limit overall benefits and patient acceptance. In this regard, three different graphene oxides (GO) with variations in their degrees of oxidation were studied chemically and tissue-wise. The accuracy of the synthesis of the different GO was verified by robust techniques using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as conventional techniques such as infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), RAMAN spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The presence of oxygenated groups was of great importance. It affected the physicochemical properties of each of the different graphene oxides demonstrated in the presence of new vibrational modes related to the formation of new bonds promoted by the graphitization of the materials. The toxicity analysis in the Hep-2 cell line of graphene oxide formulations at 250 µg/mL on the viability and proliferation of these tumor cells showed low activity. GO formulations did not show high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains. However, the different graphene oxides showed biocompatibility in the subdermal implantation model for 30, 60, and 90 days in the biomodels.

However, the industrial processing of tomatoes generates a significant amount of waste. Specifically, 10% to 18% of the raw materials used in tomato processing become waste. This waste can seriously affect ecosystems, such as freshwater bodies, wetlands, rivers, and other natural environments, if not properly managed. Interestingly, tomato waste, specifically the skin, contains lycopene, a potent antioxidant and antimutagenic that offers a range of health benefits. This makes it a valuable ingredient in industries such as food and cosmetics. In addition, researchers are exploring the potential of lycopene in the treatment of various types of cancer. This systematic review, guided by the PRISMA 2020 methodology, examined studies exploring the possibility of tomato peel as a source of lycopene and carotenoids for cancer treatment. The findings suggest that tomato peel extracts exhibit promising anticancer properties, underscoring the need for further investigation of possible therapeutic applications. The compiled literature reveals significant potential for using tomato peel to create new cancer treatments, which could potentially revolutionize the field of oncology. This underscores the importance of continued research and exploration, emphasizing the urgency and importance of the scientific community's contribution to this promising area of study.",,"This research has been funded by Dirección General de Investigaciones of Universidad del Norte, Universidad Libre, and by MinCiencias through Project 80740-163-2021.",Molecules,,Dana Maria Copolovici,Solanum lycopersicum; Lycopene; Humans; Neoplasms; Antioxidants; Plant Extracts; Carotenoids; Animals,2024-06-28,2024,2024-06-28,,29,13,3079,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bolaño, Diana Carolina Jiménez; Insuasty, Daniel; Macías, Juan David Rodríguez; Grande-Tovar, Carlos David","Bolaño, Diana Carolina Jiménez (Grupo de Investigación de Fotoquímica y Fotobiología, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia 081008, Colombia;, dcarolinajimenez@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co); Insuasty, Daniel (Departamento de Química y Biología, División de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, insuastyd@uninorte.edu.co); Macías, Juan David Rodríguez (Programa de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Libre, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, juand.rodriguezm@unilibre.edu.co); Grande-Tovar, Carlos David (Grupo de Investigación de Fotoquímica y Fotobiología, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia 081008, Colombia;, dcarolinajimenez@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co)","Grande-Tovar, Carlos David (University of Atlántico)","Bolaño, Diana Carolina Jiménez (University of Atlántico); Insuasty, Daniel (Universidad del Norte); Macías, Juan David Rodríguez (Free University of Colombia); Grande-Tovar, Carlos David (University of Atlántico)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/13/3079/pdf?version=1719564571,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173367750,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

We employed biodegradable hydrogel models, including polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, chitosan, and poly-2-hydroxymethacrylate. The complexation process between the hydrogel and CO2 was thoroughly investigated at the ωB97X-D/6-311G(2d,p) theoretical level. Our findings reveal a strong affinity between the hydrogel models and CO2, with binding energies ranging from -4.5 to -6.5 kcal/mol, indicative of physisorption processes. The absorption order observed was as follows: chitosan > PVP > HEAC > PEG. Additionally, thermodynamic parameters substantiated this sequence and even suggested that these complexes remain stable up to 160 °C. Consequently, these polymers present a promising avenue for crafting novel materials for CO2 capture applications. Nonetheless, further research is warranted to optimize the design of these materials and assess their performance across various environmental conditions.",All individual authors would like to extend their profound gratitude to the Promigas Building enterprise for their invaluable support towards this project.,"This research was funded by green-Gas, with project number P.2.0.001-2022 by Centro de Investigación e Innovación en Energía y Gas—CIIEG, Promigas S.A.

In contrast, studies on preventive interventions (PIs) in the health sector are very limited. Our objective was to determine to what extent there is consensus on the most relevant characteristics of the psychosocial interventions applied in the prevention of PVW in health institutions in Peru. To that end, health professionals with knowledge and experience in PVW at the national level were recruited, and the Delphi consensus technique was applied.ResultsThe consensus study was developed in four stages that included three phases of Delphi consultation. In the third consultation phase, 428 experts participated in 25 analysis groups from 66 health institutions in the country. A total of 70.3% of the participants were women, and 27.6% of the participants worked in nursing and emergency services. After the Delphi consensus analysis, we obtained a list of 10 hierarchical psychosocial interventions to prevent PVW in the country. Most notable were interventions based on the prior resolution of interprofessional conflicts, on the visibility of incidents to generate an inverse effect and on experiential training to improve assertive and empathic communication skills.","The authors thank the experts who participated as coordinators and panellists in the analysis groups: Yannina Dapello, Mery Guzmán, Dánica Barrera, Henry Julca, Katia Rojas, Winny Villanueva, Jéssica Guerrero, Ciro Ruiz, Rolando Valdivia, Lourdes Abregú, Jefry Galván, Patricia Castro, Celia Lino, Lina Cárdenas, Andrés Oré, Elizabeth Pardo, Lyzet Reyes, Heydi Diaz.

Foundation models for structured electronic health records (EHR), trained on coded medical records from millions of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across hospitals and their performance in local tasks. This multi-center study examined the adaptability of a publicly accessible structured EHR foundation model (FMSM), trained on 2.57 M patient records from Stanford Medicine. Experiments used EHR data from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). We assessed both adaptability via continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of locally training models from scratch, including a local foundation model. Evaluations on 8 clinical prediction tasks showed that adapting the off-the-shelf FMSM matched the performance of gradient boosting machines (GBM) locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels. Continued pretraining on local data showed FMSM required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained GBM’s performance, and was 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch. Our findings demonstrate that adapting EHR foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development of healthcare AI.",We would like to acknowledge Joshua Lemmon and Jiro Inoue for their contributions to the curation of the datasets used in this study.

Cognitive and language skills were assessed using standardized tools, including the Battelle Developmental Inventory, Reynell Developmental Language Scales III, and NEPSY-II battery. The results indicated that children with ASD outperformed children with DS in the areas of fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and communication. Additionally, children with ASD demonstrated higher scores in language comprehension and expressive language, compared to children with DS. Significant correlations were found between motor skills and communication abilities. Neuropsychological evaluations revealed significant differences between the two groups in various tasks, such as the comprehension of instructions, body part naming and identification, and recognition of emotions.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the risk factors for mortality in patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus from a large registry in Colombia and to evaluate the potential effect modifications by type 2 diabetes mellitus over other risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled in the Registro Colombiano de Falla Cardíaca (RECOLFACA) were included. RECOLFACA enrolled adult patients with heart failure diagnosis from 60 medical centers in Colombia during 2017-2019. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Survival analysis was performed using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: A total of 2514 patients were included, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 24.7% (n = 620). We found seven independent predictors of short-term mortality for the general cohort, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus rhythm, triple therapy, nitrates use, statins use, anemia, and hyperkalemia. In the type 2 diabetes mellitus group, only the left ventricle diastolic diameter was an independent mortality predictor (HR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.98). There was no evidence of effect modification by type 2 diabetes mellitus on the relationship between any independent predictors and all-cause mortality. However, a significant effect modification by type 2 diabetes mellitus between smoking and mortality was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus had higher mortality risk. Our results also suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis does not modify the effect of the independent risk factors for mortality in heart failure evaluated. However, type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly modify the risk relation between mortality and smoking in patients with heart failure.","List of members of the RECOLFACA Group Alberto Cadena, Clínica de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia Alejandro D.

El Alférez, a village in Los Montes de María (Bolívar, Colombia) and a macro-focus of leishmaniasis, recorded its first case in 2018, evidencing changes in the distribution and eco-epidemiology of the disease, although interactions between vectors and local fauna remain unknown.
Objective. To evaluate the diversity of sandflies and their blood meal sources in the community of El Alférez in the municipality of El Carmen de Bolívar (Bolívar, Colombia).
Materials and methods. In 2018, sandflies were collected using LED-based light traps in domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic ecotopes and identified at the species level. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome B gene was used to analyze blood from the digestive tract.
Results. Lutzomyia evansi was the most abundant species (71.85%; n = 485/675), followed by Lu. panamensis, Lu. gomezi, Lu. trinidadensis, Lu. dubitans, Lu. abonnenci,
and Lu.aclydifera. Twenty-five percent of the species had blood meals from Canis familiaris (36.00%; n = 9/25), Ovis aries (36.00%; n=9:/25), Bos taurus (24.00%; n = 6/25), Sus scrofa (20.00%; n = 5/25), and Homo sapiens (8.00%; n = 2/25). Lutzomyia evansi registered the highest feeding frequency (68.00%; n = 17/25), predominantly on a single (44.00%; n = 11/25) or multiple species (24.00%; n = 6/25).
Conclusion. Results indicate a eclectic feeding behavior in Lu. evansi, implying potential reservoir hosts for Leishmania spp. and increasing transmission risk. This study is a first step towards understanding the diversity of mammalian blood sources used by sandflies, that may be crucial for vector identification and formulation of effective control measures.",The authors thank the community of El Alférez for their help with the logistics and the samplings.,"Universidad del Atlántico, Universidad de Sucre, Pyrogen S.A.S. and the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia (Minciencias) funded the project titled “Implementación de un sistema de información geográfica para el fortalecimiento de la vigilancia epidemiológica de la leishmaniasis en la región Caribe colombiana: Sucre”, registered under the code BPIN 2020000100024.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequences were determined from 484 vaccine and 1,067 placebo recipients who acquired COVID-19. In this set of prespecified analyses, we show that in Latin America, VE was significantly lower against Lambda vs. Reference and against Lambda vs. non-Lambda [family-wise error rate (FWER) p < 0.05]. VE differed by residue match vs. mismatch to the vaccine-insert at 16 amino acid positions (4 FWER p < 0.05; 12 q-value ≤ 0.20); significantly decreased with physicochemical-weighted Hamming distance to the vaccine-strain sequence for Spike, receptor-binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S1 (FWER p < 0.001); differed (FWER ≤ 0.05) by distance to the vaccine strain measured by 9 antibody-epitope escape scores and 4 NTD neutralization-impacting features; and decreased (p = 0.011) with neutralization resistance level to vaccinee sera. VE against severe–critical COVID-19 was stable across most sequence features but lower against the most distant viruses.","This research was supported in part by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Government Contract Nos.

Neoplastic cells also deploy many mis-expressed germ cell proteins termed Cancer Testes Antigens (CTAs) to promote genome maintenance and survival. Here, we present the first comprehensive characterization of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and CTA transcriptional landscapes of endometrial cancer in relation to conventional histological and molecular subtypes. We show endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC), an aggressive endometrial cancer subtype, is defined by gene expression signatures comprising members of the Replication Fork Protection Complex (RFPC) and Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and CTAs with mitotic functions. DDR and CTA-based profiling also defines a subset of highly aggressive endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EEC) with poor clinical outcomes that share similar profiles to ESC yet have distinct characteristics based on conventional histological and genomic features. Using an unbiased CRISPR-based genetic screen and a candidate gene approach, we confirm that DDR and CTA genes that constitute the ESC and related EEC gene signatures are required for proliferation and therapy-resistance of cultured endometrial cancer cells. Our study validates the use of DDR and CTA-based tumor classifiers and reveals new vulnerabilities of aggressive endometrial cancer where none currently exist.",,"National Institutes of Health (R01 ES009558, CA215347, CA229530 to C.V.); University of North Carolina Lineberger Developmental Funding Program Stimulus Award (to J.L.B and C.V.); University of the North Carolina Center for Environmental Health and Susceptibility 2023–2024 Pilot Project Awards (to J.L.B.).",NAR Cancer,,,,2024-04-08,2024,2024-04-08,2024-04-08,6,2,zcae015,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Xingyuan; Joseph, Sayali; Wu, Di; Bowser, Jessica L; Vaziri, Cyrus","Zhang, Xingyuan (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA); Joseph, Sayali (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA); Wu, Di (Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Dentistry, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA); Bowser, Jessica L (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA; UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA); Vaziri, Cyrus (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA; UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC - 27599, USA)","Bowser, Jessica L (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center); Vaziri, Cyrus (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center)","Zhang, Xingyuan (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Joseph, Sayali (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Wu, Di (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Bowser, Jessica L (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center); Vaziri, Cyrus (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center)",1,1,,,https://academic.oup.com/narcancer/article-pdf/6/2/zcae015/57180724/zcae015.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170511651,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Older people have been particularly affected by the lockdown as their health conditions have changed, although they have been kept in isolation to avoid exposure to contagion. We sought to determine the association between lifestyles and anxiety in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Materials and methods: This study was cross-sectional. We enrolled 150 older adults of both sexes and with a history of chronic diseases from the municipality of El Agustino (Lima, Peru). The 20-item Geriatric Anxiety Scale and the 25-item Lifestyle Questionnaire on eating, physical activity, rest, and sleep were administered in Spanish during July-August 2021.
Results: The mean age was 70.8 ± 8.1 years, 54.7% were male, and 75.3% practiced exercise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 99.3% of the elderly had healthy lifestyles and 40% presented anxiety (mild, moderate, and severe anxiety in 26.7%, 8.7%, and 4.7%, respectively). We found no association between anxiety and lifestyle (p = 0.189), physical exercise was a predictor of lifestyle (p < 0.001) and we did not find predictors of anxiety symptoms (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that there was no link between anxiety symptoms and lifestyle in older adults during the lockdown. It is important to conduct in-depth research on factors associated with anxiety symptoms among older residents in other regions, focusing on population groups with the highest rates of infection and death from COVID-19.",None.,"Funding: The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",SAGE Open Medicine,,,,2024-01,2024,2024-04-08,2024-01,12,,20503121241242394,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Damián, Daysi Y; Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A; Cañari, Betsy; Moya-Salazar, Belén; Contreras-Pulache, Hans","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Damián, Daysi Y (Nursing School, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru); Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A (School of Medical Technology, Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Tecnologica del Perú, Lima, Peru); Cañari, Betsy (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru); Moya-Salazar, Belén (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Qualitative Unit, Nesh Hubbs, Lima, Peru); Contreras-Pulache, Hans (Qualitative Unit, Nesh Hubbs, Lima, Peru)","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Private University of the North)","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Private University of the North); Damián, Daysi Y (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Cañari, Betsy (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Moya-Salazar, Belén (Universidad Norbert Wiener; Qualitative Unit, Nesh Hubbs, Lima, Peru); Contreras-Pulache, Hans (Qualitative Unit, Nesh Hubbs, Lima, Peru)",1,1,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20503121241242394,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170523266,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

The overall behavior of the material's structure is the result of a complex confluence of multiple grains with a variety of relative orientations and their interaction with other structural defects. The effect of the grain boundary on cracked grains is an important factor in order to establish the mechanical behavior of nano-materials under static and dynamic loading conditions. For studying the effect of the grain boundary on the mechanical behavior of nano-crystalline solids a single boundary is placed as a defect that separates two miss-oriented crystals with a relative tilt or twist angle. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of the GB and the relative tilt and twist angles on the crack propagation under increasing cyclic loading of cracked FCC bi-crystals. Molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature of fatigue crack growth tests were performed to characterize the retardation effect of different grain miss-orientations on fatigue crack propagation. Al by-cristals with an initial edge crack and different miss-orientattion angles are simutalted, in the present research, under increasing cyclic loading condition. As a general trend high twist angles showed a greater effect on the resistance to crack propagation under single and compound grain miss-orientation.",,,Procedia Structural Integrity,,,,2024,2024,,2024,57,,461-468,All OA; Gold,Article,"Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer; Zambrano, Habib R.","Velilla-Díaz, Wilmer (Universidad Austral de Chile, Gral.

The data article introduces simulated datasets and a real dataset obtained from a retail store in Chile. The real dataset provides details on the structure of the store, including the number of departments and workers, the type of labor contract, the cost parameter values, and the average demand across all store departments. The simulated datasets, consisting of 18 categorized text files, were generated through Monte Carlo simulation to encapsulate information about the stochastic demand for store departments. These text files are classified based on: (i) type of sample (in-sample or out-of-sample), (ii) type of truncation method (zero-truncated or percentile-truncated), and (iii) demand coefficient of variation (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%). This categorization allows academics and practitioners to select the scenarios that meet with their specific research or application needs, increasing the flexibility and applicability of the datasets. In addition, researchers and practitioners can use these comprehensive real and simulated datasets to benchmark the performance of diverse optimization methods under uncertain demand, thereby ensuring robust multiskilling levels for similar MPAPs.

This problem has become a concern in urban and industrial environments due to the characteristics of rail systems and unsafe pedestrian behaviour. Research reveals that psychological and infrastructural factors influence pedestrians' decision-making when crossing railroad lines. One of these is the convenience that leads pedestrians to cross at the nearest point. However, investigations to date only study the impact of location on the risk and severity of crashes and pedestrian rule violations. The current research is quasi-experimental, i.e., no optimisation tool has been developed to determine which crossing points pedestrians should follow. Therefore, this research develops a mathematical model for locating level crossings at railways to minimise the total weighted-walked distance. A genetic algorithm was proposed for solving the model, especially for large-size problems. The algorithm parameters were calibrated using the design of experiments and ten instances based on the characteristics of the area under study. The obtained results provide (1) the location of the level crossings and (2) the route pedestrians should follow for each origin-destination pair based on the facilities adjacent to the rail lines. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the ten instances to determine how the location of the level crossings changes with modifications in the facilities' location. Results showed that the model provides alternative solutions according to the problem's size.

To address security challenges, smart cities implement robust cybersecurity measures, including network monitoring, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Detecting and mitigating possible security risks in drone network B5G is a crucial aspect of ensuring reliable and safe drone operation. It is necessary to establish sophisticated and robust attack detection techniques to defend against security threats as the use of drones becomes increasingly widespread and their applications diversify. This is due to the lack of privacy and security consideration in the drone’s system, including an inadequate computation capability and unsecured wireless channels to perform advanced cryptographic algorithms. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detection systems can identify suspicious activities and monitor network traffic, such as anomalous communication patterns or unauthorized access attempts. Therefore, the study presents an enhanced dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm with deep learning-based attack detection (EDMOA-DLAD) in Networks B5G for the purpose of Drones technique. The presented EDMOA-DLAD technique aims to recognize the attacks and classifies them on the drone network B5G. Primarily, the EDMOA-DLAD technique designs a feature selection (FS) approach using EDMOA. To detect attacks, the EDMOA-DLAD technique uses a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) classifier. Finally, the EDMOA-DLAD technique applies the beetle antenna search (BAS) technique for the optimum hyperparameter part of DVAE model. The outcome of EDMOA-DLAD approach can be verified on benchmark datasets. A wide range of simulations inferred that the EDMOA-DLAD method obtains enhanced performance of 99.79% over other classification techniques.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Therefore, the main objective of this study is to validate the “Cursa-T” scale through an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as through structural equations, to ensure that the data collected fit the proposed theoretical model. The study sample consists of 1104 university students, mostly female, and a questionnaire based on previous studies is used. The most important results of the research include the validation of the “Cursa-T” scale through advanced statistical methods, such as exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The scale is found to be reliable and valid for measuring undergraduate research and digital competencies, and the data collected fit the proposed theoretical model. The discussion of the research highlights the importance of technology, devices, software, and the use of platforms in the development of research and digital competencies in Health Sciences students. It also reflects on the role of social networks in these competencies, as they can facilitate participation in academic communities. Ultimately, the research underlines the relevance of preparing undergraduate students in health areas.",,This research received no external funding.,Societies,,,,2024-02-12,2024,2024-02-12,,14,2,22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ayala, Rocío Elizabeth Duarte; Palacios-Rodríguez, Antonio; Guzmán-Cedillo, Yunuen Ixchel; Segura, Leticia Rodríguez","Ayala, Rocío Elizabeth Duarte (School of Health Sciences, University of the Valley of Mexico (UVM), Mexico City 06060, Mexico;, rocio.duarte@uvmnet.edu); Palacios-Rodríguez, Antonio (Faculty of Educational Sciencies, Universidad de Sevilla, 41013 Seville, Spain); Guzmán-Cedillo, Yunuen Ixchel (Faculty of Psychology, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico City 04510, Mexico;, yunuen.guzman@unam.mx); Segura, Leticia Rodríguez (Institutional Directorate of Educational Innovation and Research, University of the Valley of Mexico (UVM), Mexico City 06060, Mexico;, leticia.rodriguezs@uvmnet.edu)","Palacios-Rodríguez, Antonio (University of Seville)","Ayala, Rocío Elizabeth Duarte (Universidad del Valle de México); Palacios-Rodríguez, Antonio (University of Seville); Guzmán-Cedillo, Yunuen Ixchel (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Segura, Leticia Rodríguez (Universidad del Valle de México)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/14/2/22/pdf?version=1707753814,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168825840,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

In this study, we have profited from a set of bioinformatics tools to recover important biological information of C. concholepas from low-coverage short-read NGS datasets. Specifically, we calculated the size of the nuclear genome, ploidy, and estimated transposable elements content using an in silico k-mer approach, we discovered, annotated, and quantified those transposable elements, we assembled and annotated the 45S rDNA RNA operon and mitochondrial genome, and we confirmed the phylogenetic position of C. concholepas within the muricid subfamily Rapaninae based on translated protein coding genes.ResultsUsing a k-mer approach, the haploid genome size estimated for the predicted diploid genome of C. concholepas varied between 1.83 Gbp (with kmer = 24) and 2.32 Gbp (with kmer = 36). Between half and two thirds of the nuclear genome of C. concholepas was composed of transposable elements. The most common transposable elements were classified as Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements and Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements, which were more abundant than DNA transposons, simple repeats, and Long Terminal Repeats. Less abundant repeat elements included Helitron mobile elements, 45S rRNA DNA, and Satellite DNA, among a few others.The 45S rRNA DNA operon of C. concholepas that encodes for the ssrRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and lsrRNA genes was assembled into a single contig 8,090 bp long. The assembled mitochondrial genome of C. concholepas is 15,449 bp long and encodes 13 protein coding genes, two ribosomal genes, and 22 transfer RNAs.ConclusionThe information gained by this study will inform the assembly of a high quality nuclear genome for C. concholepas and will support bioprospecting and biomonitoring using environmental DNA to advance development of conservation and management plans in this overexploited marine snail.","J.A.B thanks Vincent P.

However, its psychometric properties and measurement invariance across cultural, gender and sexual subgroups have not yet been examined. This multinational study aimed to validate the SDS-3 and test its psychometric properties, including measurement invariance across language, country, gender identity, and sexual orientation groups.
Methods: We used global survey data from 82,243 individuals (Mean age=32.39 years; 40.3 % men, 57.0 % women, 2.8 % non-binary, and 0.6 % other genders) participating in the International Sexual Survey (ISS; https://internationalsexsurvey.org/) across 42 countries and 26 languages. Participants completed the SDS-3, as well as questions regarding sociodemographic characteristics, including gender identity and sexual orientation.
Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a unidimensional factor structure for the SDS-3, and multi-group CFA (MGCFA) suggested that this factor structure was invariant across countries, languages, gender identities, and sexual orientations. Cronbach's α for the unidimensional score was 0.83 (range between 0.76 and 0.89), and McDonald's ω was 0.84 (range between 0.76 and 0.90). Participants who did not experience sexual problems had significantly lower SDS-3 total scores (M = 2.99; SD=2.54) compared to those who reported sexual problems (M = 5.60; SD=3.00), with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.01 [95 % CI=-1.03, -0.98]; p < 0.001).
Conclusion: The SDS-3 has a unidimensional factor structure and appears to be valid and reliable for measuring sexual distress among individuals from different countries, gender identities, and sexual orientations.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest with the content of this manuscript.

Two bioassays were conducted to assess the impact of acute and intermittent hypoxia on the antibacterial activity of juvenile Chilean meagre epidermal mucus against the potential pathogens Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio ordalii. Lysozyme and peroxidase activities were also measured. In general, fish exposed to hypoxia showed a 9-30% reduction in mucus antibacterial activity at the end of hypoxic periods and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. However, following water reoxygenation, the activity of non-stimulated fish was comparable to that of fish in normoxic conditions, inhibiting bacterial growth by 35-52%. In the case of fish exposed to chronic hypoxia, the response against V. anguillarum increased by an additional 19.8% after 6 days of control inoculation. Lysozyme exhibited a similar pattern, while no modulation of peroxidase activity was detected post-hypoxia.

In this study, we first evaluated the effect of extracellular ATP depletion with apyrase in SKOV-3, a cell line derived from metastatic ovarian carcinoma. We observed a decrease in cell migration and an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and cell markers, suggesting a role in maintaining a mesenchymal phenotype. To identify the P2 receptor that mediated the effects of ATP, we compared the transcript levels of some P2 receptors and found that P2RX7 is three-fold higher in SKOV-3 cells than in a healthy cell line, namely HOSE6-3 (from human ovarian surface epithelium). Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified a higher expression of the P2RX7 transcript in metastatic tissues than in primary tumors; thus, P2X7 seems to be a promising effector for the malignant phenotype. Subsequently, we demonstrated the presence and functionality of the P2X7 receptor in SKOV-3 cells and showed through pharmacological approaches that its activity promotes cell migration and contributes to maintaining a mesenchymal phenotype. P2X7 activation using BzATP increased cell migration and abolished E-cadherin expression. On the other hand, a series of P2X7 receptor antagonists (A438079, BBG and OxATP) decreased cell migration. We used a CRISPR-based knock-out system directed to P2RX7. According to the results of our wound-healing assay, SKOV3-P2X7KO cells lacked receptor-mediated calcium mobilization and decreased migration. Altogether, these data let us propose that P2X7 receptor is a regulator for cancer cell migration and thus a potential drug target.","José David Núñez Ríos is a doctoral student from the Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and has received CONAHCYT fellowship CVU #1044618.

SNF requires the exchange of nutrients between the plant and rhizobia in the nodule that occurs across a plant-derived symbiosome membrane. One iron transporter, belonging to the Vacuolar iron Transporter-Like (VTL) family, MtVTL8, has been identified as essential for bacteria survival and therefore SNF. In this work we investigated the spatial expression of MtVTL8 in nodules and addressed whether it could be functionally interchangeable with a similar nodule-expressed iron transporter, MtVTL4. Using a structural model for MtVTL8 and the previously hypothesized mechanism for iron transport in a phylogenetically-related Vacuolar Iron Transporter (VIT), EgVIT1 with known crystal structure, we identified critical amino acids and obtained their mutants. Mutants were tested in planta for complementation of an SNF defective line and in an iron sensitive mutant yeast strain. An extended phylogenetic assessment of VTLs and VITs showed that amino acids critical for function are conserved differently in VTLs vs. VITs. Our studies showed that some amino acids are essential for iron transport leading us to suggest a model for MtVTL8 function, one that is different for other iron transporters (VITs) studied so far. This study extends the understanding of iron transport mechanisms in VTLs as well as those used in SNF.","We thank Drs.

In the coastal environment, large Laminarian algae-kelps-form key coastal ecosystems that support complex and diverse food webs. Among kelps, Macrocystis pyrifera is the most widely distributed habitat-forming species and provides essential ecosystem services. This study aimed to establish the main drivers of future distributional changes on a global scale and use them to predict future habitat suitability. Using species distribution models (SDM), we examined the changes in global distribution of M. pyrifera under different emission scenarios with a focus on the Southeast Pacific shores. To constrain the drivers of our simulations to the most important factors controlling kelp forest distribution across spatial scales, we explored a suite of environmental variables and validated the predictions derived from the SDMs. Minimum sea surface temperature was the single most important variable explaining the global distribution of suitable habitat for M. pyrifera. Under different climate change scenarios, we always observed a decrease of suitable habitat at low latitudes, while an increase was detected in other regions, mostly at high latitudes. Along the Southeast Pacific, we observed an upper range contraction of -17.08° S of latitude for 2090-2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario, implying a loss of habitat suitability throughout the coast of Peru and poleward to -27.83° S in Chile. Along the area of Northern Chile where a complete habitat loss is predicted by our model, natural stands are under heavy exploitation. The loss of habitat suitability will take place worldwide: Significant impacts on marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are likely. Furthermore, changes in habitat suitability are a harbinger of massive impacts in the socio-ecological systems of the Southeast Pacific.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We acknowledge funding from ANID through Nucleo UPWELL (NCN19153), Instituto Milenio SECOS (ICN2019‐015), ANID‐CENTROS REGIONALES (CLAP, R20F0008) and FONDECYT proposals 1221699, 1221534, 1230420, 1230286.

The objective is to promote awareness to generate more scientific knowledge about the eventual impacts of forest extraction. Public policies are emphasized as crucial mediators for balanced sustainable development. Currently, the effects of extractive deforestation on forest ecosystems are poorly understood, which requires caution and forest protection. Continued research to increase our knowledge in molecular biology is advocated to understand the adaptation of biological organisms to the new conditions of the ecosystem both in the face of extractive deforestation and reforestation. The environmental impacts of extractive deforestation, such as the loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, altered water cycles, and the contribution of climate change, remain largely unknown.

This study addresses the need to anticipate and understand customer churn through the application of Deep Learning models. The central focus of the research was the development and evaluation of a short-term memory model (LSTM) specifically designed to predict customer leakage. The choice of LSTM as the mainstay of the research is based on its proven ability to model long-term dependencies in sequences, its resilience to recurrent challenges in neural networks, and its success in various sequence prediction tasks. The model implementation, configured sequentially with Keras, comprised of an initial LSTM layer of 64 units, followed by a 20% removal layer to mitigate overfitting. The second LSTM layer, with 32 units, was supplemented with another elimination layer. Model training was conducted using a dataset consisting of 20 attributes and 4250 records. The model evaluation was based on crucial measures such as precision, accuracy, sensitivity and F1 count, revealing exceptional results with 95% performance on all metrics. This study, therefore, highlights the effectiveness of the LSTM model in predicting customer churn, providing companies with a valuable tool to improve retention and mitigate associated losses.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This research received no external funding.,"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",,,,2024-03,2024,,2024-03,10,1,100237,All OA; Gold,Article,"Beltozar-Clemente, Saul; Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando; Pucuhuayla-Revatta, Félix; Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn; Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael","Beltozar-Clemente, Saul (Dirección de cursos básicos, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima 15097, Peru); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru); Pucuhuayla-Revatta, Félix (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima 15306, Peru); Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Escuela de Posgrado, Universidad Continental, Lima 15311, Peru); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15306, Peru)","Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Universidad Continental)","Beltozar-Clemente, Saul (Scientific University of the South); Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Pucuhuayla-Revatta, Félix (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Zapata-Paulini, Joselyn (Universidad Continental); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Private University of the North)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joitmc.2024.100237,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168952208,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",
366,pub.1169068030,10.1093/mnras/stae508,,,NGTS-28Ab: a short period transiting brown dwarf,"ABSTRACT We report the discovery of a brown dwarf orbiting a M1 host star. We first identified the brown dwarf within the Next Generation Transit Survey data, with supporting observations found in TESS sectors 11 and 38. We confirmed the discovery with follow-up photometry from the South African Astronomical Observatory, SPECULOOS-S, and TRAPPIST-S, and radial velocity measurements from HARPS, which allowed us to characterize the system. We find an orbital period of ∼1.25 d, a mass of $69.0^{+5.3}_{-4.8}$ MJ, close to the hydrogen burning limit, and a radius of 0.95 ± 0.05 RJ. We determine the age to be >0.5 Gyr, using model isochrones, which is found to be in agreement with spectral energy distribution fitting within errors. NGTS-28Ab is one of the shortest period systems found within the brown dwarf desert, as well as one of the highest mass brown dwarfs that transits an M dwarf. This makes NGTS-28Ab another important discovery within this scarcely populated region.","This work is based on data collected under the NGTS project at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) La Silla Paranal Observatory.

For this purpose, the database of the Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) 2020 was analyzed. The sample was random and consisted of 32.634 participants who were administered the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. A network analysis was performed to find out the core symptoms of depression according to their ethnic identity. The findings indicated that, in all ethnic groups, the central symptom was depressed mood, with the exception of the Aymara population, in whom sleep problems were central. In addition, the least interaction between symptoms was found in those who identified themselves as Amazonian natives. It is concluded that depression may manifest itself differently among ethnic groups, especially in the Aymara population, where a more somatic expression was found, such as sleep problems.",,,Acta Colombiana de Psicología,,,,2024-02-19,2024,2024-02-19,,27,1,183-196,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick; Ventura-León, José","Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick (Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Perú); Ventura-León, José (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú)",,"Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick (Private University of the North); Ventura-León, José (Private University of the North)",1,1,,,https://actacolombianapsicologia.ucatolica.edu.co/article/download/4736/4969,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168990618,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Given that Peru’s comprehensive health insurance (SIS) seeks to enhance its coverage for the entire population, it is important to know if its coverage benefits the poorest populations. Objectives: To determine the allocation of SIS resources and care to the poorest quintile during 2018 and 2019 in Peru. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from five Peruvian technical institutions. In 39,8207 Peruvian households, we analyzed the per capita budget assigned to the population affiliated with SIS in microregions of quintile 1 and quintile 2 (poor), and quintile 4 and quintile 5 (non-poor), health coverage, and the level of poverty considering the human development index (HDI) and the regional competitiveness index (RCI). Results: The poorest regions are inversely correlated with HDI and RCI and have an average service of 25.0% affiliates. In poor areas, the allocated budget was lower (approximately $303,000 to $2.2 million), but the proportion of members requiring care was higher (>70.0%). The budget allocated to health was unfair (p<0.05) between poor areas (maximum resources from $96.28 to $108.14) and non-poor areas (maximum resources from $150.00 to $172.43). Low budget allocations and low household per capita income contributed to poverty in quintile 1 and quintile 2 (p<0.01). Conclusions: the poorest regions have greater inequity and the majority of affiliates do not use or do not have access to SIS services, but they have a greater need for health care. In addition, poor regions have a high amount of population without SIS coverage, and low allocated budgets, which affects competitiveness and regional development.",,,Electronic Journal of General Medicine,,,,2024-01-26,2024,2024,2024-01-26,21,1,em568,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huarachi, Luis A; Lozano-Zanelly, Glenn; Acosta, Julio; Huarachi, Carlos A; Moya-Salazar, Jeel","Huarachi, Luis A (Graduate School, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, PERU); Lozano-Zanelly, Glenn (Graduate School, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, PERU); Acosta, Julio (Graduate School, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, PERU); Huarachi, Carlos A (Graduate School, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Lima, PERU); Moya-Salazar, Jeel (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Tenológica del Perú, Lima, PERU; Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, PERU)",,"Huarachi, Luis A (Federico Villarreal National University); Lozano-Zanelly, Glenn (Federico Villarreal National University); Acosta, Julio (National University of San Marcos); Huarachi, Carlos A (Pontifical Catholic University of Peru); Moya-Salazar, Jeel (School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Tenológica del Perú, Lima, PERU; Private University of the North)",1,1,,,https://www.ejgm.co.uk/download/inequality-in-the-distribution-of-resources-and-health-care-in-the-poverty-quintiles-evidence-from-14160.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168314487,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,1 No Poverty; 10 Reduced Inequalities; 3 Good Health and Well Being
262,pub.1167959881,10.1088/1748-9326/ad1e7f,,,Effect of sampling bias on global estimates of ocean carbon export,"Shipboard sampling of ocean biogeochemical properties is necessarily limited by logistical and practical constraints. As a result, the majority of observations are obtained for the spring/summer period and in regions relatively accessible from a major port. This limitation may bias the conceptual understanding we have of the spatial and seasonal variability in important components of the Earth system. Here we examine the influence of sampling bias on global estimates of carbon export flux by sub-sampling a biogeochemical model to simulate real, realistic and random sampling. We find that both the sparseness and the ‘clumpy’ character of shipboard flux observations generate errors in estimates of globally extrapolated export flux of up to ∼ ± 20%. The use of autonomous technologies, such as the Biogeochemical-Argo network, will reduce the uncertainty in global flux estimates to ∼ ± 3% by both increasing the sample size and reducing clumpiness in the spatial distribution of observations.

The experiment involved triplicate groups of fish (initial body weight 32.10 ± 0.79 g) fed four extruded experimental diets with varying levels of Andean lupin (0, 50, 100, and 200 g kg−1) twice a day to apparent satiety over a period of 40 days. Faecal samples were collected daily for nutrient digestibility analysis. No significant correlations were observed between the dietary inclusion of Andean lupin and final weight, survival, weight gain, protein efficiency retention, thermal growth rate, feed conversion rate, and feed intake (P > 0.05). Similarly, there were no significant relationships between increasing dietary inclusion of Andean lupin and apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter, crude protein, carbohydrate, and energy. However, the inclusion of Andean lupin led to a decrease in apparent digestibility coefficients for ash (R2 =0.6, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the digestibility of Mg and Zn decreased in a quadratic manner (P < 0.01) with increasing levels of Andean lupin inclusion. The dietary treatments did not significantly affect whole-body composition, spleen-somatic index, and intestine-somatic index (P > 0.05). However, the hepatosomatic index decreased quadratically with increasing inclusion of Andean lupin (R2 =0.51, P < 0.05), likely due to a slight reduction in cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Andean lupin is a promising plant protein ingredient for rainbow trout diets. It can be included at levels up to 200 g kg−1 without adversely affecting growth performance and nutrient digestibility. These findings contribute to the expanding knowledge on alternative protein sources in aquaculture feed formulation.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Adrian J.

238,pub.1174610278,10.1093/mnras/stae1905,,,Data reconstruction of the dynamical connection function in f(Q) cosmology,"ABSTRACT We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parametrized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. First, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma (z)$, and we show that according to Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$cold dark matter paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.","We are grateful to Bichu Li, Dongdong Zhang, Taotao Qiu, Qingqing Wang, Hongsheng Zhao, and Jiaming Shi for helpful discussions and valuable comments.

The susceptibility of countries to these crises depends on their policies, planning, and management in facing diverse challenges. This article aims to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry in G7 countries by comparing rankings and positions on indices in 2016 and 2020. Data collected from the RANking COMparison (RANCOM), Proximity Indexed Value (PIV), and Double Normalization Compromise Ranking of Alternatives from Distance to Ideal Solution (DNCRADIS) models have been utilized for data analysis. The research findings indicate noticeable differences in using different models, as the rankings and positions of G7 countries for the years 2016 and 2020, except for two countries, the United States and France, have been different. The research results demonstrate that the COVID-19 crisis had significant impacts on the tourism industries of G7 countries. Countries like the United States, France, and the United Kingdom appear as leading nations in the tourism industry, while Japan and Canada faced challenges, and Germany and Italy experienced changes in their positions. Based on these results, officials and planners in the tourism industry of G7 countries can make appropriate decisions for the development and improvement of tourism under similar crisis conditions. Moreover, these findings can serve as a valuable guide for other countries in managing similar crises in the tourism industry.",,,Technological and Economic Development of Economy,,,,2024-05-29,2024,2024-05-29,2024-06-03,30,4,1064–1086-1064–1086,All OA; Gold,Article,"Komasi, Hossein; Nemati, Alireza; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Williams, Nigel L; Bazrafshan, Ramin","Komasi, Hossein (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Nemati, Alireza (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran 15875-4413, Iran); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Faculty of Business and Law, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK); Williams, Nigel L (Faculty of Business and Law, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK); Bazrafshan, Ramin (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran 15875-4413, Iran)",,"Komasi, Hossein (Catholic University of the North); Nemati, Alireza (Amirkabir University of Technology); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North; University of Portsmouth); Williams, Nigel L (University of Portsmouth); Bazrafshan, Ramin (Amirkabir University of Technology)",1,1,,,https://journals.vilniustech.lt/index.php/TEDE/article/download/20821/12325,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172433134,38 Economics; 44 Human Society; 49 Mathematical Sciences,

However, the high laser intensities needed for implementing phase nonlinearities using conventional optical materials represent a challenge for nonlinear optics in the few-photon regime. We introduce an infrared cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) approach for imprinting nonlinear phase shifts on individual THz pulses in reflection setups, conditional on the input power. Power-dependent phase shifts on the order of 0.1π can be achieved with femtosecond pulses of only a few µW input power. The proposed scheme involves a small number of intersubband quantum well transition dipoles evanescently coupled to the near field of an infrared resonator. The field evolution is nonlinear due to the dynamical transfer of spectral anharmonicity from material dipoles to the infrared vacuum, through an effective dipolar chirping mechanism that transiently detunes the quantum well transitions from the vacuum field, leading to photon blockade. We develop analytical theory that describes the dependence of the imprinted nonlinear phase shift on relevant physical parameters. For a pair of quantum well dipoles, the phase control scheme is shown to be robust with respect to inhomogeneities in the dipole transition frequencies and relaxation rates. Numerical results based on the Lindblad quantum master equation validate the theory in the regime where the material dipoles are populated up to the second excitation manifold. In contrast with conventional QED schemes for phase control that require strong light–matter interaction, the proposed phase nonlinearity works best in weak coupling, increasing the prospects for its experimental realization using current nanophotonic technology.",M A is funded by ANID—Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo through the Scholarship Programa Doctorado Becas Chile/2018 No. 21181591.

The mine was exploited using the room-and-pillar method. Subsidence processes have occurred previously and reached the surface because of the collapse of several pillars into the mine. To prevent such risky situations, the closure plan has been modified and the backfilling of some rooms has been considered. This study aimed to evaluate the global stability of room #1.1 after backfilling. This paper combines the use of traditional techniques, numerical modelling and remote sensing to achieve this objective. Limit equilibrium methods, LIDAR technology and numerical methods-based software were employed to evaluate the stability of rooms and pillars surrounding room #1.1 and considering different backfilling levels. In all possible backfilling scenarios involving room #1.1, the impact on the surface and neighboring rooms is negligible. In addition, no substantial changes in the safety factors and deformations of the neighboring rooms were observed for both studied levels of backfilling. Thus, backfilling is an adequate countermeasure to avoid subsidence.",,No funding was received to assist with the preparation of this manuscript.,Geomechanics and Geophysics for Geo-Energy and Geo-Resources,,,,2024-07-15,2024,2024-07-15,2024-12,10,1,116,All OA; Gold,Article,"Trigueros, Emilio; Cánovas, Manuel; Arzúa, Javier; Baraibar, José Manuel","Trigueros, Emilio (Mining and Civil Engineering Department, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain); Cánovas, Manuel (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Arzúa, Javier (Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Department, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Baraibar, José Manuel (Viuda de Sainz, Basque Country, Spain)","Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)","Trigueros, Emilio (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Cánovas, Manuel (Catholic University of the North); Arzúa, Javier (Catholic University of the North); Baraibar, José Manuel (Viuda de Sainz, Basque Country, Spain)",1,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40948-024-00834-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173832190,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

211,pub.1167984164,10.1111/csp2.13057,,,Using expert knowledge to propose recreational marine reef‐fish management measures in Chile,"Abstract  Marine recreational fisheries often lack necessary information to perform assessments and develop sustainable management strategies. In Chile, although reef‐fish fisheries have been signaled as overexploited, there are still no commercial or recreational regulations regarding bans, catch limits, or size limits. We implemented an expert elicitation protocol to propose management measures to regulate recreational reef‐fish harvests of 17 reef‐fish species. Sixteen experts estimated minimum legal sizes, temporal closures, and maximum number of individuals harvested per person per trip (known as “bag limits”). Experts also prioritized management measures for each of 17 reef‐fish species. Maximum number of individuals harvested per person per trip varied between 1 and 7. In addition, permanent bans were recommended for some species, such as acha ( Medialuna ancietae ), pejeperro ( Semicossyphus darwini ), and San Pedro ( Oplegnathus insignis ). We concluded that information gathered through expert elicitation can play a key role to inform data‐poor recreational fishery management. Expert elicitation protocols that include iterative process, based on individual estimates and an open expert discussion phase, provide the necessary enabling environment to identify a variety of management measures. While future challenges include the development of mechanisms to promote acceptability and compliance for recreational fisheries management, the approach presented here is important to initiate much needed discussions.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank The Marisla Foundation, US Department of State, The Packard Foundation, The Walton Family Foundation, ANID/PIA BASAL FB0002, ANID—Millennium Science Initiative Program—ICN 2019_015 and ANID/BASAL FB210006.

By prioritizing sustainability, mobility, and community resilience, we are moving towards a holistic approach that protects the well-being of residents and the environment. In this dynamic urban design environment, finding ways to identify pedestrian-friendly spaces and create safe, efficient, and sustainable urban environments is a major challenge, and it requires research that seeks to optimize this choice, especially in terms of integrating numerical modeling methods and a wide range of measurement tasks. This research is concerned with optimizing pedestrian accessibility, which directly contributes to reducing environmental impact, improving non-motorized transport, and reducing traffic congestion. It integrates a novel, mixed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model that benefits from the use of Grey’s theory. This research’s purpose goes beyond addressing cities’ immediate challenges; it seeks to contribute to a broader understanding of sustainable urban planning. This study represents a pioneering effort to identify the challenges of optimal site selection for pedestrian walkways. By using a multi-criteria decision-making approach based on mathematical modelling and facility engineering, this effort addresses gaps in the current understanding of site selection criteria and aims to lead a paradigm shift toward a sustainable, efficient, and inclusive urban environment. The results show that the updated RANCOM-PIV greyscale is quite robust and reliable, when comparing the final results of the PIV greyscale and the MARCOS greyscale.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2024-05-23,2024,2024-05-23,,16,11,4437,All OA; Gold,Article,"Reyes-Norambuena, Pedro; Martinez-Torres, Javier; Nemati, Alireza; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani; Antucheviciene, Jurgita","Reyes-Norambuena, Pedro (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, pedroreyes@ucn.cl); Martinez-Torres, Javier (Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Vigo, 36310 Vigo, Spain;, javmartinez@uvigo.es); Nemati, Alireza (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran 1591634311, Iran;, alireza.n19597@gmail.com); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, pedroreyes@ucn.cl); Antucheviciene, Jurgita (Department of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Sauletekio al. 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Antucheviciene, Jurgita (Vilnius Gediminas Technical University)","Reyes-Norambuena, Pedro (Catholic University of the North); Martinez-Torres, Javier (Universidade de Vigo); Nemati, Alireza (Amirkabir University of Technology); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North); Antucheviciene, Jurgita (Vilnius Gediminas Technical University)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/11/4437/pdf?version=1716476217,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172038696,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

However, the beginning of the 21st century saw a change in this sense bringing new experiences of collaboration between Atacameños and archaeologists. Our goal is to reflect on the definitions and applications of collaborative methodologies in archaeological projects, through discussion focusing on the global, through the national and finally the local, from where we approach a particular collaborative project. The research, conducted between early 2021 and mid 2024, studies the history of the collection and patrimonialization of indigenous bodies in the Atacameño Lickanantay territory, and socializes this information among the local communities. Based on this work, we conclude that all research in the territory must involve and be authorized by the Atacameño communities. Also, we consider that the Atacameños should stop being the object of research and instead become researchers who lead or collaborate in the studies within their communities and in their territory. The originality of this paper lies precisely in the fact that it brings a global discussion of contemporary archaeology to a concrete case.
Desde el siglo XIX hasta el presente, en el territorio atacameño lickanantay, región de Antofagasta, norte de Chile, se han llevado a cabo prácticas arqueológicas de carácter extractivista, sin contar o negando la voz y/o participación de miembros de la comunidad indígena local. Sin embargo, desde inicios del siglo XXI se ha producido un cambio en este sentido y en la actualidad se cuenta con diferentes experiencias de colaboración entre atacameños y arqueólogos. El objetivo del artículo es reflexionar sobre las definiciones y aplicaciones de metodologías colaborativas en proyectos arqueológicos. Para ello, la metodología que utilizamos es una discusión que parte de lo global, pasa por lo nacional y llega a lo local, desde donde abordamos un proyecto colaborativo en particular. Se trata de una investigación realizada entre principios de 2021 y mediados de 2024, que se centra en estudiar la historia del coleccionismo y la patrimonialización de cuerpos indígenas en el territorio atacameño lickanantay, así como en socializar esta información entre las comunidades locales. A partir de este trabajo se concluye que toda investigación en el territorio debe hacerse con el involucramiento y autorización de las comunidades atacameñas. Asimismo, se considera que los atacameños deben dejar de ser los investigados y pasar a ser investigadores que lideren o colaboren en los estudios con sus comunidades y en su territorio.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has photometrically surveyed the entire Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere in Cycle 1 (2018 August–2019 July), Cycle 3 (2020 July–2021 June), and Cycle 5 (2022 September–2023 September). We use the observations from Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 to search for exoplanet systems that show a single transit event in each year, which we call duotransits. The periods of these planet candidates are typically in excess of 20 d, with the lower limit determined by the duration of individual TESS observations. We find 85 duotransit candidates, which span a range of host star brightnesses: 8 < Tmag < 14, transit depths between 0.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent, and transit durations between 2 and 10 h with the upper limit determined by our normalization function. Of these candidates, 25 are already known, and 60 are new. We present these candidates along with the status of photometric and spectroscopic follow-up.","This paper includes data collected by the TESS mission.

Our attention is centred on the anisotropic LRS Bianchi I and III metrics, Bianchi V metrics, and their isotropic limits. We provide a comprehensive overview of the first two metrics classes and offer new findings for Bianchi V metrics. We show that the Hubble parameter is a time-dependent perturbation parameter that controls the magnitude of the error between full-system and time-averaged solutions as it decreases, such that those complete and time-averaged systems have the same asymptotic behaviour.

However, marine deforestation due to wild kelp harvesting, among other drivers, is being observed worldwide. Studies assessing kelp removal effects often focus on the effects on kelp populations, although deforestation also impacts the organisms that interact directly or indirectly with kelp, including herbivores and algal assemblages. Using a meta-analytical approach, we estimated the magnitude and direction of kelp removal effects on kelp, invertebrate herbivores, and understory algae. We also tested if responses varied among functional groups of understory algae and whether results were influenced by the subtidal or intertidal distribution of the removed kelp species and the time elapsed since kelp removal. We observed a substantial decrease in kelp abundance, remaining for up to 4 years following kelp removal, with a larger decrease in subtidal kelp but no recovery observed in intertidal kelp over time. Invertebrate herbivore abundance showed no significant change over time. Understory algae abundance responded positively, although this effect tended to slightly decline over time following subtidal kelp removal. Canopy-, turf-forming and foliose algae were the most benefited, which raises concern about their potential to outcompete kelp. The early succession patterns and cascading effects within kelp forests illustrated here highlight the need for long-term studies to elucidate the long-lasting effects of kelp fisheries, which are scarce at present. There is also a need to consider kelp forests’ role in providing habitat and resources to improve predictive frameworks allowing kelp forest conservation and sustainable fisheries.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The continuum emission has a spectral index α ≈ 3.3, suggesting that the emission is from dust. The line emission is detected in several transitions of CS, SO, and SO2 and exhibits a line width FWHM ≈ 160 km s−1. The line profile appears Gaussian. The emission is weakly spatially resolved, coming from an area on the sky ≲1″ in diameter (≲104 au at the distance of the Galactic center, GC). The centroid velocity is v LSR ≈ 40–50 km s−1, which is consistent with a location in the GC. With multiple SO lines detected, and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, the gas temperature is T LTE = 13 K, which is colder than seen in typical GC clouds, though we cannot rule out low-density, subthermally excited, warmer gas. Despite the high velocity dispersion, no emission is observed from SiO, suggesting that there are no strong (≳10 km s−1) shocks in the molecular gas. There are no detections at other wavelengths, including X-ray, infrared, and radio. We consider several explanations for the millimeter ultra-broad-line object (MUBLO), including protostellar outflow, explosive outflow, a collapsing cloud, an evolved star, a stellar merger, a high-velocity compact cloud, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a background galaxy. Most of these conceptual models are either inconsistent with the data or do not fully explain them. The MUBLO is, at present, an observationally unique object.","We thank the anonymous referee for a helpful and constructive review.

They contribute disproportionately to the cycling of carbon and nutrients in the ocean and influence marine biogeochemistry beyond their productive regions. Characterized by intense microbial respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic), major coastal upwelling systems are also hotspots for the production and outgassing of potent greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2, N2O, and CH4. Quantifying and understanding these roles in the context of a changing climate is therefore a subject of great interest. Here we provide a short synthesis of the current knowledge of the contributions of major coastal upwelling systems to the cycling of GHG. Despite variations within and among different systems, low-latitude coastal upwelling systems typically act as a net carbon source to the atmosphere, while those at higher latitudes function as weak sinks or remain neutral regarding atmospheric CO2. These systems also significantly contribute to oceanic N2O and CH4 emissions, although the extent of their contribution to the latter remains poorly constrained. We also overview recent and future changes to upwelling systems in the context of a warmer climate and discuss uncertainties and implications for GHG production. Although rapid coastal warming is anticipated in all major coastal upwelling systems, the future changes in upwelling-favorable winds and their implications within the context of increased stratification are uncertain. Finally, we examine the major challenges that impede our ability to accurately predict how major coastal upwelling systems will respond to future climate change, and present recommendations for future research to better capture ongoing changes and disentangle natural and forced variability.","Funding This synthesis is a contribution to the Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) special feature on recent progress and developments in the study of upwelling systems.

104,pub.1171152058,10.3390/fractalfract8050253,,,Conformal and Non-Minimal Couplings in Fractional Cosmology,"Fractional differential calculus is a mathematical tool that has found applications in the study of social and physical behaviors considered “anomalous”. It is often used when traditional integer derivatives models fail to represent cases where the power law is observed accurately. Fractional calculus must reflect non-local, frequency- and history-dependent properties of power-law phenomena. This tool has various important applications, such as fractional mass conservation, electrochemical analysis, groundwater flow problems, and fractional spatiotemporal diffusion equations. It can also be used in cosmology to explain late-time cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy. We review some models using fractional differential equations. We look at the Einstein–Hilbert action, which is based on a fractional derivative action, and add a scalar field, ϕ, to create a non-minimal interaction theory with the coupling, ξRϕ2, between gravity and the scalar field, where ξ is the interaction constant. By employing various mathematical approaches, we can offer precise schemes to find analytical and numerical approximations of the solutions. Moreover, we comprehensively study the modified cosmological equations and analyze the solution space using the theory of dynamical systems and asymptotic expansion methods. This enables us to provide a qualitative description of cosmologies with a scalar field based on fractional calculus formalism.","We are thankful for the support of Núcleo de Investigación Geometría Diferencial y Aplicaciones, Resolución VRIDT No. 096/2022.

Yet, Colombian mental health services do not meet the needs of this population. Scalable, task-sharing interventions, such as Group Problem Management Plus (Group PM+), have the potential to bridge this gap by utilizing lay workers to provide the intervention. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of how and for whom Group PM+ is most effective. This mixed methods study utilized data from a randomized effectiveness-implementation trial to examine the mediators and moderators of Group PM+ on mental health outcomes. One hundred twenty-eight migrant and refugee women in northern Colombia participated in Group PM+ delivered by trained community members. Patterns in moderation effects showed that participants in more stable, less marginalized positions improved the most. Results from linear regression models showed that Group PM+-related skill acquisition was not a significant mediator of the association between session attendance and mental health outcomes. Participants and facilitators reported additional possible mediators and community-level moderators that warrant future research. Further studies are needed to examine mediators and moderators contributing to the effectiveness of task-shared, scalable, psychological interventions in diverse contexts.","We would like to dedicate this manuscript to a cherished colleague and friend, Valeria Meriño.

The women residents also participated in questionnaire-based responses about their domestic water supplies, water-storage and maintenance and mosquito life stages and disease transmission knowledge, to subsequently plan appropriate resident education programmes. Microsoft Excel 8.0 with OpenEpi was used to determine the samples sizes and the statistical values.ResultsTapped water supplies to the three poor Barranquilla neighbourhoods were dramatically increased from 2004 to 2023 resulting in their residents significantly reducing their: (a) large cement water-storage tanks from 1 per 6.9 (2004) to 1 per 31.2 (2020) premises (z = 10.5: p = 0) and (b) PPI values to 0.16, 0.19 and 0.53 (mean: 0.29: 95% CI ± 0.4) in each study neighbourhood. In contrast, tapped water supplies remained inadequate in the Buenaventura neighborhoods, thereby resulting in their continued use of many large (> 1,000-litre) water-storage containers (Barranquilla: 1 per 31.2 and Buenaventura: 1 per 1.5 premises: z = − 9.26: p = 0), with unacceptably high 0.81, 0.88 and 0.99 PPI values in each study neighbourhood (mean 0.89: 95% CI ± 0.12).ConclusionsImproved tapped water supplies resulted in reduced numbers of large custom-made stoneware water-containers, as are employed by poor residents throughout the world, as well as their Ae. aegypti PPI transmission threshold values which, together with appropriate residents’ education programmes, are also urgently to reduce to prevent/reduce Ae. aegypti transmitted human diseases globally.","We grateful acknowledge the field work performed for this project by the local Health Workers of Melisa Machado and her team in Buenaventura, as well as Alicia Rodríguez and her team in Barranquilla.

Using 7-(diethylamino)quinolone and vanillin as electron donor (D) moieties, these were linked together through the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system acting as a linker and an electron acceptor (A). The photophysical properties were studied, revealing significant Stokes shifts and strong solvatofluorochromism caused by the ICT and TICT behavior produced by the push-pull effect. Moreover, quenching caused by the population of the TICT state in THF-H2O mixtures was observed, and the emission in the solid state evidenced a red shift compared to the emission in solution. These findings were corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing the wb97xd/6-311G(d,p) method. The cytotoxic activity of the synthesized compounds was assessed on BHK-21, PC3, and LNCaP cell lines, revealing moderate activity across all compounds. Notably, compound 5b exhibited the highest activity against LNCaP cells, with an LC50 value of 10.89 μM. Furthermore, the compounds were evaluated for their potential as imaging agents in living prostate cells. The results demonstrated their favorable cell permeability and strong emission at 488 nm, positioning them as promising candidates for cancer cell imaging applications.","The authors gratefully acknowledge Universidad del Norte and Universidad del Atlántico for financial support.

However, their poor corrosion resistance can lead to issues such as osteolysis and the release of gaseous hydrogen. This study investigated the influence of the activation time of magnesium surfaces in a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution on the concentration of active hydroxyl groups and corrosion resistance. The results indicated that immersion time significantly influences the formation of a corrosion-resistant film and the distribution of surface hydroxyl groups. Specifically, specimens treated for 7.5 h exhibited the highest concentration of hydroxyl groups and the most uniform oxide film distribution. Electrochemical tests demonstrated capacitive behavior and passive surface formation for all evaluated times, with the 7.5-h immersion in NaOH yielding superior corrosion resistance, lower current density, and a more efficient and thicker protective film. SEM and EDS analyses confirmed increased formation of Mg(OH)₂ for samples treated for 5 and 7.5 h, while a 10-h treatment resulted in a brittle, porous layer prone to degradation. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and Fisher's LSD test corroborated these findings. The optimal 7.5-h alkali treatment enhanced magnesium's corrosion resistance and surface properties, making it a promising candidate for orthopedic implants. However, further studies are necessary to assess biocompatibility and physiological responses before clinical implementation.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Lily Margareth Arrieta Payares reports financial support was provided by Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia.","The authors acknowledge the financing of the: • Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia through the “Créditos educativos condonables para la formación de capital humano de alto nivel para las regiones” - Atlántico, Colombia.

METHODS: Analytical cohort study based on breast cancer incident cases recorded by the Population-based Manizales Cancer Registry between 2008-2015. Patients were followed-up for 60 months. Cause-specific survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method for variables of interest, with the Wilcoxon-Breslow-Gehan test for differences. Cox multivariate regression models were fitted.
RESULTS: 856 breast cancer cases were included. The 5-year cause-specific survival for the entire cohort was 78.2%. It was higher in women with special/exception health insurance, high socioeconomic level, <50 years old, ductal carcinoma, and stages I and II. Residential area did not impact survival. In Cox models, the subsidized health insurance regime (HR: 4.87 vs contributory) and low socioeconomic level (HR: 2.45 vs high) were predictors of the hazard of death in women with breast cancer, adjusted for age, histology, stage and interactions age-stage and insurance-stage. A positive interaction (synergistic effect modification) between health insurance regime and stage regarding to survival was observed.
CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic factors significantly contribute to the inequities in breast cancer survival, independent of the stage at diagnosis. This suggests the need for comprehensive interventions to remove barriers to accessing the health system. This research provides evidence of survival gaps mediated by certain social determinants of health and generates data on the overall performance of the Colombian health system.",,"Funding: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is part of the project , co-financed by the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Grant number 111584267659) and by the participating institutions: Universidad de Antioquia, Universidad del Norte, Universidad de Caldas, Universidad de Nariño, Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia, Queen Mary University of London and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer.",Cancer Control,,,Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Colombia; Cohort Studies; Breast; Health Inequities,2024-01,2024,2024-04-01,2024-01,31,,10732748241244928,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arias-Ortiz, Nelson; Rodríguez-Betancourt, Juan David; Toro-Toro, Jhon Eder; Navarro-Lechuga, Édgar; Jurado-Fajardo, Daniel Marcelo; Cárdenas-Garzón, Karen; Sánchez-Vásquez, Gloria Inés","Arias-Ortiz, Nelson (Grupo de Investigación Promoción de la Salud y Prevención de la Enfermedad, Universidad de Caldas, Manizales, Colombia; Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad de Caldas, Manizales, Colombia; Registro Poblacional de Cáncer de Manizales.

This study was performed on a site with high incidences of classical dengue, but relatively few DHF/DSS or SD cases as defined by the WHO 1997 or 2009 criteria, respectively. Clinical, haematological/biochemical, and viral diagnostic data were collected from febrile patients before, during, and after the COVID-19 epidemic to assess whether (a) DENV-infected patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infections or (b) DENV-SARS-CoV-2-co-infected patients had increased incidences of SD/DHF/DSS using logistic regression and machine learning models. Higher numbers of DHF/DSS/SD occurred during the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly in males and 18-40-year-olds. Significantly increased symptoms in the DENV-SARS-CoV-2-co-infected cases were (a) haemoconcentration (p < 0.0009) and hypotension (p < 0.0005) (DHF/DSS and SD criteria), (b) thrombocytopenia and mucosal bleeding (DHF/DSS-criteria), (c) abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia (SD warning signs) and (d) dyspnoea, but without fluid accumulation. DENV-infected patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infections had significantly increased incidences of thrombocytopenia (DHF/DSS-criteria) and/or abdominal pain and persistent vomiting and also thrombocytopenia (SD warning signs), but without significant haemoconcentration or hypotension. DENV-SARS-CoV-2 co-infections significantly increased the incidence of DHF/DSS/SD, while DENV-infected patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infections displayed significantly increased incidences of thrombocytopenia (DHF/DSS-criteria) and three important SD warning signs, which are therefore very important for health workers/clinicians in assessing patients' DHF/DSS/SD risk factors and planning their optimal therapies.","We are very grateful to the Colombian Ministry of Health/National Health Institute for providing the DENV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-infected patients’ data, which were collected prior to, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",This research received no external funding.,Pathogens,,,,2024-07-10,2024,2024-07-10,,13,7,573,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bukhari, Moeen Hamid; Annan, Esther; Haque, Ubydul; Arango, Pedro; Falconar, Andrew K.

To mitigate these concerns, a biofunctionalization approach involving dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) compounds and Chlorella sp. biomass was employed via electrodeposition, silanization, and dip-coating. Surface characterization using XRD, FTIR, and SEM confirmed successful deposition and immobilization. Corrosion behavior was assessed through electrochemical, immersion, and atomic absorption tests, revealing improved resistance and reduced Mg2+ ion release.

The deposit of TiO2 was performed by spin coating and the ZnO thin films were deposited onto the TiO2 surface by plasma-assisted reactive evaporation technique. The characterization of the compounds was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were performed to support the observed experimental results. Thus, the removal of methylene blue (MB) by adsorption and posterior photocatalytic degradation was studied. Adsorption kinetic results showed that TiO2/ZnO thin films were more efficient in MB removal than bare TiO2 thin films, and the pseudo-second-order model was suitable to describe the experimental results for TiO2/ZnO (q e = 12.9 mg/g; k 2 = 0.14 g/mg/min) and TiO2 thin films (q e = 12.0 mg/g; k 2 = 0.13 g/mg/min). Photocatalytic results under UV irradiation showed that TiO2 thin films reached 10.9% of MB photodegradation (k = 1.0 × 10-3 min-1), whereas TiO2/ZnO thin films reached 20.6% of MB photodegradation (k = 3.9 × 10-3 min-1). Both thin films reduced the photocatalytic efficiency by less than 3% after 4 photocatalytic tests. DFT study showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) energy gap decreases for the mixed nanoparticle system, showing its increased reactivity. Furthermore, the chemical hardness shows a lower value for the mixed system, whereas the electrophilicity index shows the biggest value, supporting the larger reactivity for the mixed nanoparticle system.

We calculate the enthalpies of incorporation both at pre-existing vacancies in symmetrically non-equivalent sites, and at interstitial positions. At high pressure, most structural changes affect the MgO6$$_{6}$$ units and the enthalpies of point defects increase, with those involving Mg and Si vacancies increasing more than those involving O sites. At 15 GPa Si vacancies and Mg interstitials have become the predominant intrinsic defects. We use these calculated enthalpies to estimate the total uptake of noble gases into the bulk crystal as a function of temperature and pressure both in the presence and absence of other heterovalent trace elements. For He and Ne our calculated solubilities point to atoms occupying mainly interstitial sites in agreement with previous experimental work. In contrast, Ar most likely substitutes for Mg due to its larger size and the deformation it causes within the crystal. Incorporation energies, as well as atomic distances suggest that the incorporation mainly depend on the size mismatch between host and guest atoms. Polarization effects arising from the polarizability of the noble gas atom or the presence of charged defects are minimal and do not contribute significantly to the uptake. Finally, the discrepancies between our results and recent experiments suggest that there are other incorporation mechanisms such as adsorption at internal and external interfaces, voids and grain boundaries which must play a major role in noble gas storage and solubility.",This work was performed using Granado-HPC at the Universidad del Norte and SCARF at STFC of the UK.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was utilized for this study, involving measurements of velocity, pressure, and wall shear stress (WSS) at various time points during the third cardiac cycle, at specific positions within two cross sections of the thoracic aorta. The first cross-section (Cross-Section 1, CS1) is located before the initial fluid bifurcation, just before the right subclavian artery. The second cross-section (Cross-Section 2, CS2) is situated immediately after the left subclavian artery. The results reveal that, under regular aortic geometries, velocity and pressure magnitudes follow the principles of fluid dynamics, displaying variations. However, in Patient II, an endoprosthesis near the CS2 and the proximal border of the endoprosthesis significantly disrupts fluid behavior owing to the pulsatile flow. The cross-sectional areas of Patient I are smaller than those of Patient II, leading to higher flow magnitudes. Although in CS1 of Patient I, there is considerable variability in velocity magnitudes, they exhibit a more uniform and predictable transition. In contrast, CS2 of Patient II, where magnitude variation is also high, displays irregular fluid behavior due to the endoprosthesis presence. This cross-section coincides with the border of the fluid bifurcation. Additionally, the irregular geometry caused by endovascular aneurysm repair contributes to flow disruption as the endoprosthesis adjusts to the endothelium, reshaping itself to conform with the vessel wall. In this context, significant alterations in velocity values, pressure differentials fluctuating by up to 10%, and low wall shear stress indicate the pronounced influence of the endovascular prosthesis on blood flow behavior. These flow disturbances, when compounded by the heart rate, can potentially lead to changes in vascular anatomy and displacement, resulting in a disruption of the prosthesis-endothelium continuity and thereby causing clinical complications in the patient.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Heliyon,,,,2024-02-20,2024,2024-02-20,2024-03,10,5,e26355,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tello, Juan P.; Velez, Juan C.; Cadena, Alberto; Jutinico, Andres; Pardo, Mauricio; Percybrooks, Winston","Tello, Juan P.

We present the clinical case of a 10-year-old female patient who presented with progressive nail deformity. The onset of the condition was approximately five years prior to presentation with an injury in the left hallux, according to the mother. She denied pain or change in the color of the area from the onset of the injury to the day of consultation. There was no previous trauma. Examination revealed subungual bone injury to the distal extremity (distal phalanx of the left hallux), and imaging tests (X-ray and soft tissue ultrasound) found bone injury. Subungual exostosis was considered as a possible diagnosis, thus prompting the indication for exeresis of the tumoral process. After surgical removal, the resected specimen was sent for pathological assessment, which found that an intraosseous hemangiolymphangioma was the origin of the tumor. A subungual exostosis is a slow-growth benign osseous tumor mainly located in the distal phalanx of the hallux that especially affects young adults, being less frequent in children. This condition results from a process of bone neoformation involving different stages, the clinical symptoms of which depend on its size and associated processes. Hemangiolymphangiomas are angiomatous lesions of the blood and lymphatic vessels that have a controversial etiology and present slow, painless, and progressive growth; these lesions are mostly benign. It is worth emphasizing that subungual injuries are not always caused by an underlying bone; therefore, potential differential diagnoses, both benign and malignant, should be considered, based on the location of the injury.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2024-01-01,2024,2024-01-01,,16,1,e51482,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro; Fretes, Alberto Navarro; Villate, María Mercedes Medina","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, PRY); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Villate, María Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY)","Villate, María Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY; Universidad del Norte); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Universidad del Norte; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Villate, María Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, PRY)",0,0,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/case_report/pdf/194352/20240102-25990-qi18n.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167548301,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,

The objectives were (a) to describe health characteristics, peri- and postnatal pathologies, and positional cranial deformities in infants enrolled in an early intervention program and (b) to analyze the effects of a parent education-based intervention program on positional cranial deformity in premature infants. A quantitative, analytical, longitudinal study was conducted. It included 103 premature infants enrolled in an early intervention program (EIP) during the year 2017, all under 4 months of corrected age, to whom a parent education-based intervention program was applied. Cranial circumference, cranial width, diagonals, and anteroposterior diameter were measured, and the cranial asymmetry index (CAI) and cephalic index (CI) were calculated at baseline and during two subsequent evaluations separated by a 3-month period. The main results showed that 75.7% of the infants belonged to a very premature gestational age category, and 57.3% had an adequate weight for gestational age. The most frequent pathologies were premature jaundice, premature anemia, and hyaline membrane disease. The most frequent positional cranial deformity was plagiocephaly. The parent education-based intervention program resulted in (1) a significant decrease in the CAI and a significant increase in the IC, (2) plagiocephalies: an increase in the mild category and a decrease in the moderate + severe categories, (3) brachycephalies: a decrease in the absence category and an increase in the moderate + severe category, and (4) dolichocephalies: an increase in the absence category and a decrease in the mild category. In conclusion, the recommended first line of intervention was not enough for this population, and future studies should support the development of national clinical guidelines, where education is complemented with other therapeutic measures.",We give thanks to the families of the infants belonging to the EIP of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso.,This research received no external funding.,Children,,Mark Dzietko,,2024-03-04,2024,2024-03-04,,11,3,302,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mosca-Hayler, Alexandra; López-Schmidt, Daniela; Curotto-Noce, Romina; Cuevas-Aburto, Jorge; Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime; Durán-Agüero, Samuel; González, Juana Borja; Diaz-Martínez, Ximena; Zapata-Lamana, Rafael; Parra-Rizo, María Antonia; Cigarroa, Igor","Mosca-Hayler, Alexandra (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2340000, Chile;, alexandra.mosca@pucv.cl, (A.M.-H.);, daniela.lopez@pucv.cl, (D.L.-S.);, romina.curotto@pucv.cl, (R.C.-N.)); López-Schmidt, Daniela (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2340000, Chile;, alexandra.mosca@pucv.cl, (A.M.-H.);, daniela.lopez@pucv.cl, (D.L.-S.);, romina.curotto@pucv.cl, (R.C.-N.)); Curotto-Noce, Romina (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso 2340000, Chile;, alexandra.mosca@pucv.cl, (A.M.-H.);, daniela.lopez@pucv.cl, (D.L.-S.);, romina.curotto@pucv.cl, (R.C.-N.)); Cuevas-Aburto, Jorge (Centro de Aprendizaje, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile;, jorgecuevas@santotomas.cl); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Centro de Investigación de Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile;, jvasquez@ucm.cl); Durán-Agüero, Samuel (Escuela de Nutrición y Dietética, Facultad de Ciencias para el Cuidado de la Salud, Universidad San Sebastián, Santiago 8330106, Chile;, samuel.duran@uss.cl); González, Juana Borja (Programa de Enfermaría, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, gjuana@uninorte.edu.co); Diaz-Martínez, Ximena (Grupo de Investigación Calidad de Vida, Universidad del Biobío, Chillán 4300818, Chile;, xdiaz@ubiobio.cl); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile;, rafaelzapata@udec.cl); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Faculty of Health Sciences, Valencian International University (VIU), 46002 Valencia, Spain;, maria.parrar@umh.es; Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Social and Health Sciences, Campus of Elche, Miguel Hernandez University (UMH), 03202 Elche, Spain); Cigarroa, Igor (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Católica Silva Henríquez, La Florida 8240000, Chile; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Arturo Prat, Victoria 4720000, Chile)","Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Católica Silva Henríquez; Arturo Prat University)","Mosca-Hayler, Alexandra (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); López-Schmidt, Daniela (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Curotto-Noce, Romina (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Cuevas-Aburto, Jorge (Universidad Santo Tomás); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Catholic University of the Maule); Durán-Agüero, Samuel (San Sebastián University); González, Juana Borja (Universidad del Norte); Diaz-Martínez, Ximena (University of Bío-Bío); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (University of Concepción); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Valencian International University; Miguel Hernandez University); Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Católica Silva Henríquez; Arturo Prat University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9067/11/3/302/pdf?version=1709531861,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169437428,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3213 Paediatrics,4 Quality Education

Clinical features were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher exact tests. Renal biopsy was performed on 6 patients who were suspected of having other renal diseases before aHUS diagnosis. Results. Most patients were male (70%). The onset of aHUS occurred frequently before age 4 years (60%) and followed gastroenteritis as the main triggering event (52%). Age groups showed comparable clinical presentation, disease severity, treatment, and outcomes. Pulmonary involvement (67%) was the main extrarenal manifestation, particularly in the 1 to 7 age group (P = .01). Renal biopsies were as follows: 3 had membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I, one MPGN type III, one C3-glomerulonephritis, and one rapidly progressive GN. Genetic screening was available in 6 patients and identified 2xCFHR5, 2xMCP, 1xADAMTS13/THBD, and 1xDGKE mutations. A total of 15 relapses were seen, of which 8 (72%) occurred in the 1 to 7 age group. The renal outcome was not significantly different regardless of age group. Conclusion. In our cohort, we observed a relatively high frequency of extrarenal involvement at first presentation represented by pulmonary manifestations. The renal prognosis at initial presentation was worse than in previous reports.",Not applicable.,"Funding: The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Global Pediatric Health,,,,2024-01,2024,2024-02-10,2024-01,11,,2333794x241231133,All OA; Gold,Article,"Espitaleta, Zilac; Domínguez-Vargas, Alex; Villamizar-Martínez, Johanna; Carrascal-Guzmán, Martha; Guerrero-Tinoco, Gustavo; Silva-Díaz, Diana; Baquero, Richard; Pinto-Bernal, Claudia; González-Chaparro, Luz; Rojas-Rosas, Luisa; Amado-Niño, Pilar; Castillo-Arteaga, Mariángel; Alvarez-Gómez, Yeferson; Arguello-Muñoz, Laura; Morales-Camacho, William; León-Guerra, Oscar; Egea, Eduardo; Galeano-Rodríguez, Ricardo; Quintero-Gómez, Ana; Aroca-Martínez, Gustavo; Musso, Carlos G.","Espitaleta, Zilac (Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Villamizar-Martínez, Johanna (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carrascal-Guzmán, Martha (Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia); Guerrero-Tinoco, Gustavo (Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Silva-Díaz, Diana (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Baquero, Richard (Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia); Pinto-Bernal, Claudia (Unidad Renal Fresenius Medical Care, Bucaramanga, Colombia); González-Chaparro, Luz (Universidad El Bosque, Bogotá, Colombia); Rojas-Rosas, Luisa (Corporación Universitaria Remington, Medellín, Colombia); Amado-Niño, Pilar (Unidad Renal RTS, Bucaramanga, Colombia); Castillo-Arteaga, Mariángel (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Alvarez-Gómez, Yeferson (Fresenius MC, Pereira, Colombia); Arguello-Muñoz, Laura (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Morales-Camacho, William (Universidad El Bosque, Bogotá, Colombia); León-Guerra, Oscar (Fundación Hospital de la Misericordia (HOMI), Bogotá, Colombia); Egea, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Galeano-Rodríguez, Ricardo (Fundación Hospital de la Misericordia (HOMI), Bogotá, Colombia); Quintero-Gómez, Ana (Clínica Somer, Rionegro, Colombia); Aroca-Martínez, Gustavo (Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Musso, Carlos G.

The results were as follows: (i) the degree of repellency (DR) of the EOs against S. zeamais was 20-68% (2 h) and 28-74% (4 h); (ii) the IC50 values on AChE were 5-36 µg/mL; likewise, the %inh. on AChE (1 µg/cm3 per EO) did not show any effect in 91% of the EO tested; (iii) six EOs (Bursera graveolens-bark, B. graveolens-leaves, B. simaruba-bark, Peperomia pellucida-leaves, Piper holtonii (1b*)-leaves, and P. reticulatum-leaves) exhibited a DR (53-74%) ≥ C+ (chlorpyrifos-61%), while all EOs were less active (8-60-fold) on AChE compared to chlorpyrifos (IC50 of 0.59 µg/mL). Based on the ANOVA/linear regression and multivariate analysis of data, some differences/similarities could be established, as well as identifying the most active EOs (five: B. simaruba-bark, Pep. Pellucida-leaves, P. holtonii (1b*)-leaves, B. graveolens-bark, and B. graveolens-leaves).

This study investigates the effects of pyrolysis oil derived from cassava peel waste (CPO), hydrogen (H), and diesel (D) blends as a partial substitute for low-displacement compression ignition engines. We tested three blends - CPO25, CPO25H5, and CPO25H10 - against neat diesel operation at engine speeds of 3400 rpm, 3600 rpm, and 3800 rpm and torques of 4 Nm, 6 Nm, and 8 Nm. Our findings reveal that while energy efficiency decreased with CPO25 compared to D100 operation, adding H2 increased energy efficiency. The highest increase was 7.8 % for CPO25H5 and 16 % for CPO25H10 compared to CPO25. Exergy efficiency also decreased with CPO25 compared to D100, but adding H2 compensated for this reduction. The highest increase was 8.0 % for CPO25H5 and 17 % for CPO25H10 compared to D100. CPO25H10 showed an increase of 8.1 % in combustion pressure and 9.9 % in heat release rate compared to CPO25. Emissions analysis also revealed that CO emissions were considerably lower with CPO and H2 than with D100, with the highest decrease of 11 % with CPO25H10. CO2 and hydrocarbon emissions followed the same trend as CO. Although NOx emissions slightly increased, the benefits of using pyrolysis oil-H2-diesel blends as a partial substitution fuel for low-displacement compression ignition engines are evident.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Jorge Duarte reports financial support was provided by Universidad del Atlántico.

In-depth understanding of RSV entry mechanisms is essential for effective antiviral development. This study introduces an innovative RSV variant, featuring the fusion of the beta-lactamase (BlaM) enzyme with the RSV-P phosphoprotein, providing a versatile tool for dissecting viral entry dynamics.
Methods: Using the AlphaFold2 algorithm, we modeled the tertiary structure of the P-BlaM chimera, revealing structural similarities with both RSV-P and BlaM. Functional assessments, utilizing flow cytometry, quantified beta-lactamase activity and GFP expression in infected bronchial epithelial cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the integrity of P-BlaM within virions.
Results: The modeled P-BlaM chimera exhibited structural parallels with RSV-P and BlaM. Functional assays demonstrated robust beta-lactamase activity in recombinant virions, confirming successful P-BlaM incorporation as a structural protein. Quercetin, known for its antiviral properties, impeded viral entry by affecting virion fusion. Additionally, Ulixertinib, an ERK-1/2 inhibitor, significantly curtailed viral entry, implicating ERK-1/2 pathway signaling.
Conclusions: Our engineered RSV-P-BlaM chimera emerges as a valuable tool, illuminating RSV entry mechanisms. Structural and functional analyses unveil potential therapeutic targets. Quercetin and Ulixertinib, identified as distinct stage inhibitors, show promise for targeted antiviral strategies. Time-of-addition assays pinpoint quercetin's specific interference stage, advancing our comprehension of RSV entry and guiding future antiviral developments.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In addition, most of the studies have only performed exploratory analyses of its factorial structure.ObjectiveThe objective of the present study was to confirm the structure and factorial invariance of the FACES III scale in nursing and obstetric students from Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.MethodsA total of 3303 students from the four countries participated in this study (Colombia = 1559, Chile = 1224, Peru = 215, Mexico = 305).ResultsThe results of the study showed that the Bi-factor model presents the best-fit indexes to the data from Colombia, Chile, and Mexico, but not from Peru. In addition, it was found that this model showed evidence of being strictly invariant among the three countries in the sequence of the invariance models proposed: metric invariance (ΔRMSEA = .000), scalar (ΔRMSEA = .008), and strict (ΔRMSEA = .008). The bi-factor model also showed adequate reliability indexes in the three countries.ConclusionIt is concluded that the FACES III scale shows adequate psychometric performance under a bi-factor model in nursing and obstetric students from Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. The lack of fit of the model in Peru could be associated with the small sample size.","Acknowledgements

Considering its prevalence and the associated severe health repercussions, hypertension has become a disease of great relevance for public health across the globe. Conventionally, the classification of an individual as hypertensive or non-hypertensive is conducted through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-h period. Although this method provides a reliable diagnosis, it has notable limitations, such as additional costs, intolerance experienced by some patients, and interferences derived from physical activities. Moreover, some patients with significant renal impairment may not present proteinuria. Accordingly, alternative methodologies are applied for the classification of individuals as hypertensive or non-hypertensive, such as the detection of metabolites in urine samples through liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. However, the high cost of these techniques limits their applicability for clinical use. Consequently, an alternative methodology was developed for the detection of molecular patterns in urine collected from hypertension patients. This study generated a direct discrimination model for hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals through the amplification of Raman signals in urine samples based on gold nanoparticles and supported by chemometric techniques such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Specifically, 162 patient urine samples were used to create a PLS-DA model. These samples included 87 urine samples from patients diagnosed with hypertension and 75 samples from non-hypertensive volunteers. In the AH group, 35 patients were diagnosed with kidney damage and were further classified into a subgroup termed (RAH). The PLS-DA model with 4 latent variables (LV) was used to classify the hypertensive patients with external validation prediction (P) sensitivity of 86.4%, P specificity of 77.8%, and P accuracy of 82.5%. This study demonstrates the ability of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to differentiate between hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients through urine samples, representing a significant advance in the detection and management of AH. Additionally, the same model was then used to discriminate only patients diagnosed with renal damage and controls with a P sensitivity of 100%, P specificity of 77.8%, and P accuracy of 82.5%.",,"We declare that the funds or sources of support received in this specific internal report study were from the Universidad Simón Bolívar, Clinica de la Costa and that the external funding was from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia; subsidy: 125380763038; subsidy: 125384467468 and Contract: RC No. 852 de 2019.

RESULTS: The rates of CoronaVac effectiveness were 32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31-33) for preventing infection, 55% (95% CI 54-56) for hospitalisation, and 90% (95% CI 89-90) for death, at the end of follow-up. These findings were more consistent during the first 4 months. Compared with the unvaccinated group, homologous booster doses appeared to increase effectiveness in preventing hospitalisation, whereas heterologous booster doses increased protection for both hospitalisation and death. Booster doses did not improve effectiveness among those already vaccinated with CoronaVac, even when they received heterologous boosters.
CONCLUSIONS: CoronaVac demonstrated effectiveness in preventing death and hospitalisation during the first year of follow-up, but its effectiveness in preventing infection was lower, decreasing rapidly after the first 4 months of follow-up. The effectiveness was higher among children aged between 3 and 12 years, and among adults aged ≥60 years. Booster doses did not improve effectiveness among those already vaccinated with CoronaVac.","Declarations of competing interest The authors have no competing interests to declare.

For spherical nanoparticles and nanorods, compact expressions for the limiting potentials at which the space charge layer includes the whole semiconductor are reported. We provide a quantitative analysis of the distribution of the potential drop between the solid and the liquid and show that the relative importance changes with doping. It is usually assumed that high doping improves charge dynamics in the semiconductor but reduces the width of the space charge layer. However, nanostructuring counterbalances the latter negative effect; we show quantitatively that in highly doped nanoparticles the space charge layer can occupy a similar volume fraction as in low-doped microparticles. Moreover, as shown by some recent experiments, under conditions of high doping the electric fields in the Helmholtz layer can be as high as 100 mV/Å, comparable to electric fields inducing freezing in water. This work provides a systematic quantitative framework for understanding the effects of doping and nanostructuring on electrochemical interfaces, and suggests that it is necessary to better characterize the interface at the atomistic level.",H.J.E.-K. would like to acknowledge support from the ICTP through the Associates Programme.,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,,,2024-07-12,2024,2024-07-12,,17,14,3460,All OA; Gold,Article,"Seriani, Nicola; Delcompare-Rodriguez, Paola; Pandey, Dhanshree; Adak, Abhishek Kumar; Mahamiya, Vikram; Pinilla, Carlos; El-Khozondar, Hala J.","Seriani, Nicola (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11, 34151 Trieste, Italy, aadak@ictp.it, (A.K.A.);); Delcompare-Rodriguez, Paola (Istituto Officina dei Materiali, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR-IOM), Via Bonomea 265, 34136 Trieste, Italy); Pandey, Dhanshree (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11, 34151 Trieste, Italy, aadak@ictp.it, (A.K.A.);); Adak, Abhishek Kumar (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11, 34151 Trieste, Italy, aadak@ictp.it, (A.K.A.);); Mahamiya, Vikram (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11, 34151 Trieste, Italy, aadak@ictp.it, (A.K.A.);); Pinilla, Carlos (Departamento de Fisica y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia); El-Khozondar, Hala J.

Four formulations were prepared using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan (CS), with silicon dioxide nanoparticles (NPs-SiO2) incorporated using the freeze-drying method at a temperature of -50 °C. TGA and DSC showed no change in thermal degradation, with glass transition temperatures around 74 °C and 77 °C. The interactions between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and CS remained stable. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the incorporation of NPs-SiO2 complemented the freeze-drying process, enabling the dispersion of the components on the polymeric matrix and obtaining structures with a small pore size (between 30 and 60 μm) and large pores (between 100 and 160 μm). The antimicrobial capacity analysis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria revealed that the scaffolds inhibited around 99% of K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and S. aureus ATCC 55804. The subdermal implantation analysis demonstrated tissue growth and proliferation, with good biocompatibility, promoting the healing process for tissue restoration through the simultaneous degradation and formation of type I collagen fibers.

The first step in this approach is the development of an energy diagnostic. However, multiple practical aspects remain unresolved when applying the existing methodologies to perform energy diagnostics, especially in the case of small and medium-scale airports. Seeking to address these issues, this work presents energy diagnostics of two Mexican international airports so that it can be used to carry out energy diagnostics in other airports with similar characteristics. Emphasis is given to identifying and prioritizing, from a sustainable point of view, the strategies to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions. The Ciudad del Carmen Airport (CME) is located in a nearshore region with high ambient temperatures (27 °C) and humidities. It was found that in 2019, the CME airport consumed 123 MWh with an average of 577 Wh per passenger, with the HVAC system being the primary energy consumer. Critical strategies for the CME airport include photovoltaic systems and HVAC renovation. In contrast, the Puebla airport (PBC) is located in a region with comfortable ambient conditions (16 °C). In 2019, the PBC airport consumed 61.31 MWh/year and 442 Wh per passenger. The main strategies for PBC include expanding its photovoltaic energy generation system, employee awareness programs, and renewing the vehicle fleet with electric vehicles.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We aimed to examine the multidimensional aspects and patterns of food insecurity and other material hardships in a cross-sectional sample of 6221 Venezuelan refugees and migrants in urban Colombia using a latent class analysis. Using multinomial and logistic regression models, we investigated the demographic and migratory experiences associated with identified classes and how class membership is associated with multiple health outcomes among Venezuelan refugees and migrants, respectively. Approximately two thirds of the sample was comprised cisgender women, and the participants had a median age of 32 years (IQR: 26-41). Four heterogeneous classes of food insecurity and material hardships emerged: Class 1-low food insecurity and material hardship; Class 2-high food insecurity and material hardship; Class 3-high income hardship with insufficient food intake; and Class 4-income hardship with food affordability challenges. Class 2 reflected the most severe food insecurity and material hardships and had the highest class membership; Venezuelans with an irregular migration status were almost 1.5 times more likely to belong to this class. Food insecurity and material hardship class membership was independently associated with self-rated health, mental health symptoms, and recent violence victimization and marginally associated with infectious disease outcomes (laboratory-confirmed HIV and/or syphilis infection). Social safety nets, social protection, and other interventions that reduce and prevent material hardships and food insecurity among refugees and migrants, alongside the host community, may improve public health, support development, and reduce healthcare costs. In the long term, regularization and social policies for migrants aimed at enhancing refugees' and migrants' social and economic inclusion may contribute to improving food security in this population.","Gratitude is extended to the thousands of Venezuelan migrants and refugees who participated in this study.

Currently, there have been reports of ectopic prostate and colon tissue in the bladder. These ectopic tissues are manifested as a bladder mass and cause lower urinary tract symptoms. However, the ectopic corpus cavernosum in the bladder has never been reported, and its clinical characteristics and treatment have not been explored yet.
Case summary: A 3-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital due to 1 month of urinary frequency. The physical examination was unremarkable. Urine analysis from other hospitals showed an elevated urine white blood cell count of 17.9/ul. In addition, ultrasound indicated a possible bladder mass. CT and MRI showed a well-margined lesion (1.9×1.9 cm) in the bladder trigone. Through preoperative imaging, we diagnosed a bladder tumor (inclined towards benign). The transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed. Unfortunately, the surgery was unsuccessful due to the difficulty in removing the excised tissue through the urethra. Subsequently, bladder incision and tumor resection were performed. The tumor was successfully removed. Surprisingly, the postoperative pathology showed that the tumor tissue was corpus cavernosum. The pathological diagnosis was ectopic corpus cavernosum in the bladder. No complications were found after the operation, and no recurrence was observed during follow-up.
Conclusion: The ectopic corpus cavernosum in the bladder has never been reported for children, which is presented as a benign tumor with rapid proliferation and large size. Surgery is recommended. However, the transurethral resection of bladder tumors is difficult to perform due to narrow urethra and limited surgical instruments. Bladder incision and tumor resection may be preferred.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This article seeks to identify the psychosocial impact of the confinement period during the COVID-19 pandemic for the Colombian population by identifying profiles that predict the levels of different mental health indicators (feelings of fear, positive emotions or feelings during free time, and work impact) and based on them, characterize the risk factors and protection that allows us to propose guidelines for prevention or recovery from future health emergencies.
Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional, retrospective ex post facto study. Multistage cluster probabilistic sampling and binary logistic regression analysis were used to predict extreme levels of various mental health indicators based on psychosocial indicators of the COVID-19 confinement period and to identify risk and protection factors.
Results: A relationship was established between the combination of some of the different psychosocial factors evaluated (this combination being the predictive profile identified) with each of the three main variables: feeling of fear (n = 8,247; R = 0.32; p = 0.00; Poverall = 62.4%; 𝜔overall = 0.25; 1-𝛽overall = 1.00), positive emotions or feelings during free time (n = 6,853; R = 0.25; p = 0.00; Poverall = 59.1%; 𝜔overall = 0.18; 1-𝛽overall = 1.00) and labour impact (n = 4,573; R = 0.47; p = 0.63; Poverall = 70.4%; 𝜔overall = 0.41; 1-𝛽overall = 1.00), with social vulnerability determined by sociodemographic factors that were common in all profiles (sex, age, ethnicity and socioeconomic level) and conditions associated with job insecurity (unemployed, loss of health insurance and significant changes to job's requirements) and place of residence (city).
Conclusion: For future health emergencies, it is necessary to (i) mitigate the socio-employment impact from emergency containment measures in a scaled and differentiated manner at the local level, (ii) propose prevention and recovery actions through psychosocial and mental health care accessible to the entire population, especially vulnerable groups, (iii) Design and implement work, educational and recreational adaptation programs that can be integrated into confinement processes.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This effect originates from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which necessitates utilizing materials with heavy elements. Here, we show that in magnetic materials with non-collinear magnetic order, the Edelstein effect and, consequently, a current-induced torque can exist even in the absence of the spin-orbit coupling. Using group symmetry analysis, model calculations, and realistic simulations on selected compounds, we identify large classes of non-collinear magnet candidates and demonstrate that the current-driven torque is of similar magnitude as the celebrated spin-orbit torque in conventional transition metal structures. We also show that this torque can exist in an insulating material, which could allow for highly efficient electrical control of magnetic order.","R.G.-H. was supported by Universidad Nacional de Colombia with QUIPU code 202010042199 and MinCiencias Conv. 937 Fundamental Research.

Methods: A retrospective study of 1 451 possible donors, distributed in three regions of Colombia, evaluated in 2022. The general characteristics, diagnosis, and causes of contraindication for potential donors were described.
Results: Among the 1 451 possible donors, 441 (30.4%) fulfilled brain death criteria, constituting the potential donor pool. Families consented to organ donation in 141 medically suitable cases, while 60 instances utilized legal presumption, leading to 201 eligible donors (13.9%). Of those, 160 (11.0%) were actual donors (in whom operative incision was made with the intent of organ recovery or who had at least one organ recovered). Finally, we identified 147 utilized donors (10.1%) (from whom at least one organ was transplanted). Statistically significant differences were found between age, sex, diagnosis of brain death, and donor critical pathway between regions. A total of 411 organs were transplanted from 147 utilized donors, with kidneys being the most frequently procured and transplanted organs, accounting for 280 (68.1%) of the total. This was followed by 85 livers (20.7%), 31 hearts (7.5%), 14 lungs (3.4%), and 1 pancreas (0.2%). The discard rate of procured deceased donors was 8.1%.
Conclusions: About one-tenth of donors are effectively used for transplantation purposes.

Therefore, stakeholders of this industry must have robust tools to maintain good performance indicators of productivity and competitiveness. One of the most critical issues is the labour force related to allocation, performance evaluation, and foreseeing/adapting to new requirements. Many authors have studied the characteristics, elements, trends, and factors crucial in its management. However, there needs to be a comprehensive understanding of this concern. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a systematic literature review on labour force management in the maritime ports to (1) understand the elements and factors that strongly relate to human management and (2) identify future research directions to address the impact of labour shortages. Research questions and keywords were used to search academic databases for peer-reviewed papers, articles, or books. The search, selection and quality assessment processes were performed using the PRISMA methodology.

The study utilized a cross-sectional design. The sample size consisted of 42 schoolchildren (54.5% girls) aged 11 to 12 years old. Participant measurements included weight and height, which were used to categorize individuals based on BMI. Additionally, the electrical bioimpedance technique was employed to categorize participants based on their body fat percentage. A sudden destabilization test of the lower limb was performed to assess the reaction time of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis muscles. The results show that overweight/obese children have a longer muscle reaction time for both the rectus femoris (β = 18.13; p = 0.048) and the vastus lateralis (β = 14.51; p = 0.042). Likewise, when the children were classified by percentage of body fat the results showed that overfat/obese children have a longer muscle reaction time for both the rectus femoris (β = 18.13; p = 0.048) and the vastus lateralis (β = 14.51; p = 0.042). Our results indicate that BMI and fat mass classification negativity alter the muscle reaction time in children. Overweight/obese or overfat/obese children showed longer reaction times in the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles compared to children with normal weight. Based on these findings, it is suggested that in overweight and obese children, efforts not only focus on reducing body weight but that be complemented with training and/or rehabilitation programs that focus on preserving the normal physiological function of the musculoskeletal system.",,"This research was financed by the internal funds of the Academic Vice-Rector for Research and Postgraduate Studies of the Universidad Santo Tomás (Chile) (project number 113200024).

Lupus nephritis (LN), commonly known as renal involvement in SLE, is associated with a poorer prognosis and increased rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. Identifying new urinary biomarkers that can be used for LN prognosis or diagnosis is essential and is part of current active research. In this study, we applied an untargeted metabolomics approach involving liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to urine samples collected from 17 individuals with SLE and no kidney damage, 23 individuals with LN, and 10 clinically healthy controls (HCs) to identify differential metabolic profiles for SLE and LN. The data analysis revealed a differentially abundant metabolite expression profile for each study group, and those metabolites may act as potential differential biomarkers of SLE and LN. The differential metabolic pathways found between the LN and SLE patients with no kidney involvement included primary bile acid biosynthesis, branched-chain amino acid synthesis and degradation, pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis, lysine degradation, and tryptophan metabolism. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that monopalmitin, glycolic acid, and glutamic acid allowed for the differentiation of individuals with SLE and no kidney involvement and individuals with LN considering high confidence levels. While the results offer promise, it is important to recognize the significant influence of medications and other external factors on metabolomics studies. This impact has the potential to obscure differences in metabolic profiles, presenting a considerable challenge in the identification of disease biomarkers. Therefore, experimental validation should be conducted with a larger sample size to explore the diagnostic potential of the metabolites found as well as to examine how treatment and disease activity influence the identified chemical compounds. This will be crucial for refining the accuracy and effectiveness of using urine metabolomics for diagnosing and monitoring lupus and lupus nephritis.",We are truly grateful to the rheumatology department and the renal unit of the Clinica de la Costa in Barranquilla City (Colombia) for the recruitment and sample collection of the patients enrolled in this study.,"This study was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (MINCIENCIAS) (SIGP code: 125384467468, Contract: RC No. 852 of 2019).",Scientific Reports,,,"Humans; Female; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Adult; Metabolomics; Biomarkers; Male; Colombia; Lupus Nephritis; Metabolome; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Case-Control Studies; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Young Adult",2024-04-25,2024,2024-04-25,,14,1,9555,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rojo-Sánchez, Alejandra; Carmona-Martes, Ada; Díaz-Olmos, Yirys; Santamaría-Torres, Mary; Cala, Mónica P.; Orozco-Acosta, Erick; Aroca-Martínez, Gustavo; Pacheco-Londoño, Leonardo; Navarro-Quiroz, Elkin; Pacheco-Lugo, Lisandro A.","Rojo-Sánchez, Alejandra (Life Sciences Research Center, School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carmona-Martes, Ada (Life Sciences Research Center, School of Basic and Biomedical Sciences, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Díaz-Olmos, Yirys (Health Sciences Division, Medicine Program, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Santamaría-Torres, Mary (Metabolomics Core Facility-MetCore, Vice-Presidency for Research, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia); Cala, Mónica P.

Currently, there are few reports on this type of tumor. We describe the case of a 58-year-old man who had been receiving peritoneal dialysis for more than nine years due to chronic renal insufficiency and uremia. One year after undergoing left renal clear cell renal cell carcinoma resection, a space-occupying lesion was found in the right kidney for which he underwent right nephrectomy. The histopathology of this tumor showed solid or tubular cell arrangements, with some areas of cyst formation. Vacuoles of varying sizes were present in the cytoplasm, and varying amounts of calcium oxalate crystals were found in the tumor cells or interstitium. The pathological diagnosis was ACD-RCC. Next-generation sequencing detected mutations in the PTCH1, MTOR, FAT1, SOS1, RECQL4, and CDC73 genes in the right renal tumor. This is a rare case of a patient with ACD-RCC in the right kidney and clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney. The findings suggest that mutations in PTCH1 associated with ACD-RCC may have acted as oncogenic drivers for the development of ACKD-RCC, together with providing insight into mechanisms underlying ACD-RCC development, as well as diagnostic and treatment options.",The authors would like to express their deepest appreciation to all the parties who have contributed in managing the patient and completing the case report.,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

These changes often pose health risks for older adults. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there is an association between anthropometric indices and muscular, motor, and cardiorespiratory components of health-related fitness in active European older adults. This study included 2687 European older adults, comprising 1999 women and 688 men, with an average age of 70.05 ± 5.5 years. The assessment included health-related fitness using the Senior Fitness Test and anthropometric indices, such as the body adiposity index, body mass index, conicity index, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, among others. The results indicated that gender significantly influences the values of physical performance and anthropometric parameters, making them incomparable. The degree of correlation between anthropometric indices and muscular, motor, and cardiorespiratory components of fitness depends on each anthropometric index analysed. The anthropometric index most correlated with physical fitness performance parameters is the waist-to-height ratio (WHR), followed by the body mass index (BMI). Cardiorespiratory endurance and balance are the two physical parameters most correlated with anthropometric indices.","We want to express our gratitude for the selfless participation of the older adult residents of Sanxenxo, Nova Gorica, Cesena, Vilanova de Cerveira, Budapest, and Aksakovo who have taken part in the In Common Sport+ project.","This research was supported by IN COMMON SPORTS +: fit, food and fun for elderly!

To accurately and precisely evaluate the efficacy of adding sorbitol-type nucleating agents to these articles, their quantitative determination is essential. This study systematically investigated the quantification of sorbitol-type nucleating agents in food packaging made from impact copolymers of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) using attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) together with analysis of principal components (PCA) and machine learning algorithms. The absorption spectra revealed characteristic bands corresponding to the C-O-C bond and hydroxyl groups attached to the cyclohexane ring of the molecular structure of sorbitol, providing crucial information for identifying and quantifying sorbitol derivatives. PCA analysis showed that with the selected FTIR spectrum range and only the first two components, 99.5% of the variance could be explained. The resulting score plot showed a clear pattern distinguishing different concentrations of the nucleating agent, affirming the predictability of concentrations based on an impact copolymer. The study then employed machine learning algorithms (NN, SVR) to establish prediction models, evaluating their quality using metrics such as RMSE, R2, and RMSECV. Hyperparameter optimization was performed, and SVR showed superior performance, achieving near-perfect predictions (R2 = 0.9999) with an RMSE of 0.100 for both calibration and prediction. The chosen SVR model features two hidden layers with 15 neurons each and uses the Adam algorithm, balanced precision, and computational efficiency. The innovative ATR-FTIR coupled SVR model presented a novel and rapid approach to accurately quantify sorbitol-type nucleating agents in polymer production processes for polymer research and in the analysis of nucleating agent derivatives. The analytical performance of this method surpassed traditional methods (PCR, NN).",,This research received no external funding.,Foods,,,,2024-04-15,2024,2024-04-15,,13,8,1200,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Martinez-Trespalacios, Jose; Marquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia; Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Turbaco 130001, Colombia;, jmartinezt@utb.edu.co); Martinez-Trespalacios, Jose (Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Turbaco 130001, Colombia;, jmartinezt@utb.edu.co; Facultad de Arquitectura e Ingeniería, Institución Universitaria Mayor de Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia); Marquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; University of the Coast; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; University of the Coast; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar); Martinez-Trespalacios, Jose (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; Facultad de Arquitectura e Ingeniería, Institución Universitaria Mayor de Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/8/1200/pdf?version=1713175251,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170743617,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",

This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of GATA3/FOXA1 co-expression in UTUC patients.
Methods: We collected 108 UTUC pathological tissue samples with complete follow-up data and 24 normal control urothelial tissues. We created a 132-site microarray and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure GATA3 and FOXA1 expression levels. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were conducted to assess UTUC prognosis.
Results: GATA3 expression was positively correlated with FOXA1 (P=0.031). Absence of GATA3/FOXA1 co-expression (GATA3-/FOXA1-) was associated with tumor extensive necrosis (P=0.001) after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. GATA3-/FOXA1- was associated with shorter Disease-Free Survival (DFS) (P=0.001) and Cancer-Specific Survival (CSS) (P<0.001) than other combination groups. Multivariate analyses identified extensive necrosis as an independent prognostic factor for CSS (P=0.030).
Conclusions: Our study revealed a positive correlation between GATA3 and FOXA1 expression in UTUC. GATA3-/FOXA1- is linked to tumor extensive necrosis and poor prognosis in UTUC and may serve as a potential biomarker for UTUC patients.",The paraffin-embedded tissues of UTUC used in this study were provided by Peking University Shougang Hospital.,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2024-02-15,2024,2024-02-15,,14,,1302864,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Yue; Wang, Yunfan; He, Huiying; Xiong, Yan","Wang, Yue (Department of Pathology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China); Wang, Yunfan (Department of Pathology, Peking University Shougang Hospital, Beijing, China); He, Huiying (Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Third Hospital, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China); Xiong, Yan (Department of Pathology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China)","Xiong, Yan (Peking University First Hospital)","Wang, Yue (Peking University First Hospital); Wang, Yunfan (Peking University Shougang Hospital); He, Huiying (Peking University; Peking University Third Hospital); Xiong, Yan (Peking University First Hospital)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1302864/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168877759,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

METHODS: Using computational tools, a molecule containing multiple ""T"" epitopes of allergens derived from A. lumbricoides and APD was designed ""in silico"" This multi-epitope protein (MP1) was expressed using an E. coli system and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose. Anti-MP1 and anti-HDM extract IgE reactivity was evaluated by Dot-Blot and indirect ELISA from sera of HDM-allergic patients and non-allergic individuals from Barranquilla-Colombia. Allergic individuals had a positive skin test to a standardized battery of inhaled allergens (EUROLINE - Ref: DP 3704-1601-1 E) and mite- specific IgE.
RESULTS: Multi-epitope (MP1) protein was expressed and purified with high purity. Dot-Blot result showed that all sera from allergic patients showed lower IgE reactivity to MP1 compared to HDM extract. By ELISA, significantly lower concentrations of anti-MP1 IgE (Median: 270.86 ng/ml; IQR: 90.3) were observed in contrast to anti-HDM IgE levels (Median: 988.5 ng/ml; IQR: 1117.6) in sera of patients allergic to HDM.
CONCLUSIONS: A protein composed of multiple epitopes of A. lumbricoides and HDM allergens was designed, expressed, and purified. Preliminary Dot-Blot results suggest that this molecule shows hypoallergenic properties with very low IgE reactivity compared to mite extract.

METHODS: In silico analysis included tropomyosin from mites (Der p 10, Der f 10, Blo t 10), insects (Aed a 10, Per a 7, Bla g 7), shrimp (Lit v 1, Pen m 1, Pen a 1), and nematode (Asc l 3) all sequences were taken from the UniProt database. Linear IgE epitopes were predicted with AlgPred 2.0 and validated with BepiPred 3.0. MHC-II binding T cell epitopes were predicted using the IEDB server, which implements nine predictive methods (consensus method, combinatorial library, NN-align-2.3, NN- align-2.2, SMM-align, Sturniolo, NetMHCIIpan 3.1, and NetMHCIIpan 3.2) these predictions focused on 10 HLA-DR and 2 HLA-DQ alleles associated with allergic diseases. Subsequently, consensus B and T epitopes present in all species were identified.
RESULTS: We identified 12 sequences that behaved as IgE-epitopes and B-cell epitopes, three of them: 160RKYDEVARKLAMVEA174, 192ELEEELRVVGNNLKSLEVSEEKAN215, 251KEVDRLEDELV261 were consensus in all species. Eleven peptides (T-epitopes) showed strong binding (percentile rank ≤ 2.0) to HLA-DRB1*0301, *0402, *0411, *0701, *1101, *1401, HLA-DQA1*03:01/DQB1*03:02, and HLA- DQA1*05:01/DQB1*02:01.

Despite the level of technological maturity of the process, the dynamic variation of the process as a result of changes in both the properties of the gasifying agent and biomass has not been analysed in sufficient depth. Therefore, the present study characterizes the process dynamically as a function of step-type changes in rice husk biomass moisture content and gasifying airflow. To identify stability conditions and the range for inducing disturbances, steady-state tests were carried out using a 32-factorial design. The experimental results demonstrate that within the tested range of airflow, the gasification process operates in the oxygen-limited zone. Despite increasing the airflow from 20 to 40 standard liters per minute (SLPM) and driving the reaction towards the combustion zone, the high temperatures achieved resulted in the gas reaching a peak Lower Heating Value (LHV) of 2.6 MJ/Nm3 and a gas power of 2.6 kW, with a Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) of 62%. In contrast, the effect of biomass moisture content was negligible due to the thermal inertia of the reactor and the natural variation of the process. Dynamic evaluation revealed that the oxidation temperature and gas concentration were the variables that took the longest to return to stability after air disturbances. It took approximately 1200 s for the hydrogen (H2) concentration to stabilize, while the gas power required about 300 s. No clear results were observed regarding the impact of the dynamic disturbance in moisture content, which varied between 12.3% w.t and 21.5% w.t.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We aimed to assess the proportion of patients with HFpEF that are eligible for empagliflozin therapy within the Colombian Heart Failure Registry (RECOLFACA).
Methods: RECOLFACA enrolled adult patients with a HF diagnosis during 2017-2019 from 60 medical centers in Colombia. Criteria of the EMPEROR-Preserved Trial were used to recruit participants. The main outcome was individual eligibility with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) criteria, while the secondary outcome was eligibility without NT-proBNP data.
Results: RECOLFACA had 799 patients with HFpEF (mean age70.7 ± 13.5; 50.7 % males). According to the major selection criteria of the EMPEROR Preserved Trial, 73.7 % patients would be eligible for empagliflozin therapy initiation when considering the NT-proBNP threshold. The NT-proBNP threshold represented the main determinant of ineligibility in patients with this biomarker measure (13.6 %; n = 16). In patients without NT-proBNP data, the main reasons for exclusion were the diagnosis of symptomatic hypotension or a systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg (7.5 %), having an eGFR < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 (4.3 %), and haemoglobin < 9 g/dl (3.1 %). Excluding NT-proBNP criteria increased empagliflozin eligibility to 80.6 %.
Conclusion: Most patients with HFpEF from RECOLFACA are potential candidates for empagliflozin therapy initiation according to the EMPEROR-Preserved trial criteria. These findings favor the utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitor medications in daily medical practice, which may further decrease morbidity and mortality in HF patients, regardless of their EF classification.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,Funding sources,IJC Heart & Vasculature,,,,2024-06-22,2024,2024-06-22,2024-08,53,,101448,All OA;

In the United States, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are particularly susceptible to these viruses and are a frequent blood meal host for various species of Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) that transmit orbiviruses. The species of Culicoides that transmit EHDV and BTV vary between regions, and larval habitats can differ widely between vector species. Understanding how midges are distributed across landscapes can inform HD virus transmission risk on a local scale, allowing for improved animal management plans to avoid suspected high-risk areas or target these areas for insecticide control. (2) Methods: We used occupancy modeling to estimate the abundance of gravid (egg-laden) and parous (most likely to transmit the virus) females of two putative vector species, C. stellifer and C. venustus, and one species, C. haematopotus, that was not considered a putative vector. We developed a universal model to determine habitat preferences, then mapped a predicted weekly midge abundance during the HD transmission seasons in 2015 (July-October) and 2016 (May-October) in Florida. (3) Results: We found differences in habitat preferences and spatial distribution between the parous and gravid states for C. haematopotus and C. stellifer. Gravid midges preferred areas close to water on the border of well and poorly drained soil. They also preferred mixed bottomland hardwood habitats, whereas parous midges appeared less selective of habitat. (4) Conclusions: If C. stellifer is confirmed as an EHDV vector in this region, the distinct spatial and abundance patterns between species and physiological states suggest that the HD risk is non-random across the study area.","The owner of the private deer ranch in this study, D.

Background: Compassion has been recognized as a fundamental dimension of quality healthcare.
Methods: Several scientific databases were consulted for relevant records published up to December 16th, 2021. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, 64 studies were included.
Results and conclusions: while existing instruments, validated in Spanish, allow for the measurement of self-compassion or compassion to others, there are no valid and reliable measures currently available in Spanish to measure patient-reported compassion.
Relevance to clinical practice: In order to ensure and promote compassion in the health care context, it is essential to have a valid and reliable tool to measure this construct in a patient-informed way, and this is currently not possible in the Spanish-speaking context because of the lack of such an instrument in Spanish.",,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Chevalier., 1984), y su asociación con el síndrome látexfruta para la búsqueda de alérgenos potenciales","OBJECTIVE: Determine the electrophoretic profiles of the extracts of Manihot esculenta, Actinidia Deliciosa and Persea Americana and their possible relationship with Latex-Fruit Syndrome.
METHODS: Protein extracts of M. esculenta, P. Americana and A. Deliciosa were prepared through the processes of maceration and solvent extraction from plant samples. In the case of the avocado, a prior extraction by soxhlet was carried out to eliminate the fat. The extracts were vacuum filtered, dialyzed and finally lyophilized. Separation of proteins based on molecular weight was performed by SDS PAGE electrophoresis. The electrophoretic profiles obtained were compared with the allergenic proteins previously identified in the latex extract, in order to determine a possible relationship with Latex-Fruit Syndrome, depending on the molecular weight.
RESULTS: The extracts of M. esculenta and P. Americana showed a wide range of protein fractions with molecular weights varying from 10 to 250 KD, finding that the region with the highest concentration of bands was between 20 and 89 KD, (60 and 65%), respectively. A 20-band profile was obtained for the M. esculenta extract (Figure 1), with seven bands sharing similar weights with the latex allergens (Hev b 1, Hev b 2, Hev b3, Hev b 4, Hev b 5, Hev b 6.03, Hev b 8 and Hev b 10) (3-5). For the P. Americana extract, 20 bands were also observed (Figure 2), seven of which presented approximate weights to the Latex allergens (Hev b 1, Hev b 2 Hev b 4 Hev b 6.01 Hev b 6.03 Hev b 8 , Hev b 10 Hev b 11 Hev b 14). The Kiwi extract showed two bands of 19.1 and 22.9 KD, with weights close to latex proteins (figure 3), (Hev b 3 and Hev b 6.01), and allergens (Act d 2 and Act d 6), reported in the literature for this fruit.
CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the relationship between the separated protein fractions and the latex allergens described in the literature, a possible association of 35% was found for the extracts of M. esculenta and P. Americana, and 10% for A. Delicious, with great relevance being the association found with the allergens Hev b 4, Hev b 2, Hev 8 and Hev b 11, which are involved in Latex-Fruit Syndrome. The electrophoretic profiles of the prepared extracts were determined and compared with the Latex allergens.

In this context, using sol-gel and ionotropic gelation methods, zinc oxide nanoparticles (NPs-ZnO) and chitosan nanoparticles (NPs-CS) were synthesized with sizes of 20.0 nm and 11.98 nm, respectively. These nanoparticles were incorporated into chitosan scaffolds through the freeze-drying method, generating a porous morphology with small (<100 μm), medium (100-200 μm), and large (200-450 μm) pore sizes. Moreover, the four formulations showed preliminary bioactivity after hydrolytic degradation, facilitating the formation of a hydroxyapatite (HA) layer on the scaffold surface, as evidenced by the presence of Ca (4%) and P (5.1%) during hydrolytic degradation. The scaffolds exhibited average antibacterial activity of F1 = 92.93%, F2 = 99.90%, F3 = 74.10%, and F4 = 88.72% against four bacterial strains: K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. enterica, and S. aureus. In vivo, evaluation confirmed the biocompatibility of the functionalized scaffolds, where F2 showed accelerated resorption attributed to the NPs-ZnO. At the same time, F3 exhibited controlled degradation with NPs-CS acting as initiation points for degradation. On the other hand, F4 combined NPs-CS and NPs-ZnO, resulting in progressive degradation, reduced inflammation, and an organized extracellular matrix. All the results presented expand the boundaries in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine by highlighting the crucial role of nanoparticles in optimizing scaffold properties.",The authors want to acknowledge Fondecyt Regular under Regular Project 1220093.,,RSC Advances,,,,2024-04-22,2024,2024,2024-04-22,14,19,13565-13582,All OA; Gold,Article,"Angarita, Jorge Eliecer Viloria; Insuasty, Daniel; M., Juan David Rodríguez; Castro, Jorge Iván; Valencia-Llano, Carlos Humberto; Zapata, Paula A.; Delgado-Ospina, Johannes; Navia-Porras, Diana Paola; Albis, Alberto; Grande-Tovar, Carlos David","Angarita, Jorge Eliecer Viloria (Grupo de Investigación de Fotoquímica y Fotobiología, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia 081008, Colombia, carlosgrande@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, +57-5-3599-484); Insuasty, Daniel (Departamento de Química y Biología, División de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); M., Juan David Rodríguez (Programa de Medicina, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Libre, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Castro, Jorge Iván (Tribology, Polymers, Powder Metallurgy and Solid Waste Transformations Research Group, Universidad del Valle, Calle 13 No. 100-00, Cali 76001, Colombia, Jorge.castro@correounivalle.edu.co); Valencia-Llano, Carlos Humberto (Grupo Biomateriales Dentales, Escuela de Odontología, Universidad del Valle, Calle 4B # 36-00, Cali 76001, Colombia); Zapata, Paula A.

METHODS: We designed and expressed a synthetic multi-epítope protein named MP1 from A. lumbricoides and house dust mites allergens. By indirect ELISA, we evaluated IgE-reactivity to MP1 and to the whole-body extract of Ascaris lumbricoides in 45 sera from Colombian Caribbean patients with lupus nephritis (LN; n=25), type 1 diabetes (T1D; n=10) and Juvenil idiopathic arthritis (JIA; n=10). Individuals with poly autoimmunity were excluded. All patients were referred to the study by their specialist doctor.
RESULTS: IgE to whole-body extract of A. lumbricoides showed the following median concentrations.
484.2 ng/ml (IQR: 203.4) in JIA patients, 325.6 ng/ml (IQR: 179.3) in individuals with LN, and 424.7 ng/ml (IQR: 80.1) in the T1D group. On the other hand, IgE-reactivity to MP1 was 126.4 ng/ml (IQR: 90.9) in JIA patients, 130.7 ng/ml (IQR: 94.8) in an individual with LN, and 148.8 ng/ml (IQR: 102.1) in the T1D group. Although no statistical differences were observed between patient groups, the IgE to MP1 in all patients (n: 45) (IgE median: 134.2 ng/ml; IQR: 100) were significantly less compared to Ascaris extract (IgE median: 380.7 ng/ml; IQR: 175.8); (W: 0.732; p-value: 1.034x10-7).

4973,pub.1169325319,10.35366/114660,38657146,,National competitive bidding analysis of osteosynthesis materials in pediatric patients with femur fractures.,"INTRODUCTION: health promotion policy requires the identification of barriers to the adoption of public policies. Paraguay's national healthcare system is inequitable, expensive, and inefficient. The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPyBS) is the entity responsible for covering the needs of a significant portion of the population. In January 2022, the MSPyBS financed the purchase of titanium elastic nails through a National Public Tender for Osteosynthesis Materials (LPN 02/22) to provide them for free in the pediatric service. Using research as a tool, we seek to analyze the impact of the implementation of LPN 02/22 at the Trauma Hospital, believing that this action would help streamline administrative and bureaucratic processes, making them more efficient with the assistance of the hospital's human resources.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: a retrospective, analytical, and comparative study conducted at a high-complexity trauma center in Asunción, Paraguay. Patients aged 4 to 14 years with an indication for stabilization with elastic nails were included. Demographic data, the mechanism of injury, time elapsed from hospital arrival to surgical treatment, length of hospital stay, and the average hospital cost were analyzed based on the daily expense of pediatric patient hospitalization.
RESULTS: 52 patients, divided into 25 cases in 2021 before implementation and 27 cases after implementation. The time elapsed from hospital arrival to definitive treatment was six days in the pre-implementation period, with an average stay from admission to discharge of 7.4 days. After implementation, the time from hospital arrival to definitive treatment was 4.3 days, and the average discharge time for the Post group was six days. The potential savings per patient amount to 332 dollars, offset by the institution's implant supply cost of 197 dollars, resulting in an approximate savings of 135 dollars per patient for the ministry.
CONCLUSIONS: we view the implementation of free titanium elastic nails for pediatric femur fracture patients positively. We encourage the institution to continue with similar policies and strive to achieve even greater benefits for users.",,,Acta Ortopédica Mexicana,,,"Humans; Child; Retrospective Studies; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Female; Male; Femoral Fractures; Paraguay; Length of Stay; Bone Nails; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Hospital Costs; Trauma Centers; Titanium",2024,2024,,2024,38,1,10-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Navarro-Vergara, A D; Portillo-Candia, A S; Sánchez-Silva, C L; Arréllaga-Alonso, R A; Portillo-Vanni, A A","Navarro-Vergara, A D (Hospital de Trauma «Manuel Giagni».

Understanding the population dynamics of the vectors, like Pintomyia longiflocosa, and its relationship with ecological variables is crucial for developing effective strategies to control sand fly populations and combat cutaneous leishmaniasis in a tropical country like Colombia.
METHODOLOGY: Adult sand flies were collected in three different sample locations: outdoor, indoor, and peri-domestic areas in three houses located in the rural settlement of Campoalegre (Huila) between February 2020 and February 2021, using the CDC light traps. The sand fly density was quantified and associated with the sample locations and the sampling months using Analysis of Variance and Pearson correlations.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the period of the sample, 98.86% of sand fly collected was identified as Pi. longiflocosa. The density of this species was significantly different between males and females, the latter contributing more to density in all sample locations (P<0.0001). The outdoor was the sample location with the highest and most significative density in this study (70%, P = 0.04). The density of these sand flies is related to the seasonality of Campoalegre, revealing a density peak from February and June to October (P < 0.05). Finally, precipitation is the environmental variable prominently linked to the density pattern, showing a negative correlation with it. Months with the highest precipitations show the lowest values of Pi. longiflocosa abundance.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNICANCE: Our investigation reveals a inverse correlation between precipitation levels and the abundance of Pi. longiflocosa in Campoalegre (Huila), particularly in outdoor areas. This suggests that vector control strategies to periods of reduced precipitation in outdoor settings could offer an effective approach to minimizing cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the region.","We would like to thank the Campoalegre community that helped us with the collection and fieldwork. We want to thank Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) for contributing not only to the logistic in the field but also to the collection and identification of sand flies.

Methods: Correlational-explanatory design, with a sample of 253 elderly, collecting data through a simple random sampling. A personal data questionnaire was applied, the scale of: self-transcendence, the self-distancing subscale, the family APGAR and the ability to self-care in Mexican population from different demographic groups. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied (Mann-Whitney U and a structural equation model) and the study was approved by a registered ethics committee.
Results: The study had participation from 253 elderly, with a mean age of 68.02 years, with prevalence of the female sex (60.1%); the level of education was primary school or lower (51.4%). It was observed that the group of chronic diseases had lower self-distancing (U = 4.449.5, p = 0.038) and greater self-transcendence (U = 4177.0, p = 0.008), and selfcare (U = 4365.5, p = 0.024) than the group without chronic diseases. It was also found that self-transcendence, self-distancing, and family functionality produce a positive effect of 37% on selfcare.
Conclusion: Self-distancing, self-transcendence, and family functionality explain an important proportion of selfcare in the elderly.

Any disturbance in this complex system poses significant risks to individuals, affecting their quality of life and even their survival.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to explore congenital insensitivity to pain, an extremely rare genetic disorder with an autosomal recessive pattern that results in the inability to perceive pain. We will focus on the well-known subtype, congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). Our research seeks to update existing knowledge through a comprehensive literature review.
METHODOLOGY: The review employs a systematic literature review, analyzing various sources and scientific documents, primarily emphasizing CIPA. The review follows the PROSPERO protocol, registered under CRD42023394489. The literature search was performed on the Scopus, PubMed, and Cinahl databases.
RESULTS: Our review reveals secondary complications associated with CIPA, such as recurrent bone fractures, temperature insensitivity, self-mutilation, and, occasionally, intellectual disabilities. The limited available information underscores the need for expanding our knowledge.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, CIPA, particularly, presents a significant medical challenge with adverse impacts on quality of life. Early diagnosis, education for families and healthcare professionals, and appropriate nursing care are essential for effective management. This review highlights the necessity of further research and awareness to enhance support for those affected.","We are grateful to the Official College of Nursing of Granada (CODEGRA) for their help in the research support program, and to the Chair of Research in Nursing Care of the University of Granada and the Official College of Nursing of Granada.",This research received no external funding.,Journal of Personalized Medicine,,Kenneth P.H.

Despite growing research, translating findings into effective policies needs to be improved. We explored the factors that make research on health education and health literacy to be referenced and mentioned in policy documents in LAC (and in Peru). We proposed a model based on the hypothesis that the relationship between research and policymaking depends on the research strength of scientific evidence, timing, and social media activity.
Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Quantitative data sources included multidisciplinary databases, altmetric data, and citations of policy documents. For data analysis, we obtained descriptive statistics to identify patterns and then verified the association between variables using χ2. The negative binomial regression was used to test the empirical model introduced above. Quantitative analysis was complemented by analysis of responses to a set of open questions from a sample of Peruvian health policymakers.
Results: We found that timing, strength of evidence, and social media activity were significant predictors of research cited in policy documents. Policy documents tended to rely more on qualitative evidence. A positive correlation between timing and cites in policy documents highlighted the importance of timely dissemination, whereas social media activity, while having an impact, had a relatively minor effect. Peruvian policymakers' responses emphasized the role of political context, the relevance of results, and policymakers' commitment to incorporating research into policies.
Conclusion: Strength of evidence, social media engagement, and publication timing are key predictors of citations for health education/literacy research in LAC policy documents. However, qualitative findings highlight challenges, including some distrust in research findings, together with limited access to relevant research. The findings offer opportunities to enhance evidence-informed health education/health literacy policy decisions.
Implications: To increase the influence on health policymakers, researchers should prioritize the timely dissemination of solid evidence, considering both traditional and digital platforms. Policymakers should focus on the quality and relevance of evidence when formulating policies.","This study is part of the research project Literacy under Covid-19 in Viñani/Alfabetización en Salud en Viñani (ALSAVI) in Tacna-Peru (https://alsavi.org/ and https://www.mmu.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/story/?id=15815) (accessed 15 February 2024).

Prior studies using electromyography (EMG) to examine orofacial muscle activity in stuttering have presented mixed results, highlighting the variability in neuromuscular responses during stuttering episodes. Fifty-five participants with stuttering and 30 individuals without stuttering, aged between 18 and 40, participated in the study. EMG signals from five facial and cervical muscles were recorded during speech tasks and analyzed for mean amplitude and frequency activity in the 5-15 Hz range to identify significant differences. Upon analysis of the 5-15 Hz frequency range, a higher average amplitude was observed in the zygomaticus major muscle for participants while stuttering (p < 0.05). Additionally, when assessing the overall EMG signal amplitude, a higher average amplitude was observed in samples obtained from disfluencies in participants who did not stutter, particularly in the depressor anguli oris muscle (p < 0.05). Significant differences in muscle activity were observed between the two groups, particularly in the depressor anguli oris and zygomaticus major muscles. These results suggest that the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms of stuttering might involve subtle aspects of timing and coordination in muscle activation. Therefore, these findings may contribute to the field of biosensors by providing valuable perspectives on neuromuscular mechanisms and the relevance of electromyography in stuttering research. Further research in this area has the potential to advance the development of biosensor technology for language-related applications and therapeutic interventions in stuttering.",The authors We would like to thank Gloria Paucar for her invaluable support in conducting trials with participants.,"This research, funded by Fondo de Apoyo a la Investigación of Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (FAI 2021) with grant number FAI-0042-2021 DFI-PUCP, received approval from Comité de ética de la investigación para ciencias de la vida y tecnologías on 15 July 2022, with approval number N° 004-2022-CEICVyTech/PUCP.

This study aimed at evaluating their simultaneous association while controlling for key confounding variables.MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried-out with 2918 secondary school students from seven charter schools located in low-resourced neighborhoods in Bogota (Colombia), 54.12% were female, and mean age was 13.81 years. The self-report instrument included demographic variables, well-being, mental health, risk behaviors and symptoms of psychopathology. Assessment of ACEs was done by a series of yes/no questions, prosocial behavior was evaluated with the corresponding subscale in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and depression was assessed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Associations were tested using the Spearman correlation coefficient, Z tests and Chi-square tests, and all primary outcome analyses were adjusted for potential confounding variables through multivariate logistic regression using depression as outcome.ResultsMean exposure to ACEs was 3.15 events; those exposed to four or more obtained lower scores in well-being, satisfaction with life and family functioning, and higher scores in symptoms of psychopathology. For the prosocial behavior scores, 64.35% were classified as close to the average, 17.51% as slightly lowered, 11.91% as low, and 6.23% as very low; participants with higher levels of prosocial behavior showed lower scores in symptoms of psychopathology. While ACEs had a positive association with depressive symptoms (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67–2.94), prosocial behavior did not have a significant association with either ACEs or depressive symptoms in multivariate regression models.ConclusionsNovel studies should further elucidate the developmental pathways involving positive and negative mental health constructs to better understand the actual effectiveness of interventions that use these constructs in their design.","We are grateful to the schools, their personnel, students and families for allowing us to conduct this study with success.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,,,,2024-07-08,2024,2024-07-08,,18,1,81,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cardozo Alarcón, Andrés Camilo; Moreno Arenas, Nathaly; Verjel Ávila, Kharen Alessandra; Trujillo Maza, Elena María; Greniez Rodríguez, Charlotte; Vargas Riaño, Olga Lucía; Suárez Acevedo, Daniel Enrique","Cardozo Alarcón, Andrés Camilo (Universidad de los Andes, Ak. 7 #116-5, Bogotá, Colombia); Moreno Arenas, Nathaly (Universidad de los Andes, Ak. 7 #116-5, Bogotá, Colombia); Verjel Ávila, Kharen Alessandra (Universidad de los Andes, Ak. 7 #116-5, Bogotá, Colombia); Trujillo Maza, Elena María (Universidad de los Andes, Ak. 7 #116-5, Bogotá, Colombia); Greniez Rodríguez, Charlotte (Universidad de los Andes, Ak. 7 #116-5, Bogotá, Colombia); Vargas Riaño, Olga Lucía (Alianza Educativa.

Methods: Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitakagwa decomposition model, correcting the sample selection bias with the inclusion of Mills' inverse ratio (Heckman's Lambda) through an ordered probit model. Data: Information available in the ScienTI Platform - Colombia during the period 2015-2021.
Results: The results show that the gender gap between female and male researchers is 5.8%. To achieve Emeritus status, one must be over 65 years old, and the possibility of achieving Emeritus status is 5.1% higher for female researchers than for their male counterparts. These differences can be explained by the time constraints that female researchers face in being productive, as they spend more time than male researchers on caregiving responsibilities, either due to motherhood or the care of other dependent family members.
Conclusions: The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a gender gap in scientific research in Colombia in the Emeritus research category in the calls for proposals for the period 2015-2021. Moreover, the existing gap cannot be explained by factors associated with attributes of education and academic productivity that are part of the regulatory requirements, insofar as not being explained by them, it evidences the existence of discrimination against women researchers to access the highest research category.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Colombia; Female; Humans; Male; Research Personnel; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Sex Factors,2024-06-06,2024,2024-06-06,,13,,588,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera-Lozada, Isabel Cristina; Gómez-Sánchez, Andrés Mauricio; Rivera-Lozada, Oriana","Rivera-Lozada, Isabel Cristina (Departamento de Economía, Universidad del Cauca, Popayán, Cauca, Colombia); Gómez-Sánchez, Andrés Mauricio (Departamento de Economía, Universidad del Cauca, Popayán, Cauca, Colombia); Rivera-Lozada, Oriana (Facultad de educación, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru)","Rivera-Lozada, Isabel Cristina (University of Cauca); Rivera-Lozada, Oriana (National University of San Marcos)","Rivera-Lozada, Isabel Cristina (University of Cauca); Gómez-Sánchez, Andrés Mauricio (University of Cauca); Rivera-Lozada, Oriana (National University of San Marcos)",0,0,,,https://f1000research.com/articles/13-588/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172616459,42 Health Sciences; 44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,5 Gender Equality

Nevertheless, there has been limited exploration into whether the digital inclusion conditions for remote education could mediate the effects that variables such as resilience, social support, and academic self-efficacy may have on mental health. Considering the above, there is evidence that shows a consistent relationship between resilience, social support and academic self-efficacy on mental health, to the extent that these are psychological variables. On the other hand, digital inclusion, which comprehends a contextual variable, not a psychological one, related to ICT access opportunities and mainly focused on the quality of Internet access, should be analyzed in a differential manner.
Objectives: This study seeks to analyze the effect of resilience, social support and academic self-efficacy, on the mental health of a group of Peruvian university students; in addition, it seeks to analyze the mediating role of digital inclusion.
Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 3,147 undergraduate students from a private university in Lima, Perú. From August to October 2020, data were collected online through questionnaire, this include The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), The 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10), The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (EMASP), The Perceived Self-Efficacy Specific for Academic Situations Scale (EAPESA) and to measure digital inclusion, the Perceived Quality of Internet Access reported by the students. The levels of participants' anxiety, depression and stress were described using frequency and percentage. Pearson Correlation test was used to measure the correlation between the variables and a Path analysis was conducted. Finally, The PROCESS macro for SPSS (Model 4) was applied to examine the mediating effect of the model controlling gender variable.
Results: The results revealed significant levels of extremely severe symptoms of anxiety (36.8%), depression (33.4%) and stress (18.1%) among the participants. A path analysis, which indicated that resilience (β = -0.346), social support (β = -0.189), academic self-efficacy (β = -0.060) and digital inclusion (β = -0.089) had significant impact on students' General Distress. In addition, digital inclusion plays a partial mediation role with low but significant effect size in the relationship between resilience, social support and self-efficacy with mental health.
Conclusion: Mental health of university students during the pandemic shows alarming levels of general or emotional distress. The findings indicate that resilience, social support and self-efficacy protect college students' mental health by reducing general distress. However, the study shows that when there is a digital divide around internet quality the impact of these factors is affected.",We thank all the participants for their contribution to this study.,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Methods: Using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS Analysis for Identification of Active Compounds in KBN Lotion; FICI for synergy evaluation, XTT and ROS assays for biofilm viability and oxidative stress, fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for structural and viability analysis, and real-time fluorescence for gene expression.
Conclusion: Our study indicates that the combined application of KBN and MN somewhat impacts the structural integrity of Candida albicans biofilms and affects the expression of several key genes involved in biofilm formation, including ALS1, ALS3, HWP1, HSP90, and CSH1. These preliminary findings suggest that there may be a synergistic effect between KBN and MN, potentially influencing not only the structural aspects of fungal biofilms but also involving the modulation of genetic pathways during their formation.","We thank Yuanying Jiang (the Second Military Medical University, China) for providing clinical drug-resistance C. albicans isolates.","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Yet, understanding empathy trends from medical students to resident doctors within a single institution is limited. This study delves into empathy trends within a single-center academic setting and identifies factors associated with low empathy.MethodsThis cross-sectional study enrolled the second—to sixth-year medical students of Phramongkutklao College of Medicine and the first—to second-year residents at Phramongkutklao Hospital. It utilized a standardized questionnaire covering demographics, family relationships, the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE). The relationship between variables and JSE scores was analyzed using independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, and Chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses examined associated factors and trends across educational levels. A quadratic term was incorporated to evaluate the presence of a nonlinear trend.ResultsA total of 520 participants, comprising 189 (36.4%) preclinical students, 153 (29.4%) clinical students, and 178 (34.2%) residents, completed the survey. The JSE showed a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83. The average empathy score was 103.8 ± 15.0, with 27.1% of low empathy levels. Specialty preference and sex-adjusted average empathy scores decreased from 114.5 (95%CI: 112.0–117.0) among second-year medical students to 95.2 (95%CI: 92.2–98.2) among second-year residents (Pnon−linear<0.001). The adjusted proportion of low empathy is highest among sixth-year medical students (54.4%, 95%CI: 34.4–73.2%). Factors associated with low empathy included those preferring procedure-oriented specialties (AOR: 4.16, 95%CI: 1.54–11.18) and a higher parental income (AOR: 2.97, 95%CI: 1.09 to 8.10). Subgroup analysis revealed that residents with a GPAX above 3.5 and those in technology-oriented specialties were also associated with lower empathy (AOR: 3.46, 95%CI: 1.40–8.59 and AOR: 2.93, 95%CI: 1.05–8.12, respectively).ConclusionA declining empathy trend was observed among medical students, which then plateaued among residents. Additionally, residents in technology-oriented specialties may require empathy enhancements due to their ongoing patient consultations. Addressing these issues requires collaborative planning between students and teachers to foster empathy throughout the medical curriculum.","We express our gratitude to the Phramongkutklao College of Medicine and its esteemed academic leaders, whose active support was vital for completing this work.

The level of undiagnosed hypertension and its associated factors among long-distance bus drivers in Ethiopia is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the magnitude of undiagnosed hypertension and its associated factors among long-distance bus drivers in Addis Ababa bus terminals.
METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 391 long-distance bus drivers from December 15, 2021, to January 15 2022 at five cross-country bus terminals in Addis Ababa. A standardized and structured questionnaire was adapted based on the WHO stepwise approach to a non-communicable disease study and translated into Amharic. Data were coded, cleaned, and entered using Epi-data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 26. Logistic regression analysis was performed. Variables with a P-value < 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were selected for multivariable logistic regression analysis. Independent variables with a P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The magnitude of association between independent and dependent variables was measured by odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: In this study, 391 study participants were involved with a response rate of 97.1%. The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension was 22.5% (CI: 18.7%, 26.6%). Poor level of knowledge (AOR: 2.00, CI: 1.08, 3.70), long duration of driving per day (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.37-4.56), habit of chewing of chat (AOR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.44, 4.73), regular alcohol consumption (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI: 1.70, 7.05), overweight (AOR:3.14, 95%CI: 1.54,6.42) obesity (AOR: 3.21, 95% CI 1.35, 7.61) and regular physical exercise (AOR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.29) were statistically significantly associated with undiagnosed hypertension.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension among long-distance bus drivers was 22.5%, which was associated with modifiable behavioral factors, lack of regular physical exercise, lack of adequate awareness and high body mass index.
RECOMMENDATION: Stakeholders must implement the necessary preventive measures. These include increasing the level of awareness of hypertension among long-distance drivers and developing prevention of hypertension strategies and policies focusing on lifestyle and behavioral modifications.","We thank St. Paul’s Millennium Medical College research office and the School of Nursing for providing an opportunity to prepare a thesis study.

METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. This study target staff nurses working in hospitals in Guanajuato, México. Demographic and working condition data were collected via questionnaire. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to evaluate burnout. A blood sample were collected and processed by ELISA technique to measure sBDNF. Finally, the General Cognitive Assessment (CAB) of the Cognifit© neuropsychological battery was used to evaluated cognitive functions.
RESULTS: Findings showed that there are sociodemographic characteristics and working conditions associated with burnout syndrome among nurses. Furthermore, the data demonstrated a significant decrease in sBDNF levels in burnout nurses and a negative correlation between BDNF levels and burnout syndrome. Additionally, these burnout nurse also revealed significant cognitive impairment in reasoning, memory, and attention as well as total scores of CAB. Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between sBDNF levels and the cognitive deficits in burnout nurse.

Two methods are used: a transversal analytical method in which three instruments were applied to 209 participants to study the relationship between Quality of Life at Work, exposure to psychosocial risks, compassion fatigue and the intention to rotate; other than from the experiences narrated by 10 Human Talent in Health explore organizational practices in critical care.ResultsThe dimension of quality of work life with the greatest dissatisfied was the management of free time (77%), the most compromised psychosocial risk was the pace of work (84%). They have high compassion satisfaction (67%) and there is an intention to migrate to another country (66%). The narrative results in discrimination/harassment as normalized practices and faceless spirituality. The integration of mixed methods shows convergence between the use of the instrument that measures quality of life at work and the narratives of the participants, complementarity with the other instruments, and divergence regarding the intention to rotate to another health institution.ConclusionThe positive trend that converges with the two approaches is that of safety at work and well-being achieved through work, embodied in the constant updating of technology and care protocols, experience time, balance between salary and work effort, staffing and supplies, and disconnection with work.","To the Collegiate Nursing Organization for its support in the data collection process, to the health institutions that participated, and to the HWF who dedicated time to answering the research questions.

AIM: To characterise sickle cell disease (SCD) haematologically, biochemically, and molecularly, and detect classic haplotypes by DNA sequencing in a group of samples from Bolívar, Colombia.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected after informed consent from volunteers from eight communities in the Bolívar department, plus samples from the Pacific region, Providencia Island, and Bogotá were included. Data were obtained from: (1) haematological analyses; (2) biochemical tests: dHPLC was used to determine haemoglobin (Hb); and (3) DNA sequencing data through five SNPs.
RESULTS: 101 samples were identified by rs334 through Sanger's Sequencing, structural haemoglobinopathies HbAS (34.65%), HbSS (2.97%) and HbAC (1.98%) were found. When contrasting the Hb identification results between SNP rs334 Vs. dHPLC/Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), a coincidence was found in 39/43 samples analysed, therefore, when comparing these techniques, a significant correlation was found (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.998). 26 samples previously analysed by rs334 were classified into classical haplotypes CAR (50.0%), BEN (30.76%), CAM (7.69%), SEN (3.84%), and ATP-I (7.69%).
CONCLUSIONS: SCD characterisation and SNPs-based classification through Sanger's DNA sequencing have not been performed before in Colombia. The results of this work will make it possible to expand the data or records of carriers and those affected, which will benefit patients and their families.","We are grateful to MINCIENCIAS, Universidad de La Sabana, Universidad del Sinú, and Pregen, Colombia.","Human Genetics Lab. is located within the Medical Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de La Sabana.

Vector control of Aedes mosquitoes is an important public health strategy to decrease or prevent spread of ABVs. The ongoing Targeted Indoor Residual Spraying (TIRS) trial is an NIH-sponsored clinical trial to study the efficacy of a novel, proactive vector control technique to prevent dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections in the endemic city of Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. The primary outcome of the trial is laboratory-confirmed ABV infections in neighborhood clusters. Despite the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, by early 2021 the TIRS trial completed enrollment of 4,792 children aged 2-15 years in 50 neighborhood clusters which were allocated to control or intervention arms via a covariate-constrained randomization algorithm. Here, we describe the makeup and ABV seroprevalence of participants and mosquito population characteristics in both arms before TIRS administration. Baseline surveys showed similar distribution of age, sex, and socio-economic factors between the arms. Serum samples from 1,399 children were tested by commercially available ELISAs for presence of anti-ABV antibodies. We found that 45.1% of children were seropositive for one or more flaviviruses and 24.0% were seropositive for CHIKV. Of the flavivirus-positive participants, most were positive for ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies by focus reduction neutralization testing which indicated a higher proportion of participants with previous ZIKV than DENV infections within the cohort. Both study arms had statistically similar seroprevalence for all viruses tested, similar socio-demographic compositions, similar levels of Ae. aegypti infestation, and similar observed mosquito susceptibility to insecticides. These findings describe a population with a high rate of previous exposure to ZIKV and lower titers of neutralizing antibodies against DENV serotypes, suggesting susceptibility to future outbreaks of flaviviruses is possible, but proactive vector control may mitigate these risks.","The authors acknowledge Scott Ritchie for his inspiring contribution to the development of the TIRS methodology.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted between October 2023 and May 2024 using the core collection of six generic databases: PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, CINAHL Complete, Scopus, and Web of Science. The PRISMA, TESTEX, RoB 2, and GRADE tools assessed the evidence's methodological quality and certainty. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42024547050).
RESULTS: Of 5916 records, 9 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials involving 477 healthy older people were included. Six meta-analyses were performed showing significant improvements in 30-second chair stand (SMD = 3.03; 95 % CI = 0.14 to 5.93; I2 = 100 %; p = 0.04), sit-and-reach (SMD = 2.09; 95 % CI = 0.15 to 4.03; I2 = 100 %; p = 0.04) and timed up-and-go (SMD = 3.10; 95 % CI = 1.67 to 4.53; I2 = 98 %; p < 0.0001) tests. However, in maximal isometric handgrip strength, back-scratch test, and fat-free mass, no significant improvements (p > 0.05) in favor of EBT were reported.

OBJECTIVES: To assess quality-of-life with 3 different instruments and to evaluate disease severity indices and to determine their correlation and effect size of change between two measurements.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-level data were obtained through two in-person visits. Sociodemographic information and data related to disease distribution, severity (through the BSA, EASI, SCORAD, POEM, and itching scales), and the impact of atopic dermatitis on quality of life using the DLQI and Skindex-29, and EQ-5D, were assessed. The correlation between change in quality-of-life scores and disease severity scores in addition to the standardized effect size were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Only 139 out of 212 patients completed the follow-up visit. BSA highly correlated with SCORAD and EASI, and the lowest correlation was found with POEM. The best correlation of pruritus VAS was found with sleep disturbance. The SCORAD score highly correlated with EASI, and the lowest correlation was found with POEM. The magnitude of the effect at initiation of the study vs follow-up was in average moderate to important.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with atopic dermatitis experience a substantial burden on quality of life. Disease activity correlates better with quality-of-life measurements when the disease is less severe after starting therapy. POEM and Skindex-29 seem to be optimal to determine disease severity and quality of life in adults with atopic dermatitis.",,,Biomédica,,,"Humans; Dermatitis, Atopic; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Adult; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Pruritus; Young Adult",2024-08-29,2024,2024-08-29,,44,3,318-327,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sanclemente, Gloria; Hernández, Natalia; Tamayo, Liliana; Chaparro, Daniela; López, Ángela; Research Group, Colombian Atopic Dermatitis","Sanclemente, Gloria (Grupo de Investigación Dermatológica, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia y Grupo de Innovación y Desarrollo en Investigación - CIC, Medellin, Colombia; Dermatologia, Hospital San Vicente Fundación-IPS Universitaria, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.); Hernández, Natalia (Dermatosoluciones SAS, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia.); Tamayo, Liliana (Seccion de Dermatologia, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellín, Colombia.); Chaparro, Daniela (Seccion de Dermatologia, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia.); López, Ángela (IPS Fototerapia Bojanini y López SAS.

Material and methods: Epidemiological study that collected clinical records of patients during the period of october 2021. Sociodemographic and housing information was collected, as well as personal pathological and non-pathological history and a record of the diagnosis of the periapical lesion based on its clinical characteristics issued by the operator on duty. Through multivariate analysis, a factor associated with acute apical abscess was identified with the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval as estimators of the strength of association with CIETmap statistical software.
Results: The 37% (32/87) of patients were diagnosed with the infection. In terms of gender, females were the most affected with a proportion of 56% (18/32). The most common cause was caries with 72% (23/32). The right upper second premolar was the most affected tooth with 25% (8/32). One associated factor was identified, age 36 to 62 years (ORa=3.54; CI95%a=1.27 -16.62).
Conclusion: The morbidity rate of the infection was moderate, and it is a common pathology in stomatological emergency consultations, so it is important for the professional in charge of the area to manage it clinically. It will be important to implement oral health education strategies aimed at different age groups to raise awareness of the cariogenic process and its consequences.","A la jefa de Estomatología, Dra.

Methods: The absorbed self-dose of the adult male heart and absorbed dose by organs in the biokinetics of the heart when administering Tc-99m are estimated using the MIRD formalism and the Cristy-Eckerman representation, which have been employed to develop the algorithm in Matlab.
Results: The results indicate that electron capture emissions of 1.446 (mGy/MBq) and Auger electrons of 0.062 (mGy/MBq) are entirely directed towards the target organ (heart) and contribute 29.33% and 1.25% respectively to its total dose. Additionally, the dosimetric contributions of biokinetic organs correspond to characteristic radiation emissions and gamma photons at 2.578 (mGy/MBq) for Tc-99m, representing 52.29% of its total dose.

Introduction: Empathy is one of the components of the structure of humanization in patient care. Medical specialists must have high levels of empathy. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the levels of empathy in doctors working in a highly complex hospital and to explore whether there are differences between the specialties studied.
 Methods: A convenience sample of 237 physicians representing 53.55% of the total population (N=443) was accessed. Empathy was measured using the Empathy Scale for Health Professionals (HP). Confirmatory factor analysis and multigroup analysis were performed to examine the invariance of the model between the sexes and reliability analyzes (Cronbach's α, intraclass correlation coefficient and McDonald's ω).
 Results: The specialty of pediatrics had the highest levels in general empathy and in the Compassionate Care and Walking in Patient Shoes subscales, but not in the Perspective Taking subescale where it presents levels similar to the specialties of anesthesiology, critical medicine and intensive care. and gynecology.
 Conclusions: The empathy values and the values in the compassionate care and “Walking in the patient's shoes” subscales were (in absolute values, but not statistically) higher in the Pediatrics specialty. In the subscale Perspective Taking, Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Surgery, and Clinic, practically the same scores were observed. Other studies are required to arrive at an explanation that allows us to understand why some specialties have higher empathy values than others.

In this, it is possible to identify multiple aspects such as the universal protection of human rights, the unification of the sources of law and legal theory and new forms of corporate economic negotiation. In this article, free trade agreements are analyzed as manifestation of this globalization, not only because of its economic aspects, but also because of the non-economic costs involved in the implementation of state policies aimed at the legal protection of human rights. Furthermore, in some cases those treaties do not consider specific social aspects from the countries involved in the agreement. Particularly in the Colombian case, it is worth to analyze the existent tensions between FTA signed with the United States and the political and legal measures imple­mented against rural development in the rice sector.",,,Revista Derecho del Estado,,,,2024-04-29,2024,2024-04-29,,,59,291-324,All OA; Gold,Article,"Insignares Cera, Silvana; Bocanegra Jiménez, María Andrea","Insignares Cera, Silvana (); Bocanegra Jiménez, María Andrea ()",,"Insignares Cera, Silvana (); Bocanegra Jiménez, María Andrea ()",0,0,,,https://revistas.uexternado.edu.co/index.php/derest/article/download/9398/15847,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171199211,44 Human Society; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Depending on compound and tissue properties as well as aggregate size and shape, the penetration behavior can differ vastly. Here, we introduce bioorthogonal Raman microspectroscopy as a contactless technique to investigate the penetration of various compounds into spheroids, organoids, and other tissue models in terms of diffusion coefficients and perfusion times. We showcase the potential of the method by applying it to the radial perfusion of neural stem cell spheroids with the prevalent cryopreservation additive dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing a diffusion model for spherical bodies, the spectroscopic data were quantitatively analyzed. Perfusion times were obtained for spheroids in the sub-mm region, and interesting findings about the spheroid-size dependence of the diffusion coefficient are reported.",Acknowledgments We would like to thank Rachel Steeg for manuscript poofreading and Ronan Le Harzic for assistance and advice at the two-photon microscope.

For this purpose, 742 university students were evaluated in two educational contexts: the online education during the COVID-19 lockdown and the subsequent face-to-face classroom environment. The sample consisted of Colombian university students between 18 and 25 years old, of middle and low socioeconomic level. As to the methodological approach, a pre- and post-test comparison was done first, followed by a cluster analysis which allowed to define four profiles based on participants’ scores on the UWES-S scale (Student Academic Engagement Scale). Multiple comparisons showed significant differences in the levels of vigor, absorption, and among the four engagement profiles: high, medium, in process, and low. The results showed that the group of students with higher scores was composed of participants in both virtual and face-to-face modalities. However, the groups with lower scores were made up of students in the online modality mainly, indicating a pattern where virtual schooling imposed during lockdown was associated with lower motivation for learning.

Our overarching goal was to analyze contemporary perceptions of masculinity and femininity using quantitative and qualitative methods, marking a groundbreaking effort in social science research. The data collection took place between January 2018 and February 2020, and involved undergraduate students who completed a series of randomized scales and the data was collected through the SurveyMonkey or Qualtrics platforms, with paper surveys being used in rare cases. All the measures used in the project were translated into 22 languages. The dataset contains 33,313 observations and 286 variables, including contemporary measures of gendered self-views, attitudes, and stereotypes, as well as relevant demographic data. The TGH dataset, linked with accessible country-level data, provides valuable insights into the dynamics of gender relations worldwide, allowing for multilevel analyses and examination of how gendered self-views and attitudes are linked to behavioral intentions and demographic variables.","The results presented in this paper are part of the larger project titled “Towards Gender Harmony” (www.towardsgenderharmony.ug.edu.pl), which involves many wonderful people.

Optimized reaction conditions provide the desired nitrogen-containing cycloadducts in up to 93% yield and dr 8.6:1 with complete regioselectivity. The substrate scope showed high tolerance to various substituted indoles and cyclopropanes, resulting in the synthesis of six new cyclopenta[b]indoles and the isolation of five derivatives previously reported in the literature. In addition, a mechanistic proposal for the reaction was studied through online reaction monitoring by ESI-MS, allowing for the identification of the reactive intermediates in the Ni(II) catalyzed process. X-ray crystallography confirmed the structure and relative endo stereochemistry of the products. This method enables the fast and efficient construction of fused indolines from readily accessible starting materials.","This work received financial support from the Chilean Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo ANID.

BackgroundThe high demand for care of COVID-19 patients led to increased work pressure on nurses, owing to increased demands for care and shortages of medical supplies and protective equipment.DesignA cross-sectional study was conducted from September to December 2022 using a self-administered questionnaire addressed to nursing professionals who cared for COVID-19 patients.MethodsThe questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics, the Spanish adaptation of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-Spanish), Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) for the evaluation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the Spanish adaptation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS-Spanish) for burnout assessment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.ResultsOf the 782 participants, 88.6% had a high level of burnout (MBI-HSS-Spanish scale score > 27). Female nurses, nurses with eight-hour work shifts, and older professionals exhibited high levels of anxiety and depression. Prolonged working hours in COVID-19 patient care services were found to be a risk factor for burnout and post-traumatic stress.ConclusionsParticipating nurses presented with a high level of chronic work stress and exhibited signs of anxiety and depression during the period under consideration. Providing nurses with psychological support measures and performing liaison consultations will alleviate the psychological burden on nurses.Relevance to clinical practiceThe study has shown that accounting for the environments where the emotional impact is greatest and how to reduce it would not only reduce anxiety, depression, and burnout in nurses but also improve the quality of care, not only in pandemic.Patient or public contributionNurses contributed to the conduct of the study by participating in the data collection via questionaries.",Our thanks to the authorities of the Technical University of the North and the University of the Balearic Islands as well as to the managers of the health lefts and their nurses.,No funding was received for the development of this study.,BMC Nursing,,,,2024-07-03,2024,2024-07-03,,23,1,454,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vaca-Auz, Janet; Revelo-Villarreal, Sonia; Anaya-González, Jorge Luis; Vaca-Orellana, Cristina; Castillo, Rocío; Altamirano-Zavala, Geovanna; Vicens-Blanes, Francisco; Molina-Mula, Jesús","Vaca-Auz, Janet (Universidad Técnica del Norte.

The relevance of this task is connected to the crucial role that writing plays in college as a facilitator for learning that enables students to think and communicate as experts in their disciplines (Ávila Reyes et al., 2021; Navarro et al., 2022; Thompson et al., 2021). To carry out this project, all faculty members were interviewed and asked to share the materials they use to support and assess student writing; this information was later contrasted with the perception of a group of alums that were polled. The results gathered provide an insightful perspective on how writing teaching and learning occur in an undergraduate program. This characterization aims to align with faculty and alums expectations regarding the role of writing within their discipline, shedding light on the complexities of teaching, learning, and applying writing skills in both academic and professional contexts.

The framework comprises four phases: the identification and analysis of current gaps in language learning applications and design of language content; the architectural design of the application, including its pedagogical components selection and revision of taxonomies; the testing and implementation of the application; and finally, the refinement process and formulation of design principles. Traditional language learning apps often rely on visual content, which is challenging for visually impaired users. Eyeland prioritizes auditory and tactile methods, ensuring compatibility with screen readers, high-contrast themes, robust zooming features, and audio descriptions for images to make learning accessible. This research focuses on creating a mobile application to enhance English teaching at the A1 level for high school students in Colombia, addressing challenges such as resource quality, collaborative learning, and inclusion of students. The methodology involves mobile task-based teaching. Visually impaired students showed an overall average score increase from 4.8 to 6.9, while sighted learners experienced a more significant rise from 4.1 to 9. High ratings for accessibility features show an overall satisfaction of 91.67. The study emphasizes the importance of mobile-assisted tasks for inclusive classroom practices and suggests further research on the role of serious games in Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT). Overall, the research contributes insights into designing inclusive technology-enhanced learning tools for EFL education, demonstrating the potential of serious games in providing accessible content and fostering autonomous and collaborative learning for visually impaired students.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2024-08-15,2024,2024-08-15,,PP,99,1-1,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villalba, Karen; Jimeno, Miguel; Robles, Heydy; Vergara, Leonardo; Sinning, Camilo; Lizcano, Leonardo; Hurtado, Breynner; Nieto, Wilson","Villalba, Karen (Language Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Robles, Heydy (Language Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vergara, Leonardo (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sinning, Camilo (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lizcano, Leonardo (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hurtado, Breynner (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Nieto, Wilson (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)",,"Villalba, Karen (Universidad del Norte); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte); Robles, Heydy (Universidad del Norte); Vergara, Leonardo (Universidad del Norte); Sinning, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Lizcano, Leonardo (Universidad del Norte); Hurtado, Breynner (Universidad del Norte); Nieto, Wilson (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2024.3444741,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174810319,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,4 Quality Education

All reported Parp1 null knockout mouse strains are viable with no developmental anomalies. It was believed that functional redundancy with other PARP family members, mainly PARP2, explains such a controversy. However, while PARP2 has similar catalytic domain to PARP1, it lacks other domains, making the absence of developmental problems in Parp1 mice knockouts unlikely. Contrary to prior assumptions, in our analysis of the best-investigated Parp1 knockout mouse strain, we identified persistent mRNA expression, albeit at reduced levels. Transcript analysis revealed an alternatively spliced Parp1 variant lacking exon 2. Subsequent protein analysis confirmed the existence of a truncated PARP1 protein in knockout mice. The decreased level of poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) was detected in Parp1 knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells with western blotting analysis, but immunofluorescence staining did not detect any difference in distribution or level of pADPr in nuclei of knockout ES cells. pADPr level in double Parp1 Parg mutant ES cells greatly exceeded its amount in normal and even in hypomorph Parg mutant ES cells, suggesting the presence of functionally active PARP1. Therefore, our findings challenge the conventional understanding of PARP1 depletion effects.",We thank Dr. Edward Schmidt for the valuable comments on the paper and our colleagues in the University of the North Dakota Department of Biomedical Sciences for stimulating discussions.,"Funding for this project was supported by the U.S. Department of Defense grant PC160049 and National Science Foundation grant MCB-2231403 to AVT.

Pediatric lupus nephritis (pLN), a manifestation of childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affecting the kidneys, is associated with impaired adipokine levels, suggesting a role in pLN pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential relationship between specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801131 and fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG) rs2066865—and the serum levels of leptin and adiponectin in patients with pLN.MethodsNinety-eight pLN patients and one hundred controls were enrolled in the study. Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were measured using ELISA. DNA extraction and real-time PCR genotyping were performed for MTHFR rs1801131 and FGG rs2066865 SNPs.ResultsCompared to healthy controls, pLN patients exhibited significantly greater serum leptin (11.3 vs. 18.2 ng/mL, p < 0.001) and adiponectin (18.2 vs. 2.7 ug/mL, p < 0.001). Adiponectin levels were positively correlated with proteinuria (p < 0.05), while leptin levels positively correlated with proteinuria, SLE disease activity index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K), and cyclophosphamide usage (all p < 0.05). There was no significant association between MTHFR rs1801131 or FGG rs2066865 SNPs and pLN in either codominant or allelic models (all p > 0.05). However, the AG genotype of FGG gene rs2066865 SNP was significantly associated with high leptin levels (> 15 ng/mL) (p = 0.01).ConclusionSerum adiponectin and leptin levels are associated with pathological manifestations of pLN. High leptin levels are associated with the AG genotype of FGG rs2066865 SNP in pLN patients, suggesting direct involvement in disease progression and potential utility as a disease biomarker.","We wish to thank Colciencias, Universidad Del Norte and Universidad Simon Bolivar, for their contributions in this research and our patients for their collaboration.",No funding was secured for this study.,Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics,,,,2024-03-14,2024,2024-03-14,,25,1,34,All OA; Gold,Article,"De Egea, Gloria Garavito; Domínguez-Vargas, Alex; Fang, Luis; Pereira-Sanandrés, Nicole; Rodríguez, Jonathan; Aroca-Martinez, Gustavo; Espítatela, Zilac; Malagón, Clara; Iglesias-Gamarra, Antonio; Moreno-Woo, Ana; López-Lluch, Guillermo; Egea, Eduardo","De Egea, Gloria Garavito (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Fang, Luis (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Pereira-Sanandrés, Nicole (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Rodríguez, Jonathan (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Aroca-Martinez, Gustavo (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia; Departamento de Nefrología, Clínica de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Espítatela, Zilac (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia; Departamento de Nefrología, Clínica de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Malagón, Clara (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad del Bosque, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Iglesias-Gamarra, Antonio (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia; Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia); Moreno-Woo, Ana (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo (CABD), Universidad Pablo de Olavide-CSIC, Seville, Spain); Egea, Eduardo (Grupo de Inmunología y Biología Molecular, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia)","Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Simón Bolívar)","De Egea, Gloria Garavito (Universidad del Norte); Domínguez-Vargas, Alex (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Simón Bolívar); Fang, Luis (Universidad del Norte); Pereira-Sanandrés, Nicole (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Simón Bolívar); Rodríguez, Jonathan (Universidad del Norte); Aroca-Martinez, Gustavo (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Simón Bolívar; Departamento de Nefrología, Clínica de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Espítatela, Zilac (Universidad Simón Bolívar; Departamento de Nefrología, Clínica de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Malagón, Clara (El Bosque University); Iglesias-Gamarra, Antonio (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Simón Bolívar; National University of Colombia); Moreno-Woo, Ana (Universidad Simón Bolívar); López-Lluch, Guillermo (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo); Egea, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://jmhg.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s43042-024-00507-4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169763964,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,
1840,pub.1168404119,10.1002/eng2.12825,,,Gasification of solid biomass or fast pyrolysis bio‐oil: Comparative energy and exergy analyses using AspenPlus®,"Abstract  The conversion of biomass residues into syngas through gasification is attractive for energy and process industry applications. However, transportation, storage, and operational challenges limit the conventional direct solid biomass gasification process. To address these issues, the intermediate conversion of biomass to bio‐oil has emerged as a promising alternative. Bio‐oil offers improved transport and storage capabilities due to its higher mass and energy density, enabling the decoupling of solid biomass supply and syngas demand. This study compares two routes for syngas production: direct gasification of solid biomass and indirect gasification using bio‐oil from biomass pyrolysis as an intermediate with biochar and pyrolysis gas supplying thermal energy to the pyrolysis stage. Biochar combustion provides about 1.4 MJ kg −1 of dry biomass to maintain the pyrolysis temperature at 480°C. Using AspenPlus® simulations, the composition and Low Heating Value of the syngas produced by both routes are analyzed. Energy and exergy analysis at different equivalence ratios and temperatures revealed that direct gasification has higher efficiencies than indirect gasification. At 1000°C and an equivalence ratio of 0.4, the highest energy and exergy efficiencies occurred in direct gasification processes. The energy efficiency of direct and indirect gasification amounted to 62% and 53%, respectively. At the same time, the corresponding exergy efficiencies were 65% and 61%. The syngas of direct and indirect gasification processes is a starting point to produce energy, synthetic fuels, and chemicals; this study provides insights for designing and optimizing biomass gasification processes.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS MINCIENCIAS supported this work through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Becas Bicentenario 2019 Contracts UN‐OJ‐2020‐47414 and UN‐OJ‐2020‐47412.

By indirect ELISA, we evaluated IgE-reactivity to MP1 and to the whole-body extract of Ascaris lumbricoidesin 45 sera from Colombian Caribbean patients with lupus nephritis (LN; n=25), type 1 diabetes (T1D; n=10) and Juvenil idiopathic arthritis (JIA; n=10). Individuals with poly autoimmunity were excluded. All patients were referred to the study by their specialist doctor.
 Results:
 IgE to whole-body extract of A. lumbricoides showed the following median concentrations: 484.2 ng/ml (IQR: 203.4) in JIA patients, 325.6 ng/ml (IQR: 179.3) in individuals with LN, and 424.7 ng/ml (IQR: 80.1) in T1D group. On the other hand, IgE-reactivity to MP1 was 126.4 ng/ml (IQR: 90.9) in JIA patients, 130.7 ng/ml (IQR: 94.8) in an individual with LN, and 148.8 ng/ml (IQR: 102.1) in T1D group. Although no statistical differences were observed between patient groups, the IgE to MP1 in all patients (n: 45) (IgE median: 134.2 ng/ml; IQR: 100) were significantly less compared to Ascaris extract (IgE median: 380.7 ng/ml; IQR: 175.8); (W:0.732; p-value: 1.034x10-7).
 Conclusions:
 These preliminary results suggest that MP1 showed antigenic properties with low IgE-reactivity compared to Ascaris lumbricoides extract in individuals with autoimmune diseases. Further studies are needed to understand better the immune response induced by this molecule.
Objetivo: Evaluar la reactividad IgE de sueros en pacientes que padecen diabetes tipo 1 (DT1), nefritis lúpica (NL) y artritis idiopática juvenil (AIJ) frente a una molécula construida a partir de epítopes T de alérgenos de A. lumbricoides. Métodos: Se diseñó y expresó una proteína multi-epítopes sintética (MP1), a partir de alérgenos de A. lumbricoides y ácaros del polvo doméstico. Mediante ELISA indirecto, se evaluaron las reactividades IgE anti-MP1 y al extracto de cuerpo entero de Ascaris lumbricoides, en sueros de pacientes con nefritis lúpica (NL; n=25), diabetes tipo 1 (T1D; n=10) y artritis idiopática juvenil (AIJ; n=10), procedentes del Caribe colombiano. Se excluyeron los individuos con poliautoinmunidad. Todos los pacientes fueron remitidos al estudio por su médico especialista. Resultados: La IgE frente al extracto de cuerpo completo de A. lumbricoides mostró concentraciones de 484,2 ng/ml (RIQ: 203,4) en pacientes con AIJ; 325,6 ng/ml (RIQ: 179,3) en individuos con NL; y 424,7 ng/ml (RIQ: 80,1) en el grupo con DT1. Por otra parte, la reactividad de IgE anti-MP1 fue de 126,4 ng/ml (RIQ: 90,9) en los pacientes con AIJ; 130,7 ng/ml (RIQ: 94,8) en los individuos con NL; y 148,8 ng/ml (RIQ: 102,1) en el grupo con DT1. Aunque no se observaron diferencias estadísticas entre los grupos de pacientes, la reactividad IgE anti- MP1 en todos los pacientes (n: 45) (mediana de IgE: 134,2 ng/ml; RIQ: 100), fue significativamente inferior en comparación con el extracto de Ascaris (mediana de IgE: 380,7 ng/ml; RIQ: 175,8); (W: 0,732; p-valor: 1,034x10-7). Conclusiones: Estos resultados preliminares sugieren que MP1 mostró propiedades antigénicas con baja reactividad IgE, en comparación con el extracto de Ascaris lumbricoides en individuos con enfermedades autoinmunes.

The framework incorporates an array of variables, including market dynamics, institutional elements, project attributes, and firm-specific factors, to optimize project outcomes and long-term viability. With approximately 3,500 microfinance projects currently operating in the country, Colombia has a thriving microfinance sector that plays a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion and economic development. To ensure a representative sample for this study, 21 microfinance projects were selected using stratified sampling based on key characteristics such as sector, size, and years of operation. The optimization framework developed in this study incorporates an array of variables, including market dynamics, institutional elements, project attributes, and firm-specific factors, to optimize project outcomes and long-term viability. Comprehensive statistical techniques, such as factor analysis, principal component analysis, ANOVA, and t-tests, demonstrate substantial enhancements in critical performance indicators when the optimization framework is implemented. The experimental group, employing the framework, displays superior investment returns, reduced loan defaults, expanded beneficiary reach, and amplified employment generation compared to the control group utilizing conventional allocation strategies. These outcomes corroborate prior studies emphasizing the merits of data-driven methodologies for financial resource allocation in microfinance. The research contributes to the comprehension of effective capital deployment in microfinance initiatives and offers institutions a practical instrument to boost performance, attain financial sustainability, and support poverty reduction and economic growth. The findings have implications for microfinance organizations, policymakers, and academics, underscoring the significance of incorporating a comprehensive set of variables and integrating social capital considerations into microfinance approaches. Subsequent research can expand upon these discoveries to further investigate the efficiency of capital allocation and develop innovative strategies to strengthen microfinance programs.","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the participating microfinance institutions in Barranquilla, Colombia, for their valuable contributions and willingness to engage in this research. Their insights, experiences, and data have been crucial in developing and testing the optimization model, ultimately leading to the significant findings presented in this study.

The researchers employed a quantitative paradigm with a descriptive scope; likewise, they used the case study as a reference as a methodology for analyzing and justifying the data. For its part, the data collection instrument consists of an adaptation of the original applied in 2007, which was validated by a panel of experts. The configuration of the instrument determines the main motivations for pedagogy studies and investigates others not previously collected. Its application was carried out in a total of 7 different pedagogies, with the participation of more than 80% of the students of each major. Regarding the characterization of the sample, the female gender stood out when entering pedagogy, as well as students who live within the same region of the institution and with scores over 500 PSU points (University Selection Test); this sets up the first-year student profile. Furthermore, the results show a clear trend in the three years of its application, highlighting: The taste for the speciality of my career, followed by I liked the idea of working with children and/or young people, I liked the teaching and I wanted to help others through the exercise of teaching. Because these categories are related to other studies from different years and contexts, but on the same topic, it can be stated that there are common motivations for the interest in teaching. Having this information offers an opportunity for the institution to carry out student retention actions aimed at motivating and attracting future teachers. Likewise, the topic can be delved into by considering other variables, such as whether there is variation in interest according to the disciplinary area, the different years of the degree, or the professional career.",,,Revista Educación,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-01-01,,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Durán, Enmanuel Álvarez; Henríquez, Mario Tapia; Diegues, Nicole Riveros","Durán, Enmanuel Álvarez (Universidad de Antofagasta); Henríquez, Mario Tapia (Universidad de Antofagasta); Diegues, Nicole Riveros (Universidad de Antofagasta)",,"Durán, Enmanuel Álvarez (University of Antofagasta); Henríquez, Mario Tapia (University of Antofagasta); Diegues, Nicole Riveros (University of Antofagasta)",0,0,,,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/educacion/article/download/55885/58639,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168085681,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

Norovirus during the Lima 2019 Pan American Games,"Background and Aims: The incidence of infectious diseases among athletes during international competitions is a concern for public health. In this study, we aim to report six cases of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis among athletes in Lima 2019 Pan American Games, a multisport event held in Peru.
Results: During the Lima 2019 event, there were no reported outbreaks or cases of most frequent diseases, however, six cases (0.09%) of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis were reported. The clinical stage of the cases was self-limited to 2 days, and the main treatment was fluid replacement. Of the six affected athletes, five came from the United States and one from Chile. Only one karate athlete from the United States, could not continue with the competition due to the illness.
Conclusions: The incidence of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis among athletes in Lima 2019 was low, and the clinical course of the illness was self-limited. We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records of athletes who presented with gastroenteritis using the Panam Sport In previous sporting events, such as the 2017 World Athletics Championships in London, Injury and Illness Surveillance System. These findings can inform the development of public health strategies for the prevention and control of infectious diseases among athletes during international competitions.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Health Science Reports,,,,2024-03-05,2024,2024-03-05,2024-03,7,3,e1856,All OA; Gold,Article,"Contreras‐Pulache, Hans; Carpio‐Quintana, Víctor; Pineda‐Vidangos, Vanessa; Loayza, Gianmarco Mello; Moya‐Salazar, Jeel","Contreras‐Pulache, Hans (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru); Carpio‐Quintana, Víctor (Comisión Médica Panam Sports, Lima, Peru); Pineda‐Vidangos, Vanessa (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru); Loayza, Gianmarco Mello (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru); Moya‐Salazar, Jeel (Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru; School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculties of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima, Peru)","Contreras‐Pulache, Hans (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Contreras‐Pulache, Hans (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Carpio‐Quintana, Víctor (Comisión Médica Panam Sports, Lima, Peru); Pineda‐Vidangos, Vanessa (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Loayza, Gianmarco Mello (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Moya‐Salazar, Jeel (Private University of the North; Universidad Tecnológica del Perú)",0,0,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hsr2.1856,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169450794,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The improvement focused on reducing the parameters of the formula proposed for indirect volumetric strain in the original method, thereby facilitating the development of a simpler formula in which the radial strain depends on only two parameters: the initial volume of the rock specimen and the volume changes of the hydraulic fluid for each instant. The comparison between the improvement proposed, and original method resulted in a mean absolute difference of 0.003.•This improvement does not depend on the axial strain, unlike the original method, which requires correcting the indirect axial strain measurements before correcting the indirect radial strain measurements.•This improvement can be useful for research on the stress-strain behavior of intact rock under laboratory conditions, such as in the study of the post-peak state.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The central hypothesis of this study proposes that this impact varies depending on the level of novelty associated with the innovation developed. To accomplish this objective, probit regression models are employed using data sourced from the Sixth Survey of Innovation and Technological Development in the Service and Commerce Sectors (EDITS VI) conducted by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) of Colombia for the period 2016-2017. The obtained results demonstrate that innovation barriers exert distinct impacts on the attainment of innovations of varying degrees of novelty (radical innovation versus incremental innovation).

The lack of an efficient treatment system has caused soil damage, destruction of marine fauna and flora, impacts on local health, and a decrease in tourism, which is vital for regional income. To solve this problem, three basic sanitation alternatives are proposed: conventional treatment plant, submersible membrane bioreactor and submarine outfall. The environmental impact assessment using the Leopold matrix is essential to understand and compare the possible effects of these alternatives. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) provides crucial data to identify the environmental impacts of each option, facilitating sustainable decision making. This approach demonstrates a commitment to protecting the local environment.

1742,pub.1171723814,10.6035/clr.7066,,,Dynamism and participant identification in the discursive construction of the American nation,"This article analyzes the linguistic choices used in political discourse to represent social actors and their role in the construction of national storylines. We focus on Donald Trump’s and Joseph Biden’s inaugural speeches as a critical exploratory context. The analytical approach involves contrasting their choices for assigning dynamism to socialactors through transitivity roles and for identifying participants through direct, indirect, and pronominal strategies. Our findings show that Trump assigns Actor + Goal roles that construe citizens as agents impinging on material reality, while Biden assigns them Actor – Goal roles that represent citizens as participants in happenings. Trump’s identification of participants shows a higher proportion of indirect strategies linked with possessivequalification, whereas Biden stands out for his frequent use of the singular first person. The findings suggest connections between the strategies identified and the construction of national identities and storylines, both permeated by political leaders’ ideological orientations.

L' enfocament analític es basa en el contrast de les seves eleccions lingüístiques per assignar dinamisme mitjançant rols de transitivitat i per identificar participants mitjançant estratègies directes, indirectes i pronominals. Els resultats indiquen que Trump assigna rols d'Actor amb Objectiu que interpreten la ciutadania com a agents que influeixen en la realitat, mentre que Biden assigna rols d'Actor sense Objectiu que representen els ciutadans com a participants d'esdeveniments no causats.

Muscle relaxation with botulinum toxin A (TxBtA) has been used as an adjuvant postnatal therapy for the repair of complex abdominal wall defects. Case presentation A female fetus was diagnosed with a giant omphalocele at 14 weeks of gestation. At 34 weeks and 5 days of gestation, 35 units of TxBtA (diluted at 100 units per 10 ml) were injected under ultrasound guidance into each muscle of the left and right sides of the abdominal wall with a 25G spinal needle. The fetus tolerated the procedure well. Two weeks after the injection, the first ultrasound examination was done and revealed a noteworthy change in the shape of the abdominal circumference, with a 50 % decrease in the omphalocele size. The newborn was delivered at 38 weeks and 3 days of gestation. The omphalocele had a maximum diameter of 7 cm. The patient required mechanical ventilation for 24 hours. The reconstruction of the anterior abdominal wall was completed on the fifth day of life using a component separation technique. Feedings were initiated one day after the closure and the patient was discharged home on the 12th day of life. The patient has not experienced any complications at 2 months of follow up. Conclusion Our case suggests that prenatal muscle relaxation of the abdominal wall with TxBtA could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, the time on parenteral nutrition, and the overall hospital stay in newborns with giant omphalocele.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Pediatric Surgery Case Reports,,,,2024-01,2024,,2024-01,100,,102748,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal; Parra-Saavedra, Miguel; Jaramillo-Guerra, Laura Vanessa; Pérez-Tirado, Amiel Alberto","Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal (Organización Clínica General del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia; Universidad Metropolitana and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Parra-Saavedra, Miguel (Organización Clínica General del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia; Institute of Surgery and Fetal Therapy of the Caribbean, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Jaramillo-Guerra, Laura Vanessa (Medicine Program, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Pérez-Tirado, Amiel Alberto (Medicine Program, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia)","Jaramillo-Guerra, Laura Vanessa (Universidad Simón Bolívar)","Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal (Organización Clínica General del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia; Universidad del Norte); Parra-Saavedra, Miguel (Organización Clínica General del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia; Institute of Surgery and Fetal Therapy of the Caribbean, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Jaramillo-Guerra, Laura Vanessa (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Pérez-Tirado, Amiel Alberto (Universidad Simón Bolívar)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsc.2023.102748,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166092148,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,

We first present some background related to these structures to then specifically introduce particular twisted-skew group rings and show how to utilize them as the underlying algebraic structure to build cryptographic protocols. We closely follow an incremental-like methodology to construct these protocols by putting parts together. As as result, we first introduce a key-agreement protocol and then generalize it to a group key-agreement protocol. We then proceed to construct a probabilistic public key encryption from our two-party key agreement and, finally, introduce a key-encapsulation mechanism from a well-known generic construction applied to probabilistic public encryption. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth security analysis for each cryptographic construction under new related algebraic assumptions and supply a proof-of-concept implementation for various candidate chosen groups.",,,Cryptography,,,,2024-07-05,2024,2024-07-05,,8,3,29,All OA; Gold,Article,"de la Cruz, Javier; Martínez-Moro, Edgar; Muñoz-Ruiz, Steven; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo","de la Cruz, Javier (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Martínez-Moro, Edgar (Institute of Mathematics, Universidad de Valladolid, 47011 Valladolid, Spain); Muñoz-Ruiz, Steven (Department of Mathematics, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33146, USA); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Cryptography Research Center, Technology Innovation Institute, Abu Dhabi P.O.

The MOBW-μ model is introduced, which incorporates a lag parameter μ in the singular part, and probabilistic properties such as the joint survival function, marginal density functions, and the bivariate hazard rate function are explored. In addition, aspects such as the correlation structure and survival copulation are addressed and we show that the correlation of the MOBW-μ is always lower than that of its copula, regardless of the parameters. The latter result implies that the MOBW-μ does not have the Lancaster’s phenomenon that explains that any nonlinear transformation of variables decreases the correlation in absolute value.

La Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino (UNSTA) presenta como nueva oferta de grado la carrera de medicina, que enfatiza un enfoque orientado a la familia y la comunidad. El programa de estudio incorpora la educación basada en la comunidad (EBC), desde el primer al último ciclo de la carrera.
 Objetivos. Indagar acerca de las percepciones que los estudiantes que cursaron el primer año de medicina en la UNSTA tienen acerca de sus  experiencias en EBC y caracterizar la valoración que le otorgan al contacto precoz con la comunidad. 
 Material y métodos. Estudio cualitativo, paradigma hermenéutico. Modo de generación conceptual, método de análisis de la teoría fundamentada a partir de entrevistas en profundidad.
 Resultados. Según la percepción de estudiantes, la EBC permite abrir la cabeza (descubrir otras realidades, chocarse con otros contextos, construir otra idea de médico); significa nutrirse de la práctica temprana (tener una marca para toda la carrera, salirse del libro, aprender de la salud pública local, conocer a un esencial invisible, valorar los diagnósticos de situación locales, sentirse parte y ponerse el delantal); posibilita aprender más allá de la medicina (generar un estudio más reflexivo, vivir el trabajo en equipo, mejorar las habilidades comunicacionales, entender a la persona como un todo e iniciar un compromiso social).
 Conclusiones. Los hallazgos subrayan los numerosos beneficios de un plan de estudio que integre la EBC desde el principio. No solo fomenta el aprendizaje reflexivo, sino que también facilita un proceso clínico centrado en la persona y su contexto, iniciando así un compromiso social.",,,Evidencia actualizacion en la práctica ambulatoria,,,,2024-06-15,2024,2024-06-15,,27,2,e007116,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hurtado, Maria del Carmen; Monteverde, Ana Clara","Hurtado, Maria del Carmen (); Monteverde, Ana Clara ()",,"Hurtado, Maria del Carmen (); Monteverde, Ana Clara ()",0,0,,,https://www.evidencia.org/index.php/Evidencia/article/download/7116/4889,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173054777,,

Como resultado, el crecimiento anual de su producto interno bruto (PIB) per cápita fue de alrededor del 0,4%. En cambio, durante el siglo XX, el crecimiento anual de su PIB per cápita fue del 2,0%. Una parte importante de este resultado puede atribuirse a que las exportaciones no crecieron durante el siglo XIX –la tasa promedio anual de crecimiento de las exportaciones efectivas fue del 0,0%–, mientras que en el siglo XX crecieron a una tasa del 2,0%.   Sobre el tema de las exportaciones colombianas en el siglo XIX se han publicado dos estudios: McGreevey (1970) y Ocampo (2013). McGreevey utilizó como fuente para su relato histórico los registros de lo que importaban los principales socios comerciales de Colombia. Sus resultados son defectuosos debido a problemas con la información de reexportaciones y las definiciones de las unidades territoriales que utilizó. En el caso de Ocampo, aunque analizó datos oficiales publicados por el Ministerio de Hacienda de Colombia, la información considerada no incluyó estimaciones anuales, sino un índice por subperíodos ad hoc.

1699,pub.1175674859,10.3390/en17184548,,,An Ensemble Method for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) Applied to Deep Learning Approaches,"Climate change, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, is causing significant long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns. To mitigate these impacts, there is an increased focus on renewable energy sources. However, optimizing power consumption through effective usage control and waste recycling also offers substantial potential for reducing energy demands. This study explores non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to estimate disaggregated energy consumption from a single household meter, leveraging advancements in deep learning such as convolutional neural networks. The study uses the UK-DALE dataset to extract and plot power consumption data from the main meter and identify five household appliances. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained with transfer learning using VGG16 and MobileNet. The models are validated, tested on split datasets, and combined using ensemble methods for improved performance. A new voting scheme for ensembles is proposed, named weighted average confidence voting (WeCV), and it is used to create combinations of the best 3 and 5 models and applied to NILM. The base models achieve up to 97% accuracy. The ensemble methods applying WeCV show an increased accuracy of 98%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results. This study shows that CNNs with transfer learning effectively disaggregate household energy use, achieving high accuracy. Ensemble methods further improve performance, offering a promising approach for optimizing energy use and mitigating climate change.",,,Energies,,,,2024-09-11,2024,2024-09-11,,17,18,4548,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moreno, Silvia; Teran, Hector; Villarreal, Reynaldo; Vega-Sampayo, Yolanda; Paez, Jheifer; Ochoa, Carlos; Espejo, Carlos Alejandro; Chamorro-Solano, Sindy; Montoya, Camilo","Moreno, Silvia (Centro de Investigación, Desarrollo Tecnológico e Innovación en Inteligencia Artificial y Robótica AudacIA, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia; Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Teran, Hector (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Villarreal, Reynaldo (Centro de Investigación, Desarrollo Tecnológico e Innovación en Inteligencia Artificial y Robótica AudacIA, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Vega-Sampayo, Yolanda (Centro de Investigación, Desarrollo Tecnológico e Innovación en Inteligencia Artificial y Robótica AudacIA, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Paez, Jheifer (Centro de Investigación, Desarrollo Tecnológico e Innovación en Inteligencia Artificial y Robótica AudacIA, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Ochoa, Carlos (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Espejo, Carlos Alejandro (Centro de Crecimiento Empresarial e Innovación Macondolab, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Chamorro-Solano, Sindy (Centro de Investigación e Innovación en Biodiversidad y Cambio Climático Adaptia, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla 080005, Colombia); Montoya, Camilo (Solenium S.A.S., Medellin 050031, Colombia)",,"Moreno, Silvia (Universidad Simón Bolívar; Universidad del Norte); Teran, Hector (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Villarreal, Reynaldo (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Vega-Sampayo, Yolanda (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Paez, Jheifer (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Ochoa, Carlos (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Espejo, Carlos Alejandro (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Chamorro-Solano, Sindy (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Montoya, Camilo (Solenium S.A.S., Medellin 050031, Colombia)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/en17184548,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175674859,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering; 51 Physical Sciences,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The research employed a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional survey design, utilizing structured questionnaires to assess participants’ perceptions of their readiness across various domains, including school mathematics, advanced mathematics, pedagogy, and math didactics. The study aimed to uncover nuanced differences in the educational trajectories and perceived preparedness of future educators within the context of the Caribbean region. The hypothesis guiding the research posited that exploring the educational environment (EE) provided to pre-service teachers could offer valuable insights into how regional teacher education institutions approach the development and competency of mathematics educators. The study sought to validate this hypothesis by conducting a comparative analysis of knowledge domains and educational methods between the two cities. Statistical analyses revealed notable variations in knowledge domains between Barranquilla and Cartagena. Consistent disparities were observed in Fundamental Mathematics, with Barranquilla participants scoring significantly higher (M = 3.8, SD = 0.6) compared to their Cartagena counterparts (M = 3.2, SD = 0.5), p = 0.012. Similar trends were found in Higher Mathematics and Educational Methods, with p-values of 0.027 and 0.041, respectively.

Objective: to identify clinical and immunological factors associated with the progression of lupus nephritis in a population from the Colombian Caribbean. Methods: we evaluated 401 patients diagnosed with SLE and lupus nephritis, treated at a reference center in the Colombian Caribbean, gathering data recorded in medical records. Results: A proportion of 87% were female, with a median age of 42 years. Most patients presented with proliferative classes (90%), with class IV being the most common (70%). A proportion of 52% of patients did not respond to treatment, which is described as the lack of complete or partial response, while 28% had a complete response. A significant decrease in hemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria was identified by the third follow-up (p < 0.001), along with an increase in creatinine, urea, and hematuria (p < 0.001). Patients with initial proteinuria > 2 g/day were found to be 27 times more likely to be non-responders (p < 0.001). Mortality was associated with the presence of serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL (p = 0.01) (OR: 1.61 CI 95% 0.75–3.75) and thrombocytopenia (p = 0.01) (OR: 0.36; CI 95% 0.12–0.81).

This qualitative research work is based on grounded theory, in particular on the approaches of Foucault, Goffman and Max-Neef et al. The techniques used were in-depth interview, participant observation, and investigative workshop. The centrality of a religious device was identified as part of the resocialization process. In this institution, religious instruction is promoted based on control and the designs of the educational programs are tinged with a strong religious tradition that promotes submission and obedience as main values within its teaching model, which limits the human development of the women interviewed since it hinders the achievement of their freedom, thus making it impossible for them to achieve their autonomy. However, thanks to the fact that the potential for human development lies in each person, the women participating in the study have managed to turn these limitations and obstacles into opportunities for their personal growth.",,,Diálogos sobre educación,,,,2024-02-29,2024,2024-02-29,,,29,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Simanca, Martha Cecilia Rambal; Casilimas, Carlos Arturo Sandoval; del Carmen Amaris Macías, María; Sobczyk, Rita Aleksandra","Simanca, Martha Cecilia Rambal (Universidad Metropolitana de Barranquilla); Casilimas, Carlos Arturo Sandoval (Universidad de Antioquia); del Carmen Amaris Macías, María (Universidad del Norte Barranquilla); Sobczyk, Rita Aleksandra (Universidad de Granada)",,"Simanca, Martha Cecilia Rambal (Universidad Metropolitana); Casilimas, Carlos Arturo Sandoval (University of Antioquia); del Carmen Amaris Macías, María (Universidad del Norte Barranquilla); Sobczyk, Rita Aleksandra (University of Granada)",0,0,,,http://dialogossobreeducacion.cucsh.udg.mx/index.php/DSE/article/download/1437/1231,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169274955,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,4 Quality Education
1675,pub.1169058597,10.3389/fhumd.2024.1345110,,,Mapping cooperation: insights into Colombia's humanitarian response to migration from Venezuela,"Since 2015, Colombia has faced a significant humanitarian challenge, receiving 2.9 million displaced Venezuelans. This study examines organizational cooperation in the humanitarian response to this migration crisis, aiming to understand the coordination dynamics among key organizations and actors. Our research combined interviews and web scraping to gather data on key actors and their relationships in the humanitarian response. We employed Social Network Analysis (SNA) to examine these relationships and the collaborative strategies among entities, focusing on how they address the migration challenges. The results indicate that cooperation occurred through mediated channels, where established NGOs collaborated via coordination mechanisms established by international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), often involving diaspora volunteer-based organizations and through ad-hoc coordination. We also identified that organizations specializing in specific activities often exhibited limited coordination with others operating in the same sector. Lastly, the results suggest that coordination mechanisms played a crucial role in driving activities and facilitating the diversification of responses, partly through allocating financial resources. This study contributes to the humanitarian aid and migration literature, focusing on Colombia's migration response. It employs a mixed-methods approach, including Social Network Analysis (SNA), to explore the dynamics within humanitarian networks. It highlights the role of the Venezuelan diaspora NGOs, challenging the conventional view of migrants solely as aid recipients. The research uncovers the complex roles of intermediaries and coordination mechanisms, offering new insights into constructing effective humanitarian network structures. It advocates for a collaborative and inclusive approach to managing migration situations.","Lia Castillo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia) helped in processing the interview content.","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Misalignments in the shafts of gear transmission systems can produce transmission errors, increased bending stress at the base of the teeth, and increased normal wear between the teeth. Because vibration analysis is very useful as a failure detection mechanism in stationary rotating equipment, the effect of shaft misalignment on vibration measurements was investigated in this study. Combined misalignments are studied because different types of misalignments occur simultaneously in real applications. The effect of a combination of axial, radial, and angular misalignments on vibration measurements in a spur gear transmission system was investigated. This study was developed through the design and construction of a test bench that allows different types of misalignment in a single-stage spur gear transmission system and vibration measurement through accelerometers installed in the support bearings. Indicators, such as kurtosis and skewness, were used to validate the results in the time domain. For the frequency domain analysis, an indicator was developed that compares the frequency spectra of misaligned conditions to the base spectrum in the aligned condition. The critical misalignment combinations were also identified. It was found that for the combined cases, the contact area between the teeth and the contact ratio were influencing factors. The quantitative effects of combined misalignments on vibration measurements were determined, which can be used as a preliminary diagnosis of this type of problem and as a basis for developing more robust prediction models.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-04-04,2024-01-01,12,,50030-50043,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villalba, Rafael E.

While many researchers have examined how organizations acquire, manage, and leverage legitimacy in urban ventures, there is still a lack of consensus on the role of different types of legitimacy in rural ventures. This paper distinguishes between two types of legitimacy, political and market legitimacy, and utilizes ANOVA to identify variations in these types of legitimacy based on venture factors such as the leader's education and the venture's age.

The DNA was sequenced using Illumina Novaseq 6000 (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) and reads 152,064 bp in length, with a large single-copy region of 83,520 bp and small single-copy region of 18,108 bp were obtained. These reads were separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions (IR) of 25,218 bp, and the overall guanine and cytosine (GC) was 37.24%. The plastid genome contains 130 genes (111 genes were unique and 19 genes were found duplicated in each IR region), including 86 protein-coding genes, 36 transfer RNA-coding genes, eight ribosomal RNA-coding genes, and 25 genes with introns (21 genes with one intron and four genes with two introns).

This study presents CPESI, a cumulative processes-based parsimonious workflow for early evaluation of sanitary infrastructure. CPESI is aimed to provide a simple, objective, and systematic analysis framework at the early stages of development of sanitary systems in underdeveloped nations. CPESI was applied to evaluate sanitation system alternatives for Riohacha (Colombia) in three stages, namely, (1) an initial assessment of citizens acceptability of the alternatives and analysis of basic laboratory testing; (2) a process analysis and technical-economic evaluation of alternatives based on CAPEX and OPEX indicators; and (3) engineering judgment to select the most viable alternative through multi-criteria evaluation. Our results suggest that CPESI could be highly replicable in developing countries and that it has the potential to expedite the alternatives assessment process when compared to data-intensive methods and expert requirements. Several researchers have highlighted the need to develop tools suitable to evaluate SDG 6 in developing nations. We believe that CPESI has the potential to contribute to that end.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. 7.

Guided by this perspective, we examined in a multinational and multicultural study (61 countries; N = 15,039) how narcissism forms are linked to cognitions and behaviors prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, differences in cognitions and behaviors across narcissism forms emerged. For example, higher narcissistic rivalry predicted lower likelihood of enactment of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, but higher narcissistic sanctity predicted higher likelihood of enactment of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Further, whereas the heroism, admiration, and rivalry narcissism forms acted in a typically antisocial manner, with high narcissism predicting greater endorsement of unfounded health beliefs, the sanctity form acted in a prosocial manner, with higher narcissism being linked to lower endorsement of unfounded COVID-19 health beliefs. Thus, the findings (a) support the idea of four narcissism forms acting differently, and (b) show that these differences reflect a double-edged sword, sometimes linking to an anti-social orientation, and sometimes linking to a pro-social orientation.","The work of Magdalena Żemojtel-Piotrowska and Jarosław Piotrowski was supported by grant 2017/26/E/HS6/00282 from the National Science Centre, Poland.

1599,pub.1169212619,10.1111/theo.12511,,,Metaphysical explanations: The case of singleton sets revisited,"Abstract Many contemporary metaphysicians believe that the existence of a contingent object such as Socrates metaphysically explains the existence of the corresponding set {Socrates}. This paper argues that this belief is mistaken. The argument proposed takes the form of a dilemma. The expression “{Socrates}” is a shorthand either for the expression “the set that contains all and only those objects that are identical to Socrates” or for the expression “the set that contains Socrates and nothing else”. However, Socrates' existence does not explain the existence of the set that contains all and only those objects that are identical to Socrates, because there is such a set no matter whether or not Socrates exists. And although Socrates' existence does explain that of the set that contains Socrates and nothing else, this explanation is a conceptual rather than a metaphysical one. Both these claims rely on a deflationary account of the use of set theoretic vocabulary that is explained, though not properly justified, in the paper.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am grateful to Severin Schroeder, Mindaugas Gilaitis, and an anonymous reviewer for their helpful comments on previous drafts of this paper.",,Theoria,,,,2024-02-26,2024,2024-02-26,2024-02,90,1,98-108,All OA; Gold,Article,"Büttner, Kai Michael","Büttner, Kai Michael (Department of Humanities and Philosophy, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Büttner, Kai Michael (Universidad del Norte)","Büttner, Kai Michael (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/theo.12511,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169212619,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields; 5003 Philosophy,

Through interviews, field observations, conversations and all his ethnographic sensorium, the researcher reveals a complex reality: communication, like the imagined nation, present obvious limits. Peasants, indigenous people, peace signatories and public institutions emerge as private spheres, operating as community autarchies without dialogue between them. These entities resist the construction of shared communicative spaces, rejecting the contemporary and technological visions that relate to the post-agreement and peace. However, this resistance is not capricious; the economies of war persist, particularly that linked to drug trafficking, which hinders unity and collective progress. This analysis delves into the disappointments of the social and political dynamics of La Macarena and its relationship with communication in the post-agreement era.",,,Mediaciones,,,,2024-03-01,2024,2024-03-01,,20,32,44-65,All OA; Gold,Article,"TAPIAS, CESAR AUGUSTO","TAPIAS, CESAR AUGUSTO (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte)",,"TAPIAS, CESAR AUGUSTO (Universidad del Norte - Uninorte)",0,0,,,https://revistas.uniminuto.edu/index.php/med/article/download/3511/3591,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169495868,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

El primer trabajo aborda el tema de la justicia organizacional como mediadora en la relación entre la distancia de poder y la alienación organizacional, además, examinó cómo la distancia de poder afecta la alienación organizacional entre trabajadores de la salud en hospitales públicos de Ankara, Turquía, utilizando la justicia organizacional como variable mediadora. Se encuestaron 491 empleados y se encontró una relación positiva entre la distancia de poder percibida y la alienación organizacional. También, se identificó una relación negativa entre la distancia de poder y la percepción de justicia organizacional. La investigación concluyó que la justicia organizacional juega un papel crucial como mediadora, mitigando los efectos negativos de la distancia de poder en la alienación organizacional en estos entornos hospitalarios.En otro estudio, se evalúa la eficiencia técnica en educación secundaria y salud mediante un análisis DEA de dos etapas, incorporando variables no discrecionales y considerando las incidencias atípicas. Los resultados muestran una mayor eficiencia en el sector salud en comparación con el sector educativo.En el artículo “Factores de impacto en la gestión de innovación. Visión desde empresas estatales”, se subraya la importancia de la innovación como motor económico y herramienta para la gestión empresarial, especialmente en el contexto de empresas estatales en Cuba. A través de un modelo de redes bayesianas, se evidencia el papel crucial del liderazgo, la documentación de procesos y la colaboración con otras entidades como elementos competitivos en la gestión innovadora a nivel empresarial.Además, se aborda la influencia de la pandemia en los modelos de liderazgo, destacando la importancia del liderazgo transaccional y transformacional en el compromiso de los trabajadores en entornos de trabajo distribuido. Se enfatiza la necesidad de investigaciones adicionales para comprender el impacto de otros modelos de liderazgo en este contexto emergente.Asimismo, se lleva a cabo una evaluación mediante un modelo de medida de las Capacidades Analíticas del Cliente (CAC), validado psicométricamente a través de análisis factorial exploratorio y confirmatorio. Este estudio, realizado en 101 empresas colombianas, presenta dos modelos: uno tridimensional con 10 ítems vinculados con diferentes factores y otro unidimensional con 14 ítems, permitiendo la medición de la CAC en un contexto de reconfiguración de capacidades operativas tradicionales en marketing.Finalmente, cerramos con “Evaluación de la implementación del Programa de Alimentación Escolar en Cali.

This study aims to understand how listening is assessed in a Colombian private language institution and its potential connection to students' underperformance in listening proficiency tests. We characterize the listening assessment used in B1-level classes through a descriptive case study. Utilizing a rubric, we analyzed fourteen listening tasks from various sources, including course materials and a mock PET exam. Our analysis had two primary objectives: (a) to uncover the rationale behind test design and its alignment with the curriculum, and (b) to evaluate the knowledge types targeted and the forms of listening assessment employed using categorization. Our findings reveal that despite the curriculum's holistic listening development goals, assessments predominantly focus on phonological knowledge through dictation tests, in which students primarily engage with audio media and recordings. These findings suggest a misalignment in the way listening is approached during the whole course, the examinations used to assess listening during the B1 level, and the use of an external standardized test as the exit exam. This study holds potential implications for curriculum alignment and the enhancement of language assessment literacy within our context, shedding light on potential factors contributing to students' underperformance in listening comprehension.",,,HOW,,,,2024-03-04,2024,2024-03-04,,31,1,37-66,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gutiérrez-Rojas, Ana; Rosado-Mendinueta, Nayibe","Gutiérrez-Rojas, Ana (Universidad del Norte); Rosado-Mendinueta, Nayibe (Universidad del Norte)",,"Gutiérrez-Rojas, Ana (Universidad del Norte); Rosado-Mendinueta, Nayibe (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://www.howjournalcolombia.org/index.php/how/article/download/694/631,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169432687,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

1570,pub.1174659476,10.3390/buildings14082458,,,"Influence of Three Different Antistripping Agents on Moisture Susceptibility, Stiffness, and Rutting Resistance of Hot-Mix Asphalt","The construction and maintenance of road infrastructure is required for the sustained economic growth of communities and societies. Nonetheless, these activities imply the tangible risk of boosting the depletion of non-renewable resources (e.g., aggregates and binders). A widely used strategy for preserving as much of these natural resources as possible is the design of high-performance composite materials. For instance, antistripping agents (ASAs) are employed to mitigate the loss of adhesive bonding between asphalt binders and aggregates, enhancing the mechanical behaviour of hot-mix asphalts (HMAs). There is still no consensus on the effectiveness of ASAs. In this regard, the present research aims to contribute to the literature by conducting a case study on the influence of three different ASAs (hydrated lime, an amines-based liquid additive, and a silanes-based liquid additive) on the moisture susceptibility, stiffness, and rutting resistance of HMA. For these purposes, indirect tensile strength, indirect tensile stiffness modulus, and uniaxial cyclic compression tests were carried out. Overall, the involved experimental protocol drew the main conclusion that the incorporation of hydrated lime as a mineral filler (at a content of 1.68% by dry weight of aggregates) is capable of improving the mechanical performance of HMAs through decreases in humidity sensitivity and permanent deformation, together with a slight increase in rigidity.",,"This research was funded by Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS), grant number 745/2016, and the APC was funded by Universidad del Norte.",Buildings,,,,2024-08-08,2024,2024-08-08,,14,8,2458,All OA; Gold,Article,"Orozco, Mario; Preciado, Jaime; Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Fuentes, Luis; Walubita, Lubinda F.; Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo","Orozco, Mario (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Preciado, Jaime (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Fuentes, Luis (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Walubita, Lubinda F.

1562,pub.1174598935,10.3390/a17080345,,,Precedence Table Construction Algorithm for CFGs Regardless of Being OPGs,"Operator precedence grammars (OPG) are context-free grammars (CFG) that are characterized by the absence of two adjacent non-terminal symbols in the body of each production (right-hand side). Operator precedence languages (OPL) are deterministic and context-free. Three possible precedence relations between pairs of terminal symbols are established for these languages. Many CFGs are not OPGs because the operator precedence cannot be applied to them as they do not comply with the basic rule. To solve this problem, we have conducted a thorough redefinition of the Left and Right sets of terminals that are the basis for calculating the precedence relations, and we have defined a new Leftmost set. The algorithms for calculating them are also described in detail. Our work’s most significant contribution is that we establish precedence relationships between terminals by overcoming the basic rule of not having two consecutive non-terminals using an algorithm that allows building the operator precedence table for a CFG regardless of whether it is an OPG. The paper shows the complexities of the proposed algorithms and possible exceptions to the proposed rules. We present examples by using an OPG and two non-OPGs to illustrate the operation of the proposed algorithms. With these, the operator precedence table is built, and bottom-up parsing is carried out correctly.",,This research received no external funding and the APC was funded by Universidad del Norte.,Algorithms,,,,2024-08-07,2024,2024-08-07,,17,8,345,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lizcano, Leonardo; Angulo, Eduardo; Márquez, José","Lizcano, Leonardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Angulo, Eduardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Márquez, José (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Márquez, José (Universidad del Norte)","Lizcano, Leonardo (Universidad del Norte); Angulo, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Márquez, José (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a17080345,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174598935,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive, observational study with a scientometric approach was conducted. Metadata from scientific articles were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection and analyzed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Emtree terms. The search strategy included the terms related to probiotics and oral health, and articles published between 2013 and 2022 were analyzed. Different scientometric indicators were used to analyze the production, impact, and network collaboration.
RESULTS: A total of 485 articles were retrieved from 241 sources, with an average annual growth rate of 10.72%. The manuscripts received an average citation per doc of 15.2. Authors collaborated on an average of 5.76 coauthors per paper. The number of articles published increased progressively from 2013 to 2022. The year 2022 had the highest number of articles published (90), while in 2013 only 36 articles were published. There was a progressive decrease in the average number of citations per article, from 32.44 in 2013 to 2.41 in 2022.
CONCLUSION: The production of articles on probiotics in dentistry has grown steadily, with an annual growth rate of 10.72%. The most productive countries were the United States, Italy, and China. The importance of international scientific collaborations and the need for more research in this field is emphasized.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study may help researchers identify areas that require further study and lead to more rapid and efficient advances in the use of probiotics to improve oral health. Its clinical importance lies in its value and ability to inform and guide future research to advance this field of science.

To introduce this paper we refute, through a review of previous studies in the same field, the use of this approach for its effectiveness in business decision-making. Gathering data on costs, demand and the available capital for the company’s different product lines was done through the use of interviews.

La mayoría son editadas en Estados Unidos y Europa del Este, con tan solo 11 revistas latinoamericanas, entre las cuales se destaca una colombiana. En este grupo de revistas, el promedio de citas por documento no supera una cita, mientras que las que se encuentran en el primer cuartil (Q1) manejan un promedio de cinco citas por documento. Además, los tipos de trabajos más citados son los artículos de revisión o aquellos que marcan las tendencias de investigación en el área de conocimiento o bases fundamentales sobre las mismas (SJR, 2024).Basándonos en búsquedas directas en la base de datos de SCOPUS, en el ámbito del estudio, se identifican diversas temáticas que marcan la tendencia para el año 2024 como administración, negocios y contabilidad. Se destacan temas como el desarrollo sostenible, con un total de 1151 publicaciones, seguido de la toma de decisiones, con 1068. También se observa un interés significativo en áreas como la sostenibilidad, el impacto del COVID-19 y sus efectos post pandemia, así como la innovación y la Inteligencia Artificial (IA) (SCOPUS, 2024).Entre estos temas, los trabajos que han recibido mayor atención a nivel de citaciones incluyen el uso de la IA en el sector turístico, evaluaciones de eficiencia en sistemas contables durante la pandemia, estrategias digitales para nuevos emprendimientos, economía verde e innovación ambiental, desafíos para los emprendedores en el contexto post pandemia por COVID-19, procesos de transformación digital en la gestión de empleados, aplicaciones de la tecnología blockchain para la trazabilidad y transparencia en la cadena de suministros, así como el impacto de las emisiones de carbono en organizaciones que incorporan tecnologías de la información y comunicación.Entre otros aspectos emergentes que están definiendo las agendas de investigación en estos campos, se evidencia un interés en temas como la responsabilidad social y ambiental de las organizaciones, la adopción de la industria 4.0 en la cadena de suministros y la normatividad de la gestión organizacional durante la pandemia por COVID-19.Estas mismas tendencias han sido recientemente validadas por la revista Forbes, que las categoriza de la siguiente manera: el uso de la IA como estrategia y herramienta de aprendizaje, las habilidades personales y aspectos fundamentales en las organizaciones que no pueden ser automatizados o reemplazados por IA, los negocios sustentables (un desafío actual para la mayoría de las organizaciones), donde se enfatiza el compromiso en la reducción de la huella de carbono, el crecimiento hacia una economía verde y la mejora de las habilidades de gestión con responsabilidad social (Marr, 2023). Además, se señala un enfoque creciente en el uso del big data para la toma de decisiones, convirtiéndose en una herramienta valiosa para mejorar la ventaja competitiva empresarial y la experiencia del cliente, sobre todo cuando se combina con la IA. Por último, se destaca la tendencia hacia el trabajo remoto después de la pandemia, con un énfasis en la productividad, el bienestar y la satisfacción de los trabajadores como aspectos clave a considerar en el ámbito organizacional (Marr, 2023).En conclusión, estos campos continúan evolucionando y vinculando investigaciones interdisciplinarias y transdisciplinarias, lo que, junto con la base epistemológica de la administración, los negocios y la contabilidad, permite el desarrollo del estado del arte en la ciencia y define líneas claras sobre las tendencias que demandan las organizaciones y el ámbito del conocimiento.",,,Cuadernos de Administración,,,,2024-03-18,2024,2024-03-18,,40,78,e1114001-e1114001,All OA; Gold,Article,"Castro-Bolaño, Lauren J.","Castro-Bolaño, Lauren J.

It examines MacIntyre’s revision of Iusnaturalism with an Aristotelian approach, Arendt’s methodological Iuspositivism highlighting legal frameworks, Nino’s rationality-based human rights theory, and Habermas’ emphasis on communicative action and social constructs. This research navigates the dynamic interplay of these theories, offering a multi-dimensional perspective on the evolution, validation, and application of human rights in contemporary society. Significantly, it introduces a dialectical perspective on rationality as a dynamic and evolving human attribute, addressing the constructivist necessities in defining human nature amidst prevailing uncertainties.",,,The Age of Human Rights Journal,,,,2024-03-18,2024,2024-03-18,,,22,e8430-e8430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arrieta-López, Milton; Certain-Ruiz, Roberto","Arrieta-López, Milton (Universidad de la Costa, Colombia); Certain-Ruiz, Roberto (Universidad de la Costa, Colombia)",,"Arrieta-López, Milton (University of the Coast); Certain-Ruiz, Roberto (University of the Coast)",0,0,,,https://revistaselectronicas.ujaen.es/index.php/TAHRJ/article/download/8430/8504,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169848835,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Esto ha llevado a una transformación significativa en la interacción entre el odontológico y los pacientes, adaptándose a nuevas formas de satisfacer sus necesidades de atención. Objetivo: Explorar los beneficios y las barreras de la atención dental presencial y la teleodontología de pacientes durante la pandemia de Covid-19. Metodología: Estudio cualitativo exploratorio y descriptivo. Se realizaron 20 entrevistas a individuos que habían utilizado servicios odontológicos presenciales y otros en línea durante la pandemia de Covid-19. Se realizó análisis temático cualitativo de la información recolectada. Resultados: En la atención presencial, los pacientes otorgaron importancia a las medidas de bioseguridad, y el miedo al contagio fue uno de los principales motivos para evitar esta modalidad. No obstante, los pacientes valoraron positivamente la capacidad de resolver sus problemas dentales inmediatamente. Por otro lado, en la teleodontología mencionaron que desconocían este servicio y se sintieron motivados por el deseo de evitar el riesgo de contagio. Sin embargo, fue desafiante el tener que demostrar autonomía para llevar a cabo, por sí solos, ciertos exámenes. Conclusión: La atención dental presencial es esencial para muchos pacientes, y la implementación de normas de bioseguridad no debería representar un riesgo de contagio.

Variables como la huella plantar y el mecanismo de windlass podrían influir en este equilibrio. Actualmente no se encuentran estudios que relacionen estos elementos en deportistas. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar la influencia de la huella plantar y el MW en el equilibrio dinámico en deportistas colombianos. Metodología: Estudio transversal y correlacional. Participaron 193 deportistas de baloncesto (n=45), fútbol (n=102) y voleibol (n=46). El equilibrio dinámico se evaluó mediante el test de la Y. Para determinar el tipo de pie se utilizó el método de Herzco y el test de Jack para evaluar el MW. Resultados: Se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en el equilibrio dinámico según huella plantar en baloncesto H(2)=9.033, Sig.=0.01; 1- ? =.202, ?2=.205.

The quality of this material significantly influences its market value, with impurities potentially affecting Li-ion battery performance and longevity. While the importance of impurity analysis is acknowledged by suppliers and manufacturers of battery materials, reports on elemental analysis of trace impurities in Li2CO3 salt are scarce. This study aims to establish and validate an analytical methodology for detecting and quantifying trace impurities in Li2CO3 salt. Various analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), were employed to analyze synthetic and processed lithium salt. X-ray diffraction patterns of Li2CO3 were collected via step-scanning mode in the 5-80° 2θ range. SEM-EDX was utilized for particle morphology and quantitative impurity analysis, with samples localized on copper tape. XPS equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer was employed to analyze the surface composition of the salt. For ICP-OES analysis, a known amount of lithium salt was subjected to acid digestion and dilution with ultrapure water. Multielemental standard solutions were prepared, including elements such as Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Si, Zn, Ca, K, Mg, Na, and S. Results confirmed the presence of the zabuyelite phase in XRD analysis, corresponding to the natural form of lithium carbonate. SEM-EDX mapping revealed impurities of Si and Al, with low relative quantification values of 0.12% and 0.14%, respectively. XPS identified eight potential impurity elements, including S, Cr, Fe, Cl, F, Zn, Mg, and Na, alongside Li, O, and C. Regarding ICP-OES analysis, performance parameters such as linearity, limit of detection (LOD), and quantification (LOQ), variance, and recovery were evaluated for analytical validation. ICP-OES results demonstrated high linearity (>0.99), with LOD and LOQ values ranging from 0.001 to 0.800 ppm and 0.003 to 1.1 ppm, respectively, for different elements. The recovery rate exceeded 90%. In conclusion, the precision of the new ICP-OES methodology renders it suitable for identifying and characterizing Li2CO3 impurities. It can effectively complement solid-state techniques such as XRD, SEM-EDX, and XPS.","The authors thank the Universidad de Católica del Norte for the support in performing this study.

In Latin America, there has been continuous growth in the use of these models for exploring and defining strategies for a transition toward decarbonized and more sustainable energy systems. These models are essential for quantifying impacts and defining potential pathways due to the complexity of the interactions between different energy sectors. However, reviewing the increasing pool of available modeling tools is necessary, empowering regional energy planners and policymakers with a clearer understanding of their classifications, applications, and critical features. This understanding aids in selecting the most suitable tool for their needs. This article aims to contribute to analyzing trends in utilizing energy modeling tools in Latin America, specifically focusing on their application in energy planning and research efforts toward sustainability. We present a systematic literature review of the leading energy modeling tools used in Latin America following the PRISMA methodology. Eight specific tools were selected and analyzed, assessing five primary aspects: geographical coverage, sectoral coverage, temporal resolution, time horizon, and renewable energy integration. The analysis revealed the evolution of energy modeling tool usage in the region, highlighting trends supporting sustainable energy planning and transition practices. The analysis highlights the increasing share of renewable energy in Latin America. It also recognizes the necessity for high-temporal resolution tools to evaluate the availability and utilization of renewable resources while emphasizing the importance of intersectoral collaboration. Furthermore, it indicates the importance of collaboration among stakeholders and policymakers to advance toward more sustainable energy systems.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Study focus Hydrological models are widely used to project the impacts of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) change on water budget. However, their ability to produce reliable predictions depends on how accurately they represent the role of vegetation in the watershed’s water balance. We analyze how different representations of Leaf Area Index (LAI) affect streamflow responses to LULC change using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We also examine streamflow response to 100 % pasture cover (PAS), 100 % forest cover (FOR), and a control scenario using the original SWAT model, SWAT-T, and a proposed new variant (SWAT-Tb), which improves LAI bimodal representation for tropical regions. New hydrological insights for the region SWAT-T and SWAT-Tb reproduce observed LAI and streamflow in the CR watershed. However, SWAT-T restricts LAI simulation to unimodal seasonality, while the original SWAT reproduces streamflow but not LAI seasonality. Results using SWAT-T (unimodal LAI) and SWAT-Tb (constant and bimodal LAI) show streamflow increases during the dry seasons for the FOR scenario and decreases for the PAS scenario.

Carvacrol (CVR) has exhibited a broad-spectrum antifungal activity in vitro. We assumed that CVR can also be applied to control Alternaria rot on goji berries and mycotoxins produced by the pathogens. To investigate whether CVR impacts the accumulation of mycotoxins and cell membrane damage of A. alternata, the antifungal activity of CVR on the fungal growth and mycotoxin production was evaluated in this study. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CVR against A. alternata was 0.12 µL/mL. Meanwhile, the destruction of plasma membrane integrity, cytoplasmic leakage, intracellular oxidative damage, and inhibitory effect in vivo were also observed in A. alternata treated with CVR. Moreover, CVR significantly reduced the accumulation of AOH, AME, and TeA. Transcriptomic profiling was performed by means of comparative RNA-Seq analysis to research the gene expression level of A. alternata, which attested to significant changes in nitrogen metabolism, carbon utilization, fatty acid oxidation, and antioxidant enzymes in CVR-treated A. alternata. This study suggests a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of response to CVR treatment in A. alternata, indicating that CVR is a novel antifungal agent with the potential to be applied to various fungi.",,This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 32060565); the Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province (grant numbers: 2022AAC03229 and 2020AAC03255); and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the North Minzu University (grant number: FWNX13).,Journal of Fungi,,Zonghua Wang,,2024-06-03,2024,2024-06-03,,10,6,402,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Junjie; Zhou, Yueli; Wang, Peng; Zhao, Lunaike; Zhang, Huaiyu; Qu, Huan; Xu, Fei","Wang, Junjie (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.)); Zhou, Yueli (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.)); Wang, Peng (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.); College of Life Science, Northwest A & F University, Yangling 712100, China); Zhao, Lunaike (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.)); Zhang, Huaiyu (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.)); Qu, Huan (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.)); Xu, Fei (Key Laboratory of Storage and Processing of Plant Agro-Products, School of Biological Science and Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China;, 15732950990@163.com, (Y.Z.);, peng_w08@163.com, (P.W.);, zhao921526641@163.com, (L.Z.);, rosalie42@163.com, (H.Q.);, lengyue0524@163.com, (F.X.); Physical and Chemical Laboratory of Ningxia Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Yinchuan 750021, China)","Wang, Junjie (North Minzu University); Zhang, Huaiyu (North Minzu University)","Wang, Junjie (North Minzu University); Zhou, Yueli (North Minzu University); Wang, Peng (North Minzu University; North West Agriculture and Forestry University); Zhao, Lunaike (North Minzu University); Zhang, Huaiyu (North Minzu University); Qu, Huan (North Minzu University); Xu, Fei (North Minzu University; Ningxia Center for Diseases Prevention and Control)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/10/6/402/pdf?version=1717395342,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172470235,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

Additionally, this review highlighted the use of such biosorbents in wastewater treatment. Furthermore, novel approaches for sustainable nutrient removal from aqueous solutions were identified. A comprehensive understanding of the implementation of biosorption processes using agro-industrial residues based on corn and rice crops is critical for the sustainable management of residues and water bodies in the world to protect and conserve natural resources. Specifically, the review focuses on the exploration, preparation and application of innovative biosorbents to remove various forms of nutrients such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrates, ammonium and phosphates from aqueous solution, analyzing the sustainability of treatments applied to biomass, such as thermal transformation or chemical modification to reduce environmental impacts. It was found that 95 to 99% of nitrogen and phosphorus can be removed with biosorbents made from rice husks and corn residues, analyzing approximately 50 scientific articles related to these plant materials. Research opportunities were identified, such as the recovery of removed nutrients for soil improvement, life cycle analysis to assess the concept of zero waste, among other aspects.

Chile exemplified this. By mid-2020, Chile had one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the world predominantly in poorer areas. A year later, the country launched a universal vaccination campaign based on the national strategy of immunization established in 1975. By 2022, Chile presented one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination coverages globally, reaching 94.3% of the population with the primary scheme by the end of 2022. Objective: This study analyzes the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence at the beginning of the pandemic (2020) compared with the seroprevalence after 2 years of ongoing epidemic and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns (2022). Methods: Two population-based random samples of individuals aged 7 years and older from two Chilean cities were studied. Utilizing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, IgG antibodies were measured in serum of 1061 participants in 2020, and 853 in 2022. Results: Using the Global Moran's Index, the seroprevalence distribution pattern for the year 2020 showed clustering in the two cities. Conversely, seroprevalence and vaccinations were homogeneously distributed in 2022. These results show the success of the vaccination campaign in Chile, not only in coverage but also because it widely reached all individuals. Conclusions: The uptake of this preventive measure is high, regardless of the social and economic factors, achieving broad population immunity.

Worry, fear, and anxiety associated with this disease can affect the perception of family health. The study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with health vulnerability of family members in the Peruvian population after pandemic.
Methods: Observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study. Sampling was nonprobabilistic. The sample consisted of 519 residents who met the following inclusion criteria: Peruvian resident, of both genders, over 18 years of age, who lives with their family, and who agrees to participate in the study. For data collection, the ""SALUFAM"" and ""PRE-COVID-19"" scales were used, which measure the health vulnerability of family members and concern about the contagion of COVID-19, respectively. Data collection was done between January and March, 2023.
Results: Living in the Coast region increases by 3.299 times (95% CI = 1.55-9.28; p = 0.003) the probability of lower family health vulnerability compared to residents from the Jungle region. In the same way, having a low concern about the contagion of COVID-19 increases 2.77 times (95% CI = 1.02-7.53; p = 0.044) the probability of less vulnerability to family health, unlike participants who are highly concerned about the contagion of COVID-19.
Conclusions: It should be necessary to design prevention and family health promotion strategies according to the geographical region; it is also essential to provide education on the risks and the importance of prevention measures for COVID-19, regardless of their initial level of concern.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Journal of General and Family Medicine,,,,2024-03-27,2024,2024-03-27,2024-05,25,3,146-153,All OA; Gold,Article,"Coronado, Richard D.

Nonetheless, overexploitation is causing a decline in both the population and the associated ecosystems due to the lack of sustainability strategies and knowledge of alternative ways of utilization. The focus of this research was to determine if the secondary metabolites found/identified in the volatile fractions/ethyl acetate extracts of Aniba panurensis, Nectandra cuspidata, Ocotea cymbarum and O. myriantha from the Amazon region of Colombia (Departamento de Caquetá) would be promising/interesting for industry, so that uses/exploitation other than timber could be recommended. In this work, the chemical compositions by GC–FID/MS of the volatile fractions/total extracts (by HS–SPME/SDE/maceration) of the trunk wood of these trees were determined. The results were: (i) the volatile fractions/extracts of A. panurensis were composed of 88–94% benzenoid-type aromatic esters (benzyl salicylate and benzoate); (ii) N. cuspidata contained 95% sesquiterpenes (α-copaene and α-cubebene/germacrene D) by HS–SPME, 89% oxygenated and hydrocarbonated sesquiterpenes (τ-cadinol and δ-cadinene) by SDE, and 87% sesquiterpenes and aporphine alkaloids (α-copaene/germacrene D/δ-cadinene/α-cubebene and dicentrine/dehydrodicentrine) by solvent extraction; (iii) O. cymbarum contained mainly 63% sesquiterpenes and monoterpene ethers (α-copaene/trans-calamenene and eucalyptol) by HS–SPME, 63–85% of monoterpene alcohols (α-terpineol/borneol)/hydrocarbons (α-/β-pinenes)/ethers (eucalyptol) and phenylpropanoid ethers (methyleugenol) by SDE/solvent extraction; and (iv) for O. myriantha, the constituents per family were 91% sesquiterpenes (bicyclogermacrene/germacrene D)—HS–SPME, 72% sesquiterpene alcohols and sesquiterpenes/monoterpenes (spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene/δ-3-carene)—SDE, and 69% benzenoid-type aromatic esters and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons/alcohols (benzyl salicylate and bicyclogermacrene/α-cadinol)—solvent extraction. In conclusion, the main constituents identified in the woods (volatile fractions/extracts) of the species could be isolated and sustainably used/exploitated due to their bioproperties, as well as for their fragrant properties, some of which could be harnessed by different sectors/types of industries.","The authors thank the Universidad del Norte (Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación) for the financial support of the APC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study incorporating a secondary data analysis of 2017-2021 data from the Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). REs and ethnicity were obtained from focal child's mother's report. Four outcomes were assessed: hyperopia, myopia, astigmatism and any RE. We included potential confounders, such as age, sex, wealth index, area of residence, region of origin, frequency of watching TV and watching screens at less than 30 cm distance. Generalised linear models with the Poisson family and log link function were used to calculate crude prevalence ratio and adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: Data from a total of 52,753 children were included. The prevalence of RE in children aged 7-11 years was 10.90% (95% CI 10.49-11.33), of which 5.19% were hyperopia, 3.35% myopia and 2.36% astigmatism. Those of the Aymara ethnicity were less likely to suffer from any RE and astigmatism (aPR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-0.99, p = 0.046; aPR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92, p = 0.012, respectively), Members of Amazon groups were more likely to have hyperopia (aPR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.14-3.36, p = 0.015) and Quechuas were more likely to have myopia (aPR =1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62, p = 0.028), where all were compared to Mestizos.
CONCLUSION: About 1 in 10 Peruvian children suffer from a RE. The most frequent RE in this study was hyperopia. Ethnic differences were seen in the frequency of RE.",Conflicts of interest None of the authors have any proprietary interests or conflicts of interest related to this submission.

1380,pub.1175174384,10.3389/fpos.2024.1440122,,,A theory on political violence in hybrid regimes: insights from Colombia,"This article presents a model of political competition in which political parties, through clientelism strategies, vie for control of legislative seats. Parties exercise political violence to prevent potential rivals from gaining power and threatening their position within the hybrid political regime. The theory suggests that the degree of political violence exerted by parties in hybrid regimes will increase (decrease) as they concentrate more (less) power in the legislature. Using the methodology of analytical narratives, we examine the narrative on political violence in the Colombian political regime to identify key actors, strategies, information sets, and institutional changes. From these identified elements, we construct a theoretical model of political competition within the mathematical theory of games to explain the institutional changes highlighted in the narrative. Finally, we develop an econometric model to find statistical evidence supporting the predictions of the theoretical model derived from the narrative. The narrative and the analytical narrative indicate that, in a hybrid regime, a higher degree of political power concentration causes a higher rate of political violence. The estimation of the Vector Auto-regression model allows us to analyze the response of the violence rate to a shock in the concentration index. Following an unexpected increase in the concentration of political power, the violence rate shows an initial increase of approximately 0.3 percentage points above its initial value. Subsequently, the effect attenuates slightly and stabilizes at around 0.2 percentage points above the baseline, maintaining this level throughout the period. The theoretical model proposed in this paper suggests an explanation of political violence that diverges from the explanations offered by traditional theories. We suggest that the theoretical model proposed here captures the historical logic of the relationship between violence, political clientelism, and exclusion in Colombia, a country with a relatively long tradition as a formal democracy (since 1958), leading us to interesting conclusions that have not been proposed so far in the literature on violence in Latin America.",,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Political Science,,,,2024-08-29,2024,2024-08-29,,6,,1440122,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cendales, Andrés; Guerrero-Sierra, Hugo; Oñate, Laura","Cendales, Andrés (Departamento de Economía y Administración, Facultad de Ciencias Jurídicas y Sociales, Universidad de Caldas, Manizales, Colombia); Guerrero-Sierra, Hugo (Facultad de Relaciones Internacionales, Estrategia y Seguridad, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Cajicá, Colombia); Oñate, Laura (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cendales, Andrés (University of Caldas)","Cendales, Andrés (University of Caldas); Guerrero-Sierra, Hugo (Military University Nueva Granada); Oñate, Laura (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpos.2024.1440122,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175174384,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

However, the theoretical foundation for analyzing EE needs further development to comprehensively capture its systemic, complex, and adaptive nature. Although recent studies have made progress in this area by incorporating complexity theory into this field of literature, the multilayer characteristics of an EE have been overlooked in those conceptualizations. We therefore build upon those papers by introducing an understanding of EE as a multilayer network from the perspective of complexity theory.

The investigation evaluated the effect of the experimental gastrojejunal bypass bariatric surgery hourglass (EBSSC G-YB) on the fecal bacterial microbiota in obese Landrace pigs. Twelve six-month-old animals were used, which were supplemented with energy from 2.5 months for a period of 120 days, enough time to reach the condition. Subsequently, they were intervened with the EBSSC G-YB and the changes in the microbiota were characterized, comparing an experimental group with two control groups in a period of 30 days. The result was that the microbiota of the three groups showed Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the ones with the highest relative abundance, however, at the end of the experiment a difference is highlighted, where the Phylum Spirochaetes was constant and more frequently in the experimental group, while for control groups 1 and 2 it was the Phylum Tenericutes. Although the differences were not significant, qualitatively there was greater diversity in the experimental group, with greater abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Pseudohongiella, which may be useful as quantifiable biomarkers of weight loss in future research.

While pre-existing comorbidities have been linked to most cases, the exact distribution of fatalities within the country remains unclear. We aimed to assess deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic across various regions and provinces in Peru.
Methods: An observational georeferencing study was designed. Peru faced four waves of COVID-19 over three years, with variable impacts across its three regions (Coast, Highlands, and Jungle). Deaths related to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure (HF), arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), strokes, and acute coronary syndrome, were examined as primary variables. The study period spanned pre-pandemic years (2017-2019) and pandemic years (2020-2021), utilizing death data from the National Death Information System (SINADEF). The georeferencing analysis was conducted using ArcGIS v10.3.
Results: A total of 28,197 deaths were recorded during the study period, with significant increases during the pandemic (2020-2021). Cardiovascular deaths were disproportionately higher during the pandemic, totaling 19,376 compared to 8,821 in the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.001). AMI and HF were the leading causes of mortality, showing significant increases from the pre-pandemic (5,573 and 2,584 deaths) to the pandemic period (12,579 and 5,628 deaths), respectively. Deaths due to CVD predominantly affected individuals aged over 60, with significant increases between the two study periods (7,245 vs. 16,497 deaths, p = 0.002). Geospatial analysis revealed regional disparities in CVD mortality, highlighting provinces like Lima and Callao as COVID-19 critical areas. The substantial increase in cardiovascular deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru showed distinctive patterns across regions and provinces.
Conclusions: Geospatial analysis identified higher-risk areas and can guide specific interventions to mitigate the impact of future health crises. Understanding the dynamic relationship between pandemics and cardiovascular health is crucial for effective public health strategies.",The authors thank Rosy and Dante Espinoza-Morriberon of Universidad Tecnológica del Perú for their support in the selection and collection of data and the critical review of this manuscript that was also powered by Nesh Hubbs&#x27; team.,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,,,2024-06-03,2024,2024-06-03,,11,,1316192,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Marín, Eileen A.; Palomino-Leyva, Camila B.; Rivera, Jhonny; La Torre, Rosario; Cañari, Betsy; Pardo-Villarroel, Claudio; Contreras-Pulache, Hans","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Marín, Eileen A.

This study evaluated the association between the availability of recreational facilities and average minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day of US adolescents in 2017 (n = 1,437). Data for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the 2017 Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating study, an internet-based study collecting information on diet and PA of parent and adolescent dyads. Adolescents aged 12-17 from the US were included. Predicted daily minutes of MVPA were calculated. The exposure variables of interest were the availability of school recreational facilities, indoor recreational facilities, playing fields, bike/hiking/walking trails or paths or public parks. Participants were excluded if no information was provided for MVPA or availability of recreational facilities. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression analysis was used to calculate mean daily minutes of MVPA and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. In fully adjusted models, we found statistically significant associations between the type of recreational facility and differences in daily minutes of MVPA for school (p-value < 0.001) and public parks p-value < 0.001), but not for the other recreational facilities. The average daily minutes of MVPA differed by 4.4 min (95 % CI 2.6, 6.2) if participants had school recreational facilities, respectively. School recreational facilities are important for engaging adolescents in PA objectives. Features within school recreational facilities should be studied to further investigate contributions to increased PA levels.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Incorrect settings are an important source of misoperations that cause blackouts. This paper presents a new, fast, and simplified method for automatic calculation and verification of power transformer overcurrent protection settings. The method is based on a new concept of a metadata short-circuit matrix for obtaining the boundary of the short-circuit in every bay of the transformer. The evolution of simulators and object-oriented programming has been used to design an integrated method that significantly reduces the time involved in protection coordination processes by calculating pickups, time dials, operating times, and margin times of all overcurrent functions used in power transformers (ANSI 50, 50N, 51, 51N). A simplified approach to computing inverse curve operating times is used, considering in-code equations to avoid the use of complex relay models. Expert programmable rules are used to verify the settings automatically, including input user settings. The method was implemented in Power Factory DIgSILENT, and it has been used by the Colombian power system operator for more than two years in the coordination protection process with successful results. Two real-world applications of the method are presented.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Juan F.

Reinstating this capacity requires a structural detachment from the market. The artistic gesture, as a unique execution of a human body that does not become an object, eludes market capture, since, in the case of the gesture, the work is the very activity of acting. The gesture, as a minimal yet vital component of art not only escapes the gravitational pull of capital but also, by aligning itself with human action, underscores the individual and collective agency of humans to think and act freely. To comprehend the above, it is elucidated how the work/gesture, the artistic gesture, reshapes the concept of a work of art, the role of the artist and the viewer, and the function that the museum must fulfill. Finally, the political and educational potential of the artistic gesture is posited as an exercise that fosters free-thinking practices to sensitize participants to their mutual interdependence and eco-dependence on nature.",,,"Arte, Individuo y Sociedad",,,,2024-05-13,2024,2024-05-13,,Avance en línea,,1-12,All OA; Gold,Article,"Machado-Penso, María V.; Serrano-López, Federico G.","Machado-Penso, María V.

The existence of such a partition for any number of regions remains an open question. In this paper, we address this issue by developing an algorithm to find such a convex fair partition without restrictions on the number of regions. Our approach utilizes the normal flow algorithm (a generalization of Newton’s method) to find a zero for the excess areas and perimeters of the convex hulls of the regions. The initial partition is generated by applying Lloyd’s algorithm to a randomly selected set of points within the polygon, after appropriate scaling. We performed extensive experimentation, and our algorithm can find a convex fair partition for 100% of the tested problem. Our findings support the conjecture that a convex fair partition always exists.",,"B.U. acknowledges the support of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics at Bonn, of the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation, and of the ICTP through the Associates Programs.",Fixed Point Theory and Algorithms for Sciences and Engineering,,,,2024-08-12,2024,2024-08-12,,2024,1,13,All OA; Gold,Article,"Campillo, Mathilda; Gonzalez-Lima, Maria D.; Uribe, Bernardo","Campillo, Mathilda (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 via Puerto Colombia, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gonzalez-Lima, Maria D.

Thus, this paper analyzes in detail the effects of OFCSs on conventional overcurrent protection schemes and proposes a novel mitigation strategy to the energization and fault plus load effects introduced by this charging strategy on protection systems. The proposed approach includes additional constraints in the overcurrent coordination problem to minimize operation times and uphold coordination delays between main and remote backup protection. Additionally, the resulting optimization problem is solved with the Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA), and is validated on the IEEE 34 and IEEE 123 test systems. In overload situations, the strategy yields a minimal increase of under 200 ms in main protection response times, ensuring non-activation during BEB connections, whereas in non-overload scenarios, optimal settings maintain comparable response times. The paper concludes by recommending coordinated cut-off mechanisms with grid operators to prevent unmet demands during extended BEB connections, addressing critical challenges in the evolving landscape of BEB charging.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2024-08,2024,,2024-08,159,,110007,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caraballo-Gomez, Michel; Restrepo, Mauricio; Orozco-Henao, Cesar","Caraballo-Gomez, Michel (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Atlántico, Colombia); Restrepo, Mauricio (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Atlántico, Colombia); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Atlántico, Colombia)","Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte)","Caraballo-Gomez, Michel (Universidad del Norte); Restrepo, Mauricio (Universidad del Norte); Orozco-Henao, Cesar (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2024.110007,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171463431,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,

Using graphs directly instead of vectorization allows exploiting the intrinsic representations of the data. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised learning method based on the use of graph kernel functions used for this task. One of the problems of SVM, as the number of samples increases, is the cost of storing and solving the optimization problem related to SVM. In this work, we propose a method capable of finding a small representative subset of the whole graph data set such that an approximate solution of the SVM optimization problem can be obtained in a fraction of the time, and without significantly degrading the classification prediction error. The method is based on the use of Locality-Sensitive Hashing for projecting over the Hilbert spaces defined by appropriate graph kernels that measure similarity between the graphs. A description of the algorithm, as well as numerical results using two graph kernels (Simple Product and Random Walk) on simulated and real life data sets are presented. The numerical experiments compare the training times and the classification error between the SVM obtained with our smart sampling approach, and the SVM obtained over the complete data set or over a random sub-sample. The results offer evidence of the advantages of our proposal for solving large scale graph classification problems when using SVM.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-01-22,2024-01-01,12,,15791-15799,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gonzalez-Lima, María D.; Ludeña, Carenne C.; Otazo-Sanchez, Gibran G.","Gonzalez-Lima, María D.

Cryothermal catheter therapy induces cellular necrosis by freezing the insides of pulmonary veins, with the goal of disrupting abnormal electrical heart signals. Nevertheless, tissue damage induced by cold temperatures may also lead to other complications after cardiac surgery. In this sense, the simulation of catheter ablation can provide safer environments for training and the performance of cryotherapy interventions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to help better understand how temperature rates can affect this procedure by using computer tools to develop a simulation framework to predict lesion size and determine optimal temperature conditions for reducing the risk of major complications. The results showed that a temperature profile of around -40 °C caused less penetration, reduced necrotic damage, and smaller lesion size in the tissue.

Leptospirillum (L.) ferriphilum, is an iron-oxidizing microorganism with a remarkable adaptability to thrive in extreme acidic environments, including heap bioleaching processes, acid mine drainage (AMD) and natural acidic water. A strain of L. ferriphilum (IESL25) was isolated from an industrial bioleaching process in northern Chile. This strain was challenged to grow at increasing concentrations of sulfate in order to assess changes in protein expression profiles, cells shape and to determine potential compatible solute molecules. The results unveiled changes in three proteins: succinyl CoA (SCoA) synthetase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASD); which were notably overexpressed when the strain grew at elevated concentrations of sulfate. ASD plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of the compatible solute ectoine, which was identified along with hydroxyectoine by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The relationship between IDH, SCoA, and ectoine production could be due to the TCA cycle, in which both enzymes produce metabolites that can be utilized as precursors or intermediates in the biosynthesis of ectoine. In addition, distinct filamentous cellular morphology in L. ferriphilum IESL25 was observed when growing under sulfate stress conditions. This study highlights a new insight into the possible cellular responses of L. ferriphilum under the presence of high sulfate levels, commonly found in bioleaching of sulfide minerals or AMD environments.","The authors thank Biotechnology Center of Catholic University of North Chile by laboratory facility support, Benito Gomez-Silva for comments and review, Conicyt scholarship 05-DOC-FIC-45 and support by FONDECYT Chile, projects 1221604 and 112411236.","The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2024-05-24,2024,2024-05-24,,15,,1369244,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arias, Dayana; Zepeda, Víctor; Nancucheo, Ivan; Saldaña, Manuel; Galleguillos, Pedro A.","Arias, Dayana (Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Applied Microbiology, Centro de Investigación en Fisiología y Medicina de Altura (FIMEDALT), Departamento Biomédico, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Zepeda, Víctor (Scientific and Technological Research Centre for Mining Research, CICITEM, Antofagasta, Chile); Nancucheo, Ivan (Facultad de Ingeniería, Arquitectura y Diseño, Universidad San Sebastián, Concepción, Chile); Saldaña, Manuel (Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Arturo Prat University, Iquique, Chile); Galleguillos, Pedro A.

Studies suggest that high levels of stress may be related to the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aims to explain how quarantine habits and lifestyles acted as risk factors for the frequency of this syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic. An observational study was conducted with 34 Chilean participants (average age 24.5 ± 3.85 years), of whom 21 (62%) were female. Surveys on consumption trends and lifestyles created by the authors were administered. Additionally, we used the global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) and the depression anxiety stress scales (DASS-21) to assess psychological stress and the Rome IV criteria to assess IBS. Significant differences were found between individuals with better healthy habits compared to those with poor healthy habits. The former showed lower sedentary activity (32%, p = 0.005), only 27% were fast eaters (vs. 44%, p = 0.001), had shorter nap intervals (14% vs. 28%, p = 0.03), and higher vegetable consumption (p = 0.02). There were 20 cases (59%) of IBS, with a strong association with the female sex (p = 0.004), where females were 15 times more likely to develop it compared to males (p = 0.008). Additionally, when alcohol consumption was added to females, there was a higher likelihood of developing this syndrome (p = 0.009), as individuals who consumed alcohol were 12 times more likely to develop it compared to those who did not (p = 0.02). Among other factors, it was observed that 57% of those with the syndrome consumed drinks more often (p = 0.02) but consumed fewer nuts (p = 0.009). In conclusion, IBS has a multifactorial etiology, and correcting individual habits such as alcohol consumption could potentially prevent or delay its development. Therefore, it is important to maintain healthy lifestyles, regardless of non-modifiable factors such as gender, in order to better cope with this syndrome.","We would like to express our gratitude for the support of Mónica Andrews from the Universidad Autónoma de Chile for her assistance in data curation and validation of questionnaires.

Other research shows that there could be, due to the workload, the appearance of some psychosocial risks such as stress, anxiety and depression. Therefore, the question arises: What are the levels of depression, anxiety and stress present in university teachers in the city of Quito? The methodology used for this study is quantitative, descriptive-correlational in scope, with a non-experimental cross-sectional research design. After applying the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to 162 professors from public and private universities in the city of Quito, the relevant results were that the academic staff presented 85.2% mild depression, 74.1% mild anxiety and 85.2% mild stress. Regarding the work functions, they perform most frequently, it was found that 51.9% work in the three substantive functions: teaching, research – community outreach and administrative management. It is concluded that there is a significant correlation between the time spent on active breaks and stress and anxiety.

Initially, a thin layer of Mo was grown through sputtering, followed by a sulfurization process employing the CVD technique. This two-stage process enables the control of diverse nanostructure formations of both MoS2 and MoO3 on SiO2 substrates, as well as the formation of bulk-like grain structures. Subsequently, the addition of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was examined, resulting in MoS2/rGO(n), where graphene is uniformly deposited on the surface, exposing a higher number of active sites at the edges and consequently enhancing electroactivity in the HER. The influence of the synthesis time on the treated MoS2 and also MoS2/rGO(n) samples is evident in their excellent electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential.","The authors gratefully appreciate the contribution of the MAINI—UCN, for the analysis and data acquisition using FE-SEM, Raman and XPS, the equipment from Raman-AFM Proyecto Fundación Andes.

(Gastropoda: Eulimidae): the first parasitic deep-sea snail reported for the Salas & Gomez Ridge,"Eulimidae is a highly diverse family of gastropods that are often parasites of echinoderms. They are cosmopolitan and live from the intertidal to great depths. Despite its wide geographic and bathymetric distribution, no species of Eulimidae have been reported for the Salas & Gómez Ridge to date. In this study, we describe Melanella martarum sp. nov., which was collected during the EPIC oceanographic cruise onboard RV Mirai (JAMSTEC, Japan) in 2019. Seven specimens were collected with a modified Agassiz trawl on the summit of seamount ""Pearl"" (Zhemchuznaya) in the Salas & Gómez Ridge (25.59°S, 89.13°W) at 545 m depth. The morphology of M. martarum sp. nov. was compared with other Melanella species reported for the area, including Chile and Rapa Nui. DNA was extracted and partial sequences of the mitochondrial genes Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (COI) and 16S rDNA, and the nuclear gene Histone 3 (H3) were sequenced. Melanella martarum sp. nov. has morphological characteristics that separate it from other species of Melanella, such as the thickness and color of the shell, and the shape of the protoconch. In addition, M. martarum sp. nov. was genetically differentiated from other Melanella spp. sequences (uncorrected p distances from 18,1-8.6% in mitochondrial COI and 16S rDNA to 3% in nuclear H3 sequences). Although there is not much molecular data available for Eulimidae, the phylogenetic analysis confirms the results obtained by morphology, placing the species found on the Salas & Gómez Ridge within the genus Melanella. The current study advances the understanding of the poorly known benthic fauna found on seamounts in the easternmost part of the Sala & Gómez ridge, a location distinguished by a high level of endemism.","For their assistance at sea, we would like to thank the Captain and crew of R/V Mirai, and the scientific personnel participating in the EPIC cruise.

X-ray powder diffraction measurements confirm that CH3NH3NiCl3 adopts a crystal structure within the Cmcm space group, while CsNiCl3 is organized in the P63/mmc space group, as reported previously. Such structural diversity underscores the complex nature of these perovskites and their potential for tailored applications. Thermal analysis further reveals the stability of CH3NH3NiCl3 and CH3NH3NiBrCl2, which begin to decompose at 260 °C and 295 °C, respectively. The optical absorption properties of these perovskites studied by UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy revealed the bands characteristic of Ni2+ ions in an octahedral environment. Notably, these absorption bands exhibit subtle shifts upon bromide substitution, suggesting that optical properties can be finely tuned through halide modification. Such tunability is paramount for the design and development of materials with specific optical requirements. By offering a detailed examination of these properties, the study lays the groundwork for future advancements in material science, particularly in the development of innovative materials for sustainable energy technologies.","R.C. thanks to Fondecyt Iniciación 11230732.

Obtaining this nanomaterial is strongly linked to biogenic synthesis methods, which have also been developed in this research, using Coriandrum sativum extract as a reducing agent. ZnO NPs have been properly characterized by techniques to evaluate their morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental analysis by EDX. The evaluation of the antimicrobial and antifungal effects is linked to the use of a system provided by ""locker sanitizer"" equipment, which has been designed and built as part of this research, and is intended to treat textile garments by nebulizing the ZnO NP colloid (99.08 μg/mL) + UV-B, water + UV-B, and UV-B only, and also to evaluate the influence of the treatment time for 1, 2 and 3 min. In this sense, it is known that the nanomaterial used shows a better response to UV light because more hydroxyl radicals are produced, leading to a higher reaction rate, which results in greater efficiency in inhibitory processes. The results show that the use of the locker sanitizer is more efficient when using ZnO NP + UV-B light since it achieved 100 % growth inhibition against E. coli, C. albicans, and A. brasiliensis, and >99 % against S. aureus, after 3 min of treatment.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The structure, particle morphology, optical properties, and biological compatibility of the NPs were assessed. The results demonstrated the formation of BT:Sm and [(BT:Sm)-PEG]. The relative intensities and positions of peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) are consistent with an average crystallite size of ∼75 nm. The Raman spectra showed that Sm doping produced the typical tetragonal peaks at around 306 and 715 cm-1, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that the PEGylation process was effective. Also, our investigation demonstrates the potential of these NPs as very temperature-sensitive nanosensors with a resolution exceeding 0.5 °C, which is achievable through optical excitation. We also analyze their emission properties. Finally, we present a study related with the mitochondrial activity of naked and PEG-coated NPs. The results indicate that neither naked nor PEG-coated NPs exhibit changes in mitochondrial metabolism, as indicated by quantitative cell viability and morphological visualization. The PEG-coated NPs prevented the formation of aggregates in cell culture compared to naked NPs, demonstrating the significance of PEG as a stabilizing agent.","This work has been partially financed by P.

In the current study we collected data from 414 participants, both divorced parents and the children's extended families in Peru (155) and Spain (259). Participants completed a questionnaire on attitudes toward the parents, and the Short Dark Tetrad questionnaire. Multivariate tests were conducted on participants' responses, showing that negative attitudes toward parents are not very strong but that attitudes toward fathers are more negative than attitudes toward mothers. Custodial parents are perceived less negatively, and parents who share custody are perceived the least negatively. Extended family members hold more negative attitudes against parents than the parents themselves. Mothers have significantly more negative attitudes toward fathers than the fathers towards mothers. Dark traits are a significant predictor of negative attitudes toward the mother but not toward the father. The perception of unhappiness in the child was predicted by negative attitudes toward the parents. Non-parents tend to evaluate both parents more negatively compared to parents' mutual perceptions. There was an effect on dark traits, negative attitudes against parents, and perception of unhappiness in the child. Peruvians scored significantly higher in all variables.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Miguel Clemente reports financial support was provided by Xunta de Galicia.

1211,pub.1167987628,10.15649/cuidarte.3042,,,Estrés laboral y calidad de vida en enfermeros durante la pandemia por Covid-19,"Highlights Work-related stress is the set of physical and emotional reactions that appear when exposed to difficult situations and do not have the resources to face them. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the stressors in nursing care in intensive care units. Caring for patients with Covid-19 generated a high workload for health personnel, causing a series of alterations that affected the quality of life of health professionals. It is essential to evaluate the level of work stress in health professionals, as well as to design strategies to improve working conditions for nursing staff. Introduction: Work-related stress is the physical and emotional manifestation triggered by an imbalance in coping with perceived demands. One of the workers most affected by work-related stress is the nursing staff, a situation that was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic and could affect their quality of life. Objective: To evaluate the connection between quality of life and work-related stress in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods:  Analytical, cross-sectional study, with a quantitative approach. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis were used for the present study. Results: A negative correlation was obtained between quality of life and stress level (r = -0,438, p < 0,01), and being a professional nurse was related to higher stress levels. On the other hand, being 31 years or older and having more than 12 months of work experience were associated with a higher quality of life score, while being female, single, divorced, or widowed and having higher acute stress scores indicated a significantly worse quality of life. Discussion:  Acute stress negatively affects the quality of life of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and this differs significantly according to age, sex, marital status, and work experience. Conclusion: It is recommended that the health sector authorities design policies that guarantee strategies to improve the mental health of nursing personnel, as well as to guarantee fair and dignified treatment.

Batch flocculation experiments were performed to determine the size of the flocculated aggregates over time by using focused beam reflectance measurements. Sedimentation tests were performed to analyze the settling rate of the solid-liquid interface and the turbidity of the supernatant. Subsequently, a model that relates the hindered settling rate to the aggregate size was used to determine the mass fractal dimension (Df). Flocculation kinetics revealed that greater amounts of kaolin generated larger aggregates because of its lamellar morphology. The maximum size was between 10 and 20 s of flocculation under all conditions. However, the presence of kaolin reduced the settling rate. The fractal dimension decreased with the increase in the kaolin content, resulting in the formation of irregular and porous aggregates. By contrast, factors such as the flocculation time, water quality, and quartz size had limited influences on the fractal dimension. Seawater produced a clearer supernatant because of its higher ionic strength and precoagulation of particles. Notably, the harmful effect of clays in seawater was reduced.","Ricardo I.

To do so, expressions are proposed for both effects and a time range is specified where repeated doses can be applied. Moreover, we propose expressions (PROBIT equations) that relate the percentage of a population that would reach the recommended daily amount of vitamin D and the repeated dosage to which the population is exposed for skin types I to IV. For all the cases studied, protective factors, such as the use of clothes or sunscreens, were taken into account. Additionally, comparisons were made based on skin types between the generation of daily vitamin D and the onset of sunburn, being able to establish a percentage of those who would suffer from first-degree sunburns when this population reached the recommended daily amount of vitamin D. Thus, it can be noted that when a large percentage of a population wants to obtain the recommended daily allowance of vitamin D of 2000 IU or more, and by exposing a small portion of skin to solar radiation, a considerable percentage of that population would suffer from first-degree sunburn as vitamin D generation is related to the area of exposed skin. Therefore, by increasing the area of skin that is exposed to solar radiation, vitamin D needs can be safely met even with higher daily amounts.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,“This research received no external funding”.,Heliyon,,,,2024-05-11,2024,2024-05-11,2024-05,10,10,e30864,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco; Comendador-Jiménez, Begoña; Castro, Enrique; Cánovas, Manuel; Conesa, Manuel","Sánchez-Pérez, Juan Francisco (Department of Applied Physics and Naval Technology, Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, Spain); Comendador-Jiménez, Begoña (General Directorate of Pharmacy and Health Products.

In aquaculture settings, Vibrio poses a substantial risk of infectious diseases, resulting in considerable stock losses and prompting the use of antimicrobials. However, this practice contributes to the proliferation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria and resistance genes. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of biological agents such as bacteriophage CH20 and endolysin LysVPp1 in reducing Vibrio bacterial loads in both rotifer and fish larvae. LysVPp1's lytic activity was assessed by measuring absorbance reduction against various pathogenic Vibrio strains. Phage CH20 exhibited a limited host range, affecting only Vibrio alginolyticus GV09, a highly pathogenic strain. Both CH20 and LysVPp1 were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing Vibrio load in rotifers or fish larvae through short-setting bioassays. Our results demonstrated the significant lytic effect of endolysin LysVPp1 on strains of Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio splendidus. Furthermore, we have showcased the feasibility of reducing the load of pathogenic Vibrio in live feed and fish larvae by using a non-antibiotic-based approach, such as lytic phage and endolysin LysVPp1, thus contributing to the progress of a sustainable aquaculture from a One Health perspective.",The authors acknowledge all staff of the Laboratorio de Patobiología Acuática (UCN) and Laboratorio de Biotecnología (INTA) for providing material and assisting during the rotifer and larvae sampling.,"The authors are grateful for the financial support by FONDECYT Regular 1200523 and FONDECYT Regular 1211950 from ANID, Chile.",Microorganisms,,,,2024-04-30,2024,2024-04-30,,12,5,904,All OA; Gold,Article,"Romero, Jaime; Blas-Chumacero, Sergueia; Urzúa, Victoria; Villasante, Alejandro; Opazo, Rafael; Gajardo, Felipe; Miranda, Claudio D.; Rojas, Rodrigo","Romero, Jaime (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, El Líbano 5524, Santiago 7830489, Chile;, sergueia.blas@ug.uchile.cl, (S.B.-C.);, vrosariou@gmail.com, (V.U.);, alejandro.villasante@inta.uchile.cl, (A.V.);, ropazo@inta.uchile.cl, (R.O.);, fgajardoe@gmail.com, (F.G.)); Blas-Chumacero, Sergueia (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, El Líbano 5524, Santiago 7830489, Chile;, sergueia.blas@ug.uchile.cl, (S.B.-C.);, vrosariou@gmail.com, (V.U.);, alejandro.villasante@inta.uchile.cl, (A.V.);, ropazo@inta.uchile.cl, (R.O.);, fgajardoe@gmail.com, (F.G.)); Urzúa, Victoria (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, El Líbano 5524, Santiago 7830489, Chile;, sergueia.blas@ug.uchile.cl, (S.B.-C.);, vrosariou@gmail.com, (V.U.);, alejandro.villasante@inta.uchile.cl, (A.V.);, ropazo@inta.uchile.cl, (R.O.);, fgajardoe@gmail.com, (F.G.)); Villasante, Alejandro (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, El Líbano 5524, Santiago 7830489, Chile;, sergueia.blas@ug.uchile.cl, (S.B.-C.);, vrosariou@gmail.com, (V.U.);, alejandro.villasante@inta.uchile.cl, (A.V.);, ropazo@inta.uchile.cl, (R.O.);, fgajardoe@gmail.com, (F.G.)); Opazo, Rafael (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, El Líbano 5524, Santiago 7830489, Chile;, sergueia.blas@ug.uchile.cl, (S.B.-C.);, vrosariou@gmail.com, (V.U.);, alejandro.villasante@inta.uchile.cl, (A.V.);, ropazo@inta.uchile.cl, (R.O.);, fgajardoe@gmail.com, (F.G.)); Gajardo, Felipe (Laboratorio de Biotecnología de Alimentos, Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, El Líbano 5524, Santiago 7830489, Chile;, sergueia.blas@ug.uchile.cl, (S.B.-C.);, vrosariou@gmail.com, (V.U.);, alejandro.villasante@inta.uchile.cl, (A.V.);, ropazo@inta.uchile.cl, (R.O.);, fgajardoe@gmail.com, (F.G.)); Miranda, Claudio D.

However, there is a lack of psychometric evaluation of instruments that allow to identify behavior regarding problematic use of the internet and cell phones in the Latin America, particularly in Ecuador. The main aim of this study is to examine the psychometric properties of two instruments: the Internet-related experiences questionnaire (IREQ) and Mobile-related experiences questionnaire (MREQ) in high school students (n = 4, 174, M age = 15.63; 51.19% male and 48.37% female).
Methods: The validation process was performed using one and two factors for both questionnaires according to previous literature. After checking the models proposed to date, the best fit model was the one-factor model for (IREQ) and one-factor model for (MREQ).
Results and discussion: The invariance was performed using two samples according to gender (male, female) and has been confirmed with an acceptable internal consistency for both questionnaires. For IREQ (All, ω = 0.80; Male, ω = 0.77; Female, ω = 0.82) and for MREQ (All, ω = 0.83; Male, ω = 0.82; Female, ω = 0.84). In addition, we performed the correlation analysis between IREQ, MREQ, and socio-demographic variables and finally, both instruments demonstrated strong psychometric qualities within the local population.",The authors would like to thank all students who participated in this study.,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Searches were performed in Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science until March 2023 for RCTs assessing probiotics with a minimum intake duration of 0.2 months vs. control (no treatment or placebo) and reporting at least one primary or secondary outcome. Primary outcomes were number of carious, Streptococcus mutans count, and Lactobacillus count; secondary outcomes were bacterial plaque index, gingival index, salivary pH, and bleeding index. We performed meta-analyses with random effects models and the inverse variance method. Effects were described as mean difference (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The risk of bias was assessed with the RoB 2.0 tool. The GRADE methodology was used to assess the quality of evidence (QoE). Nineteen RCTs were included (n = 2622), with a follow-up range of 0.2 to 108 months. Probiotics had no effect on reduction of dental caries (MD -0.24 carious pieces, 95%CI -0.72 to 0.23; I2 = 52%, low QoE) or Lactobacillus count (MD -0.78 CFU/mL, 95%CI -1.65 to 0.09; I2= 52%, very low QoE) vs. control. However, probiotics probably reduced S. mutans count vs. control (MD -0.40 CFU/mL, 95%CI -0.57 to -0.24; I2 = 11%, moderate QoE). Probiotics had no effect on bacterial plaque index (MD 0.21 units of bacterial plaque, 95%CI -0. 55-0.96; I2 = 80%, very low QoE), gingival index (MD 0.04 units of gingival index, 95%CI -0.18 to 0.27; I2= 0%, low QoE), and salivary pH (MD -0.12 pH units, 95%CI -0.72 to 0.48; I2 = 92%, very low QoE) vs. control. Probiotics were found to likely reduce S. mutans counts. However, no significant effect of probiotics was observed in reducing other outcomes compared to the control group.",Conflict interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",International Dental Journal,,,,2024-07-17,2024,2024-07-17,2024-07,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayta-Tovalino, Frank; Maguiña-Quispe, Jorge; Barja-Ore, John; Hernandez, Adrian V","Mayta-Tovalino, Frank (Maestria en Epidemiologia Clinica y Bioestadistica, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Peru.; Grupo de Bibliometria, Evaluacion de evidencia y Revisiones Sistematicas (BEERS), Human Medicine Career, Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Peru.); Maguiña-Quispe, Jorge (Maestria en Epidemiologia Clinica y Bioestadistica, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Peru.); Barja-Ore, John (Academic Department, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru.); Hernandez, Adrian V (Unidad de Revisiones Sistemáticas y Meta-análisis (URSIGET), Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru.; Health Outcomes, Policy, and Evidence Synthesis (HOPES) group, University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, Storrs, Connecticut, USA.

A questionnaire was administered to 577 executives from Colombian companies, and the data was analyzed using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The results show that both transformational and transactional leadership have a direct and significant impact on extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction, with transformational leadership having the greatest impact on these factors. Conversely, passive-avoidant leadership has negative effects on these three constructs. This study validates the effectiveness of the MLQ 5X in a South American country, a geographical region where such studies are in their early stages.

Materials and methods: An observational, descriptive study conducted on 254 first- to fifth-year students of Human Medicine who were administered the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) in 2021. Results: A total of 48.03 % of the students had a moderate level of physical activity. The sociodemographic characteristics most commonly observed were the female sex in the light (64.56 %) and vigorous (59.26 %) levels of physical activity and the male sex in the moderate (55.37 %) level of physical activity. Concerning the age, the youth stage predominated in all levels (light: 58.44 %, moderate: 62.60 % and vigorous: 61.11 %), contrary to the young adult stage, where all levels obtained the lowest percentage. According to the year of study, second-year students stood out in the light (36.71 %), moderate (36.07 %) and vigorous (58.49 %) levels, in contrast to fourth-year students, who achieved the lowest percentage in all levels (light: 3.8 %, moderate: 26.23 % and vigorous: 3.77 %). Finally, regarding the light level of physical activity, the mean number of hours sitting per day was 7.88 compared to the vigorous level, which attained a mean of 3.23. Conclusions: Most of the students of Human Medicine at a university in northern Peru had a moderate level of physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. The most prevailing sociodemographic characteristic was the female sex with a light level; those in the youth stage and the second year of studies showed all levels of physical activity.

The separate contributions of currents, sea-swell waves, and infragravity waves to high- and low-frequency sediment fluxes were analyzed. The infragravity wave energy was more relevant near the swash zone than in other areas. Although the currents are the primary suspended sediment transport mechanism, the results suggest that the waves are an important driver of sediment suspension from the seabed. The results indicate that Sea-Swell (SS) waves and cross-shore currents are the prevailing hydrodynamic factors in nearshore sediment transport, and the cross-shore suspended sediment transport rates are higher than those in alongshore transport. The submerged bar intensified during the wet season (1–4 November 2018) when the wave height intensities were lower, contrary to the dry season (24–25 March 2018). Significant accretion nearshore was identified (in the subaerial beach) during the wet season when the suspended sediments were greater, the SS-wave heights nearshore were lower, and sediment flux was directed onshore. A notorious erosion was distinguished during the dry season.

This research proposes an optimized UHPC blend that significantly reduces the Portland Cement dosage by incorporating industrial waste materials [i.e., Recycled Glass Powder (RGP) and Electric Arc Furnace Slag (EAFS)]. The integration of these waste materials in UHPC formulation addresses critical waste management issues and aligns with sustainable construction practices. Utilizing a tri-variable Design of Experiments methodology in conjunction with the Andreasen & Andersen theory, the research aims to reduce Portland Cement in UHPC without compromising its compressive strength and rheological behavior. The optimized blend incorporates RGP and EAFS, achieving the threshold compressive strength established by ACI-239 (150 MPa) while maintaining a self-compacting performance in the fresh state. This mixture features low cement (621 kg/m³) and silica fume (100 kg/m³) content. Life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted to examine the environmental efficiency of the optimized blend. A comparative LCA demonstrates that the optimized UHPC mixture developed in this study surpasses a control mixture with higher cement and silica fume contents while maintaining comparable mechanical and rheological properties. Notably, this improvement is highlighted by a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions. The scientific significance of this study lies in its demonstration of a viable pathway to producing UHPC with reduced environmental impact, contributing to the advancement of sustainable building practices, and offering a practical solution to waste management issues.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Una Mirada Socioecológica","The article proposes four interfaces that highlight the importance of mining and industrial action as agents of transformations that, at least from the 18th century onwards, conditioned the trajectory of many natural and social processes in the Huasco Valley. These interfaces correspond to: the logging and disappearance of vernacular vegetation during the 18th century; the expansion of mining capital in the agricultural sector and the deterioration and decline of the area's forest biomass between 1820 and 1850; a second expansion of mining capital that, coming from the salt pampas, invested in the agricultural development of Huasco between 1890 and 1930; and finally, the arrival of the Pacific Steel Company in the valley in the mid-20th century. At present, processes of resistance to the socio-ecological crisis can be detected that are synonymous with active social participation as a way of building a new distributive order capable of regulating social entropy and the biophysical environment based on knowledge and future expectations. This translates into modifying asymmetries in access, management and allocation of benefits and externalities that imply unequal ecological exchanges and, in the same way, to correct the absence of the State as an organizing and regulating entity of economic interests whose actions strongly impact the destiny of territories such as the one studied.",,,Historia Ambiental Latinoamericana y Caribeña (HALAC) revista de la Solcha,,,,2024-06-28,2024,2024-06-28,,14,2,106-136,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lorca, Mauricio; Brangier, Víctor","Lorca, Mauricio (Universidad de Atacama); Brangier, Víctor (Universidad de Talca)",,"Lorca, Mauricio (University of Atacama); Brangier, Víctor (University of Talca)",0,0,,,https://www.halacsolcha.org/index.php/halac/article/download/798/722,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173272422,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society,

In addition, some symmetry properties of the Four-Wave mixing (FWM) signal concerning the frequency detuning exchange are used in the study, without restricting ourselves to the maxima of population oscillations. We analyze the behaviors of these optical responses in a vibronic coupling scheme using a molecule model consisting of two coupled harmonic curves of electronic energies with displaced minima in position and nuclear energies. The solvent effect in our model is treated through the natural Bohr frequency shift to a time-dependent function, with explicit manifestations in its comparison as if the upper state were broadened. Our results for both FWM signal propagation and nonlinear optical susceptibilities are sensitive to the intramolecular coupling parameters, solvent stochasticity, and perturbation order for the treatment of the weak probe beam. The consideration of a second-order probe beam in FWM would not represent a significant contribution to the predicted results, since its percentage contribution is negligible within the model development framework; however, this contribution becomes important when increasing the ratio between longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

On the other hand, Green and Schroll introduced Brauer graph algebras and Brauer configuration algebras to investigate the algebras of tame and wild representation types. An appropriated system of multisets (called a Brauer configuration) induces these algebras via a suitable bounded quiver (or bounded directed graph), and the combinatorial properties of such multisets describe corresponding indecomposable projective modules, the dimensions of the algebras and their centers. Undirected graphs are examples of Brauer configuration messages, and the description of the related data for their induced Brauer configuration algebras is said to be the Brauer analysis of the graph. This paper gives closed formulas for the dimensions of Brauer configuration algebras (and their centers) induced by Cayley and nilpotent graphs defined by some finite groups and finite commutative rings. These procedures allow us to give examples of Hamiltonian digraph constructions based on Cayley graphs. As an application, some quantum entangled states (e.g., Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger and Dicke states) are described and analyzed as suitable Brauer messages.",,"Convocatoria Nacional para el Establecimiento de Redes de Cooperación bajo el Marco del Modelo Intersedes 2022–2024, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

However, it is not known whether loss of muscle strength occurs, and which interventions will effectively mitigate physical PAE impairments. We aimed to investigate whether physical alteration persists during adolescence and whether exercise is an effective intervention.ResultsUsing paradigms to evaluate different physical qualities, we described that early adolescent PAE animals have significant alterations in agility and strength, without alterations in balance and coordination compared to CTRL animals. We evaluated the effectiveness of 3 different exercise protocols for 4 weeks: Enrichment environment (EE), Endurance exercise (EEX), and Resistance exercise (REX). The enriched environment significantly improved the strength in the PAE group but not in the CTRL group whose strength parameters were maintained even during exercise. Resistance exercise showed the greatest benefits in gaining strength, and endurance exercise did not.ConclusionPAE induced a significant decrease in strength compared to CTRL in PND21. Resistance exercise is the most effective to reverse the effects of PAE on muscular strength. Our data suggests that individualized, scheduled, and supervised training of resistance is more beneficial than endurance or enriched environment exercise for adolescents FASD.","The authors would like to thank Rodrigo Leyton, Antonio Hidalgo, Montserrat Olivares for their support in the first stage of the experimentation.",Proyecto Semilla Vicerectoría de investigación UCN 071/2022 (PHS and RB).,Biological Research,,,"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Female; Muscle Strength; Pregnancy; Male; Rats; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats, Wistar",2024-06-22,2024,2024-06-22,,57,1,41,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vargas-Foitzick, Ronald; García-Ordenes, Bayron; Iratchet, Donovan; Acuña, Angie; Alcayaga, Spencer; Fernández, Cristian; Toledo, Karla; Rodríguez, Marianela; Naranjo, Carolina; Bustamante, René; Haeger, Paola A","Vargas-Foitzick, Ronald (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); García-Ordenes, Bayron (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Núcleo de Investigación en Prevención y Tratamiento de Enfermedades Crónicas no Transmisibles (NiPTEC), Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Iratchet, Donovan (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Acuña, Angie (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Alcayaga, Spencer (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Fernández, Cristian (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Toledo, Karla (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Rodríguez, Marianela (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Naranjo, Carolina (Departamento de Ciencias Clínicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Bustamante, René (Carrera de Kinesiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Núcleo de Investigación en Prevención y Tratamiento de Enfermedades Crónicas no Transmisibles (NiPTEC), Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Haeger, Paola A (Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Núcleo de Investigación en Prevención y Tratamiento de Enfermedades Crónicas no Transmisibles (NiPTEC), Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)","Haeger, Paola A (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North)","Vargas-Foitzick, Ronald (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North); García-Ordenes, Bayron (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North); Iratchet, Donovan (Catholic University of the North); Acuña, Angie (Catholic University of the North); Alcayaga, Spencer (Catholic University of the North); Fernández, Cristian (Catholic University of the North); Toledo, Karla (Catholic University of the North); Rodríguez, Marianela (Catholic University of the North); Naranjo, Carolina (Catholic University of the North); Bustamante, René (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North); Haeger, Paola A (Catholic University of the North; Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,https://biolres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40659-024-00520-2,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173115560,31 Biological Sciences,

Cardiometabolic abnormalities (CAs), encompassing lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose, and blood pressure, contribute to CVD prevalence. Despite high CA incidence, research in Latin America has primarily focused on traditional adiposity indices, overlooking the intricate relationship between fat and lean body components. The study aimed to analyze the association between the lean-to-fat mass ratio (LFMR) and CAs in the adult Peruvian population.
Methods: This was an analytical cross-sectional study using secondary data from the PERU MIGRANT study (2007, 989 participants). The main outcome variable was CA defined as having ≥ 2 out of six metabolic components (high triglycerides, impaired fasting glucose, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high C-reactive protein). The main exposure variable LFMR was divided into tertiles. A generalized linear model was used with log link and robust variance Poisson family to calculate crude (cPR) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
Results: A total of 959 adults aged 30 years or older were included in the analysis (53% females). The prevalence of CA was 50.9%. Females aged 30 - 44 years old showed statistically significant inverse associations for the middle (aPR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.78) and highest (aPR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.35) LFMR categories. Similar trends were seen for females aged 45 - 59 years and ≥ 60 years, and males aged 30 - 44 years, while for males aged 45 - 59 years, only the middle LFMR category was associated. No statistically significant association between LFMR and CA was found among old males.
Conclusions: LFMR was negatively associated with CA, among the Peruvian adult population. These findings underscore the relevance of LFMR in understanding cardiometabolic health disparities.","We are grateful to “CRONICAS Centro de Excelencia en Enfermedades Cronicas” for generously sharing the resources of the PERU MIGRANT study database with the public, and to Walter Suárez-Carmona for his comments during revising of this manuscript.",There was no specific funding source to be mentioned.,Journal of Clinical Medicine Research,,,,2024-03-16,2024,2024-03-16,2024-03,16,2-3,81-93,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valencia, Jamee Guerra; Castillo-Paredes, Antonio; Gibaja-Arce, Carolina; Saavedra-Garcia, Lorena; Barengo, Noel C.","Valencia, Jamee Guerra (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Castillo-Paredes, Antonio (Grupo AFySE, Investigacion en Actividad Fisica y Salud Escolar, Escuela de Pedagogia en Educacion Fisica, Facultad de Educacion, Universidad de Las Americas, Santiago 8370040, Chile); Gibaja-Arce, Carolina (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima 15067, Peru); Saavedra-Garcia, Lorena (Grupo de Investigacion en Nutricion Funcional, Carrera de Nutricion y Dietetica, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima 15024, Peru); Barengo, Noel C.

The most suitable way to characterize the vibrations is to use the daily vibration exposure A (8) and Vibration Dose Value as specified in Directive 2002/44/EC. Therefore, based on the existing literature, we propose Probit equations that allow us to relate the population percentage affected by the vibration effects (low-back pain, sciatica, and herniated disc) with the A (8) and the Vibration Dose Value. It is worth noting that there is a good correlation between the experimental data and the expressions obtained, especially for low-back pain and herniated discs. Once the expressions have been validated, we analyze the limit values given in the aforementioned legislation, showing that the percentage of the affected population is significant for them. Therefore, this study also proposes new limits based on their own definitions, which are more in line with the results shown in the bibliography.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, knowledge about copper resistant microbes in deep sea hydrothermal vents is still limited.
Methods: The copper-resistant bacteria were isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples and conducted thorough physical, phylogenetic, and genomic analyses to elucidate their copper resistance capability and related genes.
Results: Twelve highly copper-resistant bacteria (up to 6-10 mM) were isolated from deep sea hydrothermal fields They were affiliated with the Pseudoalteromonas (4), Marinobacter (3), Halomonas (2), Psychrobacter (1), and Pseudomonas (1) genus in the α-Proteobacteria, and the Sphingomonas (1) genus in the β-Proteobacteria. The presence of copper in the medium obviously induced the amount of polysaccharides and proteins in the crude extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by Halomonas sp. CuT 3-1, Pseudoalteromonas sp. CuT 4-3 and Marinobacter metalliresistant CuT 6, which could absorb 40 to 50 mg•g-1 copper. We further described a novel species, Marinobacter metalliresistant sp. nov. CuT 6T, which exhibited a higher copper resistance and encoded more heavy metal resistance-related genes than other Marinobacter species.
Discussion: It revealed that the copper resistance capability exhibited by these strains in hydrothermal fields is likely attributed to the production of exopolymeric substances, such as polysaccharides and proteins, as well as active transport or efflux mechanisms for heavy metals.",The authors are very grateful to the whole team of the oceanic cruises of COMRA DY65 via the R/V ‘Dayang hao’ for helping them collect the samples from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields.,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Their dispersion has important scientific, environmental, health, and economic implications. They can be dispersed through the air by the aerosolization of near surfaces or transported from distant sources. Here, we tested the contribution of local (scale of meters) versus regional (kilometers) sources by analyzing an airborne fungal community by ITS sequencing around a copper mine in the North of Chile. The mine was the regional source, whereas the soil and vegetal detritus were the local sources at each point. The airborne community was highly homogeneous at ca. 2000 km2, impeding the detection of regional or local contributions. Ascomycota was the dominant phylum in the three communities. Soil and vegetal detritus communities had lower alpha diversity, but some taxa had abundance patterns related to the distance from the mine and altitude. On the contrary, the air was compositionally even and unrelated to environmental or spatial factors, except for altitude. The presence of plant pathogens in the air suggests that other distant sources contribute to this region's airborne fungal community and reinforces the complexity of tracking the sources of air microbial communities in a real world where several natural and human activities coexist.",,"This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID, Chile) by grants FONDECYT iniciación 11190256, FONDECYT Iniciación 11200319, FONDEQUIP EQM200125, and doctoral fellowship 21201778.",Microorganisms,,,,2024-05-04,2024,2024-05-04,,12,5,934,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fuentes-Alburquenque, Sebastián; Suez, Victoria Olivencia; Aguilera, Omayra; Águila, Blanca; Araya, Luis Rojas; Mandakovic, Dinka","Fuentes-Alburquenque, Sebastián (Centro de Investigación en Recursos Naturales y Sustentabilidad, Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria, Facultad de Ciencias Médicas, Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Santiago 8370993, Chile;, omayra.daniela86@gmail.com; Departamento de Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Ingeniería, Escuela de Ingeniaría Civil, Facultad de Ingeniería Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Santiago 8370993, Chile); Suez, Victoria Olivencia (Escuela de Biotecnología, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Huechuraba 8580745, Chile;, victoria.olivencia@mayor.cl); Aguilera, Omayra (Centro de Investigación en Recursos Naturales y Sustentabilidad, Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria, Facultad de Ciencias Médicas, Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Santiago 8370993, Chile;, omayra.daniela86@gmail.com); Águila, Blanca (Programa de Doctorado en Microbiología, Universidad de Chile, Ñuñoa 7800003, Chile;, b.aguila.llanquilef@gmail.com; Fundación Ciencia y Vida, Huechuraba 8580704, Chile); Araya, Luis Rojas (Departamento de Química, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile;, l.rojas@ucn.cl); Mandakovic, Dinka (GEMA Genómica, Ecología y Medio Ambiente, Universidad Mayor, Huechuraba 8580745, Chile;, dinka.mandakovic@umayor.cl)","Fuentes-Alburquenque, Sebastián (Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins)","Fuentes-Alburquenque, Sebastián (Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins); Suez, Victoria Olivencia (Universidad Mayor); Aguilera, Omayra (Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins); Águila, Blanca (University of Chile; Fundación Ciencia and Vida); Araya, Luis Rojas (Catholic University of the North); Mandakovic, Dinka (Universidad Mayor)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/5/934/pdf?version=1714815276,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171415210,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3107 Microbiology,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Crops in Peru,"Cannabis is a plant that is cultivated worldwide, and its use is internationally regulated, but some countries have been regulating its medicinal, social, and industrial uses. This plant must have arrived in Peru during the Spanish conquest and remains widely cultivated illicitly or informally to this day. However, new regulations are currently being proposed to allow its legal commercialization for medicinal purposes. Cannabis contains specific metabolites known as cannabinoids, some of which have clinically demonstrated therapeutic effects. It is now possible to quantitatively measure the presence of these cannabinoids in dried inflorescences, thus allowing for description of the chemical profile or ""chemotype"" of cannabinoids in each sample. This study analyzed the chemotypes of eight samples of dried inflorescences from cannabis cultivars in four different regions of Peru, and based on the significant variation in the cannabinoid profiles, we suggest their therapeutic potential. The most important medical areas in which they could be used include the following: they can help manage chronic pain, they have antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, and antipruritic properties, are beneficial in treating duodenal ulcers, can be used in bronchodilators, in muscle relaxants, and in treating refractory epilepsy, have anxiolytic properties, reduce sebum, are effective on Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are proapoptotic in breast cancer, can be used to treat addiction and psychosis, and are effective on MRSA, in controlling psoriasis, and in treating glioblastoma, according to the properties of their concentrations of cannabidiol, cannabigerol, and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, as reviewed in the literature. On the other hand, having obtained concentrations of THC, we were able to suggest the psychotropic capacity of said samples, one of which even fits within the legal category of ""non-psychoactive cannabis"" according to Peruvian regulations.","We thank all the crop owners for providing us with access to samples for collection.

Oral bacterial infections are common in diabetic patients; however, due to the development of resistance, treatment options are limited. Considering the excellent antimicrobial properties of phenolic compounds, we investigated them against isolated oral pathogens using in silico and in vitro models. We performed antibiogram studies and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), antibiofilm, and antiquorum sensing activities covering phenolic compounds. Bacterial strains were isolated from female diabetic patients and identified by using 16S rRNA sequencing as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus chungangensis, Bacillus paramycoides, and Paenibacillus dendritiformis. Antibiogram studies confirmed that all strains were resistant to most tested antibiotics except imipenem and ciprofloxacin. Molecular docking analysis revealed the significant interaction of rutin, quercetin, gallic acid, and catechin with transcription regulator genes 1RO5, 4B2O, and 5OE3. All tested molecules followed drug-likeness rules except rutin. The MIC values of the tested compounds varied from 0.0625 to 0.5 mg/mL against clinical isolates. Significant antibiofilm activity was recorded in the case of catechin (73.5% ± 1.6% inhibition against B. paramycoides), cinnamic acid (80.9% ± 1.1% inhibition against P. aeruginosa), and vanillic acid and quercetin (65.5% ± 1.7% and 87.4% ± 1.4% inhibition, respectively, against B. chungangensis) at 0.25-0.125 mg/mL. None of the phenolic compounds presented antiquorum sensing activity. It was, therefore, concluded that polyphenolic compounds may have the potential to be used against oral bacterial biofilms, and further detailed mechanistic investigations should be performed.",,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Thus, the occurrence of ARB in the intestinal contents of pelagic and demersal wild fishes captured in anthropogenic-impacted Coquimbo Bay in Chile was studied. Culturable counts of total and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria were determined by a spread plate method using Trypticase soy agar and R2A media, both alone and supplemented with the antimicrobials amoxicillin, streptomycin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Heterotrophic plate counts of pelagic and demersal fishes ranged from 1.72 × 106 CFU g-1 to 3.62 × 109 CFU g-1, showing variable proportions of antimicrobial resistance. Representative antimicrobial-resistant isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and isolates (74) from pelagic fishes mainly belonged to Pseudomonas (50.0%) and Shewanella (17.6%) genera, whereas isolates (68) from demersal fishes mainly belonged to Vibrio (33.8%) and Pseudomonas (26.5%) genera. Antimicrobial-resistant isolates were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials by an agar disk diffusion method, showing highest resistance to streptomycin (85.2%) and amoxicillin (64.8%), and lowest resistance to oxytetracycline (23.2%) and ciprofloxacin (0.7%). Only furazolidone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were statistically different (p < 0.05) in comparisons between isolates from pelagic and demersal wild fishes. Furthermore, an important number of these isolates carried plasmids (53.5%) and produced Extended-Spectrum-β-lactamases (ESBL) (16.9%), whereas the detection of Metallo-β-Lactamases and class 1-integron was rare.

However, to date, only a few genetic data are available, which limits exploring its genetic diversity and developing new genetic studies for its improvement. We report the poro-poro plastid genome to expand the knowledge of its molecular markers, evolutionary studies, molecular pathways, and conservation genetics. The complete chloroplast (cp) genome is 163,451 bp in length with a typical quadripartite structure, containing a large single-copy region of 85,525 bp and a small single-copy region of 13,518 bp, separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions (IR) of 32,204 bp, and the overall GC content was 36.87%. This cp genome contains 128 genes (110 genes were unique and 18 genes were found duplicated in each IR region), including 84 protein-coding genes, 36 transfer RNA-coding genes, eight ribosomal RNA-coding genes, and 13 genes with introns (11 genes with one intron and two genes with two introns). The inverted repeat region boundaries among species were similar in organization, gene order, and content, with a few revisions. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed based on single-copy orthologous genes and maximum likelihood analysis demonstrates poro-poro is most closely related to Passiflora menispermifolia and Passiflora oerstedii. In summary, our study constitutes a valuable resource for studying molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and domestication. It also provides a powerful foundation for conservation genetics research and plant breeding programs. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the plastid genome of Passiflora tripartita var. mollissima from Peru.","We thank the Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN) for funding the APC.

Current research indicates that EFEHs are closely associated with Tribo-Electric Nano-Generators (TENGs). However, the performance of TENGs in energized environments remains unclear. This work aims to evaluate the performance of TENGs in electric-field energy harvesting applications. For this purpose, TENGs of different sizes, operating in single-electrode mode were conceptualized, assembled, and experimentally tested. Each TENG was mounted on a 1.5 HP single-phase induction motor, operating at nominal parameters of 8 A, 230 V, and 50 Hz. In addition, the contact layer was mounted on a linear motor to control kinematic stimuli. The TENGs successfully induced electric fields and provided satisfactory performance to collect electrostatic charges in fairly variable electric fields. Experimental findings disclosed an approximate increase in energy collection ranging from 1.51% to 10.49% when utilizing TENGs compared to simple EFEHs. The observed correlation between power density and electric field highlights TENGs as a more efficient energy source in electrified environments compared to EFEHs, thereby contributing to the ongoing research objectives of the authors.",,"This work has been supported by ANID under grant Fondecyt Iniciación 11241171, 11240105 and 11230962.

Más del 90 % de las personas que reciben un diagnóstico de cáncer de mama son no metastásicos. La quimioterapia reduce la tasa de mortalidad hasta un 40 %, pero también causa efectos físicos, psicológicos, sexuales y sociales. Por lo tanto, el objetivo fue identificar los cambios en la función sexual causados por la quimioterapia en pacientes con cáncer de mama no metastásico. La quimioterapia incluye cuatro grupos de fármacos: antraciclinas, alquilantes, antimetabolitos y taxanos. Estos provocan la isquemia local y el agotamiento de los folículos primordiales, lo que resulta en una menopausia temprana y cambios fisiológicos que afectan la función física, sexual y psicológica. Se llevó a cabo una revisión de la bibliografía utilizando índices o bases de datos como PubMed, SciELO, Elsevier, así como las revistas The Lancet y Nature. Se incluyeron artículos originales y revisados en inglés y español que se publicaron entre 2019 y 2023.

Non-metastatic breast cancer does not spread from the initial site. More than 90 % of people diagnosed with breast cancer are non-metastatic. Chemotherapy reduces the mortality rate by up to 40 %, but it also causes physical, psychological, sexual and social effects. Therefore, we aimed to identify changes in sexual function caused by chemotherapy in patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. Chemotherapy includes four groups of drugs: anthracyclines, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and taxanes. These cause local ischemia and depletion of primordial follicles, resulting in early menopause and physiological changes that affect physical, sexual and psychological function.

Initially this normative concession was recognized as a fundamental right due to its connection with the rights to human dignity, life and the free development of personality. The progressive development of jurisprudence has made it possible to understand that the right to a dignified death is a complex and autonomous fundamental right that can be translated into a subjective right. It is a complex right because it depends on very particular circumstances for its configuration and involves criminal elements that distort or reinforce its guarantee. It is an autonomous right insofar as its violation is not conditioned to the transgression of other constitutional rights and although it is related to the right to life, dignity, autonomy, health and other rights, it retains its independence as a fundamental constitutional guarantee.",,,Revista Derecho del Estado,,,,2024-04-29,2024,2024-04-29,,,59,35-64,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aicardo Vergara, Santiago; Restrepo, John Fernando","Aicardo Vergara, Santiago (); Restrepo, John Fernando ()",,"Aicardo Vergara, Santiago (); Restrepo, John Fernando ()",0,0,,,https://revistas.uexternado.edu.co/index.php/derest/article/download/9390/15839,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171196634,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Abstract The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge of palliative care among medical students at three institutions in northern Minas Gerais. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study carried out with 320 students from the 1st, 6th and 11th terms, using a survey instrument on philosophy, pain, dyspnea, psychiatric problems, gastric problems and communication. The results were evaluated by the mean percentage of correct answers, with unsatisfactory answers being up to 50%, acceptable between 51% and 70%, desirable between 71% and 80%, and excellent above 80%. The number of correct answers grew as the terms progressed, but with unsatisfactory or acceptable means. Although the students in the 11th term had completed all of the course’s theory, their mean scores were inadequate. These results highlight the need to implement the provisions of CNE/CES Resolution 3/2022 of the National Education Council in undergraduate medical courses to encourage assertive behavior in palliative care.

However, some challenges and opportunities exist to overcome, such as the lack of data on emerging destinations wishing to adopt these solutions. This manuscript presents a literature review of the current trends in RS applied to the tourism industry, including categories associated with their use and emerging techniques. Likewise, it presents a pathway for implementing an RS when insufficient data are available for a destination. The SLR followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and used the WoS, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. The results show that the hybrid RS integrates deep learning algorithms, data analytics, and optimisation techniques with collaborative tourism features to provide innovative solutions in terms of performance, accuracy, and personalisation of recommendations, thus achieving the management of tourist destinations or tourism-oriented services. Emerging destinations that lack RS data in tourism should use various data sources generated by tourists on social media, tourism portals, and through their interaction with tour operators. New tourism recommender system solutions can emerge following trends integrating new technologies based on user experience, collaboration, and the integration of multiple data sources.",,"The authors thank the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MinCiencias-Colombia) for awarding a grant in 2021 within the framework of the Bicentennial Doctoral Excellence Scholarship Program.

We assessed spatial genetic structure, signals of local adaptation, and population assignment of M. chilensis analyzing 5963 SNPs from 125 individuals across six natural populations sampled over two consecutive years along the southeast Pacific coast (39° 25′ to 43° 07′ S, ~ 430 km). Neutral and putatively adaptive loci revealed high genetic diversity and low genetic differentiation among populations. Of the whole dataset, less than 1% (50) of loci were identified as putatively adaptive through multiple approaches, with only 0.1% detected in by all of them, and only two loci of them were correlated with environmental variables. No evidence of Isolation by Environment (IBE) was found, albeit a slight differentiation in the southern sampling location (Yaldad). These results suggest that the genetic structure observed is primarily shaped by neutral processes with weak signals of local adaptation. Gene-flow appears to be the main evolutionary force influencing the species’ population genetic structure. Because of the importance for the industry, the probability of correct assignment of individuals to their population of origin using allelic frequencies was evaluated. Analyses exhibited relatively low probabilities (< 50% for four out of six sites) of accurately assigning individuals to their geographic origin, with a limited success of SNP markers the for such purposes. Likely, species' high dispersal capacity, seed translocation, and the spill-over effect of mussel aquaculture prevents population genetic differentiation through high effective gene flow, hindering local genetic adaptation.","Authors acknowledge Natalia Muñoz, Francisca Gálvez, Daniel Aliste, Paulina Gyorgy and particularly Raúl Vera for their valuable contributions in the field, sample processing and DNA extractions and other laboratory procedures.

Advances in hardware permit the massification of accessibility to and applications of parallel computing. Nonetheless, some algorithms include steps that require or depend on the results of other steps that cannot be parallelized. Speculative computing allows parallelizing those tasks and reviewing different execution flows, which can involve executing invalid steps. Speculative computing solutions should reduce those invalid flows. Product configuration refers to selecting features from a set of available options respecting some configuration constraints; a not complex task for small configurations and models, but a complex one for large-scale scenarios. This article exemplifies a videogame product line feature model and a few configurations, valid and non-valid, respectively. Configuring products of large-scale feature models is a complex and time-demanding task requiring algorithmic solutions. Hence, parallel solutions are highly desired to assist the feature model product configuration tasks. Existing solutions follow a sequential computing approach and include steps that depend on others that cannot be parallelized at all, where the speculative computing approach is necessary. This article describes traditional sequential solutions for conflict detection and diagnosis, two relevant tasks in the automated analysis of feature models, and how to define their speculative parallel version, highlighting their computing improvements. Given the current parallel computing world, we remark on the advantages and current applicability of speculative computing for producing faster algorithmic solutions.","We acknowledge that our current institution permits us to work as a research team regardless of location, thanks to online meetings.

1066,pub.1173352332,10.3390/rs16132357,,,Observation and Projection of Marine Heatwaves in the Caribbean Sea from CMIP6 Models,"In recent decades, climate change has led to ocean warming, causing more frequent extreme events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs), which have been understudied in the Caribbean Sea. This study addresses this gap using 30 years of daily sea surface temperature (SST) data, complemented by projections for the 21st century from nineteen Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. In the 1983–2012 period, significant trends were observed in the spatially averaged MHWs frequency (1.32 annual events per decade and node) and mean duration (1.47 ± 0.29 days per decade) but not in mean intensity. In addition, MHWs show large monthly variations in these metrics, modulated by interannual and seasonal changes. MHWs seasonality is different in the three used metrics, being more intense and frequent in warm and rainy months (intensity between 1.01 to 1.11 °C, duration 6.79 to 7.13 days) and longer lasting in late boreal winter (intensity between 0.82 to 1.00 °C, duration 7.50 to 8.31 days). The MHWs behavior from two extreme months show that these events can occur in both small and large areas in the Caribbean. Overall, models tend to underestimate the annually averaged MHWs frequency and intensity, while they overestimate duration when compared to observations. MHWs projections are more extreme under SSP585, as they are sensible to the radiational scenario. However, an increase in MHWs intensity and duration (events lasting as much as 154 days by 2100) is expected, driving a decrease in frequency (–37.39 events per decade under SSP585 by 2100). These projections imply that MHWs conditions at the beginning of the century will be nearly permanent in the Caribbean’s future. Nonetheless, caution is advised in interpreting these projections due to differences between models’ simulations and observed data. While advancements in oceanic models within CMIP6 demonstrate progress compared to previous CMIP initiatives, challenges persist in accurately simulating extreme events such as marine heatwaves.",We acknowledge the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) launched by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) for CMIP6 data.,This research received no external funding.,Remote Sensing,,,,2024-06-27,2024,2024-06-27,,16,13,2357,All OA; Gold,Article,"Usta, David Francisco Bustos; Parra, Rafael Ricardo Torres; Rodríguez-López, Lien; Alvarez, Maibelin Castillo; Bourrel, Luc","Usta, David Francisco Bustos (Facultad de Oceanografía, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción 4030000, Chile;, mcastilloa@udec.cl); Parra, Rafael Ricardo Torres (Grupo de Investigación en Geociencias GEO4, Departamento de Física y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 25260, Colombia;, rrtorres@uninorte.edu.co); Rodríguez-López, Lien (Facultad de Ingeniería, Arquitectura y Diseño, Universidad San Sebastián, Lientur 1457, Concepción 4030000, Chile;, lien.rodriguez@uss.cl); Alvarez, Maibelin Castillo (Facultad de Oceanografía, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción 4030000, Chile;, mcastilloa@udec.cl); Bourrel, Luc (Géosciences Environnement Toulouse, UMR 5563, Université de Toulouse, CNRS-IRD-OMP-CNES, 31000 Toulouse, France;, luc.bourrel@ird.fr)","Usta, David Francisco Bustos (University of Concepción)","Usta, David Francisco Bustos (University of Concepción); Parra, Rafael Ricardo Torres (Universidad del Norte); Rodríguez-López, Lien (San Sebastián University); Alvarez, Maibelin Castillo (University of Concepción); Bourrel, Luc (Géosciences Environnement Toulouse)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/13/2357/pdf?version=1719495326,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173352332,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 3702 Climate Change Science; 3708 Oceanography,13 Climate Action

In this study, the biological activity of peptides from mucus of Seriola lalandi and Seriolella violacea were identified and characterized. To this purpose, peptide extraction was carried out from epidermal mucus samples of juveniles of both species, using chromatographic strategies for purification. Then, the peptide extracts were characterized to obtain the amino acid sequence by mass spectrometry. Using bioinformatics tools for predicting antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, 12 peptides were selected that were chemically produced by simultaneous synthesis using the Fmoc-Tbu strategy. The results revealed that the synthetic peptides presented a random coil or extended secondary structure. The analysis of antimicrobial activity allowed it to be discriminated that four peptides, named by their synthesis code 5065, 5069, 5070, and 5076, had the ability to inhibit the growth of Vibrio anguillarum and affected the copepodite stage of C. rogercresseyi. On the other hand, peptides 5066, 5067, 5070, and 5077 had the highest antioxidant capacity. Finally, peptides 5067, 5069, 5070, and 5076 were the most effective for inducing respiratory burst in fish leukocytes. The analysis of association between composition and biological function revealed that the antimicrobial activity depended on the presence of basic and aromatic amino acids, while the presence of cysteine residues increased the antioxidant activity of the peptides.

Algae can grow on the exposed and non-nutrition carbonate surface, inducing and accelerating weathering of rock substrates, thus promoting soil formation. Yet the actual contribution of algae to solutional weathering intensity remains unclear. In this study, we performed weathering simulation experiment on two algae species (Klebsormidium dissectum (F.Gay) H.Ettl & G.Gärtner and Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck), which were screened from carbonated rock surfaces from a typical karst region in South China. The results showed: (1) both algae have solutional weathering effect on carbonate rock, (2) there is no difference of solutional intensity observed, yet the solutional modes are different, suggesting different ecological adaptative strategies, (3) algae on carbonate rocks have higher carbonic anhydrase activity (CAA) and secrete more extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), accelerating rock weathering. (4) The absolute dissolution amount of carbonate rock with algae participation is 3 times of that of without algae. These results indicate the significant impact of terrestrial algae on carbonate rock solutional weathering and provides quantitative evidence that terrestrial algae are pioneer species. It also contributes to our further understanding of soil formation in karst ecosystems in South China.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Therefore, it is extremely necessary to explore and monitor the genetic diversity of natural populations. In the Southeast Pacific Ocean (SEPO), specifically on the coast of Chile, the presence of the copepod Acartia tonsa has been indicated solely using morphological evidence, due to the absence of genetic information. In the present work, the genetic diversity, population structure and phylogenetic position within the genus Acartia, of populations identified morphologically as A. tonsa, was evaluated by amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and nuclear marker 18 s. Our results showed that the populations identified as A. tonsa correspond to a new monophyletic group endemic to SEPO (GMYC = 1.00; PTP = 0.95). The populations showed moderate to high genetic diversity with an incipient structuring between populations and biogeographic zones. Our results suggest that despite the homogenizing effect of the Humboldt Current, isolation by distance and contrasting environmental conditions at different geographic scales have an important influence on the genetic diversity of zooplankton in the SEPO region.","This investigation was funded by Millennium Institute of Oceanography (IMO, Grant ICN120019) and Fondecyt Grant 1210171 to C.A.V.

The center of contemporary school action is the student, a subject of interest, autonomous in his or her learning and constructor of knowledge. In this sense, what role has constructivism played in the displacement of teaching by learning and a subsequent crisis in education? This question in turn leads to the question of constructivism: what is it, a model, an approach, a current, a theory? This article outlines a conceptual approach from the perspective of Mario Carretero, Juan Delval and César Coll, who relate constructivism with Piaget, Vygotsky, Ausubel and cognitive psychology to derive a constructivist conception of teaching and learning. However, the proposal is to understand constructivism as a discursive field in which plural and dispersed discourses are precisely articulated, framed by knowledge coming from psychological theories that oppose and cross each other, in order to determine how subjects construct knowledge.

The only treatment available and recommended by the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health is serotherapy. This study evaluated the liver function of equines submitted to the immunization protocol currently used by the “Instituto Vital Brazil” to produce anti-Bothrops serum. Five equines were evaluated with Bothrops venom inoculation during three immunization cycles. Blood samples were taken for a biochemical test and a liver assessment due to the damage caused to the liver. The biochemical data that presented significant differences in all animals compared to baseline were AST, ALT, GGT, FA, GLDH and serum protein. Creatinine did not change throughout the experiment. The results obtained suggest that liver alterations may occur throughout the three immunization cycles. There is a great need for new studies aimed at broadening knowledge about venom inoculation protocols in serum producer equines and minimizing the adverse effects of immunization.
RESUMO: Acidentes ofídicos têm sido um desafio médico e veterinário. O único tratamento disponível e preconizado pela Organização Mundial da Saúde e pelo Ministério Saúde é a soroterapia. O presente estudo avaliou a função hepática dos equinos submetidos ao protocolo de imunização empregado atualmente pelo Instituto Vital Brazil para produção do soro antibotrópico. Foram avaliados cinco equinos com inoculação de veneno Botrópico durante o período de três ciclos de imunizações. Amostras de sangue foram coletadas para realização de exame bioquímico e avaliação hepática por conta das lesões causadas no fígado. Os dados bioquímicos que apresentaram diferenças significativas, em todos os animais, comparados ao tempo basal, foram AST, ALT, GGT, FA, GLDH e proteína sérica.

ABSTRACT The objective of this article is to examine technology management and innovation models aimed at developing a methodology to produce biodegradable biomaterials. The methodology isproposed based on a qualitative review of literature on practices, methods, and processes related to technology management and innovation in the development of biodegradable biomaterials from reincorporable organic waste. A search was conducted in scientific databases and academic literature, and 60 documents were selected that presented methodological components related to biotechnology and bioplastics. A matrix was used to identify relevant dimensions and characteristics for systematic practice in this industrial context. Among the findings, it is evident that not all models consider the stages after product launch, and it is necessary to document the events that generate learning to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Technology management and innovation models have become more dynamic and proactive as they have evolved and incorporated tools such as foresight and technological surveillance. The importance of integrating work in interdisciplinary and interdepartmental teams in fifth-generation models is also highlighted. It is concluded that it is feasible to extract different elements, components, and tools that may form a possible proposal for a Technology and Innovation Management Methodology that contributes to the development of biodegradable biomaterials obtained from reincorporable organic waste for the packaging and plastics industry and market.",,,Ingeniare,,,,2024-03,2024,2024-03,,31,,0-0,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quiceno, Santiago; Yepes, William Urrego; C., Juan Carlos Posada; Valencia-Arias, Alejandro","Quiceno, Santiago (); Yepes, William Urrego (); C., Juan Carlos Posada (); Valencia-Arias, Alejandro ()",,"Quiceno, Santiago (); Yepes, William Urrego (); C., Juan Carlos Posada (); Valencia-Arias, Alejandro ()",0,0,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/ingeniare/v31/0718-3305-ingeniare-31-31.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169796972,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society,

Previous studies have shown that victimization experiences impact the mental health of migrant children, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This study aims to examine the co-occurrence of multiple forms of maltreatment (polyvictimization) among migrant and Chilean children and youth and its association with depressive symptoms, addressing a research gap in Latin America.MethodsSecondary data from the National Polyvictimization Survey (NPS) conducted by the Chilean Ministry of the Interior were analyzed. Measures assessing polyvictimization and depressive symptoms were administered to a sample of 1362 participants, with equal group sizes for migrants and Chilean-born individuals. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, group comparisons, correlation analyses, and multiple regression analyses.ResultsThe study revealed marked differences in experiences of conventional crime victimization and polyvictimization between migrant and Chilean-born participants, with migrants facing slightly higher incidences. Correlational analysis indicated variable strengths of association between victimization types and depressive symptoms across groups, with Chilean-born individuals showing stronger correlations for certain victimization forms. Multiple regression analysis highlighted gender, polyvictimization, child maltreatment, internet victimization, sexual victimization, and peer/sibling victimization as significant predictors of depressive symptoms across the sample. Notably, an interaction was observed between child maltreatment and migrant status, indicating a mitigated impact of maltreatment on depressive symptoms among migrant adolescents. This suggests the potential for unique resilience or coping mechanisms in this group.ConclusionsThis study elucidates the varied victimization experiences of migrant children and youth in Chile, with a notable emphasis on the mitigating effect of migrant status on the relationship between child maltreatment and depressive symptoms. It highlights the resilience and potential adaptive strategies of migrant minors facing adversity. The findings underscore the necessity of developing support and intervention strategies that recognize the specific needs and strengths of migrant children and youth, advocating for policies that protect and empower this vulnerable demographic amidst new environmental challenges.",The authors acknowledge the Government of Chile for transferring the database.,N/A.,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,,,,2024-06-18,2024,2024-06-18,,18,1,72,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pinto-Cortez, Cristián; Marín-Gutiérrez, Mauricio; Melis-Rivera, Carlos; Contreras-Taibo, Lorena; Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo","Pinto-Cortez, Cristián (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, 18 de Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile); Marín-Gutiérrez, Mauricio (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, 18 de Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile); Melis-Rivera, Carlos (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, 18 de Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile); Contreras-Taibo, Lorena (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Diego Portales, Grajales 1898, Santiago, Chile); Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile)","Marín-Gutiérrez, Mauricio (University of Tarapacá)","Pinto-Cortez, Cristián (University of Tarapacá); Marín-Gutiérrez, Mauricio (University of Tarapacá); Melis-Rivera, Carlos (University of Tarapacá); Contreras-Taibo, Lorena (Diego Portales University); Moya-Vergara, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,https://capmh.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13034-024-00755-7,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172980641,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Although prior preclinical studies have demonstrated the cytoprotective antioxidant effects of alginate oligosaccharides (AOSs) through the Nrf2 pathway, whether such mechanisms apply to gastric diseases remains unclear. In this study, we used the GES-1 gastric cell line exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a damage model to investigate the impact of AOS on cell viability and its associated mechanisms. Our results revealed that pre-incubation with AOS for either 4 h or 24 h significantly improved the viability of GES-1 cells exposed to H2O2. In addition, AOS reduced the intracellular ROS levels, activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, with increased Nrf2 protein and mRNA expression and a significant upregulation of the target genes HO-1 and NQO1. The activation of Nrf2 was correlated with decreased Keap1 protein expression and an increased level of the autophagy protein p62/SQSTM1, suggesting the activation of Nrf2 through a noncanonical pathway. This study suggests that AOS is a potential treatment for protecting gastric epithelial cells from oxidative stress by activating the p62/SQSTM1-Keap1-Nrf2 axis and laying the foundation for future investigations about its specific therapeutic mechanisms.","We would like to thank the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Católica del Norte (Coquimbo, Chile) for use of its confocal facility (FONDEQUIP, EQM140100) and Odyssey M Imaging System (FONDEQUIP EQM220103), and thank to ANID-MILENIO (NCN2023_23, P.H).","This research was funded by FIC-R 40041173-0 (Potencial terapéutico de algas marinas de Coquimbo, Chile), and VRIDT-UCN N°035/2021 (Utilización de algas pardas con propiedades antioxidantes en Biomedicina.

DEP exposure induces various processes, including inflammation and oxidative stress, which ultimately contribute to a decline in lung function. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling is critical for lung homeostasis. The impact of DEP on cAMP signaling is largely unknown. Methods: We exposed human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells to DEP for 24-72 h and evaluated mitochondrial bioenergetics, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and the components of cAMP signaling. Mitochondrial bioenergetics was measured at 72 h to capture the potential and accumulative effects of prolonged DEP exposure on mitochondrial function. Results: DEP profoundly altered mitochondrial morphology and network integrity, reduced both basal and ATP-linked respiration as well as the glycolytic capacity of mitochondria. DEP exposure increased gene expression of oxidative stress and inflammation markers such as interleukin-8 and interleukin-6. DEP significantly affected mRNA levels of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP-1 and -2 (Epac1, Epac2), appeared to increase Epac1 protein, but left phospho-PKA levels unhanged. DEP exposure increased A-kinase anchoring protein 1, β2-adrenoceptor and prostanoid E receptor subtype 4 mRNA levels. Interestingly, DEP decreased mRNA levels of adenylyl cyclase 9 and reduced cAMP levels stimulated by forskolin (AC activator), fenoterol (β2-AR agonist) or PGE2 (EPR agonist). Discussion: Our findings suggest that DEP induces mitochondrial dysfunction, a process accompanied by oxidative stress and inflammation, and broadly dampens cAMP signaling. These epithelial responses may contribute to lung dysfunction induced by air pollution exposure.",,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

However, about 10–20% of those diagnosed with the disease are never-smokers. For Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) there are clear differences in both the clinical presentation and the tumor genomic profiles between smokers and never-smokers. For example, the Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) histological subtype in never-smokers is predominately found in young women of European, North American, and Asian descent. While the clinical presentation and tumor genomic profiles of smokers have been widely examined, never-smokers are usually underrepresented, especially those of a Latin American (LA) background. In this work, we characterize, for the first time, the difference in the genomic profiles between smokers and never-smokers LC patients from Chile.MethodsWe conduct a comparison by smoking status in the frequencies of genomic alterations (GAs) including somatic mutations and structural variants (fusions) in a total of 10 clinically relevant genes, including the eight most common actionable genes for LC (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, MET, BRAF, RET, ERBB2, and ROS1) and two established driver genes for malignancies other than LC (PIK3CA and MAP2K1). Study participants were grouped as either smokers (current and former, n = 473) or never-smokers (n = 200) according to self-report tobacco use at enrollment.ResultsOur findings indicate a higher overall GA frequency for never-smokers compared to smokers (58 vs. 45.7, p-value < 0.01) with the genes EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA displaying the highest prevalence while ERBB2, RET, and ROS1 the lowest. Never-smokers present higher frequencies in seven out of the 10 genes; however, smokers harbor a more complex genomic profile. The clearest differences between groups are seen for EGFR (15.6 vs. 21.5, p-value: < 0.01), PIK3CA (6.8 vs 9.5) and ALK (3.2 vs 7.5) in favor of never-smokers, and KRAS (16.3 vs. 11.5) and MAP2K1 (6.6 vs. 3.5) in favor of smokers. Alterations in these genes are comprised almost exclusively by somatic mutations in EGFR and mainly by fusions in ALK, and only by mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS and MAP2K1.ConclusionsWe found clear differences in the genomic landscape by smoking status in LUAD patients from Chile, with potential implications for clinical management in these limited-resource settings.","We thank the patients who consented to provide tumor material and clinical data that was used in this study.

In this study, we examined several antimicrobial peptides previously identified in salmonid mucosal secretions, with a primary focus on their potential to bind to chitin as an initial step. The binding capacity to chitin was tested, with hepcidin and piscidin showing positive results. Further assessments involving cytotoxicity in salmonid cells RTgill-W1, SHK-1, RTS-11, and RT-gut indicated that the peptides did not adversely affect cell viability. However, hemolysis assays unveiled the hemolytic capacity of piscidin at lower concentrations, leading to the selection of hepcidin for antiparasitic assays. The results demonstrated that the nauplius II stage of C. rogercresseyi exhibited higher susceptibility to hepcidin treatments, achieving a 50% reduction in parasitic involvement at 50 µM. Utilizing fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, we observed the localization of hepcidin on the surface of the parasite, inducing significant spherical protuberances along the exoskeleton of C. rogercresseyi. These findings suggest that cysteine-rich AMPs derived from fish mucosa possess the capability to alter the development of the chitin exoskeleton in copepod ectoparasites, making them therapeutic targets to combat recurrent parasitic diseases in salmon farming.",,"This research was funded by FONDECYT 1210056 (F.G., P.A.S., C.C. and C.A.Á.), FONDECYT 1231088 (P.A.S. and F.G.), FOVI 230188 (P.A.S., F.G. and C.A.Á.), FOVI 220076 (C.A.Á. and P.A.S.) from ANID-Chile.",Pharmaceutics,,Ferenc Fenyvesi,,2024-03-08,2024,2024-03-08,,16,3,378,All OA; Gold,Article,"Santana, Paula A.; Arancibia, Camila; Tamayo, Laura; Cumillaf, Juan Pablo; Roman, Tanya; Cárdenas, Constanza; Suarez, Cinthya Paillan; Álvarez, Claudio A.; Guzman, Fanny","Santana, Paula A.

It was possible to isolate a total of 46 bacteria; among them only three showed ureolytic activity: Priestia megaterium T130-1, Paenibacillus sp. T130-13 and Staphylococcus sp. T130-14. Biocement cores were made by mixing tailings with the isolated bacteria in presence of urea, resulting similar to those obtained with Sporosarcina pasteurii and Bacillus subtilis used as positive control. Indeed, XRD analysis conducted on biocement showed the presence of microcline (B. subtilis 17%; P. megaterium 11. 9%), clinochlore (S. pasteurii, 6.9%) and magnesiumhornblende (Paenibacillus sp. 17.8%; P. megaterium 14.6%); all these compounds were not initially present in the tailings soils. Moreover the presence of calcite (control 0.828%; Paenibacillus sp. 5.4%) and hematite (control 0.989%; B. subtilis 6.4%) was also significant unlike the untreated control. The development of biofilms containing abundant amount of Ca, C, and O on microscopic soil particles was evidenced by means of FE-SEM-EDX and XRD. Wind tunnel tests were carried out to investigate the resistance of biocement samples, accounted for a mass loss five holds lower than the control, i.e., the rate of wind erosion in the control corresponded to 82 g/m2h while for the biocement treated with Paenibacillus sp. it corresponded to only 16.371 g/m2h. Finally, in compression tests, the biocement samples prepared with P. megaterium (28.578 psi) and Paenibacillus sp. (28.404 psi) showed values similar to those obtained with S. pasteurii (27.102 psi), but significantly higher if compared to the control (15.427 psi), thus improving the compression resistance capacity of the samples by 85.2% and 84.1% with respect to the control. According to the results obtained, the biocement samples generated with the native strains showed improvements in the mechanical properties of the soil supporting them as potential candidates in applications for the stabilization of mining liabilities in open environments using bioaugmentation strategies with native strains isolated from the same mine tailing.","The authors thank the Dirección de Gestión de la Investigación of the Universidad de Antofagasta and MINEDUC-UA Grant n° ANT22991.

In the following work, we obtained arsenic nanoparticles (AsNPs) produced by an anaerobic bacterium from the Salar de Ascotán, in northern Chile, and evaluated their effects on the human oral squamous carcinoma cell line OECM-1. Resazurin reduction assays were carried out on these cells using 1-100 µM of AsNPs, finding a concentration-dependent reduction in cell viability that was not observed for the non-tumoral gastric mucosa-derived cell line GES-1. To establish if these effects were associated with apoptosis induction, markers like Bcl2, Bax, and cleaved caspase 3 were analyzed via Western blot, executor caspases 3/7 via luminometry, and DNA fragmentation was analyzed by TUNEL assay, using 100 µM cisplatin as a positive control. OECM-1 cells treated with AsNPs showed an induction of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, which can be explained by a significant decrease in P-Akt/Akt and P-ERK/ERK relative protein ratios, and an increase in both PTEN and p53 mRNA levels and Bit-1 relative protein levels.

Abstract Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that causes systemic inflammation and alterations in immunological tolerance. The activation of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes contributes to more than 50% of its pathogenesis. Objective: to review the role of IFN-λ in the pathogenesis of SLE. Materials and Methods: Systemic search in database; through the MeSH and DeCS keywords. The word “Lambda Interferon” was additionally included. Results: Aberrant production of type I interferon was found to contribute to the deregulation of IFN-λ, produced mainly by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This process leads to immunological stimulation by autoantibodies and an increase in IFNλR-1 in B cells, enhancing the generation of antibodies. IFN-λ3 is particularly associated with lupus nephritis, and IFN-λ generally increases MHC-I expression, enhancing the CD8+ T cell response and possibly affecting central tolerance and regulation in the thymus. Conclusion: It is highlighted that IFN-λ favors immune activation, formation of immune complexes, chronic inflammation and production of autoantibodies, linking high levels of IFN-λ3 with greater disease activity.",,,Revista Paraguaya de Reumatología,,,,2024-06-30,2024,2024-06-30,,10,1,37-45,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara Serpa, Oscar Vicente; Apraez Mazabel, Nayla; Córdoba Paredes, Juan Sebastián; Arenas Contreras, Erika Jhohanna; Lemus Arellano, Elva Rosa; Herrera Olivares, Miguel Ángel; Ruiz Pastrana, Geraldine Lucia; Grajales Marín, Vanesa Alejandra; Daza Arnedo, Rodrigo; Vázquez Jiménez, Lourdes Carolina; Rico Fontalvo, Jorge","Vergara Serpa, Oscar Vicente (); Apraez Mazabel, Nayla (); Córdoba Paredes, Juan Sebastián (); Arenas Contreras, Erika Jhohanna (); Lemus Arellano, Elva Rosa (); Herrera Olivares, Miguel Ángel (); Ruiz Pastrana, Geraldine Lucia (); Grajales Marín, Vanesa Alejandra (); Daza Arnedo, Rodrigo (); Vázquez Jiménez, Lourdes Carolina (); Rico Fontalvo, Jorge ()",,"Vergara Serpa, Oscar Vicente (); Apraez Mazabel, Nayla (); Córdoba Paredes, Juan Sebastián (); Arenas Contreras, Erika Jhohanna (); Lemus Arellano, Elva Rosa (); Herrera Olivares, Miguel Ángel (); Ruiz Pastrana, Geraldine Lucia (); Grajales Marín, Vanesa Alejandra (); Daza Arnedo, Rodrigo (); Vázquez Jiménez, Lourdes Carolina (); Rico Fontalvo, Jorge ()",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18004/rpr/2024.10.01.37,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173379815,"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Although their overall prevalence is around 0.77%, FASD remains underdiagnosed and little known, partly due to the complexity of their diagnosis, which shares some symptoms with other pathologies such as autism spectrum, depression or hyperactivity disorders.
Methods: This study included 73 control and 158 patients diagnosed with FASD. Variables selected were based on IOM classification from 2016, including sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis test for quantitative factors, Chi-square test for qualitative variables, and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predictions.
Results: This study explores the application ML in diagnosing FASD and its subtypes: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), and Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). ML constructed a profile for FASD based on socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological data from children with FASD compared to a control group. Random Forest (RF) model was the most efficient for predicting FASD, achieving the highest metrics in accuracy (0.92), precision (0.96), sensitivity (0.92), F1 Score (0.94), specificity (0.92), and AUC (0.92). For FAS, XGBoost model obtained the highest accuracy (0.94), precision (0.91), sensitivity (0.91), F1 Score (0.91), specificity (0.96), and AUC (0.93). In the case of pFAS, RF model showed its effectiveness, with high levels of accuracy (0.90), precision (0.86), sensitivity (0.96), F1 Score (0.91), specificity (0.83), and AUC (0.90). For ARND, RF model obtained the best levels of accuracy (0.87), precision (0.76), sensitivity (0.93), F1 Score (0.84), specificity (0.83), and AUC (0.88). Our study identified key variables for efficient FASD screening, including traditional clinical characteristics like maternal alcohol consumption, lip-philtrum, microcephaly, height and weight impairment, as well as neuropsychological variables such as the Working Memory Index (WMI), aggressive behavior, IQ, somatic complaints, and depressive problems.
Discussion: Our findings emphasize the importance of ML analyses for early diagnoses of FASD, allowing a better understanding of FASD subtypes to potentially improve clinical practice and avoid misdiagnosis.","The authors acknowledge Visual TEAF, who contributed to patient recruitment and made this research possible.","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

966,pub.1173413319,10.5209/rced.85790,,,Influencia de las redes sociales ante el consumo responsable en docentes de Educación Primaria,"Currently, consumption is the main gratification of citizens, resorting to the incessant acquisition of new stimuli and experiences. This reality is increased by the use of social networks, platforms that find their main source of funding in advertising and digital marketing. Faced with this socio-economic model, the figure of teachers emerges with relevance, as role models and those responsible for the education of future generations. For this reason, the aim of this research is to explore the use of social networks and the consumption habits of teachers in the last cycle of Primary Education, as well as their repercussions on classroom activities. For this purpose, a Focus Group was carried out with six teachers from Cantabria (España). The results point to a contradictory situation where the participants, despite not considering sustainability as one of their main consumption criteria and giving in to some of the strategies employed by social networks, do pay attention to its promotion in the classroom on a regular basis. In view of this controversy, the need to make teachers aware of the importance of responsible consumption in the current context is highlighted, so that its development becomes naturalised and, therefore, its transfer to the classroom with the youngest children.",,,Revista Complutense de Educación,,,,2024-07-01,2024,2024-07-01,,35,3,437-448,All OA; Gold,Article,"Díaz-Herrera, Laura; Salcines-Talledo, Irina; González-Fernández, Natalia","Díaz-Herrera, Laura (Ayuntamiento de Alfoz de Lloredo); Salcines-Talledo, Irina (Universidad de Cantabria); González-Fernández, Natalia (Universidad de Cantabria)",,"Díaz-Herrera, Laura (Ayuntamiento de Alfoz de Lloredo); Salcines-Talledo, Irina (University of Cantabria); González-Fernández, Natalia (University of Cantabria)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5209/rced.85790,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173413319,"39 Education; 3903 Education Systems; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",4 Quality Education

At Los Tubos beach in Algarrobo Bay along the central Chilean coast, there have been blooms of these algae that persist almost year-round over the past 20 years, leading to environmental, economic, and social issues that affect the local government and communities. The objective of this study was to characterize the species that form these green tides based on a combination of ecological, morpho-anatomical, and molecular information. For this purpose, seasonal surveys of beached algal fronds were conducted between 2021 and 2022. Subsequently, the sampled algae were analyzed morphologically and phylogenetically using the molecular markers ITS1 and tufA, allowing for the identification of at least five taxa. Of these five taxa, three (U. stenophylloides, U. uncialis, U. australis) have laminar, foliose, and distromatic morphology, while the other two (U. compressa, U. aragoensis) have tubular, filamentous, and monostromatic fronds. Intertidal surveys showed that U. stenophylloides showed the highest relative coverage throughout the seasons and all intertidal levels, followed by U. uncialis. Therefore, we can establish that the green tides on the coast of Algarrobo in Chile are multispecific, with differences in relative abundance during different seasons and across the intertidal zone, opening opportunities for diverse future studies, ranging from ecology to algal biotechnology.",,"We are thankful for the support provided by ANID Millennium Science Initiative Program Coastal Social Ecological Millennium Institute, SECOS ICN 2019_015, ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002, CNRS International Research Network Diversity and Biotechnology of Marine Algae (contract number 00022), and ANID grant FB210021 to COPAS-Coastal.",Plants,,,,2024-04-30,2024,2024-04-30,,13,9,1258,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mutizabal-Aros, Javiera; Ramírez, María Eliana; Haye, Pilar A.; Meynard, Andrés; Pinilla-Rojas, Benjamín; Núñez, Alejandra; Latorre-Padilla, Nicolás; Search, Francesca V.; Tapia, Fabian J.; Saldías, Gonzalo S.; Navarrete, Sergio A.; Contreras-Porcia, Loretto","Mutizabal-Aros, Javiera (Departamento de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago 8370251, Chile;, jaavimuti@gmail.com, (J.M.-A.);, mramirezcasali@gmail.com, (M.E.R.);, meynardster@gmail.com, (A.M.);, benjamin.pinilla.rojas11@gmail.com, (B.P.-R.);, gnunez.alejandra@gmail.com, (A.N.); Centro de Investigación Marina Quintay (CIMARQ), Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Quintay 2531015, Chile; Instituto Milenio en Socio-Ecología Costera (SECOS), Santiago 8370251, Chile;, phaye@ucn.cl, (P.A.H.);, nlatorrepadilla@gmail.com, (N.L.-P.);, fran.search.t@gmail.com, (F.V.S.);, gsaldias@ubiobio.cl, (G.S.S.);, snavarrete@bio.puc.cl, (S.A.N.); Center of Applied Ecology and Sustainability (CAPES), Santiago 8331150, Chile); Ramírez, María Eliana (Departamento de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Facultad de Ciencias de la Vida, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago 8370251, Chile;, jaavimuti@gmail.com, (J.M.-A.);, mramirezcasali@gmail.com, (M.E.R.);, meynardster@gmail.com, (A.M.);, benjamin.pinilla.rojas11@gmail.com, (B.P.-R.);, gnunez.alejandra@gmail.com, (A.N.); Instituto Milenio en Socio-Ecología Costera (SECOS), Santiago 8370251, Chile;, phaye@ucn.cl, (P.A.H.);, nlatorrepadilla@gmail.com, (N.L.-P.);, fran.search.t@gmail.com, (F.V.S.);, gsaldias@ubiobio.cl, (G.S.S.);, snavarrete@bio.puc.cl, (S.A.N.)); Haye, Pilar A.

East Asian herbal medicines (EAHMs) have been traditionally used in Asian countries, but their efficacy and safety require systematic evaluation. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EAHM for treating menopausal insomnia. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 10 electronic databases from inception until 19 July 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating EAHM for menopausal insomnia were included. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep architecture. Secondary outcomes included total effective rate (TER), menopausal symptoms, and adverse effects. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, and the results were calculated as mean differences (MDs) or risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Also, the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results: A total of 70 RCTs involving 6,035 participants met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently used EAHMs were modified Suan Zao Ren Tang, and the most frequently used herbal component was Zizyphus jujuba Miller var. spinosa Hu ex H. F. Chou [Rhamnaceae; Zizyphi Semen]. Compared with sedative-hypnotics, EAHM significantly improved sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (MD -2.18, 95% CI -2.56 to -1.80), and reduced menopausal symptoms, as assessed by the Kupperman Index (MD -4.92, 95% CI -6.03 to -3.80). Similar results were seen when EAHM was added to sedative-hypnotics. When EAHM was additionally used in sedative-hypnotics, similar benefits were shown for PSQI (MD -2.46, 95% CI -3.09 to -1.82) and the Kupperman Index (MD -4.64, 95% CI -5.07 to -4.21). EAHM was generally safer than sedative-hypnotics, with significantly fewer adverse reactions (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.34). However, the certainty of evidence was moderate to low. Conclusion: EAHMs, alone or with sedative-hypnotics, may be effective and safe for improving sleep quality and managing menopausal symptoms. Future studies should include diverse populations, rigorous methodologies, and explore mechanisms of action to confirm these findings.

It is also known for harboring a great biodiversity of adapted life forms. While desertification is increasing as a result of climate change and human activities, it is necessary to optimize soil and water usage, where stress-resistant crops are possible solutions. As many studies have revealed the great impact of the rhizobiome on plant growth efficiency and resistance to abiotic stress, we set up to explore the rhizospheric soils of Suaeda foliosa and Distichlis spicata desert plants. By culturing these soils and using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we address community taxonomy composition dynamics, stability through time, and the ability to promote lettuce plant growth. The rhizospheric soil communities were dominated by the families Pseudomonadaceae, Bacillaceae, and Planococcaceae for S. foliosa and Porphyromonadaceae and Haloferacaceae for D. spicata. Nonetheless, the cultures were completely dominated by the Enterobacteriaceae family (up to 98%). Effectively, lettuce plants supplemented with the cultures showed greater size and biomass accumulation. We identified 12 candidates that could be responsible for these outcomes, of which 5 (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Paenisporosarcina, and Ammoniphilus) were part of the built co-occurrence network. We aim to contribute to the efforts to characterize the microbial communities as key for the plant's survival in extreme environments and as a possible source of consortia with plant growth promotion traits aimed at agricultural applications.IMPORTANCEThe current scenario of climate change and desertification represents a series of incoming challenges for all living organisms. As the human population grows rapidly, so does the rising demand for food and natural resources; thus, it is necessary to make agriculture more efficient by optimizing soil and water usage, thus ensuring future food supplies. Particularly, the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) is considered the most arid place on Earth as a consequence of geological and climatic characteristics, such as the naturally low precipitation patterns and high temperatures, which makes it an ideal place to carry out research that seeks to aid agriculture in future conditions that are predicted to resemble these scenarios. Our main interest lies in utilizing microorganism consortia from plants thriving under extreme conditions, aiming to promote plant growth, improve crops, and render ""unsuitable"" soils farmable.","This research was sponsored by ANID (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile) grants; 2021 Postdoctoral FONDECYT 3210156, 2022 Regular FONDECYT 1220902, and 2022 Estrategia en Sequía FSEQ210029 to J.C.-S. and F.R.; 2021 Regular FONDECYT 1210633 and 2023 Anillo ATE220007 to C.P.S.; and 2023 Postdoctoral FONDECYT 3230189 to C.P.-E.

This study, conducted in a general hospital in the highly populated area of Acapulco in the state of Guerrero on the southwestern coast of Mexico, provides a unique perspective on PHC implementation. Objetive To determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding PHC in the healthcare personnel of a secondary hospital in Mexico. Materials and methods A self-administered KAP questionnaire was used in a cross-sectional study involving 200 health-care workers at the Hospital General Renacimiento. Results The mean knowledge score was 6.58 (SD = 1.7), and 59 % of participants (n = 117) had a score above the mean, while the mean practice score was 5.96 (SD = 1.38) and 34 % of the participants (n = 68) were above the mean. The final multiple linear regression model showed that time working in the hospital and having previously been trained in PHC were significant factors for knowledge. At the same time, gender was substantial for practices, with females scoring significantly lower on this dimension. After attitude was dichotomized into positive and negative, a binary logistic regression model showed that positive attitudes were associated with taking the PHC course. Conclusions While most of the participants had positive KAP to PHC, there was a general notion that PHC only involved healthcare workers at the first level. Training in PHC is essential to improving the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare personnel.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In America, the existence of these ailments has been documented since preceramic times and recent archaeological findings in the Colombian Caribbean plains revealed a probable case of luetic disease. The present research sought to explore the behavior of treponematosis in the lower Magdalena from pre-Hispanic times to the colonial period (8th century A.D. - 17th century A.D.). In this study, 67 individuals from the archaeological sites Turbana, Samán Norte, Plan Bonito, Simití, El Salado, La Pasión and Carmen de Bolívar were systematically analyzed, following the criteria proposed by Steckel et al. (2006), Rothschild and Rothschild (1995) and Rodríguez (2005). It was found that 16.41% of the individuals analyzed were affected by gum, which is a characteristic of the presence of treponema in the tertiary stage and precisely the case with the highest affectation and with a high probability of having suffered from the disease for a long time. These results invite us to make several considerations on the diagnostic approach to venereal treponematosis, to ponder the determinants involved in the prevalence of the disease in the region over time, and to reflect on the care strategies and sexual behavior of these populations.",,,Revista de Antropología y Sociología Virajes,,,,2024-01-24,2024,2024-01-24,,26,1,61-84,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramírez-Pio, Francisco; Rodríguez-Cuenca, José Vicente; Cadena-Duarte, Bibiana","Ramírez-Pio, Francisco (Universidad Nacional de Colombia); Rodríguez-Cuenca, José Vicente (Universidad Nacional de Colombia); Cadena-Duarte, Bibiana (Universidad Nacional de Colombia)",,"Ramírez-Pio, Francisco (National University of Colombia); Rodríguez-Cuenca, José Vicente (National University of Colombia); Cadena-Duarte, Bibiana (National University of Colombia)",0,0,,,https://revistasojs.ucaldas.edu.co/index.php/virajes/article/download/8643/7034,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168233763,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology",3 Good Health and Well Being

The objective of this study was to describe resilience and coping strategies in a sample of women victims of the armed conflict and their relationship with the stages of grief experienced. The methodology used was a quantitative, descriptive, non-experimental, ex post facto approach. Twenty women victims of the armed conflict who were in different stages of grief due to the loss of their loved ones as a result of the armed conflict participated in the study. The Resilience Scale SV-RES for youth and adults by Saavedra and Villalta (2008), the Coping Strategies Inventory adapted by Cano, Rodríguez, and García (2006), and the Grief Phases Scale by Miaja and Moral (2013) were used. Results: Deficiencies in the use of coping strategies were identified in the study sample, with a higher frequency of use of non-functional strategies. Women who were in more advanced stages of grief showed the use of more functional coping strategies. No correlation between stages of grief and time since loss was identified. Conclusions: The results suggest that the process of coping and grief elaboration in the sample of women victims of the armed conflict is not related to the time elapsed since their loss, but rather to the use of personological resources.",,,Revista Criterios,,,,2024-01-30,2024,2024-01-30,,31,1,101-115,All OA; Gold,Article,"Klimenko, Olena; Hernández-Florez, Nubia; Herrera, Gloria Patricia Vergara; Aragón, Ingris Jhoana Rentería; Lozano, Tatiana Padilla","Klimenko, Olena (Institución Universitaria de Envigado); Hernández-Florez, Nubia (Universidad Metropolitana de Barranquilla); Herrera, Gloria Patricia Vergara (); Aragón, Ingris Jhoana Rentería (); Lozano, Tatiana Padilla ()",,"Klimenko, Olena (Institución Universitaria de Envigado); Hernández-Florez, Nubia (Universidad Metropolitana); Herrera, Gloria Patricia Vergara (); Aragón, Ingris Jhoana Rentería (); Lozano, Tatiana Padilla ()",0,0,,,https://revistas.umariana.edu.co/index.php/Criterios/article/download/3543/4079,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170403867,42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Surveys are conducted with 401 potential customers of ""Tenango"" handicrafts, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the nine key elements of the Canvas Model.   Findings: The findings underscore the importance of 'sales', 'distribution channels', and 'innovation' in the Canvas Model within the artisan sector, while 'key partners' emerge as less significant. These findings suggest the need to adapt the Canvas Model to the artisanal context, focusing on effective sales and distribution strategies and strengthening the unique value proposition of the crafts.   Research, Practical & Social Implications: This pioneering study provides a solid foundation for future research in the artisan sector and offers valuable insights for the development of business strategies. The findings have significant implications not only for the artisans of Tenango de Doria but also for other artisan contexts, potentially guiding the development and sustainability of micro-enterprises in various cultures and regions.   Originality/Value: The study marks a novel approach by applying a quantitative analysis to assess the Canvas Model in the artisan sector, highlighting the complexities of formulating a successful business model in this field and contributing valuable perceptions for its development and sustainability.",,,International Journal of Professional Business Review,,,,2024-01-31,2024,2024-01-31,,9,1,e04265-e04265,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cordero, Gabriela Ortiz; Mohedano, Gisela Yamin Gómez; Alonso, Maria Teresa Sarabia","Cordero, Gabriela Ortiz (); Mohedano, Gisela Yamin Gómez (); Alonso, Maria Teresa Sarabia ()",,"Cordero, Gabriela Ortiz (); Mohedano, Gisela Yamin Gómez (); Alonso, Maria Teresa Sarabia ()",0,0,,,https://www.openaccessojs.com/JBReview/article/download/4265/1676,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168500089,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context","8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Análisis de decisiones judiciales,"This study addresses the issue of the assessment of psychological expertise in cases of sexual offenses, emphasizing its relevance in judicial decision-making, given the lack of physical evidence corroborating the abuse. The primary objective is to identify the key criteria for such assessments and propose measures to optimize them. Employing a qualitative methodological design with a phenomenological approach, this research analyzed court rulings to evaluate how judges apply the assessment criteria for these expert evaluations. The findings indicate that, although psychological expertise significantly influences decisions, courts often disregard the fundamental criteria for the accreditation of the expert, the methodology employed, and the causal relationship between the crime and the psychological harm. The study presents a framework regarding the importance of appropriately applying valuation criteria that uphold the integrity of the judicial process. The conclusions highlight that, to ensure fair judgments, it is essential for judges to evaluate the foundations of psychological expertise and its applicability, suggesting the implementation of stringent standards to minimize judicial errors in cases of sexual abuse.",,,Justicia,,,,2024-09-11,2024,2024-09-11,,29,46,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lopez, José Joel Mio","Lopez, José Joel Mio (Universidad César Vallejo)",,"Lopez, José Joel Mio (Universidad César Vallejo)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.17081/just.29.46.7551,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175689223,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

Convolution neural networks, inspired by the processes of the human brain, are particularly effective in image classification. In particular, one-dimensional convolution neural networks have played a significant role in time series analysis, including thunderstorm forecasting. Unfortunately, these models face challenges when used with unbalanced datasets, where the proportion of events of interest, such as thunderstorms, is significantly lower than other phenomena. To overcome this limitation, several over-sampling and under-sampling strategies have emerged. In this paper, we propose a method for forecasting thunderstorm occurrences in the northern region of Chile using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, combined with a balanced batch generator and attention models. The algorithm developed to predict thunderstorm days achieved a performance metric of approximately 79.6%, a promising result due to the minimal failure rates observed.",,"This work was supported in part by Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María under Project PI-LIR-2022-14.

Despite these findings, there is limited conclusive evidence on the relationship between sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and burnout.ObjectiveThe current study aimed to evaluate the relationships between sleep quality symptoms, anxiety, depression, and burnout in samples of adult individuals from two Latin American countries, Peru and El Salvador, through network analysis and to identify key symptoms that reinforce the correlation and intensify the syndromes.MethodsA total of 1012 individuals from El Salvador and Peru participated, with an average age of 26.5 years (SD = 9.1). Symptom networks were constructed for both countries based on data from the Jenkins Sleep Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-2, General Anxiety Disorder-2, and a single burnout item.ResultsThe results indicated that Depressed Mood, Difficulty Falling Asleep, and Nervousness were the most central symptoms in a network in the participating countries. The strongest conditional associations were found between symptoms belonging to the same construct, which were similar in both countries. Thus, there is a relationship between Nervousness and Uncontrollable Worry, Anhedonia and Depressed Mood, and Nighttime Awakenings and Difficulty in Staying Asleep. It was observed that burnout is a bridge symptom between both countries and presents stronger conditional associations with Tiredness on Awakening, Depressed Mood, and Uncontrollable Worry. Other bridge symptoms include a Depressed Mood and Nervousness. The network structure did not differ between the participants from Peru and El Salvador.ConclusionThe networks formed by sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and burnout symptoms play a prominent role in the comorbidity of mental health problems among the general populations of Peru and El Salvador. The symptom-based analytical approach highlights the different diagnostic weights of these symptoms. Treatments or interventions should focus on identifying central and bridge symptoms.",None.,No funding was received to support the writing of this research paper.,Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica,,,,2024-07-16,2024,2024-07-16,,37,1,27,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yupanqui-Lorenzo, Daniel E.; Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Baños-Chaparro, Jonatan; Arauco-Lozada, Tania; Palao-Loayza, Luis; Rivera, Marlon Elías Lobos; Barrios, Iván; Torales, Julio","Yupanqui-Lorenzo, Daniel E.

Within the DSS model, disability is considered as a deficit, limitations in activity and restrictions in the participation of people. Objective: to present the evidence related to the association between DSS and disability. Methods: exploratory review. Articles from the years 2013 to 2021 were included, original articles with quantitative methodology that evaluated DSS and disability. Results: 42 articles met the inclusion criteria. It was found that older adults and women have greater disability. There is no significant association with disability for ethnic group and social position. People with disabilities have little schooling. They are more likely to report mental illness, more health problems, more likely to suffer from social exclusion. In addition to opportunities to access the labor market and lower working conditions compared to people without disabilities. Access to health services for people with disabilities is affected by the lack of money to attend, long waiting times and excessive paperwork.

We aimed to determine the relationship between overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and their dimensions with academic performance in young students. We used a quantitative, descriptive-correlational study with a cross-sectional design conducted among a population of students residing in the department of Caldas, Colombia. The WHOQOL-BREF scale was used to measure quality of life, and participants were asked to provide their cumulative grade point average from the previous semester or period for the evaluation of academic performance. All data were analyzed using SPSS 25, including tests for normality, measures of central tendency and dispersion, as well as Spearman correlation tests. Positive relationships were identified in most variables, with the only negative correlation observed in the social domain. Two positive and statistically significant relationships were highlighted in the environmental and psychosocial domains. The young participants reported satisfactory scores in self-perceived overall quality of life and health-related quality of life. The academic performance was 3,6 ± 0,49. There is no significant correlation between quality of life, health-related quality of life, and academic performance.

 Por ello, el objetivo de este estudio fue explorar los posibles usos de la inteligencia artificial (IA) en la comunicación política colombiana, su influencia en la polarización y su impacto en la desinformación. Así, utilizando el método Delphi en un grupo de expertos en estrategia electoral, los resultados mostraron que los expertos concuerdan en que la IA es útil para crear contenido en redes sociales y segmentar mensajes políticos.

Además, coinciden en que la comunicación algorítmica aumenta la polarización en redes sociales, pero difieren en si fomenta o reduce la participación electoral.
Computational propaganda and bots have become tools within social networks for shaping opinions. However, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has added complexity to this landscape, allowing for natural language processing and the creation of automated strategies for political communication. While AI offers potential benefits, it also raises ethical concerns and the risk of spreading misinformation. Consequently, countries like Colombia are exploring the application of AI in political campaigns while simultaneously working on regulating its use within their democratic framework. With the 2023 elections looming, the debate surrounding the ethics and impact of AI in political communication gains significant relevance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in Colombian political communication, its influence on polarization, and its role in disseminating disinformation. By employing the Delphi method with a panel of electoral strategy experts, the findings revealed a consensus among experts regarding AI's utility in creating content for social networks and segmenting political messages. However, there was disagreement regarding its suitability for generating speeches or government plans. Additionally, experts concurred that algorithmic communication exacerbates polarization on social networks but held differing opinions on whether it enhances or diminishes electoral participation.

Hence, their initial training becomes a matter of relevance for the success of creating inclusive schools. This work contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4: ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The other objectives were to delimit the competences in inclusive education for teachers and analyse the perception of future teachers in the acquisition of IE competences in the context of university classrooms and internship centres. This research was carried out with 315 students from Catalan public universities through a questionnaire to assess their perception of these competencies. The results show that competences related to leadership in educational environments, inclusive values, or the identification of the students’ abilities are being developed in internship centres. However, the university classroom context lead to the development of competences related to cooperative learning and assessment. In addition, there are significant differences between students who follow specialised teacher training in special needs and those who do not follow it. In conclusion, there is a need to extend specific training to all students and for a greater interrelationship between the training for developing competences in both contexts.",,This research did not receive any external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2024-05-11,2024,2024-05-11,,16,10,4037,All OA; Gold,Article,"Garcia-Vallès, Xènia; Martín, Mar Badia; Gavaldà, Josep Maria Sanahuja; Romero, Antonio Pérez","Garcia-Vallès, Xènia (Department of Education, Catalan Government, 08006 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain;, xgarci11@xtec.cat); Martín, Mar Badia (Department of Basics, Developmental and Educational Psychology, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain); Gavaldà, Josep Maria Sanahuja (Department of Applied Pedagogy, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain;, josep.sanahuja@uab.cat, (J.M.S.G.);, antonio.perez.romero@uab.cat, (A.P.R.)); Romero, Antonio Pérez (Department of Applied Pedagogy, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain;, josep.sanahuja@uab.cat, (J.M.S.G.);, antonio.perez.romero@uab.cat, (A.P.R.))","Martín, Mar Badia (Autonomous University of Barcelona)","Garcia-Vallès, Xènia (Government of Catalonia); Martín, Mar Badia (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Gavaldà, Josep Maria Sanahuja (Autonomous University of Barcelona); Romero, Antonio Pérez (Autonomous University of Barcelona)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/10/4037/pdf?version=1715421613,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171660930,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,4 Quality Education

An immunoconjugated for the detection of house dust mite (Dermatophagoides) allergens,"Conjugation of avian IgY antibodies to nanosensors has been extensively explored for the diagnostics of virus and parasite infection, as well as for the detection of pharmaceutically and toxicologically relevant molecules. However, to date this strategy has only been minimally applied the detection of allergens. In this study, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were conjugated to a polyvalent IgY antibodies raised against Dermatophagoides group I allergens. GNPs were synthesized by HAuCL4 reduction using 1% trisodium citrate, and characterized them by absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The most stable immunoconjugates were obtained with 18-nm monodisperse GNPs and a minimal concentration of 12.5 μg/mL of IgY at pH 7.5. The immunoconjugate was capable of detecting up to 1.5 μg of a total Dermatophagoides farinae protein extract in an immuno-dot blot assay. This immunoreactant conjugate represents a new tool for the detection and control of indoor dust mite allergens.",The authors would like to thank the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Laboratory at the Universidad Pontificia Javeriana de Colombia for its support in the standardization of IgY antibody detection techniques.

Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to analyze the spatial–temporal distribution of heavy metals in water and sediments to determine the environmental status of El Guájaro Reservoir, where such studies have not been developed. Two measurement campaigns (dry and wet period) were carried out and eight sampling stations were selected. A comparison of water and sediment quality parameters with existing national and international regulations was done. Also, heavy metal distribution maps were generated, and the geoaccumulation index was calculated to identify sources and sediments contamination level. Based on the obtained results, agriculture and mining activities are the main causes of the reservoir contamination. This metals levels could be a potential risk for the aquatic life and the populations that are supplied from this water body.","The authors thanks to Tito Crissien, General Manager of Universidad de la Costa.

However, research on the use of a mixed approach is limited. Aims: To incorporate serial concept mapping (CM) into CBL tutorials, to explore students' perspectives on the worth of the method to better understand patients' problems and elicit diagnoses, and to assess the student's learning. Methods: We designed a four-phase method of CBL that incorporated serial mapping to assist students in the process of knowledge construction regarding the underlying principles of the patients' present complaints, the recognition of disease patterns and the eliciting of diagnostic hypotheses. Students worked both individually and collaboratively. We used a questionnaire to explore the students' perspectives of the method and a score system to assess end-of-course performance. Results: The students perceived that serial CM was useful to integrate previous knowledge into new clinical information for case analysis and to elicit diagnoses. They also reported an increase in content-related knowledge. The end-of-course scores were high for most students. Conclusions: Novice medical students perceived serial CM in CBL tutorials as an effective strategy for learning.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the frequency and severity of renal complications in fatal cases associated with CHIKV infection based on the clinical and histopathological features from post-mortem tissue biopsies.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study included fatal cases associated with CHIKV infection occurring from September 2014 through October 2015, reported to National System for Public Health Surveillance (SIVIGILA) and laboratory-confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Colombia. Medical records from 13 patients were available. Information was collected on history, physical examination, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and virologic investigation reports.
RESULTS: Diagnosis of CHIKV infection was performed by positive CHIKV-PCR on post-mortem tissue in 10 cases, positive CHIKV-PCR in serum in 6 cases and anti-CHIKV virus IgM in 2 cases. Only 3 cases were children (≤5 years old). Four cases had underlying diseases, mainly systemic arterial hypertension. The median value of creatinine at admission was 2.8 mg/dL (interquartile range 1.52-4.51). During hospitalization, 9 cases required ICU admission, 8 vasopressor support and 6 mechanical ventilation. Kidney histopathological findings were mainly acute interstitial nephritis (11 cases), congestion/oedema glomerular (10 cases) and acute tubular necrosis (5 cases).
CONCLUSIONS: Renal impairment in fatal cases of CHIKV infection is frequent and related mainly to acute interstitial nephritis.

The associated neurologic and vascular damage triggers a chain of events that lead to a secondary brain injury (SBI), a preventable cause of adverse neurological outcomes. Proper prevention of these factors may limit undesirable outcomes. This article presents a concept analysis that aims to form a single definition of the term secondary brain injury for nursing personnel.
METHODOLOGY: Concept analysis was used to clarify the concept of SBI. An electronic search was performed on existing nursing literature dating from 1995 to 2016 on PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid Journal, Wiley, and ProQuest.
RESULTS: A clear definition and description of the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of SBI increases the knowledge and level of recognition of the secondary injuries. This may lead to strategies that reduce the risk of long-term effects (disability) and poor clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This concept analysis contributes to the endeavor of identifying phenomena that are pertinent for nursing; it also provides a basis for future research that leads to improving nursing interventions and creating educational programs and healthcare policies that prevent or eliminate the consequences of SBI.",,,Journal of Neuroscience Nursing,,,Adult; Brain Injuries; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroscience Nursing; Terminology as Topic,2018-08,2018,,2018-08,50,4,220-224,Closed,Article,"Ortega-Pérez, Stefany; Amaya-Rey, María Consuelo","Ortega-Pérez, Stefany (Questions or comments about this article may be directed to Stefany Ortega Pérez, PhD(c) MSc RN, at srortega&amp;commat;uninorte.edu.co .

For decades, much of Colombia was occupied by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a leftist guerrilla group that had waged war on the Colombian state since 1964. The threat of violence and kidnapping severely limited where scientists could study, and where they could go for fieldwork. That all changed with a stroke of a pen on 26 September 2016, when Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos signed a peace deal with the FARC. Guerrilla fighters shuttered their jungle camps and handed over their weapons. Now, Colombian scientists are rushing in, exploring the geology of their country, its wealth of species, and how its ecosystems are coping with stresses such as deforestation and climate change. Those forays are risky: Vast areas haven't yet been cleared of land mines, and drug traffickers, paramilitary groups, and non-FARC armed insurgents plague the countryside. But the researchers are seduced by the prospect of prying scientific secrets from huge swaths of land that are no longer off-limits.",,,Science,,,,2018-04-26,2018,2018-04-26,2018-04-27,360,6387,368-373,Closed,Article,"Wade, Lizzie","Wade, Lizzie (Triganá, Colombia.)",,"Wade, Lizzie (Triganá, Colombia.)",3,0,0.03,5.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103657640,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society","15 Life on Land; 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

However, few researchers have studied the relationship between EF and ToM in clinical populations, especially that of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention and motor hyperactivity/impulsivity, in which EF is largely impaired. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model, 201 English and Spanish articles evaluating EF and ToM in ADHD were chosen. Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria and were selected for further analysis. The first study dates from 2001. Most of the studies’ designs are cross-sectional, include mostly male children, have a small sample size, and were conducted in European countries. Unlike tasks assessing EF, tasks assessing ToM were heterogeneous across studies. The EFs most correlated with ToM were inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and attention. Interest in studying the relationship between EF and ToM in ADHD is recent,but increasing based on new findings and tuning of ToM instruments. However, while an association between EF and ToM is indicated in ADHD, the degree of prediction and predictability of one over the other cannot yet be established because of the studies’ heterogeneity.","We thank the Editor and two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

6705,pub.1100901104,,29417976,,Serum cortisol levels and neuropsychological impairments in patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between neuropsychological variables and serum cortisol levels as a measure of physiological stress in patients with fibromyalgia.
METHODOLOGY: A sample of 60 women was intentionally selected: 30 with Fibromyalgia diagnosis and 30 with normal controls. Cortisol levels were determined using two blood samples (AM and PM) and a neuropsychological and emotional battery was applied with a standardized protocol in Colombian population to evaluate different cognitive domains. Comparative and correlational non-parametric analyzes were performed, a multiple regression analysis to determine influences between variables.
RESULTS: Significant differences between the study groups in the neuropsychological variables (attention, memory, language, visual-constructive praxis and executive functions (EF), (p<0.05) were found, obtaining better scores in the control group. Significant correlations between the cortisol profile, with false acknowledgments of Rey auditory- verbal learning test, and with perseverative errors of the Wisconsin test were found. Multiple regression analysis predicts the influence of memory and EF variables on the cortisol profile in an 88.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that, in patients with FM, there are neuropsychological alterations, mainly in executive functioning (cognitive flexibility) and episodic memory (evocation and storage). Likewise, executive dysfunction is related to physiological stress reciprocally and in turn are conditioned by emotional alterations such as symptoms of depression, which supports the neurophysiological model that compromises the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the prefrontal cortex, rich in corticosteroid receptors.",,,Actas españolas de psiquiatría,,,Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fibromyalgia; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Nervous System Diseases,2018-01-01,2018,2018-01-01,2018-01,46,1,1-11,Closed,Article,"Barceló-Martinez, Ernesto; Gelves-Ospina, Melissa; Navarro Lechuga, Edgar; Allegri, Ricardo F; Orozco-Acosta, Erick; Benítez-Agudelo, Juan C; León-Jacobus, Alexandra; Román, Néstor F","Barceló-Martinez, Ernesto (MD.

However, the vascular health of metabolically obese and normal weight (MONW) individuals is not completely comprehended.ObjectivesThe purpose of our study was to evaluate vascular function on the basis of a high fat diet (HFD)-MONW rabbit model.SubjectsTwenty four male rabbits were randomly assigned to receive either a regular diet (CD, n = 12) or a high-fat diet (18% extra fat on the regular diet, HFD, n = 12) for 6 weeks.ResultsBody weight, TBARS and gluthathione serum levels were similar between the groups; fasting glucose, triglycerides, C reactive protein (CRP), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) were higher in the HFD group. Compared to CD, the HFD rabbits had glucose intolerance and lower HDL-cholesterol and plasma nitrites levels. Thoracic aortic rings from HFD rabbits exhibited: (a) a reduced acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation; (b) a greater contractile response to norepinephrine and KCl; (c) an improved angiotensin II-sensibility. The HFD-effect on acetylcholine-response was reversed by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (NS398) and the cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor (SC560), and the HFD-effect on angiotensin II was reversed by NS398 and the TP receptor blocker (SQ29538). Immunohistochemistry and western blot studies showed COX-2 expression only in arteries from HFD rabbits.ConclusionsOur study shows a positive pro-inflammatory status of HFD-induced MONW characterized by raised COX-2 expression, increase of the CRP levels, reduction of NO release and oxidative stress-controlled conditions in an early stage of metabolic alterations characteristic of metabolic syndrome. Endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular reactivity in MONW individuals may be biomarkers of early vascular injury. Therefore, the metabolic changes induced by HFD even in normal weight individuals may be associated to functional alterations of blood vessels.","This work was supported by grants from the Consejo de Investigaciones de la Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (PIUNT I521/1), Consejo de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de la República Argentina (CONICET PIP 215/14), Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino and Institutional funds from INSIBIO (Instituto Superior de Investigaciones Biológicas).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which empathy levels, as well as the reliability of the data, were measured in 640 students. The mean and standard deviation were estimated in two factors: gender and courses studied. The data were processed using bi-factorial variance analysis (modeliii), calculating the effect size, power of the test, and the possible growth potential of the empathy and of each of its components considering the gender. The level of significance was α≤.05 and β≥0.80. The SPSS 22.0 statistics program was used.
RESULTS: Differences were found between courses and gender. The differences between courses in empathy are due to values by males in specific components. The model of decline in empathy and in the component, compassionate care, is not fulfilled.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of empathy between the genders were higher in males than in females, and similar in the compassionate care component. This is not consistent with the idea that women have higher levels of empathy than the men. There are differences in the behaviour of the means depending on the course and gender, and the empathy decline model is fulfilled only in two of its components.

Multivariable logistic regressions were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for lifetime use of nine psychoactive substances, as well as high-risk/harmful alcohol use. Disadvantaged identities from three categories (ethnicity, sexual identity, gender), and interactions between these were compared.ResultsFindings indicate that participants with disadvantaged ethnic and sexual minority identities are more likely to use psychoactive substances compared to their counterparts. The intersecting identity ‘disadvantaged ethnic identity and sexual minority’ appears to be protective compared to those with just one of these identities. While female gender appears to be highly protective in general, it is not protective among females with disadvantaged social identities.ConclusionsStark disparities in substance use between different social identities and their intersections emphasise the importance of intersectionality theories in public health research intervention design.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample comprised 6628 individuals aged 35 to 70 years (mean age 50.7 years, 64.1% women) residing in the four Colombian regions.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of dyslipidemia was 87.7% and was substantially higher among participants older than 50 years, male, rural residents, and those with a lower level of education (66.8%), and with a lower income (66.4%). High non HDL-c was the most common abnormality (75.3%). The values of total cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol were higher in areas with the lowest health needs index than in the areas with intermediate and highest health need index, the isolated HDL-c value was much lower.
CONCLUSION: Colombia has a high prevalence of abnormalities of the lipid profile. The causes of the high rates of dyslipidemia were not well define in this study, but were more common in rural and poorer regions and among those with lower socio-economical status. Strategies to tackle the adverse lipid profile to reduce CVD are needed in Colombia, particularly in rural areas and among the areas with the higher health need index.","Acknowledgements The main PURE study and its components are funded by the Population Health Research Institute, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, and through unrestricted grants from several pharmaceutical companies with major contributions from AstraZeneca Canada [Canada], Sanofi-Aventis [France and Canada], Boehringer Ingelheim [Germany and Canada], Servier, and financial support of COLCIENCIAS (Grant 6566-04-18062) in Colombia.

However, primary evidence comes from high-income countries, and no specific studies have been conducted in low and middle-income countries where higher air pollution levels exist.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older Mexican adults and the associated effect modifiers.
METHODS: Data for this study were taken from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition in Mexico carried out in 2012. A total of 7986 older adults composed the analytical sample. Cognitive function was assessed using two tests: semantic verbal fluency and three-word memory. The annual concentration of PM2.5 was calculated using satellite data. Association between exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive function was estimated using two-level logistic and linear regression models.
RESULTS: In adjusted multilevel regression models, each 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM2.5 raised the odds of a poorer cognitive function using the three-word memory test (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.74), and reduced the number of valid animal named in the verbal fluency test (β = -0.72, 95% CI: -1.05, -0.40). Stratified analyses did not yield any significant modification effects of age, sex, indoor pollution, urban/rural dwelling, education, smoking and other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports an association between exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cognitive function in older adults. This is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries, which are marked by a rapid growth of their aging population and high levels of air pollution.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Environment International,,,Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cognition; Environmental Exposure; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter,2018-04-25,2018,2018-04-25,2018-08,117,,1-9,Closed,Article,"Salinas-Rodríguez, Aarón; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Manrique-Espinoza, Betty; Moreno-Banda, Grea Litai; Sosa-Ortiz, Ana Luisa; Qian, Zhengmin; Lin, Hualiang","Salinas-Rodríguez, Aarón (National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Manrique-Espinoza, Betty (National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico); Moreno-Banda, Grea Litai (National Institute of Public Health, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico); Sosa-Ortiz, Ana Luisa (Laboratory of Dementias, National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, CDMX, Mexico); Qian, Zhengmin (College for Public Health and Social Justice, Saint Louis University, St Louis, MO, USA); Lin, Hualiang (Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China)","Lin, Hualiang (Sun Yat-sen University)","Salinas-Rodríguez, Aarón (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública); Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo (Universidad del Norte); Manrique-Espinoza, Betty (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública); Moreno-Banda, Grea Litai (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública); Sosa-Ortiz, Ana Luisa (Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía); Qian, Zhengmin (Saint Louis University); Lin, Hualiang (Sun Yat-sen University)",53,20,2.34,8.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103639149,41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination; 42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

This study investigated item difficulty and construct validity of the Spanish version of the BNT to assess cultural and linguistic impact on performance.
METHODS: Subjects were 1298 healthy Spanish speaking adults from Colombia. They were administered the 60- and 15-item Spanish version of the BNT. A Rasch analysis was computed to assess dimensionality, item hierarchy, targeting, reliability, and item fit.
RESULTS: Both versions of the BNT satisfied requirements for unidimensionality. Although internal consistency was excellent for the 60-item BNT, order of difficulty did not increase consistently with item number and there were a number of items that did not fit the Rasch model. For the 15-item BNT, a total of 5 items changed position on the item hierarchy with 7 poor fitting items. Internal consistency was acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: Construct validity of the BNT remains a concern when it is administered to non-English speaking populations. Similar to previous findings, the order of item presentation did not correspond with increasing item difficulty, and both versions were inadequate at assessing high naming ability.",,,The Clinical Neuropsychologist,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colombia; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Language; Language Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Translations; Young Adult",2018-02-23,2018,2018-02-23,2018-11-30,32,sup1,29-45,Closed,Article,"Kim, Stella H.; Strutt, Adriana M.; Olabarrieta-Landa, Laiene; Lequerica, Anthony H.; Rivera, Diego; De Los Reyes Aragon, Carlos Jose; Utria, Oscar; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos","Kim, Stella H.

Measurement of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) based on HOB elevation and arterial transducer position has not been adequately studied.
METHODS: This is a planned secondary analysis of prospectively collected data in which paired, serial arterial blood pressure (ABP), intracranial pressure, and CPP measures were obtained once per day for 3 days, with measures leveled at the tragus (Tg) and the phlebostatic axis (PA). The HOB position was recorded for all paired readings.
RESULTS: From 136 subjects, ABP and CPP values were lower when the transducer was leveled at the Tg, compared with the PA (P < .001); these differences persisted regardless of HOB position.
CONCLUSION: The difference in CPP when ABP is referenced at the Tg versus PA is not consistently attributed to HOB elevation.",,,Journal of Neuroscience Nursing,,,Arterial Pressure; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Critical Care; Female; Humans; Intracranial Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Positioning; Posture,2018-12,2018,,2018-12,50,6,322-326,Closed,Article,"McNett, Molly; Livesay, Sarah; Yeager, Susan; Moran, Cristina; Supan, Erin; Ortega, Stefany; Olson, DaiWai M.","McNett, Molly (Sarah Livesay, DNP ACNP FNCS, is Associate Professor, Rush University, Chicago, IL.

A Situation‐Based Analysis of Drivers’ Perceived Likelihood of Engaging in Mobile Phone Multitasking,"This study investigated how situational characteristics typically encountered in the transport system influence drivers' perceived likelihood of engaging in mobile phone multitasking. The impacts of mobile phone tasks, perceived environmental complexity/risk, and drivers' individual differences were evaluated as relevant individual predictors within the behavioral adaptation framework. An innovative questionnaire, which includes randomized textual and visual scenarios, was administered to collect data from a sample of 447 drivers in South East Queensland-Australia (66% females; n = 296). The likelihood of engaging in a mobile phone task across various scenarios was modeled by a random parameters ordered probit model. Results indicated that drivers who are female, are frequent users of phones for texting/answering calls, have less favorable attitudes towards safety, and are highly disinhibited were more likely to report stronger intentions of engaging in mobile phone multitasking. However, more years with a valid driving license, self-efficacy toward self-regulation in demanding traffic conditions and police enforcement, texting tasks, and demanding traffic conditions were negatively related to self-reported likelihood of mobile phone multitasking. The unobserved heterogeneity warned of riskier groups among female drivers and participants who need a lot of convincing to believe that multitasking while driving is dangerous. This research concludes that behavioral adaptation theory is a robust framework explaining self-regulation of distracted drivers.","The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thorough comments.

Recent research on driving behaviour of distracted drivers suggests that in certain circumstances drivers seem to assume safer behaviours while using a mobile phone. Despite a high volume of research on this topic, self-regulation by mobile phone distracted drivers is not well understood as many driving simulator experiments are designed to impose an equal level of distraction to participants being tested for their driving performance. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between self-regulatory secondary task performance and driving. By a driving simulator experiment in which participants were allowed to perform their secondary tasks whenever they feel appropriate, the driving performance of 35 drivers aged 18-29 years was observed under three phone conditions including non-distraction (no phone use), hands-free interactions and visual-manual interactions in the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. Drivers' longitudinal and lateral vehicle control observed across various road traffic conditions were then modelled by Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) with exchangeable correlation structure accounting for heterogeneity resulting from multiple observations from the same driver. Results show that the extent of engagement in the secondary task influence both longitudinal and lateral control of vehicles. Drivers who engaged in a large number of hands-free interactions are found to select lower driving speed. In contrast, longer visual-manual interactions are found to result in higher driving speed among drivers self-regulating their secondary task. Among the road traffic conditions, drivers distracted by their self-regulated secondary tasks are found to select lower speeds along the s-curve compared to straight and motorway segments. In summary, the applied human-machine system approach suggests that road traffic demands play a vital role in both secondary task management and driving performance.","We want to acknowledge the assistance of Ms. Wanda Griffith (QUT), Mr. Adrian Wilson (QUT), and Mr. Andrew Haines (QUT) during the preparation of the experiment and data collection.

It is important to identify and rethink the strategies to approach this challenge for health care institutions from a professional perspective.
METHODS: An online survey, created with Google Forms, was sent to professional neurosurgeons in Mexico and Latin America. Participation was voluntary, and responses were anonymous and confidential. Data were captured after 1 month and subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using Fisher exact and χ2 tests.
RESULTS: There were 83 questionnaires answered by certified neurosurgeons with a response rate of 52.9%. Responses indicated that 78% of hospitals have no specific management guidelines for patients with TBI and alcohol intoxication. In 90% of cases, no triage strategies are defined for the case, and at hospital admission, there are no specific identified strategies for extraordinary surveillance of risks in these patients (P = 0.062).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm a lack of systematic strategies for management of patients with TBI and associated comorbidity of alcohol intoxication in the acute phase. It is important to define specific management guidelines to improve treatment efficacy and limit complications in patients with TBI and alcohol intoxication.","We thank Alex Rochin-Mozqueda, M.D., and J.

The preparation of 2-10 involved derivatization of the side chain of 1 at C-13. Except for 2, all derivatives are being reported for the first time. Most of the tested compounds presented IC50s below 4.0 μM, being considered potential antitumor agents. The structures of all new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including 2D NMR and HRMS. Additionally, the interaction of annonalide (1) with ctDNA was evaluated using spectroscopic techniques, and the formation of a supramolecular complex with the macromolecule was confirmed. Competition assays with fluorescent probes (Hoechst and ethidium bromide) and theoretical studies confirmed that 1 interacts preferentially via DNA intercalation with stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (1:ctDNA). The ΔG value was calculated as -28.24 kJ mol-1, and indicated that the interaction process occurs spontaneously. Docking studies revealed that van der Walls is the most important interaction in 1-DNA and EB-DNA complexes, and that both ligands (1 and EB) interact with the same DNA residues (DA6, DA17 and DT19).","The authors thank Fundação Cearense de Apoio a Pesquisa (FUNCAP), Process: PNP-0058-00137.01.00/11; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Process: 405001/2013-4; and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Alagoas (FAPEAL) (60030 000863/2016), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) (APQ-02187-17) and Sponsorships for A.O.C.V.

In effect, the DMC algorithm allows for obtaining a better quality of control than conventional controllers, especially for plants with large time delays. However, in spite of these advantages, there are still some difficulties that can appear in the implementation of DMC in local control loops. This is due to limitations of the computational resources in industrial devices (e.g., Programmable Logic Controllers). To overcome these difficulties, we propose a tuning strategy for the DMC algorithm with reduced horizons. It is shown that a reduction in the length of prediction and dynamic horizons can reduce the required memory in industrial controllers without degrading the quality of control.",This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education under grant BK-UiUA.

RECENT FINDINGS: Since 2004, CHIK, an arboviral infection, has spread throughout the world, infecting millions of people. The illness occurs in two phases: an acute viremic infection followed by chronic arthritis. In less developed countries, there are limited resources and effective treatment. For acutely ill CHIK fever patients, management is symptomatic. The treatment of chronic CHIK arthritis should be determined by an understanding of pathogenesis. Is chronic CHIK arthritis a persistent viral infection or a postinfectious inflammatory process? Multiple proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors have been identified in chronic CHIK arthritis. Attempts to isolate CHIK virus from synovial fluid have been unsuccessful. Given pathogenetic similarities (as well as differences) compared with rheumatoid arthritis and the painful, disabling nature of the arthritis, it is not surprising that disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate have begun to be used.
SUMMARY: CHIK infection has emerged with major arthritic epidemics for which evidence-based therapy is limited. But there is an opportunity to improve the treatment of chronic CHIK arthritis and, from this disease, to gain understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory arthritis more generally.",,,Current Opinion in Rheumatology,,,"Arthritis, Infectious; Chikungunya Fever; Chikungunya virus; Chronic Disease; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Humans",2018-05,2018,,2018-05,30,3,256-263,Closed,Article,"Sutaria, Ravi B; Amaral, Jose K; Schoen, Robert T","Sutaria, Ravi B (Department of Rheumatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.); Amaral, Jose K (Faculty of Medicine Estácio of Juazeiro do Norte, Juazeiro do Norte, Brazil.); Schoen, Robert T (Department of Rheumatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.)",,"Sutaria, Ravi B (Yale University); Amaral, Jose K (Faculty of Medicine Estácio of Juazeiro do Norte, Juazeiro do Norte, Brazil.); Schoen, Robert T (Yale University)",18,4,1.1,3.72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100776591,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

BACKGROUND: In Spain, the national public health service is the most likely point of primary care access for victims of intimate partner violence. However, health professionals are also victims of violence by their intimate partner. Little research has been undertaken exploring the prevalence and risk factors of this abuse in health professionals.
METHODS: A cross-sectional multicenter study in professionals of both sexes who were working in the Spanish Public Health Service was performed. The health professionals completed an online survey of intimate violence abuse: for women, the screening of abuse against women by an intimate partner, and for men, the domestic violence screening tool in a family setting. A descriptive and comparative analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1071 professionals: 49.9% were physicians, 46.9% were nurses and 3.3% were nursing assistants. Of the participants, 26.6% had experienced some form of abuse, and 73.3% of the abused professionals had not spoken of their experience of abuse with anyone else.
CONCLUSION: Men experienced a lower incidence of intimate partner violence than women. In fact, 34% of the female participants were in an abusive relationship, which is a higher percentage than that observed in studies of the general Spanish female population (11.7%). It appears that being female and a nurse are risk factors for abuse.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: These data suggest the urgent implementation of action plans for the provision of support for the victims and for interventions aimed at reducing the problem. Better training and awareness-raising programmes that improve the detection of intimate partner violence and the care of its victims are also necessary.",,"Funding This article is part of a project, expedient number: PI13/01253, integrated into the Spanish National Plan Research + Development + Innovation and co‐financed by Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) – General Evaluation Branch and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER).",International Nursing Review,,,Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Assistants; Nursing Staff; Physicians; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Socioeconomic Factors; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires; Violence,2018-02-26,2018,2018-02-26,2018-09,65,3,441-449,Closed,Article,"Carmona‐Torres, J.M.; Recio‐Andrade, B.; Rodríguez‐Borrego, M.A.","Carmona‐Torres, J.M.

In Colombia, Law 100/93 was created as an ambitious reform aimed at integrating the social security and public sectors of healthcare in order to create universal access, and at the same time to generate market competence with the objective of improving effectiveness and responsiveness. Instead, however, Colombian health reform has served to generate competition which has aggravated inequalities among people. Within this context, we practice nursing. As nurses, our responsibility is to advocate for our patients. We cannot ignore what is happening worldwide in hospitals and community health settings because our responsibility is to promote health, prevent disease, and care for human beings. So, today, when the world pushes for economical profit and competence on one hand, and, on the other, for moral compromises to care, respect, and advocacy for all human beings, being a nurse in the Colombian health system represents a challenge for us.

3384,pub.1106526923,10.1002/ase.1802,30179312,,Using the Jigsaw Method to Teach Abdominal Anatomy,"This study evaluates a cooperative learning approach for teaching anatomy to health science students incorporating small group and peer instruction based on the jigsaw method first described in the 1970's. Fifty-three volunteers participated in abdominal anatomy workshops. Students were given time to become an ""expert"" in one of four segments of the topic (sub-topics) by allocating groups to work-stations with learning resources: axial computerized tomography (CT) of abdominal structures, axial CT of abdominal blood vessels, angiograms and venograms of abdominal blood vessels and structures located within abdominal quadrants. In the second part of workshop, students were redistributed into ""jigsaw"" learning groups with at least one ""expert"" at each workstation. The ""jigsaw"" learning groups then circulated between workstations learning all sub-topics with the ""expert"" teaching others in their group. To assess abdominal anatomy knowledge, students completed a quiz pre- and post- workshop. Students increased their knowledge with significant improvements in quiz scores irrespective of prior exposure to lectures or practical classes related to the workshop topic. The evidence for long-term retention of knowledge, assessed by comparing end-semester examination performance of workshop participants with workshop nonparticipants, was less convincing. Workshop participants rated the jigsaw workshop highly for both educational value and enjoyment and felt the teaching approach would improve their course performance. The jigsaw method improved anatomy knowledge in the short-term by engaging students in group work and peer-led learning, with minimal supervision required. Reported outcomes suggest that cooperative learning approaches can lead to gains in student performance and motivation to learn.

Furthermore, suicide attempts exert a financial burden of millions of dollars on society.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the factors associated with more than one suicide attempt in the Colombian population that was reported in 2016.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 18,763 reports entered in the database of the National Public Health Surveillance of the National Institute of Health of Colombia during 2016 was performed.
RESULTS: 11,738 (62.6%) of the total number of reports were female, the mean age was 25.0 (95% CI, 24.9-25.2) years, 46% of all cases were individuals between 10- and 20-years-old; 5,734 (30.6%) reported 2 or more suicide attempts and the prevalence of a mental disorder and persistent suicidal ideation were 48.5% and 16.4%, respectively. The factor most strongly associated with more than one suicide attempt, after adjusting for logistic regression, was persistent suicide ideation with crude OR=5.5 (95% CI, 5.0-5.9), and ORa=4.0 (95% CI, 3.6-4.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with persistent suicidal ideation were 4 times more likely to have 2 or more suicide attempts. Other factors such as the use of a sharp weapon as a mechanism to perform the attempt and the history of bipolar affective disorder and/or depression were also associated with more than one suicide attempt.","Al Instituto Nacional de Salud por facilitar los datos de reportes de intentos de suicidio de 2016, así como a las entidades territoriales por su trabajo diligente en la notificación de los casos.",,Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatría (English ed ),,,"Adolescent; Adult; Bipolar Disorder; Child; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Prevalence; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Young Adult",2018-08-17,2018,2018-08-17,2020-04,49,2,96-101,Closed,Article,"Aparicio Castillo, Yeison Ariel; Blandón Rodríguez, Ana María; Chaves Torres, Ninfa-Marlen","Aparicio Castillo, Yeison Ariel (Universidad Minuto de Dios, Bogotá, Colombia.); Blandón Rodríguez, Ana María (Grupo de Vigilancia y Control de Eventos de Salud Mental y Lesiones de Causa Externa, Dirección de Vigilancia y Análisis del Riesgo en Salud Pública, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogotá, Colombia.); Chaves Torres, Ninfa-Marlen (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Militar, Nueva Granada, Colombia.

Failure analysis is carried out to diagnose the cause(s) and mitigate potential similar failures in coal mine excavator fleet. The analysis methodology involves collection of background data, on-site visual examination, non-destructive testing, macroscopic and microscopic fractography, chemical analysis, metallographic analysis, hardness measurements as well as finite element structural analysis. A crack developed and grew up stealthily at a field weld joint between a man-hole plate and the boom plate. The collected evidence suggests a series of triggering factors leading to the unexpected failure: unmatched plate materials regarding mechanical properties, low-quality weld beads and the introduction of geometric discontinuities that effectively work as stress raisers.",Authors would like to acknowledge Universidad Del Norte and the Ph.D. National Scholarship Colciencias-Uninorte N° 617-2014 (Contract Identification Number: UN-OJ-2014-24072 and UN-OJ-2014-26159) for the financial support.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Engineering Failure Analysis,,,,2018-08,2018,,2018-08,90,,47-63,Closed,Article,"Maury, Heriberto; Wilches, José; Illera, Danny; Pugliese, Víctor; Mesa, Jaime; Gómez, Humberto","Maury, Heriberto (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Wilches, José (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Illera, Danny (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Pugliese, Víctor (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Mesa, Jaime (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gómez, Humberto (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, km 5 vía a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte)","Maury, Heriberto (Universidad del Norte); Wilches, José (Universidad del Norte); Illera, Danny (Universidad del Norte); Pugliese, Víctor (Universidad del Norte); Mesa, Jaime (Universidad del Norte); Gómez, Humberto (Universidad del Norte)",6,1,,1.26,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101548064,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Some drawbacks occur when very many objects need to be identified, and the tool is unable to support all of them. Even if the mechanism could tag them all, it is also important that the labels or codewords not resemble each other, to be able to detect and correct errors. To solve this problem, this article proposes an MDS (Maximum Distance Separable) code C with length 11 and dimension 7 over the finite field F210$${\mathbb {F}}_{2^{10}}$$. Furthermore, we construct a subcode of C with capacity for 327 different identifiers. Concretely we consider the set of all codewords with entries belonging to the subfield of F210$${\mathbb {F}}_{2^{10}}$$ isomorphic to F25$${\mathbb {F}}_{2^{5}}$$.

La Guajira, Colombia, was the location as a study case for the proposed method. Simulating waves nearshore (SWAN) and Delft3D models were adapted for three scenarios of extreme waves. The calculation of hydrodynamic force profiles through the RP 2A-WSD-2014 method and the proposed method shows that the traditional method cannot reproduce current profiles associated to hydrodynamic nonlinear interactions. The analysis included sensitivity tests for the hydrodynamic model data; also, a structural numerical model using SAP2000 was built to assess the structural stability of a ductile monopile structure (stress and deformation analysis). The structural model intends to generate a contribution for predesign and reliability considerations. Finally, the method contributes to solve the data restrictions and guide to engineers to set objective security factors considering the theoretical profiles and numerical modeling.","The authors offer thanks for the support through the scholarship offered to Juan Rueda-Bayona as a graduate student at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellín (Res. 002-2012) and Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla [doctoral fellowship (2013–2017) Grant UN-OJ-2013-22058].

Current approaches to conservation are built on the premise that conservation and development are not antagonistic. Social conservationists advocate win–win solutions that both conserve biodiversity and promote human well-being. In this paper we explore how the conservation-development relationship is understood by a rural community in Colombia where remaining areas of tropical dry forest are threatened by human activities, and a payment for ecosystem services scheme, PES, is proposed as a conservation strategy. Q-methodology was used to identify and categorise local peoples’ perspectives on forest conservation. Four distinctive perspectives were found: Social Conservationism, Fair Development, Development Advocate and Government’s Responsibility. Social conservationism places more importance on forest conservation while the other three perspectives emphasise development. This suggests that the conservation program at the local level must be explicit about tensions and trade-offs. Not to do so can compromise the social acceptability of the PES scheme and therefore the conservation objective.","This work would not be possible without the financial and human support of the Strategic Area Program on Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Well-Being of Universidad del Norte, Colombia.

Formation energies values at valence band maximum indicate that the nitrogen vacancy is more stable than the aluminum vacancy in both Al and N rich conditions. Under Al-rich and N-rich conditions, aluminum vacancy presents two transition levels in the band gap: from neutral state to a negative charge-state ( 0 / − 1 ) , and from a negative charge-state to a double negative charged state ( − 1 / − 2 ) . Nitrogen vacancy at low Fermi energies prefers a positive charged state, then it adopts a neutral charged state, and finally it is stabilized in a negative charge-state. Bond lengths of atoms in vicinity of vacancy and electronic structure are affected by charge states. AlN sheet with vacancy defects could present spin-polarized charge states.

This paper illustrates the Relative Assessment of Indicators in Sustainability Enhancement (RAISE) methodology that is based on the measure of negative impacts generated during any product life cycle stage. This approach includes a systematic process for the definition and evaluation of indicators to compare the sustainability performance of products considering each indicator individually and using a holistic index of sustainability to entail an overall comparison between products from manufacturing scenarios. The RAISE method is developed with the aim of assessing sustainability performance of product life cycle stages and incorporating this assessment into the decision-making process when comparing different manufacturing scenarios. A guitar capo manufactured in polymeric material is used as case study to demonstrate the use of the method. In this paper, only the manufacturing stage is considered; however, the method can also be employed in other stages of the life cycle.","This work was partially supported by COLCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 617-2.

A deductive analysis was applied looking toward a successful recognition of root cause(s), where based on knowledge of background, and failure characteristics, multiple hypothesis are exposed that are further confirmed or rejected according to different tests, material analysis or maintenance history. In both shafts, failure arises from inadequate repairing. In order to confirm this, the failure analysis methodology included the following steps: technical review, visual inspection, fractography, penetrating inks, metallography, optic microscopy and stress analysis. Evidence obtained through these techniques indicates a fatigue failure induced by inadequate repairing procedures; therefore, main recommendation is to take the necessary precautions in order to guarantee minimal alterations on shaft geometry or material microstructure.","The authors would like to thank José Wilches and Humberto Gómez from Universidad del Norte, and all the reviewers and anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the research.",,Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention,,,,2018-08-01,2018,2018-08-01,2018-10,18,5,1053-1061,Closed,Article,"Serje, David A.; Niebles, Enrique E.; Lascano, Sheila K.","Serje, David A.

We synthesized thin films of Tiox-Zn-V with varying concentrations of vanadium and titanium. The resulting thin films are characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), wavelength-dispersive x-ray fluorescence, and ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry. XRD results indicate that the majority phase of the resulting structure was Tiox-Zn with a crystallographic plane (020) and an angular position 2θ of 42.38°. The presence of vanadium was confirmed by x-ray fluorescence, and transmittance measurements in the 300–800-nm range showed that the transmittance of this material was over 80%, but reduced in the presence of vanadium. We also found the width of the energy gap to decrease as the concentration of vanadium is increased, thereby suggesting an increase in conductivity and the introduction of a certain amount of disorder into the Tiox-Zn structure according to the Wemple–DiDomenico (WDD) formulation of energy dispersion.

During optimization steps of TR methods, the proposed models are built as follows: samples from the cost function are taken about the current solution and then, a linear or a quadratic Taylor polynomial is built about each sampled point. All Taylor expansions are convexly combined by using radial basis functions in order to propose a surrogate model for the optimization step. Theoretically, we prove that, the proposed models are fully linear or fully quadratic depending on whether they are built based on convex combinations of linear or quadratic Taylor expansions, respectively. This guaranties that, regardless the initial guess of the iterative process, the optimization method will converge to local solutions where at least first order optimality conditions are satisfied. Discussions on how to solve the surrogate optimization problems among iterations are presented as well. Experimental results are carried out making use of a sequential data assimilation problem. The results reveal that, the use of our proposed models in such context can improve the quality of analysis states in terms of root-mean-square-error values while uncertainties can be decreased across different assimilation cycles.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory (AML-CS) at Universidad del Norte, BAQ, COL.",,Journal of Computational Science,,,,2018-05,2018,,2018-05,26,,264-274,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

It is found that the vacancies introduce defect levels in the band gap, and these generate a total magnetization in the g-GaN system. The formation energy with different charge states for the vacancies of gallium and nitrogen were calculated, obtaining higher energies than the GaN wurtzite phase (w-GaN). Furthermore, nitrogen vacancies were found to be more stable than gallium vacancies in a whole range of electronic chemical potential. Finally, gallium and nitrogen vacancies produce a nonzero magnetic moment in g-GaN, making it a potential candidate for future spintronics applications.",Acknowledgements The Authors thank to COLCIENCIAS and Universidad del Norte for the financial support.

These two intermediate Colombian cities are becoming increasingly important in terms of Colombia's urbanization and modernization plans. The text explores the ‘mobility tragedy’ as one of the main urban issues of Colombian cities, and the homogeneous and linear way in which this ‘tragedy’ supposedly affects women. Using focus groups, the authors show that mobility has differential effects according to the gender and class of the urban inhabitants of the two cities, who, from their differential experiences, build different spatio-temporal imaginaries and representations of urban spaces that are never pre-established elements. Based on the findings of the fieldwork carried out during 2016 and 2017, the authors propose a conceptualization of urban spaces, associated with the life experiences of their inhabitants. This approach emphasizes the distributive effects of mobility on men and women. This is a call to see ‘cities’ within the city, shedding light on the fact that some women take on greater burdens within the city than their male counterparts, destroying the longing for urban spaces as neutral constructions and showing how space and the ways in which different urban systems attempt to manage it through mobility mechanisms, operate as governmentality: they grant meaning to people's lives without them recognizing such mechanisms as influential.","We thank our students, Paola Pereira, Rosa Castellanos, Ivy Bonilla, Maria Fernanda Molinares, Gloria Jaimes, and Emily Sosa, for their helpful assistance in this project.

We conducted a thematic analysis of 500 news items and 71 letters to the editor (LTE) to establish the polarity of these texts. Findings showed that the negative tone of the coverage seemed related to a strong negative reaction from the public. This supports the first level of influence from agenda-setting theory, since the Iraq War was an important issue for journalists and the public alike. There is also evidence of a second level of influence with regards to the issues reported being considered negative. LTE were gauged in terms of how they criticized coverage of the war, with the particular finding that journalistic professionalism was questioned following bias accusations about the qualifications of the parties at war. Overall, the wider perspective on public concerns offered by this study could help guide journalistic coverage of the Colombian post-conflict phase.",,,Catalan Journal of Communication & Cultural Studies,,,,2018-04-01,2018,,2018-04-01,10,1,25-42,Closed,Article,"Barrios, Marta Milena; Uribe-Jongbloed, Enrique; Vega-Estarita, Lina","Barrios, Marta Milena (Universidad del Norte); Uribe-Jongbloed, Enrique (Universidad Externado de Colombia); Vega-Estarita, Lina (Universidad del Norte)",,"Barrios, Marta Milena (Universidad del Norte); Uribe-Jongbloed, Enrique (Universidad Externado de Colombia); Vega-Estarita, Lina (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104245464,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Particularly, assessing the effects of vertical stratification over mixing, estuarine circulation and suspended sediment transport processes. Measurements of salinity, temperature, density, currents and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were performed at the Magdalena river mouth during high and low streamflows to distinguish among two contrasting seasonal conditions (flow conditions, wind patterns, wave energy). Salinity, temperature, density and location of the freshwater-saltwater interface (FSI) exhibited a sharp seasonal variability. The river mouth and delta front were stratified regardless of the hydrologic season, whereas the riverine section was stratified during the low streamflow season, reflecting the balance between fluvial advection and vertical stratification. Reduction of the vertical mixing led to a more clearly defined and extended stratification. Bottom friction is the main mixing mechanism, but as stratification is strengthened along the river mouth, the vertical mixing weakens, promoting the developing of TMZ (SSC >4500 mg l−1). Our results indicate that TMZ developing is caused by the convergence of stratified layers near the nodal point and the weakening of bottom turbulence by stratification. Although the TMZ exhibited a strong seasonal variation in its magnitude and extent, it usually formed in the convergence front demarcated by saltwater intrusion. Streamflow is the major influence on the TMZ formation since it allows the development of stratified conditions, which weaken turbulent mixing, and thus promotes particulate matter settling. The Magdalena River estuary can be classified as turbid (4000 mg l−1 < SSCmax < 10,000 mg l−1) and extremely turbid during low streamflow seasons (SSCmax > 10,000 mg l−1). These values are of the same order as the SSC reported for the Yangtze and Yellow estuaries, classified as having the largest SSC values of the world.","This study constitutes a contribution from the research project “Hacia el entendimiento de la turbulencia y la floculación en desembocaduras tropicales – procesos fundamentales en la formación de zonas de máxima turbidez y el transporte de sedimentos” funded by Colciencias (Proyecto 121571250890 Convocatoria 745).

Entre estos se destacan placas aladas alargadas, posiblemente talladas con una intención simbólica asociada a un tipo de materia prima específica. Placas aladas de formas similares se han reportado en amplias regiones del norte de Colombia y Venezuela, Panamá, Costa Rica y el Caribe. En este trabajo, la identificación de la materia prima a partir de estudios arqueométricos realizados sobre placas aladas prehispánicas de la SNSM revela que estas están elaboradas en jade tipo nefrita, serpentinita y calcedonia. Las características mineralógicas de los artefactos fueron comparadas con la asociación mineralógica identificada en rocas de la Formación Punta Betín, la Formación Rodadero y el Batolito de Santa Marta de la Sierra Nevada. La similitud mineralógica encontrada entre las placas y las rocas estudiadas permite proponer una fuente geológica de origen local en la SNSM.
The artisanal record of the prehispanic peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), Colombia, who lived in the region during the chronological periods Nahuange (AD 100 to 1000) and Tairona (AD 1000 to 1600), contains a wide variety of artifacts made from varied materials. This is explained by the abundance of mineral resources in the area and existing cultural exchange with other regions. Many of these artifacts were made of a green stone, including winged plates carved for possibly symbolic reasons that were associated with a specific type of raw material. Winged plates with similar shapes have been archaeologically reported in the north of Colombia, Venezuela, Panamá, Costa Rica and the Caribbean. Archaeometric studies on the plates of the SNSM reveal that these are elaborated in nephrite, serpentinite, and chalcedony. The mineralogical characteristics identified in the artifacts were compared with the minerals identified on rocks of the Punta Betín, Rodadero Formation, and the Batolito de Santa Marta of the Sierra Nevada. The mineralogical similarity found between the plates and the rocks allows us to suggest a geological source of local origin in the SNSM.",,,Latin American Antiquity,,,,2018-10-17,2018,2018-10-17,2018-12,29,4,774-792,Closed,Article,"Gómez, Natalia Acevedo; Scharff, Marion Weber; García-Casco, Antonio; Sáenz-Samper, Juanita","Gómez, Natalia Acevedo (Departamento de Geociencias y Medio Ambiente, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 80 N° 65-223 – Medellín, Colombia); Scharff, Marion Weber (Departamento de Geociencias y Medio Ambiente, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 80 N° 65-223 – Medellín, Colombia, (, mweber@unal.edu.co, )); García-Casco, Antonio (Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología, Universidad de Granada, Avda.

An indicator usually expresses the level of agreement of a respondent with a given statement, generally based on a Likert scale response. Literature exhibits remarkable variations regarding indicators’ complexity, expressed by the number of indicators for each latent variable, the type of scale, and granularity. Dealing with different levels of complexity implies that respondents require different cognitive efforts when choosing a relevant Likert point. Further, as a Likert item is undoubtedly a set of ordered categories, modelers face the challenge of estimating a large number of threshold parameters resulting from greater complexity when using ordered models for measurement equations. This paper studies the influence of indicators’ complexity on the estimation of HDC models based on an experiment that systematically varies the number of indicators, the granularity and the type of scale. We specified a proper parameterization of the scale factor of the measurement component for capturing potential effects of complexity in measurement equations. Findings revealed that granularity and its quadratic effect, as well as the interaction between granularity and number of indicators, affect the error variance of the measurement component and have a substantial impact on the goodness-of-fit of the discrete choice sub-model. Modeling results also showed that using odd-numbered scales, widely used in transportation choice studies, contribute to a lower error variance of the measurement component.","We are grateful to the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF), for having partially financed this work through EP-2013-01-SVG-2015-01, and to the Across Latitudes and Cultures – Bus Rapid Transit (ALC – BRT) for the short-term study visit.

A detailed model for allothermal gasification in a downdraft fixed bed tubular reactor is proposed. This considers solid and gas phases traveling in parallel flow along the reactor. Results for temperature and gas profile show a reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental works carried out under similar conditions. Aiming to maximize H2 yield, eight Gaussian flux distributions, similar to those typical of CSP systems, each with a total power of 8 kW (average heat flux 20 kW/m2), but with varying peak locations, were analyzed. The results show a maximum producer gas yield and a chemical efficiency of 134.1 kmol/h and 45.9% respectively, with a molar concentration of 47.2% CO, 46.9% H2, 3.3% CH4, and 2.6% CO2 for a distribution peak at z = 1.4 m, thus relatively close to the flue gas outlet. Hydrogen production and gas yield using this configuration were 4% and 2.9% higher than the achieved using the same power but homogeneously distributed. Solar to chemical efficiencies ranged from 38.9% to 45.9%, with a minimum when distribution peak was at the reactor center.

State-of-the-art solutions for active distribution networks fault location consider wide-area measurements, which include synchronized measurements obtained by Phasor Measurement Units (PMU). For distribution networks though, the capital cost of such solutions is prohibitive. Most recently, solutions have been proposed without considering synchronized measurements. However, they have some limitations, such as not considering multiple inverter-interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (DER). The solution presented is composed of a load flow based approach, which uses only locally available measurements. A ladder iterative technique is proposed to estimate the system state variables during the fault period. DERs models, which consider various modes of operation and fault conditions are used. An impedance formulation which considers distribution networks inherent characteristics is presented. The proposed methodology is validated on the IEEE 34-nodes test feeder. The ease of implementation of design, formulation of parameters and encouraging test results indicate potential for real-life applications.","This work was supported by PEC-PG (Programa Estudantes-Convênio de Pós-Graduação), CAPES/CNPq – Brazil, Energy Strategic Area Project of the Universidad del Norte – Colombia and XV convocatoria interna de investigación: Modalidad Agendas de I+D+I.",,International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems,,,,2018-07,2018,,2018-07,99,,454-464,Closed,Article,"Orozco-Henao, C.; Bretas, A.S.; Herrera-Orozco, A.R.; Pulgarín-Rivera, Juan Diego; Dhulipala, Surya; Wang, S.","Orozco-Henao, C.

Flexibility is an alternative to cope with uncertainty that increases social welfare. This article seeks for estimating the value of this flexibility and interpreting its meaning in the Colombian power system. In order to keep this focus clear, we implement a well-known methodology of Real Options (RO) in a simplified version of the Colombian power system. Accordingly, we introduce flexibility using a simple strategy of adding new transmission lines and make a simple comparison with a robust approach, as the one currently used in Colombia. Our results show that introducing this flexibility in the Colombian TEP increases social welfare in around $35 million, which represents an upper bound for the additional investment costs incurred to provide this adapting ability to the power system. These results suggest the need for revising the current paradigm of robust approach to prepare future Colombian transmission plans.","This work was partially supported by CONICYT, FONDECYT/Regular 1161112 grant and by CONICYT, FONDAP 15110019 grant (SERC-CHILE).

The total anthocyanin content expresses as delphinidin chloride (TAEDC) per mL of the extract was equal to 124 ± 5 μg TAEDC/mL. After the identification, a sensitization process was performed and verified by infrared spectroscopy (IR) and absorption diffuse reflectance. Afterwards, the Methylene Blue photodegradation process was studied under visible light irradiation on the S. cumini-sensitized TiO2 material (TiO2/S. cumini). The results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of the sensitized material TiO2/S. cumini was ∼3 times greater than unmodified TiO2 thin films, which let us to propose that the extract from Caribbean Colombian S. cumini could have a great potential as source of photosensitizers for photocatalytic applications. Finally, the electronic structure of each anthocyanin found in the extract (delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside, malvidin-3-5-diglucoside and petunidin-3-5-diglucoside) and their interaction with a TiO2 model was studied by means of the density functional theory (DFT).","The authors would like to thank the Grants FONDECYT 11140563 and 1161416.

We do so in order to gain a better understanding of their role in representing gender in Colombia. Relevant topics include: the widespread violence against women in a traditional, patriarchal country, the ineffectiveness of policies targeting gender discrimination, and ideologies of machismo and Marianismo. These practices are discussed as factors that may prevent women’s social empowerment and participation in the workforce and politics of the country. Our results show that, as per Colombia’s prevailing social relations, narconovelas demonstrate a gendered power imbalance and mestizo heteronormativity via macho plots that glamorize violence against women. Women are rarely key characters in narconovelas, and when they appear, they are dependent on men, and attain status through men or their families. In addition, the genre represents continuous verbal and physical aggression against women, especially if they belong to ethnic or racial minorities.",,,Feminist Media Studies,,,,2018-02-19,2018,2018-02-19,2019-04-03,19,3,348-363,Closed,Article,"Miller, Toby; Barrios, Marta Milena; Arroyave, Jesús","Miller, Toby (Institute of Media & Creative Industries, Loughborough University London, London, UK); Barrios, Marta Milena (School of Communication, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arroyave, Jesús (School of Communication, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Barrios, Marta Milena (Universidad del Norte)","Miller, Toby (University of London); Barrios, Marta Milena (Universidad del Norte); Arroyave, Jesús (Universidad del Norte)",12,5,,5.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101114405,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

The impact of possible policies such as gasoline taxes increases, purchase price subsidies, tax exemptions, and increases in fuel recharging station availability for alternative fuelled vehicles is evaluated using hybrid choice models. The models also allow assessing the sensitivity of latent variables (i.e., attitudes and perceptions) in the car purchase behaviour. The models are estimated using data from a stated choice survey collected in five Colombian cities. The latent variables are obtained from the rating of statements related to the transport system, environmental concern, vehicle preferences, and technology. The modelling approach includes regression between latent variables. Results show that environmental concern and the support for green transport policies have a positive influence on the intention to purchase alternative fuel vehicles. Meanwhile, people who reveal to be car-dependent prefer to buy standard fuelled vehicles. The analysis among cities shows similar trends in individual behaviour, although there are differences in attribute sensitivities. The policy scenario analysis revealed high sensitivity to capital cost and the need for extensive investments in refuelling stations for alternative fuel vehicles to become attractive. Nevertheless, all policies should not only be directed at infrastructure and vehicles but also be focused on user awareness and acceptance of the alternative fuel vehicles. The analysis suggests that in an environmentally conscious market, people prefer alternative fuels. However, if the transport policies support private transport, the market shares of alternative fuel vehicles will decrease.",,,Transportation,,,,2018-03-16,2018,2018-03-16,2018-11,45,6,1721-1753,Closed,Article,"Soto, Jose J.; Cantillo, Victor; Arellana, Julian","Soto, Jose J.

The understanding of the dissolution is essential for selecting the processing equipment, the operating conditions, and the polymer excipients. The methodology presented in this work for ketoprofen (KTO) and polymer excipients serves as a screening process to select the best API-polymer formulation for hot melt extrusion (HME) to target a specific release profile. KTO dispersion within the polymer was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dissolution tests. Thermal characterization shows that a single phase amorphous solid solution (one glass transition temperature [T g ]) was achieved under the HME processing conditions and screw configuration; and with the combination of polymer excipients, an extended release profile of KTO was accomplished, releasing 100% of KTO in 24 h.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the technical support of the professionals from the Instituto de Capacitación e Investigación del Plástico y del Caucho (ICIPC), the pharmaceutical company Procaps S.A., and Universidad del Norte.

High solar radiation variation due to moving clouds may cause failures to the solar receiver. This paper shows a dynamic performance analysis of a solar central receiver operating when short-time cloud passages partially shade the solar field. The solar receiver incorporates an aiming methodology based on a closed loop model predictive control approach. The DNI changes are simulated using an agent-based model that closely emulates the transients in solar radiation caused by clouds. These models are coupled with a solar system model that resembles the Gemasolar solar plant. The simulations showed that the base feedback loop aiming strategy could successfully restore the solar receiver back to its steady state after transient operations caused by clouds. However, undesired overshoots in incident flux density and high heating rates in the controlled variables were found. These issues are overcome through a setpoint readjustment approach, which is temporally supported by a PI controller. The results show that the proposed aiming control strategy can provide a continuous safe operation of the solar central receiver when subject to transient flux distribution due to clouds.","The authors wish to acknowledge the support received for this research from COLCIENCIAS, Doctoral Scholarship Program 727–2015, Universidad del Norte, the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative (ASTRI), a project supported by the Australian Government, through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).",,Renewable Energy,,,,2018-06,2018,,2018-06,121,,355-367,Closed,Article,"García, Jesús; Too, Yen Chean Soo; Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez; Beath, Andrew; Kim, Jin-Soo; Sanjuan, Marco E.","García, Jesús (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Too, Yen Chean Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); Padilla, Ricardo Vasquez (School of Environment, Science and Engineering, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, 2480, Australia); Beath, Andrew (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); Kim, Jin-Soo (CSIRO Energy Centre, Mayfield West, NSW 2304, Australia); Sanjuan, Marco E.

In this paper, we applied a model that is gaining recognition in the context of passenger values of time estimation known as random valuation (RV) to a context in which there is little evidence of its application: freight value of time estimation (FVOT). Secondly, we compared this model to the commonly used methodology, random utility (RU). We analysed several levels of model specification to estimate the FVOT using data from a stated choice experiment applied in five of the main cargo transport road corridors of Colombia. The analysis accounts for the value of time differentiated by vehicle type. Results suggest that the RV models performed better for the same dataset than its counterpart RU in all cases. Another aspect to highlight is that the FVOT value obtained with the RU approach was pretty similar to those obtained with the RV in most cases. Also, the estimates FVOT for empty trips are closer, and in some cases higher, than those of loaded trips.",,,Transportation,,,,2018-08-02,2018,2018-08-02,2020-04,47,2,705-736,Closed,Article,"Goenaga, Boris; Cantillo, Victor","Goenaga, Boris (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5.

In this paper, we sized and conducted an economic analysis of three photovoltaic systems for installation in remote areas populated by indigenous communities. These alternative electricity access solutions were designed using a decision support framework that considers optimal system sizing, reliability and efficiency. The study considered three community size scenarios: small communities or Segment 1 (S1), medium communities or Segment 2 (S2) and large communities or Segment 3 (S3). Thanks to this information, we were able to estimate the energy demand within each scenario and design three optimized renewable energy systems. According to the results, the cost of energy was calculated as being COP $1,125, COP $1002 and COP $1159 per kWh for communities S1, S2 and S3, respectively. Scenario S2 is the cheapest option due to the lower average household income (COP $61.369 per month with respect to COP $81.975 and COP $86.460 for S1 and S3, respectively). Finally, the results clearly indicate that the cost per kWh could be as little as COP $450, COP $401 and COP $464 for segments S1, S2 and S3, respectively (values closer to the 2015 national average unit cost in kWh, which was COP $391 for the off-grid system), if the government were to subsidize up to 60% of the electricity supply cost. This shows that, under this assumption, the evaluated technology could be competitive alternative for meeting the energy needs of the target population.","Acknowledgment We would like to thank the Universidad de la Guajira, Colombia (International agreement Nº 4734), for its financial support for conducting this research.",,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,,,,2018-02,2018,,2018-02,82,,4245-4255,Closed,Article,"Vides-Prado, Andrés; Camargo, Edgar Ojeda; Vides-Prado, Carlos; Orozco, Israel Herrera; Chenlo, Faustino; Candelo, John E.; Sarmiento, Agustín Barrios","Vides-Prado, Andrés (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad de la Guajira, Km 5 Vía a Maicao, PBX (5), 728 2729 Riohacha, Colombia); Camargo, Edgar Ojeda (Faculty of Industrial Engineering, Universidad de la Guajira, Km 5 Vía a Maicao, PBX (5), 728 2729 Riohacha, Colombia); Vides-Prado, Carlos (Department of Environmental Engineering, Universidad de la Guajira, Km 5 Vía a Maicao, PBX (5), 728 2729 Riohacha, Colombia); Orozco, Israel Herrera (Energy System Analysis Unit – Energy Department, CIEMAT, Av Complutense 40, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Chenlo, Faustino (Photovoltaic Solar Power Unit, CIEMAT, Av Complutense 40, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Candelo, John E.

There is an urgent need to make therapeutic decisions, which are mostly support measures, for which there are no recommendations based on controlled clinical trials that demonstrate their benefit and risk profile.",,,Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo,,,,2018-01,2018,,2018-01,18,1,51-61,Closed,Article,"Accini, Jose Luis; Ariza, Abul; Accini, Andrea; Cotes, Rafael; Barraza, Ernest; Arenas, Kellys","Accini, Jose Luis (Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia; Universidad Libre-Barranquilla, Barranquilla, Colombia; Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; IPS Centro Científico Asistencial Jose Accini SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ariza, Abul (Medicina Crítica y Cuidados Intensivos, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Accini, Andrea (IPS Centro Científico Asistencial Jose Accini SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cotes, Rafael (Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Barraza, Ernest (Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Arenas, Kellys (Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia)","Accini, Jose Luis (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte; Free University of Colombia; Universidad del Norte; IPS Centro Científico Asistencial Jose Accini SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Accini, Jose Luis (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte; Free University of Colombia; Universidad del Norte; IPS Centro Científico Asistencial Jose Accini SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ariza, Abul (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Accini, Andrea (IPS Centro Científico Asistencial Jose Accini SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cotes, Rafael (Universidad del Norte); Barraza, Ernest (Universidad del Norte); Arenas, Kellys (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100425272,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law,3 Good Health and Well Being

Wave and Wind Energy Potential Including Extreme Events: A Case Study of Mexico. In: Shim, J.-S.; Chun, I., and Lim, H.S. (eds.), Proceedings from the International Coastal Symposium (ICS) 2018 (Busan, Republic of Korea). Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 85, pp.13361340. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The available wind and wave energy potential of the coasts of Mexico was found to be low in several analyses. However, these analyses considered only average conditions. To adequately assess the energy potential of Mexican coasts for energy extraction, it is necessary to characterize maritime weather and to define both normal and storm thresholds. For the present study, a 60-year historical analysis of wave and wind conditions along the Mexican coasts was performed. A statistical analysis of extreme conditions was carried out using the peaks-over-threshold approach. Also, seasonal (winter, spring, summer and autumn) and hourly available power were included in the analysis. The differences between the energy potentials when including and excluding extreme events are considerable. The energy potential of events occurring along the Mexican coasts confirms that energy can be adequately and profitably obtained from waves and wind. The greatest energy potential in the Atlantic is found to the northeast of the Yucatan Peninsula and in the Pacific along the Baja California Peninsula. Winter is the best season for energy extraction, while summer is the most unfavorable season.",,,Journal of Coastal Research,,,,2018-05,2018,,2018-05,85,sp1,1336-1340,Closed,Article,"Felix, Anglica; Mendoza, Edgar; Chvez, Valeria; Silva, Rodolfo; Rivillas-Ospina, Germn","Felix, Anglica (CONACYT, Engineering Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico); Mendoza, Edgar (Engineering Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico); Chvez, Valeria (Engineering Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico); Silva, Rodolfo (Engineering Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico); Rivillas-Ospina, Germn (Institute of Environmental and Hydraulic Studies, Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Felix, Anglica (CONACYT, Engineering Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico)","Felix, Anglica (CONACYT, Engineering Institute, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico); Mendoza, Edgar (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Chvez, Valeria (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Silva, Rodolfo (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Rivillas-Ospina, Germn (Universidad del Norte)",5,1,,1.55,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106092476,40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy
1644,pub.1103630276,10.1007/s00500-018-3210-1,,,A Tabu Search implementation for adaptive localization in ensemble-based methods,"In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter based on adaptive localization via Tabu search. The proposed method works as follows: during assimilation steps, observed components from the model state are split into two groups: the training set and the validation set, after which analysis states are obtained by using the training data, while posterior errors are estimated by means of the validation set. These steps are repeated for a fixed number of iterations and based on a Tabu search implementation, for each model component an optimal radius of influence is estimated. Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz 96 model which mimics the chaotic behaviour of the atmosphere. We assess the accuracy of the proposed method by contrasting its numerical results with those obtained by reference filters from the specialized literature such as the local ensemble transform Kalman filter and the ensemble Kalman filter based on modified Cholesky decomposition. Besides, numerical simulations are enriched by using different ensemble sizes, radii of influences (where appropriate), and inflation factors. The results reveal that, for all configurations, the proposed adaptive localization-based filter can improve the accuracy as well as the convergence of ensemble-based methods in the context of sequential data assimilation methods.","This work was supported by the Applied Math and Computer Science Laboratory (AML-CS) at Universidad del Norte, BAQ, COL.",,Soft Computing,,,,2018-04-24,2018,2018-04-24,2019-07,23,14,5519-5535,Closed,Article,"Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.; Morales-Retat, Luis E.","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.

However, the characteristics and location of a port may make it more attractive to mobilise more freight from/to some particular countries rather than others, making the port choice decision dependent on the country of origin/destination of the cargo. This article proposes advanced econometric models to evaluate simultaneously port choice and the country of origin/destination choice for Colombian imports and exports. Findings suggest that for imports and exports domestic freight rate is the most important variable for the joint choice process. Also, for exports, maritime transit time is more relevant than for imports, while for the frequency of shipping lines the opposite is true. The existence of a trade agreement and the gross domestic product per capita also have a significant influence on the election of a country for exports/imports.",,This word was supported by Colciencias [Programa Jóvenes Investigadores e Innovadores 2015],Maritime Policy & Management,,,,2018-03-02,2018,2018-03-02,2018-08-18,45,6,720-738,Closed,Article,"Cantillo, Javier; Cantillo, Victor; Arellana, Julián","Cantillo, Javier (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cantillo, Victor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Arellana, Julián (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte)","Cantillo, Javier (Universidad del Norte); Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte); Arellana, Julián (Universidad del Norte)",19,6,,6.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101320274,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",

1626,pub.1106203514,10.1111/tgis.12462,,,NRand‐K: Minimizing the impact of location obfuscation in spatial analysis,"Abstract Location privacy, or geoprivacy, is critical to secure users’ privacy in context‐aware applications. Location‐based services pose privacy risks for users, due to the inferences that could be made about them from their location information and the potential misuse of this data by service providers or third‐party companies. A common solution is to apply masking or location obfuscation, which degrades location information quality while keeping a geographic coordinate structure. However, there is a trade‐off between privacy, quality of service, and quality of information, the last one being a valuable asset for companies. NRand is a location privacy mechanism with obfuscation capabilities and resistance against filtering attacks. In order to minimize the impact on location information quality, NRand‐K has been introduced. This algorithm is designed for use when releasing location information to third parties or as open data with privacy concerns. To assess the impact of location obfuscation on exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), a comparison is performed between obfuscated data with NRand, NRand‐K, and unaltered data. For the experiments, geolocated tweets collected during the Central Italy 2016 earthquake are used. Results show that NRand‐K reduces the impact on ESDA, where inferences were similar to those obtained with the unaltered data.",,,Transactions in GIS,,,,2018-08-17,2018,2018-08-17,2018-10,22,5,1257-1274,Closed,Article,"Zurbarán, Mayra; Wightman, Pedro; Brovelli, Maria; Oxoli, Daniele; Iliffe, Mark; Jimeno, Miguel; Salazar, Augusto","Zurbarán, Mayra (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Wightman, Pedro (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Brovelli, Maria (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy); Oxoli, Daniele (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy); Iliffe, Mark (N‐LAB, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK); Jimeno, Miguel (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Salazar, Augusto (Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia)","Zurbarán, Mayra (Universidad del Norte)","Zurbarán, Mayra (Universidad del Norte); Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Norte); Brovelli, Maria (Politecnico di Milano); Oxoli, Daniele (Politecnico di Milano); Iliffe, Mark (University of Nottingham); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte); Salazar, Augusto (Universidad del Norte)",13,3,,2.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106203514,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,

Moreover p a ( φ ) is bounded by the vertex of the module affording φ, and equality holds in case that G is p-solvable.

The modified gradient operators utilize a non-staggered grid. In dimensions other than 1D, the modified gradient operators are expressed as Kronecker products of their corresponding 1D versions and some identity matrices. It is shown, that these modified 1D gradient operators are as accurate as the original gradient operators in terms of approximating first-order partial derivatives. It turns out, that in 1D one requires to solve two linear systems for finding a numerical solution of the Eikonal equation. Some examples show that the solution obtained by utilizing the modified operators increases its accuracy when incrementing the order of their approximation, something that does not occur when using the original operators. An iterative scheme is presented for the nonlinear 2D case. The method is of a quasi-Newton-like nature. At each iteration a linear system is built, with progressively higher-order stencils. The solution of the Fast Marching method is the initial guess.

This emphasis has led authors to overlook the context of global inequality and the way it shapes the meaning and uses of a second citizenship. This paper offers a new approach that puts the analytical focus on global inequality in the value of citizenship. First, I construct a composite index of citizenship value and use it to outline the structure of the global citizenship hierarchy. Then, I analyse an original dataset to evaluate the prevalence of dual citizenship in 13 countries. The analysis demonstrates that individuals’ reactions to the possibility of obtaining a second citizenship are shaped by their position in the global citizenship hierarchy. Citizens of Western countries have no practical incentive to obtain a second citizenship and exhibit low demand for it. In Latin American and Eastern European countries, in contrast, demand for a second citizenship is high. Millions draw on their ancestry or ethnic identity to claim citizenship from Western or EU countries. The second, higher-tier nationality is not necessarily used to emigrate. Instead, it often operates as ‘compensatory citizenship’ that makes up for limitations in dual citizens’ primary resident citizenship.","I am grateful to Andreas Wimmer, Paul Starr, Paul DiMaggio, Miguel Centeno, Douglas Massey, David FitzGerald, Yinon Cohen, René Flores, Maria Abascal, Alfredo Garcia, Dimitry Kochenov and Isaac Sasson for their comments on earlier versions of the paper.

As known, solar radiation profiles change due to earth's movements. Even though this change is not manipulable, its behavior is predictable. However, at ground level, direct solar radiation mainly varies due to the effect of clouds, which is a complex phenomenon not easily predictable. In this paper, dynamic solar radiation time series in a two-dimensional (2D) spatial domain are obtained using a biomimetic cloud-shading model. The model is tuned and compared against available measurement time series. The procedure uses an objective function based on statistical indexes that allow extracting the most important characteristics of an actual set of curves. Then, a multi-objective optimization algorithm finds the tuning parameters of the model that better fit data. The results showed that it is possible to obtain responses similar to real direct solar radiation transients using the biomimetic model, which is useful for other studies such as testing control strategies in solar thermal plants.",,,Journal of Solar Energy Engineering,,,,2018-01-31,2018,2018-01-31,2018-04-01,140,2,,Closed,Article,"Garcia, Jesus; Portnoy, Iván D; Vasquez, Ricardo S; Sanjuan, Marco E.","Garcia, Jesus (Department of Mechanical Engineering.

On the other hand, the negative partition coefficient indicated that the solubility of the complex on the hydrogel chains is carried out even with changes in temperature. Also, the presence of deprotonation generated an increase in hydrogel swelling. Finally, the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital orbitals indicated the presence of a molecular flow in the valence and conduction bands during the adsorption of complex, then these results indicate that is possibly designing a drug delivery system.Graphical abstract",,,Polymer Bulletin,,,,2018-10-08,2018,2018-10-08,2019-07,76,7,3423-3435,Closed,Article,"Delgadillo Armendariz, Nancy Liliana; Rangel Vázquez, Norma Aurea; Marquez Brazon, Edgar","Delgadillo Armendariz, Nancy Liliana (Tecnológico Nacional de México/I.T., Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico); Rangel Vázquez, Norma Aurea (Tecnológico Nacional de México/I.T., Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico); Marquez Brazon, Edgar (Departamento de Química y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Rangel Vázquez, Norma Aurea (Tecnológico Nacional de México/I.T., Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico)","Delgadillo Armendariz, Nancy Liliana (Tecnológico Nacional de México/I.T., Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico); Rangel Vázquez, Norma Aurea (Tecnológico Nacional de México/I.T., Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico); Marquez Brazon, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",1,0,,0.12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107487155,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

Tensile properties and hardness were measured to determine the mechanical properties, and the effect of the welding parameters. Heating and cooling cycles of differential scanning calorimetry were used to establish thermal properties. Microstructure observations complemented experimental observations. Results showed that tensile strength, hardness, and crystallinity decreased when rotational speed was increased, while the welding speed effect was weak. Deleterious phenomena on molecular structure of the stir region were explained by means combination of selected welding parameters and the material flow during the process.",The authors wish to thank Universidad Autónoma del Caribe for its financial support for this research through project CONV-I-004-P012.

However, in spite of the importance of the microbial populations involved in these processes, little is known about their response or adaptation to osmotic stress. In order to investigate the response to osmotic stress in these microorganisms, six species of acidophilic bacteria were grown at elevated osmotic strength in liquid media, and the compatible solutes synthesised were identified using ion chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Trehalose was identified as one of, or the sole, compatible solute in all species and strains, apart from Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans where glucose and proline levels increased at elevated osmotic potentials. Several other potential compatible solutes were tentatively identified by MALDITOF analysis. The same compatible solutes were produced by these bacteria regardless of the salt used to produce the osmotic stress. The results correlate with data from sequenced genomes which confirm that many chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic acidophiles possess genes for trehalose synthesis. This is the first report to identify and quantify compatible solutes in acidophilic bacteria that have important roles in biomining technologies.",,,Journal of Microbiology,,,"Acidithiobacillus; Adaptation, Physiological; Bacteria; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Culture Media; Osmotic Pressure; Trehalose; Water",2018-09-28,2018,2018-09-28,2018-10,56,10,727-733,Closed,Article,"Galleguillos, Pedro A.; Grail, Barry M.; Hallberg, Kevin B.; Demergasso, Cecilia S.; Johnson, D.

1502,pub.1104047947,10.1111/jbi.13350,,,Iriarteeae palms tracked the uplift of Andean Cordilleras,"Abstract  Aim The high biodiversity of northern South America is unparalleled and includes several centres of diversity such as Amazonia, the Andes and the Chocó. Movement of lineages amongst and within these bioregions is thought to be rare, and the effect of those dispersals on the distribution, diversity, and community assembly remains poorly understood. Here we address these effects by studying divergence times, biogeographical history, and species diversification of the palm tribe Iriarteeae, an ecologically dominant forest component.   Location Central and South America.   Methods  We developed a calibrated phylogeny and a spatially explicit diversification model that incorporates molecular and fossil data. In these analyses, we included a new fossil Iriartea species Gemmamonocolpites galeanoana , derived from new samples of Miocene deposits in western Amazonia. We also estimated the geographical range evolution of lineages and tested whether speciation and extinction rates were affected by dispersal events using a simulation approach in Cla SSE .    Results Dispersal amongst bioregions was not evenly distributed across the topology. We found that Amazonian communities are overdispersed across the phylogeny, whereas Andean taxa are clustered. Dispersal events were associated with increases in species diversification and were concomitant with periods of Andean uplift. Migration into montane areas occurred several times from lowland Amazonian ancestors, and montane taxa subsequently recolonized the Amazonian bioregion.   Main conclusions Our results suggest that the diversification of Iriarteeae palms closely followed the west‐to‐east surface uplift history of the Northern Andes. From an early, lowland Amazonian ancestor, the first diversification events took place in the earliest emerging mountain chain, the Western Cordillera. From there multiple range expansions followed eastwards and back into the lowlands. This study demonstrates how geological events within a single mountain range can affect the geographical expansion and diversification of lineages.",,,Journal of Biogeography,,,,2018-05-17,2018,2018-05-17,2018-07,45,7,1653-1663,Closed,Article,"Bacon, Christine D.; Velásquez‐Puentes, Francisco J.; Hoorn, Carina; Antonelli, Alexandre","Bacon, Christine D.

1482,pub.1107273311,10.1007/s11051-018-4368-2,,,Number concentrations and size distributions of nanoparticles during the use of hand tools in refurbishment activities,"Hand tools, such as a sledgehammer, are widely used in refurbishment activities; nonetheless, there is very little knowledge on nanoparticle generation. We measured particle number size distributions (PSDs) and concentrations (PNCs) in the 10–420 nm using a NanoScan scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) during the use of hand tools (i.e., sanding and removal of wall) in a real indoor refurbishment environment. Results indicated that refurbishment activities from removal of wall increased average PNCs by ~ 6 times over the background while it was ~ 1.5 times higher than sanding. The highest total PNC was 1.9 × 105 particles cm−3 that corresponded to removal of wall activities. For sanding activities, PNC was lower as the coat of the plaster was probably slightly wet. Moreover, comparison between the two principal activities showed a similar peak in the accumulation mode (~ 65 nm), with a monomodal pattern. Results suggest that removal of wall activities emitted nanoparticles with a 59% of contribution in the Aitken mode. According to these data, it can be inferred that the application of hand tools in refurbishment activities generates lower total PNC than using electromechanical equipment. This study may contribute to our understanding of nanoparticle generation in refurbishment activities.Graphical abstractᅟ",,The authors thank FAPERGS and CNPq for the financial support.,Journal of Nanoparticle Research,,,,2018-09-27,2018,2018-09-27,2018-10,20,10,264,Closed,Article,"De Paoli, Fabrício; Agudelo-Castañeda, Dayana M.; Teixeira, Elba C.; Silva, Luis F.

This situation is due to the existing and increasing pressure under industrial activities that follow a linear economy model based on design, manufacture, use and final disposal. As a feasible solution, Circular Economy (CE) model is considered a key strategy to enhance the overall sustainability performance of products, including strategies to improve the useful life of products and close flows of material in a circular path. In the measurement of circularity, existing sustainability indicators are oriented solely to single products and do not consider the product family approach, which involves the use of a common product platform comprised by constructive components or modules able to generate different product variants to satisfy a variety of customer requirements. Consequently, this paper proposes six indicators regarding material flow, reusability, reconfiguration, and functional performance. Such indicators are focused on measuring the circularity of product families respect the circularity of components among their product variants. A case study based on a family of prosthetic fingers is developed to demonstrate the implementation and usefulness of the proposed set of indicators.",This work was supported by COLCIENCIAS through the PhD.

The supports were prepared by one-pot coprecipitation from soluble precursors. The XRF analysis of the catalysts showed that the contents of Mo and Ni increased slightly with the presence of Nb. Micropore area and pore volume augmented importantly with Nb content, resulting in pore diameters between 5.3 and 9.3 nm. XPS analysis showed that the presence of Nb decreases the active metal–support interaction, improving the Mo and Ni sulfidation degree. The Raman spectra of sulfided catalysts suggested an increase in the number of layers of MoS2 in the presence of Nb. Generally, the thiophene HDS activity at normal pressure of sulfided NiMo6/Al2O3–Nb2O5(8) was greater than that of the sulfided catalysts with x = 0, 1, and 4 wt% Nb, which can be attributed to the Nb promotion that would have an effect on the type of active site (Brønsted or Lewis acidic sites), since the number of sites by CO chemisorption for sulfided NiMo6/Al2O3–Nb2O5(x) did not show correlation with the catalytic activity. The high-pressure HDS activity of dibenzothiophene was also greater in the presence of Nb, and the hydrogenation route was preferred for the Nb-promoted solid, while the unpromoted one showed a larger yield of direct desulfurization products.",The authors would like to acknowledge financial support to Universidad del Atlántico-Colombia (through Project CB21-FGI2016 “7ma Convocatoria 2016”).

These have recently been evaluated as potential α-glucosidase inhibitors. Consequently, we proposed a quantitative 3D structure–activity relationships in order to obtain predictive models of the biological activity. Two types of descriptors were used for the modelling: quantum chemical and multi-linear algebraic maps. The first one was obtained by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) at the M06/6-311++G(d,p) level, while for the second, attribute sets were obtained by using 3D molecular topology, atom weighed by physicochemical properties including the polar surface area, hardness, softness, van der Waals volume and charges. A genetic algorithm scheme was employed to determine the best subset of attributes for the application of the multiple linear regression. The most robust model (M4R_TD) was obtained with four multi-linear algebraic map descriptors (R2 = 0.946, Q2 = 0.901, F = 85.70), which indicate a good correlation between experimental and calculated results. Seven new simple structural modifications in the molecular core were suggested specifically for the three most active compounds (1, 2 and 5). The modifications to compound 1 appear to lead to an increase in the predicted activity from a pIC50 value of 9.872 to 10.656 in compound 1.3. The modifications to compound 2 do not affect an increase in the biological activity, and finally the modifications to compound 5 seem to increase the activity with a predicted pIC50= log[10/(10−6×IC50)]IC50 value of 10.094 for compound 5.1.",We are grateful to USFQ Poligrants 2017–2018 for the financial support for this research.

Arsenic sources may be natural or anthropogenic, and the mobility of the element is ruled by physicochemical conditions that also define the dominant As species in the environment. Arsenic levels are evaluated in various abiotic and biotic environmental samples. The highest As levels are observed in sediment, from where it may be mobilized into the aquifers. This article reviews studies about As in the world but with emphasis on studies performed in Brazil, a country where continental water bodies are a common geographic feature. We reviewed 64 studies published between 1985 and 2016. The results indicate that in recent years more studies have been conducted to determine As levels in foods and human samples as a tool to evaluate the exposure of populations and identify potential sources. In Brazil, the main problems associated with contamination with As are the use of wood preservatives and herbicides as well as the impact caused by mining. Also, the precarious character of sewage treatment systems contributes to the contamination of water bodies.","The authors thank the Laboratory of Environmental Sciences of the State University of the North of Rio de Janeiro (Laboratório de Ciências Ambientais, LCA, da Universidade Estadual Norte Fluminense, UENF) for the field and laboratory logistics.

A best–worst scaling survey was developed to compare the importance of eight different attributes of the built environment regarding walkability. Model results show an asymmetry negative–positive in the judgment and choice of built environment characteristics that promote and impede walkability. The most important barriers, obtained from worst responses, are connectivity, topography, sidewalk surface and absence of policemen. Walkability scores were computed for different neighbourhoods and different policy scenarios were forecasted. Simulation results from the worst responses indicate that improvements in sidewalk quality, along with an increase in the number of police officers, lead to an 85% increase in the walkability score for the lower income neighbourhoods.","The authors thank the CNPQ for the financial support provided from project 407630/2016-3.

Although the current mechanistic empirical pavement design guide uses axle load spectra to characterize the traffic variable for pavement design purposes, pavements around the world continue to be designed using the equivalency single axle load concept, which is based on the static load of the vehicles (dead weight). However, the dynamic loads induced by roughness can be considerably higher than the static load in specific locations of a pavement section, causing an unexpected adverse impact on the performance of pavement structures. In the present investigation, the effects of both pavement roughness and vehicle speed on the dynamic loads developed at the tire pavement interface are evaluated along with their effects on the performance of pavement structures. In order to achieve the above objective, 787 pavement profiles were analyzed, combining rural and urban environments, as well as rigid and flexible pavement sections. The dynamic load produced at the tire pavement interface for all pavement profiles was modeled. Two roughness indices, The International Roughness Index (IRI) and the Dynamic Load Index (DLI), were determined for each profile. A correlation model between the IRI and the DLI was developed. Additionally, a Traffic Correction Factor (TCF) was proposed to account for the dynamic load effects induced by roughness and vehicle speed. The proposed TCF could be used to modify the estimation of traffic damage on road sections with high roughness levels, therefore improving future performance prediction processes. Finally, a methodology to calculate the reduction of the remaining life of a pavement structure due to the surface roughness was proposed.",,,Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering,,,,2018-07-03,2018,2018-07-03,2019-05,44,5,4339-4348,Closed,Article,"Goenaga, Boris; Fuentes, Luis; Mora, Otto","Goenaga, Boris (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5.

These studies have shown that jurisdictional politics helped hold together large empires but also fostered change in the relationship between rulers and their subjects. Following this scholarship, this paper analyzes a series of jurisdictional conflicts that involved free people of African descent in eighteenth-century Colombia. It focuses on black men who worked in the navigation of Colombia’s main fluvial artery, the Magdalena River. Known as bogas, their free status and their high spatial mobility posed several challenges to local and viceregal authorities, who did not agree over what status bogas had, nor which court had jurisdiction over them. Bogas, well aware of the intricacies of jurisdictional politics, took advantage of these interstices evading either municipal or royal authorities in order to defend their lifestyles. In doing so, they claimed identifications as corporative subjects with privileges. The article shows, then, that notions of and practices around legal pluralism were not just abstractions. On the contrary, they shaped, in fundamental ways, the relationship between the Spanish monarchy and its subjects of African descent.","*I wish to thank Gabriel Paquette, Ben Vinson III, Franklin Knight, Rachel O´Toole, María Portuondo, Marcela Echeverri, Manuel Lucena, Nelson González, Julian Velasco, Guillermo García, Lauren MacDonald, Norah Andrews, Joe Clark, Brandi Walters, the Grupo de Historia Colonial at Universidad de los Andes, and the anonymous reviewer for their insightful comments.

We focus on the institutional individualism–collectivism orientation of nations and the presence of nascent entrepreneurs as moderators of this relationship to account for the multilayered nature of the context. We observe that for individuals with entrepreneurial self-efficacy the positive effect of knowing nascent entrepreneurs as a driver of entrepreneurial intentions is weaker than for individuals who do not believe to be able to successfully launch a business venture.

Mexico's integration with global production chains, however, has failed to produce sustained output and productivity growth. In this paper we propose an explanation for slow growth that hinges on the negative demand externalities of input outsourcing. We make two contributions. First, using input–output data we show that outsourcing has lowered domestic demand for the manufacturing sector, especially for capital-intensive basic industries. Second, we develop a model of outsourcing and capital accumulation and show that lower costs of outsourcing can hurt accumulation if, for the aggregate manufacturing sector, the negative effect of domestic demand shortfalls on profitability exceeds the offsetting effects of lower input costs and of export expansion. Our findings complement the broader literature on the apparent paradox of Mexico's success as an exporter of manufactures amid sluggish growth.","We would like to acknowledge the helpful comments made by seminar participants at the 2016 Eastern Economic Association Meeting (Washington, DC), Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla, Colombia), the 2016 New Developmentalism Workshop (Sao Paulo, Brazil), the 2016 LACEA-LAMES meeting (Medellin, Colombia), and the 2017 Analytical Political Economy Workshop (London).",,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,,,,2018-12,2018,,2018-12,47,,96-113,Closed,Article,"de Souza, João Paulo A.; Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo","de Souza, João Paulo A.

We construct a Historical Index of Human Development (HIHD) for Colombia for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and find modest advances in the index during the nineteenth century, life expectancy being the dimension that contributed most to the Colombian Human Development Index in that century. In contrast, all HIHD components exhibited significant advances during the twentieth century. In particular, social dimensions were the main contributors to a growing Human Development Index in Colombia, and life expectancy was the main driver for both men and women. These achievements are mainly explained by the role of public policies aimed at the improvement of education and health. Next, since life expectancy was the dimension that most contributed to human development in the long run, we empirically examine the role of improvements in the provision of public utilities in the significant reduction of mortality. Our hypothesis is that the reduction of mortality was largely brought about by improvements in the provision of aqueducts and sewerage. To this end, we construct a new dataset using statistics reported by the Colombian government, which included annual information on the main diseases and causes of mortality during the 1916–2014 period disaggregated by departments. Econometric results show that the decline in mortality rates, especially those related to some waterborne diseases, was significantly related to the expansion of aqueducts and sewerage services in the country.","We thank an anonymous referee and the journal editor (Claude Diebolt) for their valuable comments.

Textural analysis reveals a predominance of mud, especially in the mangrove zone, which at the same time showed higher contents of salts, organic carbon (total carbon is assumed to be total organic carbon due to the nearly total lack of carbonates), total nitrogen and total sulfur, and also a higher acidity. C/N and C/S ratios ranged from 10.7 to 16.6 and from 2.5 to 10.4 respectively in the analyzed mangrove sediments. The results indicate that the sedimentary organic content of the Swamp of Mallorquin would derived from mixed sources (e.g. algal, terrestrial and sewage), and that depositional processes in recent years have taken place under marine and brackish conditions. While mangrove sediments have been considered efficient records of environmental changes (e.g. sources and cycle of organic matter, depositional environments and paleosalinity), this study found that mangrove plants affect such records by modifying the chemistry and the distribution patterns of some variables such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in their surrounding sediments.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the universities Atlantic, Cordoba and Vigo for their valuable help to carry out the Analyzes of this work.

Timing of phylogenetic splits of lowland restricted lineages on either side of the Andes could provide information on the timing of montane uplift and associated climatic changes. The timing of the arrival and diversification of organisms restricted to specific climatic regimes at a particular altitude can provide information on the age at which mountains reached a height adequate for that climate once corrected for global climate changes. As a model for study, we discuss how dated phylogenies in biome rich Colombia may contribute to an understanding of geological and climatic change in north‐western South America. Lowland wet forest restricted lineages separated from the mid‐Miocene, whereas lineages primarily restricted to mid‐altitude cloud forests began to diversify from the mid‐ to late‐Miocene and the majority of high‐altitude Páramo lineages began to diversify during the Pliocene. The age of diversification of altitudinally restricted lineages therefore gives an indication of the age at which particular altitudes may have been reached.",The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is supported by the Scottish Government&#x27;s Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division and during 2017 is grateful for the support of players of the People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery towards its scientific research.,,Geological Journal,,I.

The seismic shakings were meant to crudely simulate the seismic history of field deposits in some very seismically active zones in California. The technique estimates shear stresses and strains based on acceleration and pore pressure recorded using a vertical array of sensors in the deposit. A constitutive model was implemented to identify optimal material parameters controlling the contractive behavior of the soil based on the recorded response of all shakings. It was found that the seismic history of soil deposits plays an important role in determining the contractive tendency of the material, significantly influencing the pore pressure response of the deposit. That is, the seismic history can reduce or increase the resistance of a deposit to contraction and liquefaction.",,,Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,,,,2018-11,2018,,2018-11,114,,215-224,Closed,Article,"El-Sekelly, W.; Mercado, V.; Abdoun, T.; Dobry, R.; Sepulveda, A.","El-Sekelly, W.

The purpose of this study is to propose a new method for evaluating the spatial variation of SO2 levels in the Metropolitan Area of Porto Alegre (MAPA). This method included use of Chi-square test to better identify the origin of SO2 sources. Additionally, results of the different methods applied allowed to analyze the temporal SO2 levels and their association with meteorological parameters. SO2 at five sampling sites (Esteio, Canoas, Charqueadas, Triunfo, and Gravataí) were measured during 2010–2015; using fluorescence SO2 automated analyzers. Results showed that Charqueadas had the highest average concentration (~ 15 μg m−3), followed by Triunfo (13 μg m−3), Esteio (6 μg m−3), Canoas (3 μg m−3), and Gravataí (2 μg m−3). Chi-square test applied to SO2, and wind direction quadrants showed significant contribution of local emission sources. Seasonal variation revealed higher SO2 levels on cold days for most of the studied sites, except for Esteio site. Day-wise variations revealed higher SO2 concentration on weekdays than weekends for Esteio and Canoas sites, indicating traffic influence especially during the rush-hours. Annual averages analysis identified an increasing trend in SO2 concentrations, implying that applied emission control systems and technological improvement of engines and fuels were not sufficient and thus points out a need for better subsidies mechanisms to pollutant control and effective emission reduction strategies that decision makers, including environmental agencies, must make priority by considering the local realities.",The authors thank the FAPERGS and CNPq for the financial support to this work.,,"Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health",,,,2018-05-22,2018,2018-05-22,2018-08,11,7,801-813,Closed,Article,"Landim, A.

Prevalence study of rheumatic disease in Colombian population older than 18 years,"Introduction Rheumatic diseases are the leading cause of permanent disability. The COPCORD model is an effective tool in the determination of the prevalence of diseases. The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of rheumatic disease in a Colombian population over 18 years of age. Methods A prevalence study was carried out using a probabilistic method of stratified random sampling in three stages: cartographic sectors in each city, selection of the blocks of each sector, and the households of each block. The COPCORD questionnaire adapted for Colombia was applied by standardized interviewers. Confirmation of the diagnosis was made by a rheumatologist with access to all the information. Results Out of a total of 6693 patients that completed the questionnaire, 64% were women. Pain not associated with trauma was reported by 48% of the participants. The most frequent locations were: knees 35%, hands 26%, lumbar spine 20%, and shoulders 16%. Non-specific skeletal muscle discomfort, osteoarthritis, regional appendicular syndrome, and non-inflammatory low back pain, were the most prevalent diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammatory low back pain were the most common inflammatory conditions. The prevalence of Chikungunya fever was estimated at 6.68%. Conclusion The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in Colombia is higher than commonly reported, lower than for fibromyalgia and gout, and similar for osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and spondyloarthritis. In Colombia these diseases are a public health problem without awareness of their impact on the general population.","In its realization, specialized institutions were committed in each of its fields: the Colombian Association of Rheumatology, which economically supported the development of the project; the University of La Sabana, that gave the methodological and academic support, and the National Consulting Center, which conducted the fieldwork in 6 different cities of the country.

Since the 2003 UNESCO proclamation of this carnival as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, the celebration has gained national and international attention, while the city has developed a whole cultural market around it. This essay traces the evolution of a popular costume and street performance that carries racial stereotypes and as such, has become almost emblematic of carnival time itself. La Negrita Puloy de Montecristo is now the only female symbol of the Barranquilla Carnival. It is argued in this essay that as long as blackness is performed during the regulated time of carnival, lived by the city as an illusion of racial integration and black pride, the consciousness of inequality stays dormant and inequality continues being a quotidian practice in a supposedly tri-racial nation that was funded on the principles of mixture. This essay is the product of a research project that lasted a year and combined ethnographic and archival work. Las Negritas Puloy de Montecristo perform exclusion annually, as they intend to paradoxically perform inclusion. This very popular carnival manifestation seems to be a sign that only as stereotype can the sexualized black woman participate in the public sphere. As the mulata, she is a sexual object. As a slave, she is forgotten.

In some developing countries, depending on the characteristics of the city, instead of cycling or walking, captive users opt for informal services to commute. Although they are less safe and possibly less comfortable than regulated BRT services, demand for informal services such as motorcycle taxis has grown in recent years, affecting the self-sustainability of some BRT systems. This research aims to provide a richer explanation of the choice process between the BRT feeder service and motorcycle taxis in the context of the City of Bucaramanga, Colombia. Initially, we analyzed a set of effect indicators by diverging stacked bar charts, and then we used a hybrid discrete choice model to incorporate comfort and safety perceptions, in addition to the tangible attributes traditionally used. We found that safety perception, which varies by gender, age and income, is a key variable in modeling the choice process. Based on an empirical chart analysis and the modeling results, we proposed some policies aimed at changing user choices to stimulate the demand for BRT feeder system.",,,Transport Policy,,,,2018-01,2018,,2018-01,61,,1-9,Closed,Article,"Márquez, Luis; Pico, Ricardo; Cantillo, Víctor","Márquez, Luis (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia, Colombia); Pico, Ricardo (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Colombia); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia)","Márquez, Luis (Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia); Pico, Ricardo (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Cantillo, Víctor (Universidad del Norte)",22,4,,5.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092235487,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

1292,pub.1100913534,10.1115/1.4039255,,,Multivariate closed control loop methodology for heliostat aiming manipulation in solar central receiver systems,"Maintaining receiver’s thermal stresses and corrosion below the material limits are issues that need careful attention in solar thermal towers. Both depend on heliostats’ aiming points over the central receiver and available direct solar radiation at any instant. Since this technology relies on an unavoidable time-changing resource, aiming points need to be properly manipulated to avoid excessive hot spots. This paper proposes a new aiming point strategy based on a multivariable model predictive control (MPC) approach. It shows an alternative approach by introducing an agent-based group behavior over heliostats’ subsets, which makes possible either concentrating or dispersing solar radiation as required by the MPC algorithm. Simulated results indicate that it is feasible to develop a closed-loop control procedure that distributes solar irradiance over the central receiver according to the predefined heat flux limits. The performance of the proposed approach is also compared with the results found in the available literature that uses a different methodology.",,,Journal of Solar Energy Engineering,,,,2018-03-13,2018,2018-03-13,2018-06-01,140,3,,Closed,Article,"Garcia, Jesus; Too, Yen C.

The 10‐vertex case is still unsolved. In this paper we study the size of the automorphism group of a graph on  vertices to estimate the Euler characteristic of monotone nonevasive graph properties. We get some conditions on graphs that such graph properties must contain. We also do this by means of Oliver groups and give a new lower bound for the dimension of the simplicial complex associated with a nontrivial monotone nonevasive graph property. We apply our results to graphs on 10 vertices to get conditions on potential counterexamples to the evasiveness conjecture in the 10‐vertex case.,"The first author acknowledges and thanks the financial support of the grant P12.160422.004/01‐ FAPA Andres Angel from Vicedecanatura de Investigaciones de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia.

The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is used to estimate the direct influence between strategic objectives, and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is used to obtain a matrix containing the full influences (direct and indirect) between those factors. Finally, a criterion is used to select those relationships that are important enough to be considered in the Impact-relation map defined by DEMATEL. The literature shows some cases in which ANP and DEMATEL are combined to build a strategy map; however, they are used in a completely different way from how they are utilized in the method proposed in this paper. As an illustration, the method is applied in a manufacturing company.","This work was supported by the Department of Research Technology (Project DICYT-U. of Santiago, N° 061817QL) and the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Santiago of Chile.",,Computers & Industrial Engineering,,,,2018-04,2018,,2018-04,118,,170-179,Closed,Article,"Quezada, Luis E.; López-Ospina, Héctor A.; Palominos, Pedro I.; Oddershede, Astrid M.","Quezada, Luis E.

It is aimed for 6 to 12 year old children at risk. During the scholastic year 2015–2016, 151 children from three schools in two poor districts of Lima (Peru) participated in the program. In this paper, we examine the impact of various components of program implementation related to psychological well-being and child labour. The qualitative description of the program is based on the participant observation of the 151 children, their families and their teachers. Sixty percent of the participants were boys and 40% girls, all between 8 and 13 years (M = 10.38, DT = 1.22). In a second phase, we collected longitudinal quantitative indicators of innovation, dosage and responsiveness of participants within a group of 36 children who took part throughout a 10 months implementation program in two schools in Villa El Salvador. We describe the process of transfer and adaptation of the program in Peru, from previous experiences in other Latin American countries. Qualitative observation allowed us to document the influence of organizational dynamics and the relationship with families for the proper functioning of the program. The results showed a significant improvement in the responsiveness of the stakeholders in the second phase of the program. Participants positively improved their attitude towards peers and program facilitators, as well as, continued to assist to the workshops. In the discussion, we propose that part of the improvement could be attributed to the reorganization in smaller groups in the program sessions. Small group intervention seems to increase the intensity of implementation. Hence, we explored to what extent small-scale intervention indirectly contributes to improve academic outcomes, psychological adjustment and child labour.",,,Applied Research in Quality of Life,,,,2018-03-29,2018,2018-03-29,2019-07,14,3,617-636,Closed,Article,"Márquez, Esperanza; Holgado, Daniel; Maya-Jariego, Isidro","Márquez, Esperanza (Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain); Holgado, Daniel (Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain); Maya-Jariego, Isidro (Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain)","Maya-Jariego, Isidro (University of Seville)","Márquez, Esperanza (University of Seville); Holgado, Daniel (University of Seville); Maya-Jariego, Isidro (University of Seville)",4,0,,2.26,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101831327,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

However, the findings in the literature are mixed in this regard, with some researchers providing evidence in favour of this association and some findings evidence against it. Given that perceived economic inequality and endorsement of system-justifying beliefs are related to increased inequality acceptance, we explore the interplay between them in relation to support for redistribution. This study is intended to shed light on the role of utopian standards (ideal estimates about what ought to be) as one mechanism that affects the relationship between perceived greater economic inequality and support for redistribution. Based on correlational data (N = 794), we conducted a conditional process analysis and found that perceived greater inequality displayed a negative indirect effect on support for redistribution, through acceptance of ideal level of economic inequality: Perception of higher inequality was related to increased ideal levels of inequality and thus with lower support for redistribution. In addition, we found that economic system-justifying beliefs conditioned the effect of perceived economic inequality in two ways: First, perceived economic inequality was positively associated with higher acceptance of inequality, and this association was stronger for those that justified the economic system more, and perceived greater inequality was associated with higher support for redistribution—but only for those who endorsed lower levels of economic system justification beliefs. These findings provide evidence that perceived greater economic inequality does not in itself lead to a push for more redistribution; rather, utopian standards such as ideal estimates of economic inequality, which are conditioned by system-justifying ideologies.","This project was funded thanks to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias, Colombia) through a scholarship given to the first author (Grant-679), and the PSI2016-78839-P MINECO (Spain) grant given to second and third authors.

An Exploration of Issues Reflected on by CELTA Candidates,"The current study aimed to investigate whether the intensive Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA), which certifies teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), is better viewed as a teacher development or a teacher training course. Qualitative content analysis was carried out on the written reflective assignments of CELTA course participants on several courses where the researcher worked as a tutor. The data was subsequently triangulated using semi-structured qualitative interviews. From these data, four main themes emerged as significant: Teacher Learning, General Pedagogic Knowledge, Teaching Skills and Teaching Language, and the Learner Element. A closer analysis of the categories within these themes reveals a tension between a view of teacher development as “training” and a view of teacher development as “education”. To ensure that the course places a greater emphasis on teacher development, CELTA tutors can encourage less focus on the teaching techniques acquired during the course and more focus on the appropriacy of such techniques with particular classes and in certain contexts by redesigning the reflective prompts which form the basis of the written reflection assignment on the course, and by modelling reflective practice throughout the course.","Many thanks to all my research participants, who have all embarked on their own reflective journeys in different contexts and settings, without whom this research would not have been possible.

At the same time, retirement produces several life-style modifications that significantly influence well-being and can lead to depression. Thereby, this study aimed to estimate the association between retirement and depression incidence in Mexican older adults from a population-based cohort and to evaluate its potential effect modifiers. The cohort was assembled using SAGE-Mexico waves 0 and 1 (baseline and follow-up, respectively), and included individuals who at wave 0 were 53+ years and not depressed, and those who had a follow-up. Retirement was assessed in wave 0 by creating three categories: working; retired; and can’t retire; covariates were also ascertained in wave 0. Incidence of depression was measured in wave 1 by means of self-report of a medical diagnosis of depression and of the use of an algorithm based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) adjusted for all the covariates; additionally, interaction terms were constructed to explore a potential effect modification given by marital status, income quintile, health insurance tenure and multimorbidity. The analytic sample consisted of 820 participants; the 8-year depression incidence was 12.20%; and being retired increased the risk of depression in those older adults who did not have a permanent partner (RR: 4.52; CI 95% 1.30–15.76). The results obtained in this study indicate that the association between retirement and depression in Mexican older adults depends on the context surrounding the retirement transition.",This paper uses data from the WHO World Health Surveys / Multi-Country Survey Study (as appropriate) and from WHO’s Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE).

Why do some groups refrain from fighting, while others operate in the incessantly violent underworld? To explain this puzzle, we propose that the underworld conflict is related to the strategies of extra-legal governance adopted by OCGs. We suggest that such strategies have origins in the availability of resources within the groups reach at their entrance into the underworld. More specifically, OCGs with access to easily extractable resources develop limited governance, which leaves them vulnerable to internal and external challenges. OCGs without access to easily extractable resources invest in extended governance, reducing their risk of underworld conflict.

                    We document for the first time Miocene corals from the Siamaná and Jimol formations of the Cocinetas Basin in La Guajira Peninsula, northern Colombia. This is the first of two contributions dedicated to the description and detailed illustration of morphospecies collected during two scientific expeditions (2011, 2014) to the remote region. Here we report coral morphospecies attributed to the families Acroporidae, Agathiphylliidae, Astrocoeniidae, Caryophylliidae, Diploastraeidae, Merulinidae, and Montastraeidae. Eighteen species belonging to these seven families, included in nine genera, are described. Fifteen species are assigned to established taxa, while three remain in open nomenclature. Of the species identified, only
                    Montastraea cavernosa
                    (Linnaeus, 1767) exists today. The coral taxa described are typical of the Oligocene–Miocene transition and were important components of shallow-water reefs in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico region during this period. The occurrence of

The first outbreak had its onset after a thermal inversion, when the canaries exhibited clinical signs that included dyspnea, conjunctivitis, cyanosis, and death. The clinical progression of the disease, on average, lasted 2 days, and lead to a 40% loss of birds within the aviary. In the second outbreak the canaries also went through a thermal inversion, ending up with several cases of sudden death (60% of mortality) in a period of 24 hours. Canaries from both aviaries were submitted for microbiological evaluation, where isolates of Pasteurella multocida multocida, which were resistant to sulfonamide, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin, were identified. After the analyzing the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, canaries in both aviaries were treated with amoxicillin.

The numerical analyses were performed through the construction of three-dimensional 3D Boundary Value Problems constructed with the software Abaqus Standard. Several values for the foundation embedment and separation between footings were considered. The behavior of the granular soil was simulated through an extended Drucker–Prager constitutive model. The results were used to calibrate an extended bearing capacity equation through a multiple variable regression analysis, and accounts for the effect of the embedment depth and separation between footings. Finally, the proposed relation was compared with some reported values in the literature, including experimental tests and numerical results, and showed a better agreement with the experimental data than other reported studies.","The authors appreciate the financial support given by COLCIENCIAS (Colombia) for the Project with Code 1215748-59323 from the convocation 748-2016, and the one given by the Bolivar Department (Colombia) and administered by CeiBA, through the scholarship “Bolivar wins with science”.",,Geotechnical and Geological Engineering,,,,2018-09-07,2018,2018-09-07,2019-06,37,3,1401-1410,Closed,Article,"Fuentes, William; Duque, José; Lascarro, Carlos; Gil, Melany","Fuentes, William (University del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Duque, José (University del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lascarro, Carlos (University del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gil, Melany (University del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Fuentes, William (Universidad del Norte)","Fuentes, William (Universidad del Norte); Duque, José (Universidad del Norte); Lascarro, Carlos (Universidad del Norte); Gil, Melany (Universidad del Norte)",12,5,,2.27,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106855670,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

By an in silico analysis of the primary structure of IL-8 from Oncorhynchus mykiss and salmo salar, it was evidenced that γ-core motif was present, as in the vast majority of kinocidins. The α-helix domain of IL-8 (αIL-8) was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and showed a tendency to form an α-helix conformation, as revealed by circular dichroism. Additionally, it was demonstrated that αIL-8 from both species showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Membrane permeabilization and co-localization assay, as well as scanning electron microscopy, showed that these peptides were accumulated on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm, suggesting that they were capable of permeabilizing and disrupt the bacterial membranes and interact with cytoplasmic components. Our results represent the first analysis on the antimicrobial function of IL-8-derived peptide from salmonids.","This work was funded by PostDoctoral FONDECYT Project N° 3150678, Chile.",,Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,,,"Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Fish Proteins; Humans; Interleukin-8; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Domains; Salmonidae; Sequence Alignment",2018-03-13,2018,2018-03-13,2018-04,498,4,803-809,Closed,Article,"Santana, Paula A.; Salinas, Nicolás; Álvarez, Claudio A.; Mercado, Luis A.; Guzmán, Fanny","Santana, Paula A.

During disaster response operations, the degraded functionality of the system can negatively impact the affected population because disrupting relief activitiesincreases human suffering resulting from the lack of access to essential goods or services. Mathematical formulations for assessing transportation network vulnerability do not generally consider this lack of access or deprivation costs, and can lead to inappropriate strategies for humanitarian assistance. This paper proposes a transportation network vulnerability assessment model that allows identifying critical links for the development of high impact disaster response operations. The model is based on an economic analysis that considers the logistical costs of the distribution operations and the external effects derived from the delays in the provision of basic supplies (deprivation costs). The approach is particularly useful for planning resilient disaster response plans in the preparednessstage, prioritizing investment for mitigation and adaptation, and prioritizing the rehabilitation (access restoration) of the disrupted links in the response and recovery stages. In addition to numerical experiments using case study networks, the authors implemented the model to the coffee-producing region of Colombia, which was hit by an earthquake in 1999.","This research was partially funded by the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) Science’s project “Integrated Humanitarian Logistics System for Developing Countries” (PGA-2000003441), by the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (SVG-2015-02) and Colciencias (Cod 1215-675-47211).",,Networks and Spatial Economics,,,,2018-01-17,2018,2018-01-17,2019-03,19,1,243-273,Closed,Article,"Cantillo, Victor; Macea, Luis F.; Jaller, Miguel","Cantillo, Victor (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Macea, Luis F.

Our results indicate that the intensity of the spin-flip precession is a direct consequence of the relaxed adsorption sites of the adatoms. We point out that d orbitals of Ni and Ir result in strong dependence on the spin-conserved and spin-flip transmission probabilities. In particular, we show that the presence of spin-orbit coupling can lead to an enhancement of the transmission probabilities especially around resonances arising due to weak coupling with specific orbitals.","This research received financial support from the Brazilian agencies CAPES, CNPq and FAPESP grant number 2012/24227-1.

However, this procedure presents some drawbacks since the MCU itself performs the communication tasks, using up part of the limited cycle time available for control. In this paper, a novel development system using the new dual core MCU trend is proposed and used to carry out the emulation of a whole renewable power plant. It takes advantage of two different and specialized microcontroller architectures, wherein a communication core monitors what the other core, a control DSP, is measuring, calculating, etc., and sends a large amount of data to a computer without disturbing the control cycle time. Also, since the MCU features a native Ethernet connection, the emulated power plant can even be controlled and monitored from afar.",,,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,,,,2018-06-19,2018,2018-06-19,,9,3,1328-1336,Closed,Article,"Ramirez, Dionisio; Venkataramanan, Giri","Ramirez, Dionisio (Department of Electrical Engineering, ETSI Industriales, Technical University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain); Venkataramanan, Giri (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison, Madison, WI, USA)",,"Ramirez, Dionisio (Technical University of Madrid); Venkataramanan, Giri (University of Wisconsin–Madison)",6,0,,1.58,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099729526,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

As a post-treatment of the advanced oxidation process, an additional adsorption process was carried out using a natural zeolite. Application of the UVsolar/O3/H2O2 process required 140 min of irradiation and the consumption of 0.67 g/L H2O2 to eliminate 56% and 17% of colour and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively. When adding persulfate to the system (UVsolar/O3/H2O2/S2O8-2), colour and COD were reduced by 29% and 77%, respectively, with a 0.2 g/L concentration of S2O8-2 requiring 250 min of irradiation time. In an experimental run with landfill leachate, adsorption post-treatment with a natural zeolite resulted in 36%, 99%, and 18% total reductions in COD, ammonium, and chloride, respectively. In another experimental run, adsorption with a zeolite was used as a pre-treatment for the advanced oxidation process (UVsolar/O3/H2O2 and UVsolar/O3/H2O2/S2O8-2). The results were similar to those for adsorption post-treatment, with 30%, 90%, and 20% total reductions in COD, ammonium, and chloride, respectively. Despite improvements, some measured parameters of treated landfill leachate still exceeded Chilean regulations for water quality. Furthermore, Lactuca sativa seeds did not germinate after irrigation with 100% treated landfill leachate or dilutions above 3%.

Method Quasi-experimental study approach with intervention group. Participants were 62 patients and their caregivers who consulted with a health care institution in the city of Girardot (Colombia). The intervention was carried out for one month, during which, measurements were performed before and after the programme. Results Most patients were elderly, diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension or COPD, 35% of them with some degree of dependency. The caregivers were mostly women, between the ages of 35 and 59 years old, domestic caregivers, and responsible for caring for their patients for between 13 and 24h a day. At the start of the programme the competency for care was low in both patients and caregivers, after the intervention there was a general increase in care and a statistically significant change. Also, at the beginning, 48% of caregivers had some level of burden, and after the study only 27% reported burden with care.

Here we quantified and described plastic fragments in the digestive tracts of 43 Easter Island flying fish (Cheilopogon rapanouiensis) and 50 yellowfin tunas (Thunnus albacares) from coastal waters around Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the South Pacific subtropical gyre, and of fish preyed upon by T. albacares. Overall, seven C. rapanouiensis (16%) individuals had ingested microplastics, most of which resembled the common planktonic prey of the fish. One microplastic was found in the gut of a fish ingested by a tuna, which indicates that trophic transfer may occur between tuna and prey. A single T. albacares (2%) had ingested five mesoplastics (15.2-26.3 mm) that were probably not mistaken for prey items, but rather accidentally ingested during foraging on fish prey. The absence of microplastics in T. albacares suggests that such small particles, if transferred from the prey, do not accumulate in the relatively large digestive tract of large predators. On the other hand, larger plastic items may accumulate in the gut of tunas, to which they may induce deleterious effects that still need to be examined. However, only a small portion of the fish had ingested mesoplastics. The results of this study suggest that microplastic contamination is not an immediate threat to large predatory fish, such as T. albacares, along the coast of Easter Island within the South Pacific subtropical gyre.","We are grateful to the fishermen from Rapa Nui who facilitated us with fish samples.

The aim of this work was to study the anticancer effects of three ruthenium complexes on a human gastric cancer cell line.
MAIN METHODS: We synthetized three [Ru(η6-anethole)(en)X]PF6 complexes, where (en) is ethylenediamine and X is Cl (1), Br (2) or I (3), which were then evaluated by MTT assay, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry on the human gastric cancer cell line AGS.
KEY FINDINGS: Compound 3 exhibited the highest cytotoxicity (IC50 = 11.27 ± 1.08 μM) of the series, with an activity almost three-fold more potent than the commercial drug cisplatin, and also revealed a 4.5-fold less potent cytotoxicity in the human normal gastric cell line GES-1. The exchange of the halogen (Cl, Br or I) on the organometallic compound slightly alters its solubility in PBS and lipophilicity (expressed as Log P). Studies of gene expression revealed that compound 3 induces a significant overexpression of the pro-apoptotic genes Caspase-3, PUMA and DIABLO in the gastric cancer cell line AGS after 6 h. In contrast, only PUMA was significantly overexpressed in the normal gastric cell line GES-1. Compound 3 induced the activation of multiple caspases in AGS cells: a sign of apoptosis. Characterization via single-crystal X-ray diffraction for compound 3 confirmed the key structural features for this type of organometallic complexes.

The aim of this work was to study the cytotoxic activity, and apoptosis induction of two new ruthenium complexes on a human gastric cancer cell line.
MAIN METHODS: Two ruthenium(II) complexes were synthesized: [(H2pbbzim)Ru(tpy-Ph-COOCH3)](Cl)2 (Ru-UCN1), and [(tpy)Ru(tpy-Ph-bzH)](Cl)2 (Ru-UCN3), and their anticancer capacity determined by cytotoxic assays, gene expression analysis, caspase activation and confocal microscopy.
KEY FINDINGS: Ru-UCN3 is more notably cytotoxic than cisplatin in human gastric cancer cells AGS at 24 h, while Ru-UCN1 is more active against gastric cancer cells than cisplatin at 48 h. The complexes induce apoptosis as shown by RT-qPCR, protease activity, and confocal microscopy. Ru-UCN1 induces the overexpression of pro-apoptotic genes at 3 and 6 h, whereas Ru-UCN3 induces overexpression of these genes at 12 and 24 h. Ru-UCN1 treatment shows a strong activation of caspases 3/7 at 24 h, which was not observed for Ru-UCN3 treatment in the same timeframe.

The proposed approach is denominated Stochastic Collaborative Joint Replenishment Problem (S-CJRP) and consists of two stages. The first stage determines a cost-efficient replenishment frequency for each collaborating company in all possible coalition arrangements. To accomplish the former, an extension of the known Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP) considering real-life capacity constraints, such as stochastic demand assuming normal distribution, finite storage and transport, is solved via genetic algorithms delivering a suitable coalition. In a second stage, the Shapley Value function is established to assess and allocate the potential gains achieved by colluding in the first stage, determining a fair share distribution among players that increases the viability of such coalition. Several scenarios from a simulated numerical study illustrate average cost savings of 32.3%. 28.2% and 32.7% for 3, 4 and 5 players, respectively, considering up to 30 items for the proposed collaboration, in all cases consistently exhibiting cost reduction and increasing the proposal feasibility.",The authors are grateful for the valuable comments of the reviewers which improved our manuscript.,,International Journal of Production Research,,,,2018-09-28,2018,2018-09-28,2019-05-19,57,10,3036-3059,Closed,Article,"Otero-Palencia, Carlos; Amaya–Mier, René; Yie-Pinedo, Ruben","Otero-Palencia, Carlos (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Amaya–Mier, René (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Otero-Palencia, Carlos (Universidad del Norte)","Otero-Palencia, Carlos (Universidad del Norte); Amaya–Mier, René (Universidad del Norte); Yie-Pinedo, Ruben (Universidad del Norte)",18,8,,6.16,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107303874,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",

In this study, we explored ground level GHG distribution and the potential role of a wetland situated at 3800 m.a.s.l, and characterized by high solar radiation < 1600 W m−2, extreme temperature ranges (−12 to 24 °C) and wind stress (< 17 m s−1). The water source of the wetland is mainly groundwater springs, which generates streams and ponds surrounded by peatlands. These sites support a rich microbial aquatic life including diverse bacteria and archaea communities, which transiently form more complex structures, such as microbial mats. In this study, GHG were measured in the water and above ground level air at the wetland site and along an elevation gradient in different bioclimatic areas from arid to hyper-arid zones. The microbiome from the water and sediments was described by high-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA and rDNA genes. The results indicate that GHG at ground level were variable along the elevation gradient potentially associated with different bioclimatic zones, reaching high values at the high Andean steppe and variable but lower values in the Atacama Desert and at the wetland. The water areas of the wetland presented high concentrations of CH4 and CO2, particularly at the spring areas and in air bubbles below microbial mats. The microbial community was rich (> 40 phyla), including archaea and bacteria potentially active in the different matrices studied (water, sediments and mats). Functional microbial groups associated with GHG recycling were detected at low frequency, i.e., < 2.5% of total sequences. Our results indicate that hyper-arid and arid areas of northern Chile are sites of GHG exchange associated with various bioclimatic zones and particularly in aquatic areas of the wetland where this ecosystem could represent a net sink of N2O and a source for CH4 and CO2.","We are grateful to M.J.

The following study aimed to describe the effect of individual self-esteem as a mediator in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health (understood as the presence of anxious and depressive symptomatology) in South American migrants in Chile. We surveyed 853 people, of Peruvian and Colombian nationality, residing in three cities (Arica, Antofagasta and Santiago). Three ad-hoc scales were applied to evaluate the study variables, analyzing the measurement models for each of them using the Confirmatory Factor Analysis method. Subsequently, the hypothesized mediation model is evaluated through Structural Equations (SEM). The results show that discrimination has a positive and direct relationship with both anxiety and depression, and that the effect of interaction between the variables of discrimination, self-esteem and symptoms associated with depression and anxiety, had a simple partial mediating effect. Discrimination would have a positive and minor effect on anxious and depressive symptoms, as it is mediated by self-esteem.","Acknowldgment This project was funded by the National Commission of Science and Technology of the Government of Chile, through projects FONDECYT 1140843 and 1180315 Contributors Conception and design: A.

In this study, we characterized two ferritin homologues in the red abalone Haliotis rufescens, a species of economic importance for Chile, USA and Mexico. Two ferritin subunits (Hrfer1 and Hrfer2) were cloned. Hrfer1 cDNA is an 807 bp clone containing a 516 bp open reading frame (ORF) that corresponds to a novel ferritin subunit in H. rufescens. Hrfer2 cDNA is an 868 bp clone containing a 516 bp ORF that corresponds to a previously reported ferritin subunit, but in this study 5'- and 3'-UTR sequences were additionally found. We detected a putative Iron Responsive Element (IRE) in the 5'-UTR sequence, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of Hrfer2 translation by iron. The deduced protein sequences of both cDNAs possessed the motifs and domains required in functional ferritin subunits. Expression patterns of both ferritins in different tissues, during different developmental stages, and in response to bacterial (Vibrio splendidus) exposure were examined. Both Hrfer1 and Hrfer2 are most expressed in digestive gland and gonad. Hrfer1 mRNA levels increased about 34-fold along with larval developmental process, attaining the highest level in the creeping post-larvae. Exogenous feeding is initiated at the creeping larva stage; thus, the increase of Hrfer1 may suggest and immunity-related role upon exposure to bacteria. Highest Hrfer2 expression levels were detected at trochophore stage; which may be related with early shell formation. Upon challenge with, the bacteria an early mild induction of Hrfer2 (2 h post-challenge), followed by a stronger induction of Hrfer1 at 15 h post-challenge, was observed in haemocytes from adult abalones. While maximal upregulation of both genes in the whole individual occurred at 24 h post-challenge, in juveniles. A significant increase in ferritin protein levels from 6 h to 24 h post-challenge was also detected. Our results suggest an involvement of Hrfer1 and Hrfer2, and of ferritin proteins in the immune response of H. rufescens to bacterial infection.","We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Rodrigo Rojas for bacteria procurement, and technicians from the Abalone Culture Center (AWABI) for abalone maintenance.","This study was supported by National Fund of Science and Technology, FONDECYT No 1140849 to K.B., F.W. and L.M.",Fish & Shellfish Immunology,,,"Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Ferritins; Gastropoda; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Immunity, Innate; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; Vibrio",2018-08-18,2018,2018-08-18,2018-11,82,,279-285,Closed,Article,"Coba de la Peña, Teodoro; Cárcamo, Claudia B; Díaz, María I; Winkler, Federico M; Morales-Lange, Byron; Mercado, Luis; Brokordt, Katherina B","Coba de la Peña, Teodoro (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA) and Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Cárcamo, Claudia B (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA) and Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Innovación Acuícola AquaPacífico, Facultad de Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Díaz, María I (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA) and Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Programa de Magíster en Ciencias Del Mar Mención Recursos Costeros, Facultad de Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Winkler, Federico M (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA) and Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Innovación Acuícola AquaPacífico, Facultad de Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.); Morales-Lange, Byron (Laboratorio de Genética e Inmunología Molecular, Instituto de Biología, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, 2373223, Valparaíso, Chile.); Mercado, Luis (Laboratorio de Genética e Inmunología Molecular, Instituto de Biología, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, 2373223, Valparaíso, Chile.); Brokordt, Katherina B (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA) and Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Innovación Acuícola AquaPacífico, Facultad de Ciencias Del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.

1012,pub.1107841609,10.1002/jsfa.9449,30362128,,Novel antioxidant peptides obtained by alcalase hydrolysis of Erythrina edulis (pajuro) protein,"BACKGROUND: Oxidative reactions are responsible for the changes in quality during food processing and storage. Oxidative stress is also involved in multiple chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, and aging. The consumption of dietary antioxidants has been demonstrated to help to reduce the oxidative damage in both the human body and food systems. In this study, the potential of Erythrina edulis (pajuro) protein as source of antioxidant peptides was evaluated.
RESULTS: Pajuro protein concentrate hydrolyzed by alcalase for 120 min showed potent ABTS·+ and peroxyl radical scavenging activity with Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values of 1.37 ± 0.09 µmol TE mg-1 peptide and 2.83 ± 0.07 µmol TE mg-1 peptide, respectively. Fractionation of the hydrolyzate to small peptides resulted in increased antioxidant activity. De novo sequencing of most active fractions collected by chromatographic analysis enabled 30 novel peptides to be identified. Of these, ten were synthesized and their radical activity evaluated, demonstrating their relevant contribution to the antioxidant effects observed for pajuro protein hydrolyzate.
CONCLUSIONS: The sequences identified represent an important advance in the molecular characterization of the pajuro protein, demonstrating its potential as a source of antioxidant peptides for food and nutraceutical applications. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.","This work has received financial support from projects 186‐FINCyT‐IA‐2013 (Programa Nacional de Innovación para la Competividad y Productividad) (Innovate‐Peru), N° 007‐FONDECYT‐2014 (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica‐Peru), and AGL2015‐66886‐R (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, MINECO, Spain).",,Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,,,Amino Acid Sequence; Antioxidants; Biocatalysis; Erythrina; Hydrolysis; Peptide Mapping; Peptides; Plant Proteins; Protein Hydrolysates; Subtilisins,2018-12-18,2018,2018-12-18,2019-03-30,99,5,2420-2427,Closed,Article,"Intiquilla, Arturo; Jiménez‐Aliaga, Karim; Guzmán, Fanny; Alvarez, Claudio A; Zavaleta, Amparo I; Izaguirre, Víctor; Hernández‐Ledesma, Blanca","Intiquilla, Arturo (Laboratorio de Biología Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Jiménez‐Aliaga, Karim (Laboratorio de Biología Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Guzmán, Fanny (Núcleo de Biotecnología Curauma (NBC), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile); Alvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Zavaleta, Amparo I (Laboratorio de Biología Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Izaguirre, Víctor (Laboratorio de Biología Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Hernández‐Ledesma, Blanca (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias de la Alimentación (CIAL, CSIC‐UAM, CEI UAM+CSIC), Madrid, Spain)","Hernández‐Ledesma, Blanca (Institute of Food Science Research)","Intiquilla, Arturo (National University of San Marcos); Jiménez‐Aliaga, Karim (National University of San Marcos); Guzmán, Fanny (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Alvarez, Claudio A (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Catholic University of the North); Zavaleta, Amparo I (National University of San Marcos); Izaguirre, Víctor (National University of San Marcos); Hernández‐Ledesma, Blanca (Institute of Food Science Research)",32,9,1.5,4.19,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107841609,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",

METHOD: An instrumental study that involved the translation to Spanish of the items of the short version of the MAAS-5 scale, using the back-translation procedure. We analyzed the evidence of validity based on the test content, with the participation of a total of 14 expert judges. The degree of clarity, coherence and relevance of the items was quantified using the Aiken V coefficient and their 95% confidence intervals using an ad hoc template developed in the MS Excel program.
RESULTS: The items of the MAAS-5 show favourable evaluations of their clarity, coherence and relevance, where all the values of V were statistically significant and greater than 0.70. On the other hand, the lower limit of 95% confidence intervals of all the items satisfies the criterion at population level (Li˃0.59).
CONCLUSION: The empirical evidence of validity based on the test content of the MAAS-5 reports that all are sufficiently relevant, coherent and clear to adequately represent the construct mindfulness, both at sample and population level. This suggests that the MAAS-5 can be a brief and useful measure to assess mindfulness.

Because elongated snouts (longirostry) have evolved independently in several crocodylomorph clades, this head shape has been interpreted as an ecological adaptation. How this condition affected patterns of diversification and how longirostrine-associated cranial features changed through adaptive radiations remain poorly understood. Two new small gryposuchine gavialoids, Dadagavialis gunai gen. et sp. nov. (early Miocene, Panama) and Aktiogavialis caribesi sp. nov. (late Miocene, Venezuela), evidence remarkable Miocene diversification of longirostrine forms in the Neotropics and support transmarine biogeographical relations between northern South America, the Caribbean, and southernmost North America before the Isthmus of Panama was fully established. By integrating phylogenetics and geometric morphometrics, we focus on this gavialoid diversity to investigate patterns of longirostry across the crown group of crocodylomorphs (Crocodylia). Analyses revealed that the snout shape of gavialoids has occupied a small, distinct and almost invariable morphospace since the Cretaceous, in contrast with the morphologically labile snout shape of other crocodylians (crocodyloids and alligatoroids). Our results suggest iterative environmental shift occupations throughout gavialoid evolution without major changes in snout proportions, but involving conspicuous rearrangements of the circumorbital bones. The longirostrine gavialoid morphotype is a distinct adaptation for seizing small prey and typically includes short and wide premaxillae and enlarged ‘caniniform’ teeth only at the tip of the snout. In longirostrine crocodyloids (Tomistoma, Crocodylus intermedius), the conservation of powerful bites and ‘caniniforms’ closer to the jaw joints allowed them to exploit a wider range of prey sizes, which could explain their snout shape plasticity. Therefore, the Mio–Pliocene extirpation of gryposuchine gavialoids from the Caribbean by the arrival of Crocodylus is quite unlikely. The last gryposuchine survived throughout the Pliocene in the south-eastern Pacific, where Crocodylus has never been documented. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:34CDBC8B-98E1-4770-8FC3-A77D3DBF4057","We are indebted to H.

Nowadays their business model is being threatened by the meddling of emerging third parties powered by modern technologies. Based on the New York cab data, we will make a comparison of several machine learning techniques (linear regression, support vector machines and random forest) for forecasting the amount of dollars spent in the cab service. The comparison of those methods will focus on the accuracy of their forecasts under several circumstances: real data applied to all features, some noisy data (real data with some uniform distributed noise added) applied to several key features and some estimated data (obtained from other statistical estimators) applied to the key features. The main goal of this comparison is to provide some data regarding the performance of those methods when they are used in conjunction with other estimators","This research work was supported by Sungshin Women’s University.

It proceeds from the premise that a study of the labor process and its social organization make it possible to understand how workers live and think, and how the structures and systems that sustain their labor are maintained. To do so, we must explore the activities, risks, and demands that workers face and examine the relationship of these factors to their health. Workers were given a descriptive, exploratory questionnaire seeking data about them and their family and work environments. The questions related to their health, their job satisfaction, the operation of the taxi service, and their personal satisfaction, including satisfaction with their leisure time. The results reveal precarious working conditions, long hours (11.3h a day), low wages (US$59.18 per week), and no social protections or benefits. 6.3% reported suffering from a disease, 49.5% corresponded to musculoskeletal conditions and only 11.6% were affiliated to any health system. 53.8% are owners of the vehicle and, although it does not seem to influence physical illness (P=0.03), it is related to the psychosocial ones (P=0.260). The group did show a lower frequency of traffic accidents than other transportation workers (17.9%, versus 45.4% for drivers of taxis and microbuses). However, it can be inferred from these characteristics that there is a relationship among their standard of living (as measured by salary), their working conditions (physical wear and tear), and the state of their health. The precarious material conditions of the drivers' lives makes it difficult to reproduce their labor power and their plans in life, and these conditions determine their quality of life and work.",The author is grateful to the Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México (UACM) for the sabbatical year during which this research was carried out.,,Journal of Transport & Health,,,,2018-03,2018,,2018-03,8,,73-80,Closed,Article,"Berrones-Sanz, Luis David","Berrones-Sanz, Luis David (Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México, Mexico)","Berrones-Sanz, Luis David (Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México)","Berrones-Sanz, Luis David (Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México)",26,8,,9.04,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085381330,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being

Method A quasi-experimental study. Evaluation by ad hoc questionnaire (pre and post, and reassessment at 4 months) to all professionals (physicians and nurses) who passed any of the 6 editions of the course: ‘Simulation of situations of cardiopulmonary arrest or peri-arrest in hospitalisation units’. Descriptive and inferential statistics. Results 133 participants, 16 physicians, and 117 nurses. Before the course started, the level of knowledge was 78.5%, at the end of training it was 94.6% (p <.001), and after 4 months, it was 88% (p <.05). The satisfaction achieved was 91.8% at the end of the course, and subsequently 88.4%; this was significant (p <.05) among the younger professionals, with less experience and with a temporary contract. Eighty one point two percent of the participants expressed that they changed the way they acted during a cardiopulmonary arrest. Conclusions Continuous education in CPA, performed through simulation-debriefing, is consolidated in our field as an effective tool to acquire a suitable level of knowledge that lasts over time. The level of satisfaction achieved was high since this method of learning meets the expectations of the professionals and resembles real care practice.","The author wishes to thank the Integrated Management Director of Ferrol for their willingness in carrying out this study.

The present study was carried out to investigate the presence of proteocephalids infecting the electric catfish Malapterurus electricus from Lake Manzala, Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. Morphological characterization revealed the present parasite is a cestoda belonging to the genus Electrotaenia. Morphologically, the recovered worms were characterized by an elongated body measuring 100-127 (120 ± 2) mm long and 0.92-2.11 (2.76 ± 0.1) mm wide. The anterior part of the worm was obvious terminated at a spherical scolex measured 1.12-1.91 (1.72 ± 0.01) mm long and 1.12-1.65 (1.42 ± 0.01) mm wide with a rostellum-like apical organ equipped by 5-6 irregular rows of minute hooklets, as well as four uniloculate suckers with a diameter of 0.13-0.15 (0.14 ± 0.01) mm and covered with microtriches. A long unsegmented neck was observed followed by acraspedote and anapolytic strobila consisted of 85-120 proglottids divided into 50-58 immature, 12-19 mature, and up to 49 gravid proglottids. Molecular characterization based on 28S rRNA sequences was done to confirm the taxonomy of this parasite based on its morphology. It was observed that there was a close identity up to 72.0% with other protocephalid species obtained for comparison from the GenBank. Also, the data obtained revealed that there was high blast scores and low divergence between the present parasite and previously described Electrotaenia malapteruri (acc. no. JX477434). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the parasite sequence in conjunction with existing data investigates the placement of this protocephalid species within Proteocephalidea. It was shown that the present species is deeply embedded in the genus Electrotaenia with close relationships to other Electrotaenia malapteruri as a putative sister taxon.","The authors are thankful to Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, and extend their appreciation to The Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group no (RG-002).",,Acta Tropica,,,"Animals; Catfishes; Cestoda; Cestode Infections; Egypt; Fish Diseases; Intestines; Lakes; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 28S",2018-04-12,2018,2018-04-12,2018-07,183,,153-161,Closed,Article,"Abdel-Gaber, Rewaida; Alajmi, Reem; Quraishy, Saleh Al; Morsy, Kareem; Rasheid, Khaled Al","Abdel-Gaber, Rewaida (Zoology Department, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

This boundary for the geographic range size increases linearly with body size and has been proposed to have implications in lineages evolution and conservation. Nevertheless, the macroevolutionary processes involved in the origin of this boundary and its consequences on lineage diversification have been poorly explored. We evaluate the macroevolutionary consequences of the difference (hereafter the distance) between the observed and the minimum range sizes required by the species' body size, to untangle its role on the diversification of a Neotropical species-rich bird clade using trait-dependent diversification models. We show that speciation rate is a positive hump-shaped function of the distance to the lower boundary. The species with highest and lowest distances to minimum range size had lower speciation rates, while species close to medium distances values had the highest speciation rates. Further, our results suggest that the distance to the minimum range size is a macroevolutionary constraint that affects the diversification process responsible for the origin of this macroecological pattern in a more complex way than previously envisioned.",,,Evolution,,,Animal Distribution; Animals; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Genetic Speciation; Passeriformes; Phylogeny,2018-04-25,2018,2018-04-25,2018-05,72,5,1124-1133,Closed,Article,"Inostroza‐Michael, Oscar; Hernández, Cristián E.; Rodríguez‐Serrano, Enrique; Avaria‐Llautureo, Jorge; Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.","Inostroza‐Michael, Oscar (Laboratorio de Ecologia Evolutiva y Filoinformtica Departamento de Zoologia, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Oceanograficas, Universidad de Concepcion Casilla 160‐C Concepcion Chile); Hernández, Cristián E.

However, the mechanisms underlying microplastic ingestion by fish are still unclear, although they are important to determine the pathway of microplastics along marine food webs. Here we conducted experiments in the laboratory to examine microplastic ingestion (capture and swallowing) and egestion by juveniles of the planktivorous palm ruff, Seriolella violacea (Centrolophidae). As expected, fish captured preferentially black microplastics, similar to food pellets, whereas microplastics of other colours (blue, translucent, and yellow) were mostly co-captured when floating close to food pellets. Microplastics captured without food were almost always spit out, and were only swallowed when they were mixed with food in the fish's mouth. Food probably produced a 'gustatory trap' that impeded the fish to discriminate and reject the microplastics. Most fish (93% of total) egested all the microplastics after 7 days, on average, and 49 days at most, substantially longer than food pellets (<2 days). No acute detrimental effects of microplastics on fish were observable, but potential sublethal effects of microplastics on the fish physiological and behavioural responses still need to be tested. This study highlights that visually-oriented planktivorous fish, many species of which are of commercial value and ecological importance within marine food webs, are susceptible to ingest microplastics resembling or floating close to their planktonic prey.","We are grateful to Dr. Alfonso Silva and the members of the laboratory of fish culture of the Universidad Católica del Norte in Coquimbo to have provided us with the fish, and to have taught us how to maintain the fish in the laboratory.

In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to the composition and roles of microbial communities in hypersaline lakes which are a unique feature in the Salar. In the present study biochemical, chemical and molecular biological tools were used to determine the composition and roles of microbial communities in water, microbial mats and sediments along a marked salinity gradient in Laguna Puilar which is located in the “Los Flamencos” National Reserve. The bacterial communities at the sampling sites were dominated by members of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria. Stable isotope and fatty acid analyses revealed marked variability in the composition of microbial mats at different sampling sites both horizontally (at different sites) and vertically (in the different layers). The Laguna Puilar was shown to be a microbially dominated ecosystem in which more than 60% of the fatty acids at particular sites are of bacterial origin. Our pioneering studies also suggest that the energy budgets of avian consumers (three flamingo species) and dominant invertebrates (amphipods and gastropods) use minerals as a source of energy and nutrients. Overall, the results of this study support the view that the Salar de Atacama is a heterogeneous and fragile ecosystem where small changes in environmental conditions may alter the balance of microbial communities with possible consequences at different trophic levels.","We would like to acknowledge collaborative Grant BMBF-CONICYT N° PCCI1-2043 (BMBF FKZ 01DN13015) and Fondecyt 1140179.

In order to do this, the performance of two permeable reactive barriers (PRB) with different internal substrate arrangements were compared during the administration of a sulfate solution without metals (for 163 days) and with metals (for 60 days), simulating groundwater contaminated with acid mine drainage (AMD). In order to simulate a traditional PRB, a homogeneous distribution was implemented in the first reactor and the other PRB reactor utilized diffusion-active technology (DAPRB). In the DAPRB, the distribution of the reactive material was interspersed with the conductive material. The measurements in the internal ports showed that transverse gradients of sulfide formed in the DAPRB, causing the diffusion of sulfide from the substrate toward the layer interface, which is where the sulfide reacts by forming complexes with the metal. The DAPRB prevents the microorganisms from direct contact with AMD. This protection caused greater activity (sulfide production).","This work was financed by projects FONDAP/CRHIAM/15130015, FONDECYT 1140451 and 3180297.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,,2018-06-18,2018,2018-06-18,2018-11,642,,894-903,Closed,Article,"Pérez, Norma; Schwarz, Alex O.; Barahona, Esteban; Sanhueza, Pamela; Diaz, Isabel; Urrutia, Homero","Pérez, Norma (Laboratorio de Ingeniería Hidraúlica y Ambiental, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Concepción, Chile; Departamento de Acuicultura, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Schwarz, Alex O.

Stress-induced ethanol drinking after PEE, however, has been largely unexplored. The present study analyzed ethanol intake in male Sprague-Dawley rats after protracted prenatal and early postnatal ethanol exposure and tested whether social isolation during the sensitive period of adolescence modulates the effects of PEE on ethanol drinking. The dams were given 10% ethanol (or its vehicle) as the sole drinking fluid from gestational day 0 (GD0) to postnatal day 7 (PD7). On PD21, male offspring were housed individually (isolated housing group) or in pairs in standard cages (standard housing group). From PD56 to PD84, these male rats were tested for ethanol intake in 24-h, intermittent two-bottle choice sessions that were conducted across 4 weeks. Maternal ethanol consumption during gestation and during the first week of life of the offspring averaged 6.10-8.20 g/kg/22 h. Isolation housing during adolescence increased free-choice ethanol drinking in young adulthood. The main novel finding was that this facilitative effect of isolation on absolute and percent ethanol intake was significantly greater in PEE rats than in control counterparts not exposed to the prenatal and early postnatal ethanol exposure (effect sizes [η2p]: 0.24-0.32). The present results suggest that PEE renders the individual sensitive to the facilitative effect of stress exposure on ethanol intake.","This work was a collaborative project between the Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Católica del Norte (Chile), and Instituto M. y M.

The starches were characterized in their proximal composition, crystallinity, microstructure and thermal properties. The sweet potato starch showed the highest amylose content (42.65%) and the lowest protein content (0.30%). The oca starch granules were larger (10-30 μm) than sweet potato and arracacha starch. The highest crystallinity of sweet potato starch caused larger values of onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), conclusion temperature (Tc) (67.64 °C, 72.83 °C, and 81.20 °C, respectively) than arracacha and oca starch. The novel foam trays showed good appearance, adequate expansion, and low density; however, all foam trays showed a water absorption capacity >50%, which was related to their porosity and low density.

Compared to men, SZ women had slightly lower negative symptoms, reported slightly less social cognitive impairments, lower Family Relationships scores and higher Sentimental Life scores, independently of marital status, illness duration, age at illness onset and type of mental health treatment. All these differences have been replicated in the Aymara subgroup except for Sentimental Life scores. Aymara SZ women reported to be significantly less adherent into treatment compared to Aymara men. SZ women were found to have a better clinical profile and higher sentimental life scores than men. However, while SZ women reported more impaired Family Relationships compared to men, they were found to receive less psychotherapy in addition to pharmacological treatment. SZ Aymara women were also identified as a specific subgroup that may be targeted for increased observance strategies.","Acknowledgment This research was funded in part by the Universidad de Tarapacá through Proyecto Mayor de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica UTA no. 3732-16.

Data from 467 gay men (57.4%) and lesbian women (42.6%) were analyzed. A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method was used. The hierarchical regression analysis indicated the important predictive role of active coping, β = .23, and positive reappraisal, β = .45, in PTG, R2 = .31, p < .001, f2 = 0.16. Results revealed that, in the presence of positive reappraisal coping as an intermediate variable, partial indirect effects are detected between perceived stigma and PTG.

Phylogenetic reconstruction shows two clades: clade 1 including species of the families Eledonidae, Megaleledonidae, Bathypolypodidae, and Enteroctopodidae, and clade 2 including species of Octopodidae. Egg size, development mode, and all environmental variables exhibited phylogenetic signal, partly due to differences between the two clades: whereas most species in clade 1 inhabit cold and deep waters, exhibit large eggs and hatchling with holobenthic development, species from clade 2 inhabit tropical-temperate and shallow waters, evolved small eggs, and generally exhibit merobenthic development. Phylogenetic regressions show that egg size exhibits a conspicuous latitudinal cline, and that both egg size and development mode vary with water temperature. Additionally, analyses suggest that egg size is constrained by body size in lineages with holobenthic development. Taken together, results suggest that the variation in egg size and development mode across benthic octopuses is adaptive and associated with water temperature, supporting Thorson's rule in these organisms.",,,Evolution,,,Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Cephalopoda; Life Cycle Stages; Organ Size; Phylogeny,2018-07-31,2018,2018-07-31,2018-09,72,9,1829-1839,Closed,Article,"Ibáñez, Christian M.; Rezende, Enrico L.; Sepúlveda, Roger D.; Avaria‐Llautureo, Jorge; Hernández, Cristián E.; Sellanes, Javier; Poulin, Elie; Pardo‐Gandarillas, M.

This infection, caused by the rickettsial-like intracellular organism (RLO) Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, can severely impair the normal development of affected animals, and ultimately, their survival. The most common line of action against the WS has been the use of antibiotics, specifically oxytetracycline (OTC), administered via intramuscular injection and per os via medicated feed. In the present study, we have assessed the effectiveness of OTC baths as therapeutic treatment for the control of the WS agent in H. rufescens. Clinical signs of infection were monitored for 11 months in treated juveniles, in addition to feed consumption rate, growth patterns and gonad development. Abalones were asymptomatic until the end of the experiment, when a small number of non-treated animals exhibited clinical signs of infection. Gonad maturity was not observed. OTC treated animals grew significantly less than their non-treated counterparts, being 4.3% shorter and 13.6% lighter at the end of the experiment. They also displayed negative allometry, i.e. for the same shell length, they were lighter than non-treated groups. Furthermore, the weight of muscle and soft tissues in OTC treated animals was lighter than in the other groups, while no differences were found in shell weight. The feed consumption rate was the same for all groups, thus the observed growth patterns cannot be attributed to a decreased feed intake. One possible explanation is that antibiotic treatment may have impacted gut microflora, thus preventing efficient nutrient digestion and absorption and, indirectly, reducing growth. Prevalence of RLOs causing WS (WS-RLO) and the variant form (RLOv), infected with a bacteriophague and non virulent, were significantly lower in the OTC-treated group than in the other groups. Similar results were observed for the mean intensity of RLOv, while for WS-RLO, the intensity in the OTC-treated group was higher, although not statistically significant, than the rest of the groups. These observations may be the consequence of an increased bacterial sensitivity to OTC effects associated with the phage infection or faster reproduction of WS-RLOs than RLOv after OTC treatment. Our results let us infer that the prophylactic use of OTC in abalone to avoid the negative effects of WS on abalone farms could have an undesired negative effect on the biological control exerted by the phage on the bacteria after OTC treatment.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank D.

Five postgraduate students and five teacher educators from three different Masters of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (MTEFL) programs agreed to take part in the research. Informed by a qualitative paradigm, semi-structured interviews were conducted aimed mainly at (1) unpacking teacher educators’ and postgraduate students’ understandings of CT; (2) investigating postgraduates’ views of the place of critical thinking in their English teacher education training; (3) examining the ways in which teacher educators deal with CT in their pedagogies; and (4) identifying students’ preparedness to approach reading and writing critically, as viewed by both groups of participants. Analysis of responses revealed, on the one hand, students’ recognition of CT skills as necessary to succeed in academic life and, on the other, great concerns for the limited importance accorded to teaching these skills in teacher education courses. Teacher educators’ responses generally showed an increasing interest in trying to incorporate the teaching of CT skills in their pedagogies, but admitted to an overall lack of consistency in the implementation process. The paper concludes with critical questions about the perceived pedagogical mismatches between teacher educators’ and postgraduate students’ perceptions of the role of CT in their academic journeys, and about the role of Chilean teacher education programs in addressing these issues.",,,Teaching in Higher Education,,,,2018-03-24,2018,2018-03-24,2019-01-02,24,1,47-62,Closed,Article,"Veliz, Leonardo; Veliz-Campos, Mauricio","Veliz, Leonardo (Faculty of Arts and Education, Deakin University, Burwood, Australia); Veliz-Campos, Mauricio (Universidad Católica Silva Henríquez, Santiago, Chile)","Veliz, Leonardo (Deakin University)","Veliz, Leonardo (Deakin University); Veliz-Campos, Mauricio (Universidad Católica Silva Henríquez)",28,16,,14.1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101747818,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

POTE was dissolved in THF and mixed with an acidified aqueous solution containing chitosan to obtain chitosan/POTE (CS/POTE) films by solution casting. To produce gold nanoparticles in the CS/POTE films (i.e., CS/POTE/AuNP films), an aqueous solution of KAuCl4 salt at fixed concentration was added to the initial chitosan solution. The fabricated biobased films were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and UV–visible), thermogravimetry, contact angle analysis, polarized light microscopy (PLM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM). The effects of varying POTE composition and the presence of gold nanoparticles in the films were analyzed. For example, the results indicated the existence of interactions between chitosan and POTE, and LPM studies revealed a predominantly amorphous nature of these biobased films. In addition, the optical and surface potential behaviors of the films were examined by UV–visible and KPFM techniques. From the UV–visible spectra, the optical band gaps were estimated for the samples, and their surface potential maps exhibited differences according to the composition of POTE and the presence of AuNPs. Finally, theoretical electronic calculations provided insight into the contributions of POTE and gold nanoparticles to the electronic activity of the films.","The authors thank Fondecyt postdoctoral 3150544, Fondecyt Iniciación 11160707 and Fondecyt 1161159 for partial financial support.

Lysine homopeptides with odd number of residues, especially with 11 residues (K11), were capable of inhibiting the growth of a broader spectrum of bacteria than those with an even number. Confocal studies also determined that K11 was able to localize exclusively in the bacterial membrane, leading to cell death. In this work, the mechanism of action of this peptide was further analyzed focused on examining the structural changes in bacterial membrane induced by K11, and in K11 itself when interacting with bacterial membrane lipids. Moreover, alanine and proline scans were performed for K11 to identify relevant positions in structure conformation and antibacterial activity. To do so, circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) was conducted in saline phosphate buffer (PBS) and in lipidic vesicles, using large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), composed of 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) or bacterial membrane lipid. Antimicrobial activity of K11 and their analogs was evaluated in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 exposed to the Lys homopeptide at MIC concentration showed blisters and bubbles formed on the bacterial surface, suggesting that K11 exerts its action by destabilizing the bacterial membrane. CD analysis revealed a remarkably enhanced PPII structure of K11 when replacing some of its central residues by proline in PBS. However, when such peptide analogs were confronted with either DMPG-LUV or membrane lipid extract-LUV, the tendency to form PPII structure was severely weakened. On the contrary, K11 peptide showed a remarkably enhanced PPII structure in the presence of DMPG-LUV. Antibacterial tests revealed that K11 was able to inhibit all tested bacteria with an MIC value of 5 µM, while proline and alanine analogs have a reduced activity on Listeria monocytogenes. Besides, the activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus was affected in most of the alanine-substituted analogs. However, lysine substitutions by alanine or proline at position 7 did not alter the activity against all tested bacterial strains, suggesting that this position can be screened to find a substitute amino acid yielding a peptide with increased antibacterial activity. These results also indicate that the PPII secondary structure of K11 is stabilized by the interaction of the peptide with negatively charged phospholipids in the bacterial membrane, though not being the sole determinant for its antimicrobial activity.","This work was supported by the Chilean Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt), Grant 1140926.

In order to investigate if the obtained mesocosm results of high seaweed persistence under natural environmental conditions and under grazing pressure can be extrapolated to field situations, we conducted in situ experiments. During two summers (2007 and 2008), Macrocystis pyrifera was tethered (for 14 d) to lines in the presence and absence of the amphipod Peramphithoe femorata at three sites (Iquique, Coquimbo, Calfuco). We hypothesized that grazing damage and seaweed persistence vary among sites due to different abiotic factors. By incubating the sporophytes in mesh bags, we were either able to isolate (grazing) or exclude (control) amphipods. To test for a mesh bag artifact, a set of sporophytes was incubated without mesh bags (natural). Mesh bags used to exclude herbivores influenced sporophyte growth and physiological performance. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) content depended largely on grazers and grazed sporophytes grew less than natural and control sporophytes within the two summers. A decrease in Chl a content was found for the sites with the highest prevailing irradiances and temperatures, suggesting an efficient acclimation to these sea surface conditions. Our field-based results of sporophyte acclimation ability even under grazing pressure widely align with previous mesocosm results. We conclude that M. pyrifera and other temperate floating seaweeds can function as long-distance dispersal vectors even with hitchhiking mesoherbivores.",,,Journal of Phycology,,T.

The CLIL approach regards culture a core component, however, science teachers often struggle to integrate a cultural component in their lessons. This study describes a pedagogical intervention using CLIL in a state school in Bogotá, Colombia. The first cycle of an action research project was implemented over the course of 1 year with 50 students (aged 15–19 years) and their teacher. Students used technology-enhanced CLIL-based environmental learning projects to integrate content (science) and a vehicular language (English). Questionnaires, a teacher's journal, artefacts, and interviews were used to collect data. The findings show students’ positive perceptions of CLIL and highlight the value of explicitly considering a cultural component in science lessons, framed through a lens of scientific citizenship.

Here we used a citizen science approach where schoolchildren examined litter at riversides and identified possible sources at over 250 sampling spots along large and small rivers in Germany, during autumn 2016 and spring 2017. Litter densities have an overall median of 0.14, interquartile range 0-0.57 items m-2 and an overall average (±standard deviation) of 0.54 ± 1.20 litter items m-2. Litter quantities differed only little by sampling year. The principal litter types found were plastics and cigarette butts (31% and 20%, respectively), followed by glass, paper, and metal items, indicating recreational visitors as the principal litter source. At many sites (85%), accumulations of litter, consisting principally of cigarettes and food packaging, have been found. At almost all sampling sites (89%), litter potentially hazardous to human health has been observed, including broken glass, sharp metal objects, used personal hygiene articles and items containing chemicals. In the search for litter sources, the schoolchildren identified mainly people who use the rivers as recreational areas (in contrast to residents living in the vicinity, illegal dumping, or the river itself depositing litter from upstream sources). These results indicate the urgent need for better education and policy measures in order to protect riparian environments and reduce input of riverine litter to the marine environment.","This research would not have been possible without the enthusiastic support of all the students, teachers and volunteer collaborators – their help is greatly appreciated (see Supplement S4)!

Two of the salt flats, Gorbea and Ignorado, have high acidic brines. The causes of the local acidity have been attributed to the occurrence of volcanic native sulfur, the release of sulfuric acid by oxidation, and the low buffering capacity of the rocks in the area. Understanding the microbial community composition and available energy in this pristine ecosystem is relevant in determining the origin of the acidity and in supporting the rationale of conservation policies. Besides, a comparison between similar systems in Australia highlights key microbial components and specific ones associated with geological settings and environmental conditions. Sediment and water samples from the Salar de Gorbea were collected, physicochemical parameters measured and geochemical and molecular biological analyses performed. A low diversity microbial community was observed in brines and sediments dominated by Actinobacteria, Algae, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Most of the constituent genera have been reported to be either sulfur oxidizing microorganisms or ones having the potential for sulfur oxidation given available genomic data and information drawn from the literature on cultured relatives. In addition, a link between sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation was observed. In contrast, to acid mine drainage communities, Gorbea microbial diversity is mainly supported by chemolithoheterotrophic, facultative chemolithoautotrophic and oligotrophic sulfur oxidizing populations indicating that microbial activity should also be considered as a causative agent of local acidity.","Fondecyt Project 1100795, BHP Minerals Americas Project 32002137.",,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,,,"Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon Cycle; Chile; DNA, Bacterial; Energy Metabolism; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salts; Sulfur",2018-05-10,2018,2018-05-10,2018-08,111,8,1403-1419,Closed,Article,"Escudero, Lorena; Oetiker, Nia; Gallardo, Karem; Tebes-Cayo, Cinthya; Guajardo, Mariela; Nuñez, Claudia; Davis-Belmar, Carol; Pueyo, J.

Herein we examined whether AMD density and composition differed between two countries with contrasting socio-economic backgrounds and marine litter sources (i.e. Chile and Germany). In nationwide beach litter surveys, we used a citizen science approach with schoolchildren and their teachers. Litter densities were substantially higher in Chile than in Germany. The different geographic zones surveyed in both countries showed strong grouping tendencies according to their main economic activities (tourism, shipping, fisheries/aquaculture), major litter sources, and AMD composition, in terms of dominance and diversity of AMD types. The results suggest that beach litter composition can be used as a simple proxy to identify AMD sources, and also that law enforcement and education can help mitigate the problem; however, for efficient solutions, production and consumption of plastics must be reduced.","We are grateful to Dr. Konrad Górski for help with the Primer analyses, Dr. Boris López for collaborating with the maps, and MSc Tim Kiessling and Dr. Lars Gutow for reviewing the manuscript.

Considering its location on the western border of South America, between 17 and 28 °S, its climate has been characterized as arid to hyperarid for at least the past 10 million years. Notably dry climatic conditions of the Atacama Desert have been related to uplift of the Andes and are believed to have played an important role in the development of the most distinctive features of this desert, including: (i) nitrates and iodine deposits in the Central Depression, (ii) secondary enrichment in porphyry copper deposits in the Precordillera, (iii) Li enrichment in salt flats of the Altiplano, and (iv) life in extreme habitats. The geology and physiography of the Atacama Desert have been largely shaped by the convergent margin present since the Mesozoic era. The geochemistry of surface materials is related to rock geochemistry (Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, V, and Zn), salt flats, and evaporite compositions in endorheic basins (As, B, and Li), in addition to anthropogenic activities (Cu, Mo, and Pb). The composition of surface water is highly variable, nonetheless in general it presents a circumneutral pH with higher conductivity and total dissolved solids in brines. Major water constituents, with the exception of HCO3−, are generally related to the increase of salinity, and despite the fact that trace elements are not well-documented, surface waters of the Atacama Desert are enriched in As, B, and Li when compared to the average respective concentrations in rivers worldwide.",We sincerely thank Alan Bull for the invitation to participate in this special issue in addition to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Assessment of windows of opportunities to reduce technological gaps,"The convergence of different theories (ie, catch-up effect and windows of opportunities) allows for the interpretation of different ""technological innovation gaps"" in Chile's biomedical industry. It is common knowledge that Chile has always had an economy almost exclusively based on services, commodities, and mainly in the exploitation of natural resources with low value added. The literature confirms that countries that concentrate their economies on the knowledge, research, development, and commercialization of technology and innovation have a better and more stable growth rate in the medium and long run. The ""Asian Tigers"" are a good example of this. Analyzing the technological gaps that affect the Chilean biomedical industry, it is possible to find windows of opportunities to catch up. This could allow the country to take its knowledge, skills, and capabilities further, thus enabling Chile to not just depend on its unpredictable natural resources. For the first time, a quantitative diagnosis of the Chilean biomedical industry was made. This study considered the Chilean biomedical industry and its innovation and entrepreneurship environment, taking into account its productive capacities and its potential to make progress in technological innovation and, as a result, dramatically reducing technological gaps through windows of opportunities.",,,The International Journal of Health Planning and Management,,,Biomedical Technology; Chile; Diffusion of Innovation; Entrepreneurship; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires,2018-02-09,2018,2018-02-09,2018-04,33,2,e512-e530,Closed,Article,"Bas, Tomas Gabriel; Oliu, Carolina Alejandra","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Universidad Católica del Norte (Coquimbo) ECIEM, Coquimbo, Chile); Oliu, Carolina Alejandra (Centro de Innovación Aquapacifico, Universidad Católica del Norte Coquimbo, Chile)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North); Oliu, Carolina Alejandra (Catholic University of the North)",7,5,0.18,3.95,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100922088,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"
846,pub.1110423610,10.1038/s41586-018-0776-9,30542166,,Increased variability of eastern Pacific El Niño under greenhouse warming,"The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant and most consequential climate variation on Earth, and is characterized by warming of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the El Niño phase and cooling during the La Niña phase. ENSO events tend to have a centre—corresponding to the location of the maximum SST anomaly—in either the central equatorial Pacific (5° S–5° N, 160° E–150° W) or the eastern equatorial Pacific (5° S–5° N, 150°–90° W); these two distinct types of ENSO event are referred to as the CP-ENSO and EP-ENSO regimes, respectively. How the ENSO may change under future greenhouse warming is unknown, owing to a lack of inter-model agreement over the response of SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific to such warming. Here we find a robust increase in future EP-ENSO SST variability among CMIP5 climate models that simulate the two distinct ENSO regimes. We show that the EP-ENSO SST anomaly pattern and its centre differ greatly from one model to another, and therefore cannot be well represented by a single SST ‘index’ at the observed centre. However, although the locations of the anomaly centres differ in each model, we find a robust increase in SST variability at each anomaly centre across the majority of models considered. This increase in variability is largely due to greenhouse-warming-induced intensification of upper-ocean stratification in the equatorial Pacific, which enhances ocean–atmosphere coupling. An increase in SST variance implies an increase in the number of ‘strong’ EP-El Niño events (corresponding to large SST anomalies) and associated extreme weather events.",,,Nature,,,"Ecosystem; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Nonlinear Dynamics; Pacific Ocean",2018-12-12,2018,2018-12-12,2018-12,564,7735,201-206,Closed,Article,"Cai, Wenju; Wang, Guojian; Dewitte, Boris; Wu, Lixin; Santoso, Agus; Takahashi, Ken; Yang, Yun; Carréric, Aude; McPhaden, Michael J.","Cai, Wenju (Key Laboratory of Physical Oceanography, Institute for Advanced Ocean Studies, Ocean University of China and Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research (CSHOR), CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia); Wang, Guojian (Key Laboratory of Physical Oceanography, Institute for Advanced Ocean Studies, Ocean University of China and Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research (CSHOR), CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia); Dewitte, Boris (Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, Coquimbo, Chile; Departamento de Biología, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; Millennium Nucleus for Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands, Coquimbo, Chile; Laboratoire d’Etudes en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiales, Toulouse, France); Wu, Lixin (Key Laboratory of Physical Oceanography, Institute for Advanced Ocean Studies, Ocean University of China and Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Santoso, Agus (Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research (CSHOR), CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia); Takahashi, Ken (Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú—SENAMHI, Lima, Peru); Yang, Yun (College of Global Change and Earth System Science, Beijing Normal University and University Corporation for Polar Research, Beijing, China); Carréric, Aude (Laboratoire d’Etudes en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiales, Toulouse, France); McPhaden, Michael J.

La Oficina de Pasaportes no permitía que Harbisson apareciera con un equipo electrónico en la cabeza. Harbisson alegó que su eyeborg (ojo electrónico) debía ser considerado parte de su cuerpo; él había devenido un cíborg. Cartas de respaldo de su médico, amigos y compañeros fueron enviadas a la Oficina de Pasaportes. Finalmente, se incluyó el dispositivo de Harbisson y se convirtió en el primer cíborg reconocido por un gobierno. Gracias a la tecnociencia, él pasó a ser un tipo diferente de ser poshumano: «Harbisson 2.0».

Abstract In 2004, Neil Harbisson, who was born with dyschromatopsia, was not allowed to renew his UK passport. His passport photo was rejected. The UK Passport Authority would not allow Harbisson to appear with electronic equipment on his head. Harbisson wrote back to them insisting that the ‘eyeborg’ (electronic eye) should be considered part of his body as he had become a cyborg. Letters from his doctor, friends and partners were sent to the Passport Office to give him support. Finally, Harbisson's device was included and he became the first cyborg recognised by a government.

(Bacillariophyta), a common stalk-forming species from the Rio Negro basin (Brazilian Amazon)","A new stalk-forming diatom was observed at high relative abundances on periphytic samples collected in the Rio Negro hydrographic basin (Brazilian Amazon) and is here described using light and scanning electron microscopy. We also present ecological preferences of the new species. Eunotia amazonica sp. nov. co-dominated periphytic samples collected during the rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014 near the city of Manaus (Amazonas, Brazil). The main diagnostic feature of the new species is the stalk-forming growth form (‘Cymbella-like’) illustrated here for the first time in the genus Eunotia Ehrenberg. Previous reports on growth forms in common European databases for this genus included colonial (‘ribbon-like’) but also ‘mobile’, ‘fixed by pads’ or ‘without structures of fixation’. We demonstrated that the three dominant Eunotia species in periphytic samples from the Rio Negro all exhibited distinct ‘growth forms’ or habits: Eunotia amazonica sp. nov. (stalked), Eunotia intricans Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (ribbon-like) and Eunotia rabenhorstiana (Grunow) Hustedt (branched-arborescent). The high diversity of species, many of which are unknown to science, as well as the poorly known life-forms and habits of the Eunotiaceae in the region, partially prevent the use of metrics based on life-form to assess ecological changes. Generic assumptions based on robust statistical methods may obscure reality and lead to biased conclusions of diatom community changes in poorly explored regions such as Neotropical freshwater rivers, where the Eunotiaceae are largely dominant, particularly in the Amazon basin.",The authors thank J.

Rb3, an aerobic anoxygenic phototroph which thrives in the polyextreme ecosystem of the Salar de Huasco, in the Chilean Altiplano","The Salar de Huasco is an evaporitic basin located in the Chilean Altiplano, which presents extreme environmental conditions for life, i.e. high altitude (3800 m.a.s.l.), negative water balance, a wide salinity range, high daily temperature changes and the occurrence of the highest registered solar radiation on the planet (> 1200 W m−2). This ecosystem is considered as a natural laboratory to understand different adaptations of microorganisms to extreme conditions. Rhodobacter, an anoxygenic aerobic phototrophic bacterial genus, represents one of the most abundant groups reported based on taxonomic diversity surveys in this ecosystem. The bacterial mat isolate Rhodobacter sp. strain Rb3 was used to study adaptation mechanisms to stress-inducing factors potentially explaining its success in a polyextreme ecosystem. We found that the Rhodobacter sp. Rb3 genome was characterized by a high abundance of genes involved in stress tolerance and adaptation strategies, among which DNA repair and oxidative stress were the most conspicuous. Moreover, many other molecular mechanisms associated with oxidative stress, photooxidation and antioxidants; DNA repair and protection; motility, chemotaxis and biofilm synthesis; osmotic stress, metal, metalloid and toxic anions resistance; antimicrobial resistance and multidrug pumps; sporulation; cold shock and heat shock stress; mobile genetic elements and toxin–antitoxin system were detected and identified as potential survival mechanism features in Rhodobacter sp. Rb3. In total, these results reveal a wide set of strategies used by the isolate to adapt and thrive under environmental stress conditions as a model of polyextreme environmental resistome.","We thank Juan Ugalde for support in bioinformatic analysis.

In addition to future predictions, highly productive systems such as the Humboldt Current System are characterized by important variations in both temperature and pCO2 level, but how these physical-chemical ocean changes might influence the transmission and survival of parasites has not been assessed. This study experimentally evaluated the effects of temperature (14, 18 and 25 °C) and the combined effects of temperature (∼15 and 20 °C) and pCO2 level (∼500 and 1400 microatmospheres (µatm) on the emergence and survival of two species of marine trematodes-Echinostomatidae gen. sp. and Philophthalmidae gen. sp.-both of which infect the intertidal snail Echinolittorina peruviana. Snails were collected from intertidal rocky pools in a year-round upwelling area of the northern Humboldt Current System (23°S). Two experiments assessed parasite emergence and survival by simulating emersion-immersion tidal cycles. To assess parasite survival, 2 h old cercariae (on average) were taken from a pool of infected snails incubated at 20-25 °C, and their mortality was recorded every 6 h until all the cercariae were dead. For both species, a trade-off between high emergence and low survival of cercariae was observed in the high temperature treatment. Species-specific responses to the combination of temperature and pCO2 levels were also observed: the emergence of Echinostomatidae cercariae was highest at 20 °C regardless of the pCO2 levels. By contrast, the emergence of Philophthalmidae cercariae was highest at elevated pCO2 (15 and 20 °C), suggesting that CO2 may react synergistically with temperature, increasing transmission success of this parasite in coastal ecosystems of the Humboldt Current System where water temperature and pH are expected to decrease. In conclusion, our results suggest that integrating temperature-pCO2 interactions in parasite studies is essential for understanding the consequence of climate change in future marine ecosystem health.","This study was funded by the Project Semillero No. 5303, Dirección de Gestión de la Investigación, Universidad de Antofagasta, Chile, granted to MTG.

We explore here the contributions of Lagoa Santa material to the origins and lifestyle of early Americans, providing an historic background. Cranial morphology of Lagoa Santa skeletons allowed the proposition of a model of two biological components for the occupation of the Americas, in which early Americans are morphologically similar to people of African and Australo-Melanesian origin.

Meiospores were cultured for 35 days in an experimental mesocosm where temperature (~15 and 19 °C) and partial CO2 pressure (pCO2, ~400 and 1300 μatm) were controlled. The results indicate that germination was reduced at 19 °C, whereas the increase of pCO2 only had effects at 15 °C. Likewise, the increase in temperature significantly affected the vegetative growth of female gametophytes. Sex ratio was not affected significantly by any of the variables studied. Fertility and reproductive success decreased by about 50% at 19 °C. The pCO2 levels had no significant effects on most early developmental traits. The results suggest that ocean warming or periodic warming events (e.g. an El Niño event) might affect the recruiting capacity of this or other similar species by affecting their early developmental stages.","This study was funded by the Project Fondecyt Grant No. 1130839 to PHM.

In this study, we researched three Afro-descendant communities’ food plant TEK in the Colombian Caribbean coast. Methods used included a plant recognition exercise undertaken with three generations in families. Respondents were asked how they used a plant, the last time of use, and the reasons for non-consumption (NC) or consumption several years previously (CSYP). Different patterns of recognition and use emerged. Of the 98 species, 28 did not show evidence of intergenerational change. For certain cultivated species, there were marked differences between the percentage of grandparents and children reporting current consumption. Finally, 33 species had low recognition rates by the youngest generation and high levels of NC or CSYP. By analyzing the reasons given for NC or CSYP and the perceptions of participants in interviews and focus groups, we identified TEK erosion for various species (e.g., Anacardium excelsum, Elaeis oleifera, Solanum allophyllum, and Talinum triangulare). However, high NC levels did not always signify declining knowledge or use. Additionally, there appeared to be different dynamics of TEK change in the study sites.En Colombia pocos estudios se han enfocado en los cambios en el conocimiento ecológico ancestral (CEA) para determinar si se evidenciaba erosión del CEA o han explorado cuáles factores impulsan los cambios. En este estudio, investigamos el CEA sobre plantas alimenticias de comunidades Afrodescendientes en tres localidades en la costa Caribe colombiana. Se utilizó un ejercicio de reconocimiento de plantas, desarrollado con tres generaciones en familias. Se preguntó a los entrevistados cómo utilizaban una planta, la última fecha de uso y las razones de no consumo (NC) o consumo hace varios años (CHVA). Desde los datos surgieron diversos patrones de reconocimiento y uso. De las 98 plantas, 28 no mostraron evidencia de cambios intergeneracionales. Para algunas especies cultivadas, había diferencias marcadas entre el porcentaje de abuelos y de niños que reportaban consumo actual. Finalmente, 33 especies obtuvieron niveles de reconocimiento muy bajos por la generación más joven y altos niveles de NC o CHVA. Analizando las razones por el NC o el CHVA y las percepciones de los participantes en entrevistas y en grupos focales, identificamos erosión del CEA en el caso de varias especies (p.ej. Anacardium excelsum, Elaeis oleifera, Solanum allophyllum y Talinum triangulare). Sin embargo, niveles altos de NC no siempre estaban indicando una reducción del conocimiento y del uso. Al parecer había diferentes dinámicas de cambio en el CEA en los sitios de la investigación.","We would like to warmly thank all the people in the three communities who participated in the research, generously sharing their time and knowledge.

Here we use targeted capture and next-generation sequencing to generate robust phylogenomic trees for 39 of the 43 species in order to test the monophyly of existing genera. The large genus Ophiocoma, as currently constituted, is paraphyletic on our trees and required revision. Four genera are recognised herein: an expanded Ophiomastix (now including Ophiocoma wendtii, O. occidentalis, O. endeani, O. macroplaca, and Ophiarthrum spp), Ophiocomella (now including the non-fissiparous Ophiocoma pumila, aethiops and valenciae) and Breviturma (now including Ophiocoma pica, O. pusilla, O. paucigranulata and O. longispina) and a restricted Ophiocoma. The resulting junior homonym Ophiomastix elegans is renamed O. brocki. The genus Ophiomastix exhibits relatively high rates of morphological disparity compared to other lineages. Ophiomastix flaccida and O. (formerly Ophiarthrum) pictum have divergent mitochondrial genomes, characterised by gene-order rearrangements, strand recoding, enriched GT base composition, and a corresponding divergence of nuclear mitochondrial protein genes. The new phylogeny indicates that larval and developmental transitions occurred rarely. Larval culture trials show that species with abbreviated lecithotrophic larval development occur only within Ophiomastix, although the possible monophyly of these species is obscured by the rapid early radiation within this genus. Asexual reproduction by fission is limited to one species-complex within Ophiocomella, also characterised by elevated levels of allelic heterozygosity, and which has achieved a relatively rapid global distribution. The crown ages of the new genera considerably predate the closure of the Tethyan seaway and all four are distributed in both the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. Two species pairs appear to reflect the closure of the Panama Seaway, although their fossil-calibrated node ages (12-14 ± 6 my), derived from both concatenated sequence and multispecies coalescent analyses, considerably predate the terminal closure event. Ophiocoma erinaceus has crossed the East Pacific barrier and is recorded from Clipperton Island, SW of Mexico.","Acknowledgements TOH and AFH were supported by the Marine Biodiversity Hub, funded through the National Environmental Research Program, Australia (NERP), and administered through the Australian Government’s Department of the Environment.

One broad assessment scale used to evaluate child development is the Battelle Developmental Inventories (BDIs). The BDI-2 has a standardized version in English with good psychometric properties and a translated version in Spanish; however, despite widespread clinical use, there has been limited early childhood development research focused on this assessment tool in the past 10 years. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the literature about the BDIs and their screening test and analyze their use for child assessment. Seven databases were used to retrieve articles in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Overall, 34 articles were evaluated for general features, salient findings, and key methodological issues, such as target population, objectives, research design, and main results. Authors' considerations about the psychometric properties and utility of the BDIs were also examined. Results indicated that 41.17% of studies with the BDIs were from the United States, and the most common target population was children with autism spectrum disorders. Generally, the articles highlighted the broad applications of this measure and robust psychometric properties cited in the BDIs examiner's manual as reasons for their use. This review suggests that it is important to conduct independent analyses of the psychometric properties of the BDIs as well as validation studies to ensure appropriate applications of the BDI, including for use with non-American populations.",,,Infants & Young Children,,,,2018-01,2018,,2018-01,31,1,69-90,Closed,Article,"Cunha, Ana C.

In this study, we developed a sediment-thickness distribution model for the Pampa del Tamarugal basin (between 20°20′S and 21°30′S, northern Chile), from surface geological information, available wells, and interpretation and depth conversion of 14 seismic-reflection profiles. Four Oligocene−Holocene units and one Carboniferous−Eocene undifferentiated basement unit were identified in the seismic profiles. For depth conversion, we established an empirical velocity model using P-wave velocities measured from rock samples, with velocity values from 2 to 6 km/s. By interpolating the basal-fill surface from the processed data set, and subtracting it from the topographic surface, we generated an isopach map of the basin, which has a maximum fill thickness of 1566 m. Four N-S−elongated asymmetric subbasins with a fill exceeding 700 m in thickness were identified, and these are separated by four basement highs. Both basement and fill units are folded and cut by west-vergent high-angle reverse faults, which originated before the Oligocene and were reactivated in the Miocene. During the isopach map construction, three sources of error were identified (i.e., topographic adjustment, interpretation, and conversion method), and the mean accumulated thickness error was found to be ±250 m; in addition, the lack of wells as validation data also contributes to the uncertainty. Based on our results, the basin-fill geometry was controlled by both compressional tectonics, which generated uplifted blocks and accommodation spaces, and desertification, which has significantly decreased the sediment input since the late Miocene. Despite the uncertainties, our results provide new insights into Andean tectonics and may be used as a screening tool for natural resources such as minerals and groundwater.",,,Geological Society of America Bulletin,,,,2018-09-12,2018,2018-09-12,2019-01-01,131,1-2,155-174,Closed,Article,"Labbé, N.; García, M.; Simicic, Y.; Contreras-Reyes, E.; Charrier, R.; De Pascale, G.; Arriagada, C.","Labbé, N.

Here we obtain the phase in noncommutative space for the Spavieri effect, a generalization of Aharonov-Bohm effect which involves a coherent superposition of particles with opposite charges moving along a single open interferometric path. By means of the experimental considerations a limit θ≃0.13TeV−1 is achieved, improving by 10 orders of magnitude the results derived by Chaichian et al. [Phys. Lett. B 527, 149 (2002)PYLBAJ0370-269310.1016/S0370-2693(02)01176-0] for the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

LC impairs the normal sleep-awake cycle and produces disturbances in behavior, cognition and motor skills. Abnormal melatonin (MT) levels have also been identified in LC. Administration of MT may regulate circadian rhythms and prevent the oxidative damage. We studied the effects of MT on spatial memory acquisition (SMA) and motor skills in a liver fibrosis model (LF)s. Materials and Methods: 45 rats, divided into 4 groups. (G1: LF; G2: LF+MT;G3:MT; G4:Healthy control (HC)). LF was induced by carbon tetrachloride intraperitoneal injection (0.2 ml/Kg) for 5 months. MT was administered during 5 weeks (0.4mg/Kg/day). SMA was evaluated by using the Morris Water Maze protocol where the escape latency (EL) and mean speed were measured. Data were registered by SMART®. Results: The EL measurement analyzed by two way ANOVA: cirrhosis presented a higher EL than controls or those treated with MT suggesting impaired memory acquisition which is rescued by MT treatment. The mean speed analysis revealed that LF presented higher speed than LF+MT or HC, suggesting that LF affects motor skills, which are improved by MT. To discard whether EL is affected by altered motor skills in LF treated with MT, we compared the average EL and speed between days 2 and 6 of the training protocol. Speed was not improved during the trials unlike EL, suggesting that memory acquisition is independent of motor skills.  Conclusion: These findings suggest that MT improves cognition and motor skills in the LF model.",,,Annals of Hepatology,,,,2018-07-31,2018,,2018-07-31,17,5,0-10,Closed,Article,"Bouchet, Antoine; Ossandón, Carolina; Haeger, Paola; Bresky, Gustavo","Bouchet, Antoine (Department of Biomedical Sciences.

K. Mopeli, from 1975 to 1994. The core argument advanced is that the role of white men in the Qwaqwa public service had adverse consequences for local bantustan politics. As a result, the ruling Dikwankwetla Party increasingly experienced a backlash from anti-bantustan formations.

Photometric Analysis of the Transmission Spectra of Selected Exoplanets,"We present the results of ground based observations and model analysis of transits of exoplanets WASP-33b, WASP-43b, WASP-104b, and HD 219134b. Broadband transmission spectra (dependence of the observed radii on wavelength) have been plotted for all exoplanets, ranging from the near-UV to the IR region. We show that the transmission spectrum of WASP-33b is, within errors, flat in the range of 3800 Å to 12 000 Å. The derived broadband spectrum of WASP-43b is also flat in the first approximation, although other authors have reported the presence of absorption lines of various chemical elements in the narrow bands. Model spectra of WASP-43b taken from the literature and based on IR data allowed us to obtain a direct estimate of its nighttime temperature. We present and analyze the results of ground based observations which confirm the discovery of a transiting super-Earth in the HD 219134 star system. Signs of this planet’s existence were discovered earlier during the radial velocity analysis of the star, as well as transit observations with the Spitzer space telescope in the IR.At the estimated time, we registered a transit in the near-UV range several times. The transit depth measured in the U-band of the Johnson photometric system amounts to 0.13% ± 0.027%, which is deeper than the one based on Spitzer measurements.

Multiplicity surveys of exoplanet host stars,"Abstract In order to determine the true impact of stellar multiplicity on the formation and evolution of planets, we initiated direct imaging surveys to search for (sub)stellar companions of exoplanet host stars on close orbits, as their gravitational impact on the planet bearing disk at first and on formed planets afterwards is expected to be maximal. According to theory these are the most challenging environments for planet formation and evolution but might occur quite frequently in the milky way, due to the large number of multiple stars within our galaxy. On this poster we showed results, obtained so far in the course of our AO and Lucky-imaging campaigns of exoplanet host stars, conducted with NACO/ESO-VLT for southern and with AstraLux/CAHA2.2m for northern targets, respectively. In addition, we introduced our new high contrast imaging survey with SPHERE/ESO-VLT to search for close companions of southern exoplanet host stars, and presented some first results.",,,Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union,,,,2018-08,2018,2020-01-13,2018-08,14,S345,316-317,Closed,Article,"Mugrauer, M.; Ginski, C.; Vogt, N.; Neuhäuser, R.; Adam, C.","Mugrauer, M.

Recent studies that analyze the deployment of solar parabolic trough collectors (SPTC) in different countries and the operational SPTC plants are also presented and discussed. The paper also discusses the different kinds of software and test methods of solar collectors developed since 1981 which can be distinguished by their particular mathematical models or tracking techniques. In particular, since the mathematical models are especially required for the design, analysis, testing and validation of the systems results as they provide an approximation of the dynamic behavior of the physical properties of the system, they are discussed in depth. The mathematical models allow the calculation of different parameters of the solar parabolic trough system, the angle of inclination of the collecting surface and the forces acting on the system. The validity and experimental validation of the major mathematical models on practical solar parabolic trough concentrators, receivers and other components of different dimension are also reviewed. The paper showed the optical efficiency values are close to 63% and the theoretical peak optical efficiency reached 75%",,,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,,,,2018-02,2018,,2018-02,82,,1215-1260,Closed,Article,"Hafez, A.Z.; Attia, A.M.; Eltwab, H.S.; ElKousy, A.O.; Afifi, A.A.; AbdElhamid, A.G.; AbdElqader, A.N.; Fateen, S-E.K.; El-Metwally, K.A.; Soliman, A.; Ismail, I.M.","Hafez, A.Z.

Most of them are proposed a priori, and there are no segmentations based on the acceptance of technology and the personal values of the players. The foremost purpose of this study is to obtain a posteriori segmentation of online video games’ players, founded on unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model, and to describe the subsequent segments consistent with the personal values of Schwartz. The measurement model and the structural model were analyzed with partial least squares (PLS). Subsequently, the PLS-prediction-oriented segmentation technique has been devoted to inspecting unobserved heterogeneity and to find players’ segments. Four segments are obtained from the statistical analysis, and data analysis shown that in each of the segments, the explained variance of both use and behavioral intention (which are the endogenous variables of the model) is significantly improved by comparing the results of the global sample.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Games and Culture,,,,2018-04-18,2018,2018-04-18,2020-05,15,3,227-247,Closed,Article,"Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.; Rondán-Cataluña, F.

This work has also studied how gender discriminates those relationships.   Design/methodology/approach DeLone and McLean’s model of information systems success, visual aesthetic and gender socialisation theory are used as a theoretical framework for the study. An explanatory model was proposed based on the previous literature, and then this model was validated using a sample of undergraduate students. Partial Least Squares was chosen as the approach to conduct the statistical analysis.   Findings First, the findings show that the variance explained by the proposed model in user satisfaction of SIS is 67 per cent. Second, visual aesthetics has a significant direct effect on user satisfaction of SIS, but the indirect effect is much higher, through its relationship to system quality and information quality. Third, the results indicate that there are significant differences between men and women in the direct relationship between visual aesthetics and user satisfaction of SIS, and this relationship being much more intense in the case of women.   Originality/value The study highlights the role of visual aesthetics as a variable that explains user satisfaction in information systems; this fact emphasises on the importance of taking into account aesthetics when designing information systems. In addition, the findings support the existence of a novel relationship between visual aesthetics and information quality. Finally, new evidence on gender differences concerning user satisfaction in information systems is presented; this result indicates in the opposite direction to recent studies that imply a certain homogenisation of gender in relation to the perceptions associated with the technologies of the information.",Conflict of interest: The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.,,Kybernetes,,,,2018-04-11,2018,2018-04-11,2018-09-26,47,8,1604-1622,Closed,Article,"Ramírez-Correa, Patricio Esteban; Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier; Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio Esteban (School of Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Coquimbo, Chile); Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier (Business Administration and Marketing, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain); Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge (Business Administration and Marketing, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain)","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio Esteban (Catholic University of the North)","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio Esteban (Catholic University of the North); Rondán-Cataluña, Francisco Javier (University of Seville); Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge (University of Seville)",14,5,,4.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103354691,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

For this purpose, five hundred samples of five white varieties were stabilized at different a w values using the isopiestic method. Next, hyperspectral images (HSIs) of ten grains for each combination (variety, a w value), covering the range of 400–1000 nm were acquired, and mean spectral for each grain extracted. Then, due to a linear relationship that the spectral profiles are shown, the modeling was performed with a w values over 0.741 using partial least square regression (PLSR). From total spectra, three hundred spectrum were selected and randomly divided into training and validation sets. The results shown coefficient of determination from 0.59 to 0.834 concluding than for a w over 0.741, HSI + PLSR show potential for a w prediction in white quinoa grains.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",,Journal of Food Engineering,,,,2018-12,2018,,2018-12,238,,95-102,Closed,Article,"Castro, Wilson; Prieto, Jose M.; Guerra, Roenfi; Chuquizuta, Tony; Medina, Wenceslao T.; Acevedo-Juárez, Brenda; Avila-George, Himer","Castro, Wilson (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca 06002, Peru); Prieto, Jose M.

This biopolymer has important applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. This is produced by the action of an acid-lactic bacteria and yeasts consortium on lactose present in the kefiran granule. In the present work, kefiran concentration in the fermentation broth was optimized by the application of the response surface methodology in a central composite design of thirteen experiments. Temperature and whey powder (WP) content were the analysed dependent variables. Among the 14 suggested optimal temperature and WP conditions, it was selected 25°C for temperature and 44.1% (w/w) for WP as optimal conditions to perform further model validation experiments. Under these conditions, the quadratic model regarding kefiran concentration displayed 209.72 ± 9.77 mg Glu/mL after 48 h of culture. The obtained response surface model was further validated with three additional experiments by using these optimal conditions for temperature and WP content described above. The validation result was 216.06 ± 14.40 mg Glu/mL suggesting that experimental and theoretical models have not significant differences (p ≤ 0.05).

We conducted a manipulative study using hen eggs to estimate the potential Argentine Ant recruitment to pipping eggs in the Red-tailed Tropicbird, Phaethon rubricauda, at Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Chile. Hen eggs were experimentally opened to simulate pipping eggs and control eggs were left unopened. The eggs were monitored for 90 min. The time elapsed until the arrival of the first ant did not differ between experimental and control eggs. None of the control eggs were visited by more than two ants. In contrast, the inferred cumulative number of ants that arrived at experimental eggs varied from 1 to >450. Simulated pipping eggs attracted a high number of ants in a short period of time, and the probability of an egg being attacked by ants after 5 and 60 min of exposure was 75% and 99%, respectively. A long-term monitoring study is needed to determine the actual Argentine Ant recruitment rate on pipping eggs, and the potential effects on the post-fledging survival rate of this native seabird which is threatened by a number of introduced species.","We are grateful to Ma’u Henua and to CONAF-Rapa Nui for their support and for allowing access to Rano Raraku at the Rapa Nui National Park.

Design/methodology/approach This is a descriptive study with a quantitative approach. Face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire were carried out with a sample of 314 immigrant entrepreneurs in the city of Antofagasta. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and mean difference.   Findings The results show a new type of entrepreneur that cannot be fully described by the theories developed for South–North immigrant entrepreneurs. The concept of the South–South entrepreneur is therefore proposed, in order to categorise these entrepreneurs and explain their behaviour, with the conclusion that this group makes a significant contribution to the local economy, both in terms of job and wealth creation and by broadening the availability of goods and services.   Practical implications Given that immigrant entrepreneurs are a valuable socio-economic asset to the city in terms of job and wealth creation and service diversification, public administrations should endeavour to support these individuals and attract them to the city.   Social implications Knowledge of the contribution of this group will lead to a greater acceptance of immigrants who have recently been rejected by certain sectors of the population.   Originality/value This study reveals the existence of a group of immigrant entrepreneurs whose characteristics and contribution to local development were previously not known. 
 Propósito El objetivo de este artículo es caracterizar a los inmigrantes emprendedores/as de la región de Antofagasta e identificar de su aporte al desarrollo local.   Diseño/metodología/enfoque Es un estudio descriptivo, con un enfoque cuantitativo. Se realizaron entrevistas cara a cara con cuestionario estructurado a una muestra de 314 inmigrantes emprendedores de la ciudad de Antofagasta. Los datos fueron analizados utilizando estadística descriptiva y diferencia de medias.   Resultados Los resultados muestran un nuevo tipo de emprendedor que no pueden ser explicados a cabalidad por las teorías desarrolladas para inmigrantes emprendedores Sur-Norte. Por ello, se propone el concepto de emprendedores Sur-Sur, para categorizarles y explicar su comportamiento, concluyendo que realizan un aporte significativo a la economía local, tanto en generación de empleo y riqueza como en el incremento en la oferta.   Implicaciones prácticas Puesto que los inmigrantes emprendedores son un valioso activo socioeconómico para la ciudad en términos de generación de empleo, riqueza y diversidad en la oferta de servicios, las administraciones públicas deberían de tratar de apoyarlos, cuidarlos y atraer a la ciudad.   Implicaciones sociales El conocimiento del aporte de este colectivo contribuirá a una mejor aceptación de los inmigrantes, que en los últimos años han sido rechazados por algunos sectores de la población.   Originalidad/valor Este estudio devela la realidad de un grupo de inmigrantes emprendedores del cual no se tenía conocimiento sobre sus características y su aporte al desarrollo local.","The authors are grateful for the support of the Vice-Rector for Research and Technological Development of the Universidad Católica del Norte, through the VRIDT project 10301383: Immigrant entrepreneurs and their socio-economic impact in Antofagasta.",,Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administración,,,,2018-08-03,2018,2018-08-03,2018-11-30,31,3,450-470,Closed,Article,"Rodrigo, Luis Miguel; Romaní, Gianni; Ricci, Emilio","Rodrigo, Luis Miguel (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Romaní, Gianni (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Ricci, Emilio (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Rodrigo, Luis Miguel (Catholic University of the North)","Rodrigo, Luis Miguel (Catholic University of the North); Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North); Ricci, Emilio (Catholic University of the North)",8,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105994466,,

These alluvial terrace deposits represent a complex history of sedimentary sequences that are stacked upon older deposits with crosscutting or onlapping relationships and display varying degrees of pedogenic overprinting. These cut-and-fill alluvial and colluvial sands and silts include subordinate interbedded gravel layers and lenses and buried palaeosols with vertic pedogenic characteristics. The deposits occur lower than 17 m above the present river bed or in erosional gullies/dongas up to 20 m above the present river channel, far below the older and higher Wedburg and Proksch Koppie terraces. The formation reaches a maximum thickness of 37 m at the Riverton type area southeast of Barkly West. Middle and Late Stone Age artefacts indicate an age range from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. Alternating alluvial deposition and minor incision with pedogenesis of the Riverton Formation indicates complex environmental fluctuations over a long time period after deposition of the older, underlying Rietputs Formation gravels. This period of aggradation within alluvial channels and floodplains indicates a general reduction in catchment discharge of rivers in the summer rainfall region and conforms to the progressive drying of the southern African climate ~1.2 Ma (Gibbon, 2009).","Drs.

However, these studies rely on tissue samples collection for DNA analysis which may be problematic for species with a sensitive conservation status. Partial fin-clipping has been employed for tissue collection, due to the increased popularity of DNA-based analysis for ecological and fisheries studies, however, fin clipping can potentially affect behavior, swimming performance, predator avoidance and the ability to find and capture prey. This study aimed to test the effects of filament clipping using captive breed seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus) as an alternative tool for tissue sample. Clipped filaments regrew on average 0.05 ± 0.02 mm/day for 3 months and no mortality or disease was observed during the experiment. Filaments provided enough tissue for DNA analysis. This study provided valuable information regarding a new sampling technique that does not impair the seahorse locomotion. This methodology may be used in population’s genetic studies of other species that have skin filaments as a morphological trait.",This study received national funds from FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology through project UID/Multi/04326/2013.

Using Lebowa, the Northern Sotho bantustan, as a case study, I examine why “development” became such an important framing concept for the homeland project, how the concept changed over time, and why its application was constrained in Lebowa. I show how the internal debates within “development circles”—from policy planners to black businessmen—showcased varying understandings and beliefs about the nature of Lebowa's economy and how best to overcome its weaknesses. But by treating “development” as more than just a legitimising discourse, I ultimately argue that “development” practices— and their particular focus on creating an “entrepreneurial class”—served to entrench an already existing elite in Lebowa.",,,African Historical Review,,,,2018-07-03,2018,2019-04-19,2018-07-03,50,1-2,4-26,Closed,Article,"Phillips, Laura","Phillips, Laura (New York University, USA; Society, Work and Development Institute (SWOP), University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa)","Phillips, Laura (New York University; University of the Witwatersrand)","Phillips, Laura (New York University; University of the Witwatersrand)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113613108,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

There were 468 divorced people included in the study, 240 Spanish and 228 Chilean. 71.5% of the Chilean and 100% of the Spanish people had children. An analysis of the variance identified that life satisfaction is higher in Chilean people than in Spanish people, although the size of the effect is moderate. Regression analysis of the data sets shows that the time since divorce and provenance explain life satisfaction for those divorced people who participated in this study. Separate analyses by country show that while for divorced Spanish people time since their divorce was the only predictor of life satisfaction, age and time since separation were the predictors of life satisfaction for Chilean divorced people.","This research has been funded with support awarded to the second author by the Government of Chile National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development, FONDECYT No. 1150044. / Esta investigación ha sido financiada con la ayuda para proyectos de investigación concedida por el Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico del Gobierno de Chile, FONDECYT N° 1150044 a la segunda autora.",,Studies in Psychology,,,,2018-01-02,2018,2018-01-03,2018-01-02,39,1,154-178,Closed,Article,"Yárnoz-Yaben, Sagrario; Guzmán-González, Mónica; Comino, Priscila; Garrido, Lusmenia; Contreras, Paula; Rivera, Diana","Yárnoz-Yaben, Sagrario (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad del País Vasco — Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Comino, Priscila (Escuela de Magisterio, Vitoria.

One laboratory uses a pure non-maximally entangled channel but has a capability of performing the joint measurement on bases with a constrained degree of entanglement; the other lab makes use of a mixed X-state channel but can perform a joint measurement on bases with higher entanglement degrees. We compare the average teleportation fidelity achieved in both cases, finding that the fidelity achieved with the X-state can surpass the obtained with a pure channel, even though the X-state is less entangled than the latter. We find the conditions under which this effect occurs. Our results evidence that the entanglement of the joint measurement plays a role as important as the entanglement of the channel in order to optimize the teleportation process. We include an example showing that the average fidelity of teleportation obtained with a Werner state channel can be greater than that obtained with a Bell state channel.",The authors thank grant FONDECyT 1161631.,,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,,,,2018-04-25,2018,2018-04-25,2018-05-25,51,21,215301,Closed,Article,"Roa, Luis; de Guevara, María L Ladrón; Soto-Moscoso, Matias; Catalán, Pamela","Roa, Luis (); de Guevara, María L Ladrón (Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Soto-Moscoso, Matias (Departamento de Física, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile; Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad del Bío-Bío, Avenida Collao 1202, Casilla 15-C, Concepción, Chile); Catalán, Pamela (Departamento de Física, Universidad de Concepción, Casilla 160-C, Concepción, Chile; Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad del Bío-Bío, Avenida Collao 1202, Casilla 15-C, Concepción, Chile; Facultad de Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad San Sebastián, Campus Las Tres Pascualas, Lientur 1457, Concepción, Chile)",,"Roa, Luis (); de Guevara, María L Ladrón (Catholic University of the North); Soto-Moscoso, Matias (University of Concepción; University of Bío-Bío); Catalán, Pamela (University of Concepción; University of Bío-Bío; San Sebastián University)",2,1,,0.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103323445,"51 Physical Sciences; 5102 Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics",

One of the main objectives of these observations was to check some suggestions of the presence of a third low-mass component in the system. Analysing our own radial velocity (RV) measurements of β Coronae Borealis obtained between 2004 and 2013 together with other RV and astrometric data taken from the literature, we have considerably improved the orbital elements of the star. Using residual RVs obtained after subtracting the orbit from the observed RV, we detected a significant periodic signal consistent with the well-known 18.4868-d rotation/magnetic period of the star. The shape of the residual RVs folded with the rotation period exhibits a bimodal structure. In order to clarify the origin of the residual RV variation, we model the RV variation due to rotational modulation Zeeman patterns in the spectral lines of β Coronae Borealis spectra. The results of this analysis and the investigation of chemical inhomogeneities in the spectra of β Coronae Borealis convincingly support the ‘magnetic’ nature of the observed RV variations.",The authors acknowledge the Russian Science Foundation (grant N14-50-00043) for financial support of the theoretical part of this study.

To date, there is a lack of studies simultaneously assessing the effect of communal coping strategies and cognitive strategies on the development of posttraumatic growth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the role of communal coping strategies and cognitive strategies such as intrusive and deliberated rumination as potential mediators between subjective severity of the event and posttraumatic growth and positive adjustment in the context of natural disaster. The questionnaire was administrated to 225 people affected by the most intense earthquake recorded in Chile in this century. The results of multiple mediation analysis showed that both cognitive strategies, such as deliberative rumination, and communal coping strategies, such as communal positive reappraisal and participation in spiritual rituals, are potential mediators between subjective severity and posttraumatic growth. Overall, the present work offers researchers and professionals interested in this area of study an interesting approach to analyse individual and collective coping strategies and its interrelation.","Special acknowledgement for Tomás Arias, Alia Awad, Nadia Calderón, Osvaldo Galaz, Leyla Herrera, and Nicolás Mejías from Universidad de Concepción, Chile, for their collaboration in this research project.",,Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology,,,,2018-05-31,2018,2018-05-31,2018-07,28,4,191-199,Closed,Article,"García, Felipe E.; Wlodarczyk, Anna","García, Felipe E.

This was later used as down converter and light scattering material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Morphological, compositional and optical properties were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These particles were added with other constituents in the process of fabricating N719 or N749 stained photoanode for DSSCs. Devices fabricated using 2 wt% phosphor constituent showed an appreciable enhancement in short-circuit current density (Jsc) as well as higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to devices without phosphor content. The observed enhancement in efficiency is due to downconversion luminescence and light scattering effects arising from these phosphors particles. Further compared with the N719 based device, the enhancement in PCE for N749 based device is 59%. The significant enhancement in PCE is mainly attributed to the optical wavelength matching between the emission of phosphor and the absorbance of the N749 sensitizer. Thus our work demonstrates how the phosphor material dually improves the DSSC efficiencies.","The authors SR gratefully acknowledge Fondecyt postdoctoral program (No. 3150213), PM to Fondecyt Regular (No. 1130802) and J.

Short term stability of two lipophilic toxins, representing two chemically different groups of toxins — okadaic acid (OA) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning toxin) and 13-desmethyl spirolide C (13desmSPXC) (cyclic imine) — in seawater, interstitial water and sediment were analyzed. OA was found to be very stable in seawater, interstitial water and sediment, without significant changes over a 23-day period. Contrarily, 13desmSPXC was readily degraded, but faster in interstitial water than in seawater. In sediments, its degradation was also fast and dependent on the origin of the samples. 13desmSPXC was found in natural sediments, and this toxin was mostly associated to large particles (>10 μm) in the sediment, that are or include resting cysts of the producer species. Therefore, it appears that high concentrations of 13desmSPXC in seawater would indicate recent blooms of the producer species, while those of OA could be due to recent blooms or to others that took place long before detection. The absence of OA and 13desmSPXC indicates a low impact of those toxins in the study area.","This research was funded by Xunta de Galicia through the Project PGDIT-12/02.

In this paper fly ashes were used as a raw material to replace natural clay to make fired bricks. The effects of a high replacement ratio (from 0% to 100%) of clay with fly ash on the mechanical, radiological and leaching properties of bricks were analyzed. A study of the different sintering temperatures of bricks was carried out at the selected temperatures of 800, 900 and 1000 °C. When the temperature was increased the mechanical strength was also increased. Two leaching tests (one batch and the other monolithic) were carried out and the bricks with a high replacing ratio did not present problems regarding the heavy metal leaching in either test. The contents of three radionuclides (220Ra, 232Th and 40K) were analyzed and the Activity Concentration Index of the bricks was calculated and was lower than 1, indicating a radiation exposure lower than 1 mSv y−1.",The authors acknowledge Dr. Santiago Hurtado from the Service of Radionuclides of University of Seville for his technical assistance with the radioactivity measurements.,,Ceramics International,,,,2018-08,2018,,2018-08,44,11,13313-13319,Closed,Article,"Leiva, C.; Rodriguez-Galán, M.; Arenas, C.; Alonso-Fariñas, B.; Peceño, B.","Leiva, C.

The generally higher reactivity of chalcopyrite in chloride as opposed to sulfate solutions has resulted in many studies of chloride systems for the hydrometallurgical treatment of chalcopyrite. Despite much progress on the chloride leaching process, agglomeration and curing has received less attention over the past years. This paper reports a study on the effect of addition of chloride ion in the agglomeration and the effect of curing time on the overall leaching process of chalcopyrite ore. The work involved leaching tests carried out in columns containing 3.0 kg of agglomerated ore irrigated with raffinate solution under ambient conditions. Experiments with agglomerates produced at different concentration of chloride (20, 50 and 70 kg/t) leach at approximately the same rate. It has been demonstrated that chloride ions presence is necessary to improve the leaching kinetics, but high concentrations of chloride are not essential under ambient conditions. The rate of dissolution of chalcopyrite ore agglomerated with high concentrations of acid and chloride ions increases as the curing period increases from 15 to 80 days observing extraction of copper up to 60% in 20 days of leaching. In all experiments, the shape of the leach curves indicate that the copper that has been solubilized during the curing period is rapidly leached followed by continuous slow leaching thereafter. This study supports the addition of chloride at the agglomeration stage as a viable route for the treatment of low-grade copper sulfide ore.",,,Hydrometallurgy,,,,2018-11,2018,,2018-11,181,,215-220,Closed,Article,"Velásquez-Yévenes, L.; Torres, David; Toro, Norman","Velásquez-Yévenes, L.

Therefore, new noninvasive technologies for measuring texture properties are being studied. In this paper, forty Swiss-type cheese samples were prepared and carried to the ripening stage. During this process, hyperspectral images (HSI) were obtained in reflectance mode, in a range of 400–1000 nm. The hardness of Swiss-type cheese was measured using the technique of texture profile analysis. The relationship between spectral profiles and hardness values was modeled using two types of regression models, i.e., partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). For both PLSR and ANN, two models were created, the first one uses all the wavelengths and the second makes a selection of the relevant wavelengths. The ANN models showed slightly better performance than the PLSR models. As result, it is possible to use the proposed technique (HSI + ANN) to predict the texture properties of Swiss-type cheeses throughout the ripening period.",,,Journal of Food Engineering,,,,2018-02,2018,,2018-02,219,,8-15,Closed,Article,"Vásquez, Nadya; Magán, Claudia; Oblitas, Jimy; Chuquizuta, Tony; Avila-George, Himer; Castro, Wilson","Vásquez, Nadya (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06002, Peru); Magán, Claudia (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06002, Peru); Oblitas, Jimy (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06002, Peru); Chuquizuta, Tony (Facultad de Ingeniería Zootecnista, Agronegocios y Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza de Amazonas, Chachapoyas, Chachapoyas 01001, Peru); Avila-George, Himer (Unidad de Transferencia Tecnológica Tepic, CONACYT - CICESE, Tepic, Nayarit 63173, Mexico); Castro, Wilson (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Cajamarca, Cajamarca 06002, Peru)","Castro, Wilson (Private University of the North)","Vásquez, Nadya (Private University of the North); Magán, Claudia (Private University of the North); Oblitas, Jimy (Private University of the North); Chuquizuta, Tony (National University Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza); Avila-George, Himer (Unidad de Transferencia Tecnológica Tepic, CONACYT - CICESE, Tepic, Nayarit 63173, Mexico); Castro, Wilson (Private University of the North)",64,21,,8.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091829236,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",
278,pub.1107405209,10.1002/ep.13062,,,Optimization of the solar brine evaporation process: Introduction of a solar air heater,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the evaporation process of reject brine by using a solar system. The solar system contained a solar still coupled with a solar air heater (SAH). Solar still had a heated base, which was connected to the solar collector with a copper pipe. The influence of the introduction of the SAH to the system and increased levels of air mass flowrates was investigated. Variations in temperature and solar irradiation were monitored as well as brine evaporation. Introducing the SAH and increasing the air mass flowrate resulted in faster brine evaporation, higher utilization rate of solar radiation, higher brine, and base temperature levels within the solar still compared to the system without the SAH. The mean base temperature of the system with the SAH was 43.46 ± 11.3°C, while that of the system without the SAH was 30.62 ± 7.35°C. The use of the SAH and high air mass flowrates influenced the temperature distribution within the solar still, which affected the evaporation of the brine in a positive way. Introduction of the SAH and high air mass flowrate increased the drying efficiency of the solar system at a level of 120%. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13062, 2019",The author Rodrigo Poblete acknowledges to the Central Laboratory for Marine Aquaculture of the Marine Sciences Department at the Universidad Católica del Norte for equipment support.,,Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy,,,,2018-10-05,2018,2018-10-05,2019-05,38,3,,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil; Salihoglu, Guray","Poblete, Rodrigo (Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil (Environmental Engineering Department, Engineering Faculty, Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey); Salihoglu, Guray (Environmental Engineering Department, Engineering Faculty, Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey)","Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil (Bursa Uludağ University)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Salihoglu, Nezih Kamil (Bursa Uludağ University); Salihoglu, Guray (Bursa Uludağ University)",4,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107405209,31 Biological Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences,

Although numerous studies have been carried out in this area, the origin of the depression is still a matter of debate. The integration of seismic reflection and surface structural data along the basin allows the characterization of Oligocene and Neogene tectonic activity of the Salar de Atacama. A key element to unravel the Neogene to recent history of the basin is found along the Cordillera de la Sal, which comprises more than 3000 m of continental sedimentary succession assigned to the San Pedro Formation. Detailed analysis of the seismic data shows that large depocenters involving distal alluvial facies and evaporitic members of the San Pedro Formation accumulated in close relation with Oligocene extension. Extension was controlled by a first order normal fault located along the western flank of the Atacama basin, which appears as a key structural feature of the internal architecture of the Salar de Atacama. The rise of the Cordillera de la Sal ridge during the Neogene involved compression and sinistral strike slip in its southern domain, in combination with salt diapirism in its north domain. This transition is related to the thickness and distribution of the evaporitic lower members of the San Pedro Formation, which also controls the depth of the detachment level beneath the Cordillera de la Sal. Our results show that the current relief of the Salar de Atacama basin is mainly due to Oligocene extension and subsequent Neogene tectonic inversion.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the seismic data granted by ENAP Sipetrol, the support of Midland Valley who kindly provided us the Move software license to perform the 2D sections of this study, and SERNAGEOMIN for the field data from the mapping campaign 1:100.000 under the Plan Nacional de Geología project.",,Journal of South American Earth Sciences,,,,2018-11,2018,,2018-11,87,,200-210,Closed,Article,"Rubilar, Juan; Martínez, Fernando; Arriagada, César; Becerra, Juan; Bascuñán, Sebastián","Rubilar, Juan (Departamento de Geología, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Universidad de Chile, Plaza Ercilla 803, Santiago, Chile); Martínez, Fernando (Departamento de Geología, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Arriagada, César (Departamento de Geología, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Universidad de Chile, Plaza Ercilla 803, Santiago, Chile); Becerra, Juan (Departamento de Geología, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Universidad de Chile, Plaza Ercilla 803, Santiago, Chile); Bascuñán, Sebastián (Departamento de Geología, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, Universidad de Chile, Plaza Ercilla 803, Santiago, Chile)","Rubilar, Juan (University of Chile)","Rubilar, Juan (University of Chile); Martínez, Fernando (Catholic University of the North); Arriagada, César (University of Chile); Becerra, Juan (University of Chile); Bascuñán, Sebastián (University of Chile)",26,1,,4.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092868956,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 3706 Geophysics,

Evidence from Philippus Bopape, Josef Mahoro and Moses Rakoma’s sermons, annual and quarterly station reports and conversations with Hoffmann are juxtaposed in an attempt to understand why these African Christians and their families opted for a life within the Berlin Mission Church under Hoffmann’s close surveillance and almost prying interest in their personal affairs. Having embraced Christianity, these men and their families were attracted to the world of letters. Yet their livelihood was connected to an agrarian economy – hence their notions of belonging entwined with land and family and the metaphor of God as the mother cow. This combination rendered the arrangements they managed to make for themselves within the Berlin Mission Church convenient and fruitful, especially as consolidated in their friendly relations with Carl Hoffmann. It is argued that even as these African Lutheran leaders staged strict Berlin Mission loyalties, they also practised and preached the possibility of more hybrid identities.",,The financial support of the following institutions towards this research is gratefully accepted: the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; the National Institute for the Humanities and the Social Sciences grant number [CRP01611] and the National Research Foundation of South Africa.,South African Historical Journal,,,,2018-04-03,2018,2018-06-18,2018-04-03,70,2,407-433,Closed,Article,"Kriel, Lize","Kriel, Lize (University of Pretoria)","Kriel, Lize (University of Pretoria)","Kriel, Lize (University of Pretoria)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104892336,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

Although the artists featured in this article—Fikile Magadlela, Motlhabane Mashiangwako, Thami Mnyele, and Lefifi Tladi—personified black consciousness (BC) and cited its importance to their art making, historians still largely translate their work through the comfort of surrealism’s familiar frame. This article focuses on the professional lives of four men who were pointedly conscious in their politics and gave voice and vision to it. It accesses the black consciousness of each artist within select works by carefully analyzing and historicizing each one. It also records the lives of all four artists within BC’s parent body, the South African Students’ Organisation (SASO). Each one had a different relationship with SASO, which commissioned artists to perform, read, and display their work at cultural events it sponsored. SASO and BC’s other parent organization, the Black Peoples’ Convention, both financed artist-directed projects and critically reviewed and reproduced works in their newsletters, and some of these artists benefited directly. The artists of this study met one another through SASO in 1972, shared creative space, and built new programs aligned with black consciousness over subsequent years.

New investigations into these earlier excavations, however, show evidence for structural and organisational characteristics that overlap with those found at the nearby ceremonial site of Tulán-54, dated to around two millennia later.

The plunger method is used to promote efficient mixing between flocculant, particles, and electrolytes, ensuring the least amount of disturbance in the system. The suspensions are prepared at natural pH, varying salt concentration and flocculant dose, and then allowed to settle for a pre-set time. The sediment is then subjected to oscillatory rheological tests under small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) regimes. It is very remarkable that the viscoelastic moduli respond differently depending on the variable being examined; on the one hand, the salinity changes the internal structure of the floc network conforming the sediment by adopting liquid-like characteristics as salinity increases, on the other hand, different flocculant doses and settling times lead to unaltered floc network architectures.",,"RIJ thanks CONICYT Fondecyt no. 11171036, and the CONICYT PIA ACM 170005.

We increase the obliquity between 30° and 90° in 16 aquaplanets with liquid sea surface and perform the simulation allowing the sea ice cover formation to be a consequence of its atmospheric dynamics. Insolation is maintained constant in each experiment, but changing the obliquity affects the radiation budget and the large scale circulation. Earth-like atmospheric dynamics is observed for planets with obliquity under 54°. Above this value, the latitudinal temperature gradient is reversed giving place to a new regime of jet streams, affecting the shape of Hadley and Ferrel cells and changing the position of the InterTropical Convergence Zone. As humidity and high temperatures determine Earth’s habitability, we introduce the wet bulb temperature as an atmospheric index of habitability for Earth-like aquaplanets with above freezing temperatures. The aquaplanets are habitable all year round at all latitudes for values under 54°; above this value habitability decreases toward the poles due to high temperatures.","This research was partially financed by CONICYT grant no. 21110653, FONDECYT project no. 1171773, NC120066, and Center for Climate Science and Resiliency (CR)2, FONDAP-CONICYT n. 15110009.

As such, functional patterns under extreme water and temperature restrictions in deserts can provide inference of the responses of small ectotherms to climate change. However disentangling the interactive effects between both factors requires experimental evidence. Here we took advantage of a flowering desert episode promoting a population bloom in Gyriosomus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) beetles from Atacama Desert to test this interactive hypothesis. By systematically sampling two sympatric Gyriosomus species, we analyzed the differences in activity, body temperature and water loss rate. Body size regardless the species or sex was responsible for the observed behavioral and ecophysiological patterns. Large coleopterans (females > males, G. kingi > G. planicollis) lost less water and were active at higher temperatures making their bimodal diel activity less marked. Beyond the confirmation of the crucial role of water availability and inactivity in arid ecosystems, these results suggest that functional responses of small ectotherms to climate change will be size-dependent while advocate for integrating hydric and thermal data to better understand this transition.","Our acknowledgements to CONAF for granting permission and facilities to work in the Llanos de Challe National Park (Projects N. 028/2015 and 053/2015), and especially to Isla Troncoso, Sergio Araya, Alberto Villegas and Fernando Mercader.

Some critics have stated that the apartheid regime in South Africa supported an exclusively Western model of education, and that university education was based on a mono-cultural approach with bias towards Western values and expectations. With the demise of apartheid in 1994, the Government of National Unity (GNU) merged the fragmented hodgepodge of segregated tertiary institutions into 23 (now 26) public universities (26 since in 2004), Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) being one. There has been a paradigm shift to accommodate a new form of education which is not only supposed to address the imbalances of the past but be of relevance to the twenty-first-century knowledge economy. The transformation of the education sector is supposed to boost the Africanisation (African-oriented content) of the syllabus, foregrounding the cultural practices and values of the African people.

Ph.D. to first job mobility involves the preferences of both the hiring institution and the candidate. Both want to make the best choice and here institutional prestige plays a crucial role. A university’s prestige is an emergent property of hiring interactions, so we use a network perspective to measure it. Using this emergent ordering, we compare the subsequent scientific performance of scholars with different changes in the prestige hierarchy. We ask how movements between universities of different prestige from Ph.D. to first job correlates with academic performance. We use data of South African scholars from 1970 to 2012 and we find that those who make large movements in terms of prestige have lower research ratings than those who do not. Further, looking only those with large prestige movements, those with higher prestige Ph.Ds or first jobs have higher research ratings throughout their careers.","Financial support was provided through the Institut Universitaire de France.

261,pub.1104397865,10.1111/maec.12492,,,Scales of predator detection behavior and escape in Fissurella limbata: A field and laboratory assessment,"Abstract  The consumptive effects of predators are widely acknowledged, but predation can also impact prey populations through non‐consumptive effects (NCEs) such as costly antipredator behavioral responses. The magnitude of antipredator behavioral responses by prey is determined by an assessment of risk using sensory cues, which in turn is modulated by the environmental context. We studied the detection behavior and escape response of the keyhole limpet Fissurella limbata from the predatory sea star Heliaster helianthus. Through laboratory and field experimental trials, we quantified the distance and time of predator detection behavior by the prey, and measured their active escape responses when elicited. We found that predator detection by the limpet was chiefly mediated by distance, with experimental individuals capable of detecting predator presence effectively up to distances of at least 50 cm in the field and 70 cm under laboratory conditions. Our results indicate that this prey species is able to evaluate the proximity of its predator and use it as an indication of predation risk; therefore, predator–prey distance appears to be a primary predictor of the magnitude of the antipredator response. Given the tight relationship between predator distance and prey movement and the important role herbivores can play, particularly in this ecosystem, we expect that NCEs will cascade to the patterns of abundance and composition of rocky shore communities through changes in prey foraging behavior under risk.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding was provided by Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT) grant POSTDOC Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científicoy Tecnológico (FONDECYT) 3150240 TO T.M. and from the Iniciativa Científica Milenio (ICM) Center for the Study of Multiple Drivers on Marine Socio‐Ecological Systems (MUSELS) to B.R.B. with additional funding from FONDECYT grant 1120988 to B.R.B.

Although they are often caught in the south Pacific Ocean long-line fisheries, their trophic ecology is poorly understood. Stable isotopes with Bayesian mixing and dependence concentration models were performed to determine the diet and trophic differences between the two species in the South-eastern Pacific Ocean. According to the mixing models, fishes are the most important prey of these sharks. Dolphin calves and remains were found in the stomachs of both species, which represents a novel finding in trophic ecology of South Pacific sharks. Intra-specific differences were found in P. glauca, but not in specimens of I. oxyrinchus. The two sharks showed a high degree of diet overlap (73%), primarily over mackerel and dolphin carcasses. Our results indicate that blue and shortfin mako sharks have a generalist feeding strategy in the eastern Pacific Ocean, with a strong preference for teleost fishes and also for dolphin carcasses. Therefore, trophic studies are useful to understand energy flow through the food web, and the trophic position of key species.","The authors are grateful to Kaitlin Gallagher and Michael Hutson (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut) for their valuable help in improving this manuscript.","This work was supported by Subsecretaría de Pesca Chile (SUBPESCA) under grant ‘SRAM N° 2010-2013’: IFOP monitoring program, State of highly migratory resources, Fishing season 2010–2013.",Marine Biology Research,,,,2018-01-17,2018,2018-01-17,2018-02-07,14,2,173-182,Closed,Article,"Klarian, Sebastian A.; Canales-Cerro, Carlos; Barría, Patricio; Zárate, Patricia; Concha, Francisco; Hernández, Sebastián; Heidemeyer, Maike; Sallaberry-Pincheira, Pauline; Meléndez, Roberto","Klarian, Sebastian A.

Magnetotelluric (MT) and Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) measurements were carried out for groundwater exploration in late 2015 in the area of the Profeta Basin at the western margin of the Chilean Precordillera. Both methods complement each other: While MT in general attains larger penetration depths, TEM allows better resolution of near surface layers; furthermore TEM is free from galvanic distortion. Data were collected along three profiles, enabling a continuous resistivity image from the surface to at least several hundred meters depth. TEM data were inverted in a 1-D manner, consistently yielding a poorly conductive near-surface layer with a thickness of approximately 30 m and below a well-conducting layer which we interpret as the aquifer with resistivities around 10 Ωm. At marginal sites of the main SW-NE-profile the resistive basement was found in 150 m. These depths are confirmed by interpretation of the MT soundings. Those were firstly inverted with a 2-D approach and then by 3-D inversion as clear indications of three-dimensionality exist. Several modeling runs were performed with different combinations of transfer functions and smoothing parameters. Generally, MT and TEM results agree reasonably well and an overall image of the resistivity structures in the Profeta Basin could be achieved. The aquifer reaches depths of more than 500 m in parts and, by applying Archie's law, resistivities of 1 Ωm can be assumed, indicating highly saline fluids from the source region of the surrounding high Andes under persisting arid conditions.","This research was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT), through Project ACT 1203: Exploration and Assessment of New Groundwater Resources in the Central Depression of Antofagasta Region.

In addition, the depletion of oxide ores and those containing secondary sulfide copper will leave chalcopyrite ores as the main source of copper for future plants. To assure a sustainable hydrometallurgy plant, alternative water resources such as seawater and discard brine from desalination plants should be used together with a leaching process that can enhance the dissolution of chalcopyrite. This paper reports a study on the dissolution kinetics of finely ground copper oxide ore, chalcopyrite ore, and chalcopyrite concentrate leached in shake flasks, agitated reactors and columns using seawater and discard brine as the leaching solution. The type of chloride solution did not affect the dissolution of the copper oxide mineral. Regardless of the chloride solution used in the leaching test stirred at room temperature, the chalcopyrite dissolution did not exceed 4%, but increased to 90% when the temperature was increased to 50 °C. Column leaching of chalcopyrite ore with a P80 of 5 mm achieved a maximum dissolution of 43% of copper using discard brine at ambient temperature. The results show that curing time of the packed bed before the commencement of column irrigation and intermittent irrigation during leaching appeared to be important parameters to enhance dissolution of copper. Less irrigation time and more resting time can be beneficial for an industrial-scale heap leach plant.","The authors of this paper would like to acknowledge the financial support of Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Usach grant number 051615VY Dirección de Investigación, Científica y Tecnológica, Dicyt, that allowed to carried out leaching test in shake flask and stirred reactors.",,Hydrometallurgy,,,,2018-09,2018,,2018-09,180,,88-95,Closed,Article,"Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian; Quezada-Reyes, Víctor","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (Departamento de Ingeniería en Minas, Universidad de Santiago, Santiago, Chile); Quezada-Reyes, Víctor (Departamento de Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Minas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (University of Santiago Chile)","Velásquez-Yévenes, Lilian (University of Santiago Chile); Quezada-Reyes, Víctor (Catholic University of the North)",40,7,,6.83,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105741117,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The evaluated factors were algae arrangement (vertical versus horizontal), baffle existence (present versus absent), and air fan use (on versus off). Process productivity was maximized when the algae were arranged horizontally, a baffle was present, and the air fan was turned on. Of these, air fan use was the most important determinant of process performance. This optimized solar dryer system was then compared against the productivity of an open-air system. The solar dryer achieved a greater degree of moisture evaporation than open-air drying (86.1% versus 67.6%, respectively). This result is directly associated with the recorded peaks in air temperature (41.3 °C in the solar dryer versus 21.7 °C outside of the solar dryer). The specific energy consumption required for the optimized solar dryer process was 1.64 kWh/kg, as due to the energy requirements of the air fan and recirculation pump.

260,pub.1107224517,10.1002/ep.12951,,,Solar drying of landfill‐leachate sludge: Differential results through the use of peripheral technologies,"Sludge disposal, an indispensable element of waste management, is commonly achieved via landfilling, which requires sludge management. To this end, the drying process is critical in reducing sludge mass and volume, thereby lowering transport and storage costs. Solar energy is an alternative for minimizing costs of the drying process. This study evaluated drying landfill leachate‐derived sludge using a solar still with and without peripheral systems to enhance thermal heat input. Sludge drying was most successful when using all peripheral systems (i.e., solar air preheater, extractor, and solar collector), where an accumulated solar energy of 241.6 kJ/kg produced 20 g of sludge mass. When only using the solar air preheater and extractor, 226.1 kJ/kg were needed to achieve 35 g of sludge mass. Results were poorer and took comparatively longer to reach suitable dryness levels when no peripheral systems were used (310 kJ/kg, 28 g) or when drying took place outside of the solar still (751 kJ/kg, 28 g). Notably, the base of the solar drier was hotter (49.6°C peak) when the solar collector was used, and the thermal efficiency of the solar air preheater was 20.7%. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 345–353, 2019","This work was supported by the Chilean Ministry of Education (MICINN, Spanish acronym) [grant number FONDECYT N° 11140219].

Detailed monitoring has been performed at the heap bioleaching process in Minera Escondida since the start of the industrial operation in 2006. The huge industrial data recorded represents an opportunity to raise knowledge about complex bioleaching processes for improving the technology. A systematic approach using machine learning tools for the analysis of High Dimensional Feature Space is now being developed to deliver experience-based learning with the aim to serve as the foundation for optimal production planning and operational decision making, in the presence of inherent process variations. The construction of a Decision Support System (DSS) is reported, which considers a Real Time PCR array, a database for data logging and storage, the application of suitable statistical and computational tools for knowledge acquiring and finally the creation of a system of knowledge translation to transform it into action by applying recommendations that come to terms with operational limitations. The user can accurately retrieve data and design similar matches to the historic operation to get, for instance the expected metallurgical performance (such as copper recovery, acid consumption and bacterial activity) and recommendations.

The northern Chile is a natural laboratory to analyze this situation, since its Cenozoic tectonic evolution was marked by the tectonic inversion of Mesozoic extensional basins, which occurred simultaneously with the emplacement of km-scale intrusions. In order to provide insights on the interplay between basin inversion and magma emplacement, we completed a comparative analysis based of field data from four inverted Mesozoic basins of northern Chile and a series of previous and new analogue models reproducing the tectonic inversion of half-grabens and magma emplacement. The experiments showed that the magma migration and emplacement is controlled by the initial distribution of normal faults and occur preferentially along the inverted normal faults. High magma injection rate can cause a major reactivation of the normal faults, favoring a comparatively increase in bulk shortening. The most favorable condition for which the magma reaches the surface is under simultaneous high magma injection and shortening rates. The latter allow the magma to be emplaced along the core of inversion related anticlines such as it is recognized in northern Chile.","We thank Joao Hippertt for the invitation to contribute to this special issue.

259,pub.1100858956,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.01.014,,,Factors affecting the operational interaction between the South American sea lions and the artisan gillnet fishery in Chile,"The South American sea lion (SASL, Otaria byronia) is one of the species of pinnipeds that display the strongest level of conflict with fishing activities throughout its distribution range. However, little is known about potential temporal and/or spatial variations in the magnitude and effects of SASL and fishing interactions over an entire year and at different sites simultaneously. This study examines the factors that affect the intensity of the operational interaction between SASL and the artisan gillnet fishery in central Chile. Between 2014 and 2016, a total of 145 hauls at three artisan fishing coves were analyzed. South American sea lion interactions were observed in 82 of the 145 (56.6%) hauls analyzed, most frequently at the coves of San Antonio and El Membrillo. From the examined factors, Predation per Unit Effort increased with the number of SASL, however it decreased both during the summer and with greater distance from the nearest SASL colony. Artisan deterrent systems used by fishermen were found to be inefficient in avoiding the interactions with sea lions. Although the intensity of the interaction has increased in recent years (compared with previous studies in the area), the observed Catch per Unit Effort did not differ significantly during fishing trips with or without interaction, indicating that SASL is not a determining factor in the variation of artisan fishery catches. These results demonstrate that the intensity of interactions is not produced at random but rather it is related to factors that obey biological and ecological aspects of the SASL. These factors should be considered for the development of effective actions to prevent, or at least to reduce the interaction between SASL and artisan fisheries.","This study was supported by the Undersecretariat for Fisheries and Aquaculture, Chilean Government [Grant number 2013-115-DAP-35, “Characterization of the effects of principal artisan fisheries on marine ecosystems”], and Fondo de Investigación Pesquera [Grant number FIP 2014-29 “Population estimates for sea lions in Regions V, VI, VII and VIII”].

Let A α ( G ) = α D ( G ) + ( 1 − α ) A ( G ) where D ( G ) and A ( G ) are the diagonal matrix of the vertex degrees of G and the adjacency matrix of G, respectively. Let p ( G ) > 0 and q ( G ) be the number of pendant vertices and quasi-pendant vertices of G, respectively. Let m G ( α ) be the multiplicity of α as an eigenvalue of A α ( G ) . It is proved that m G ( α ) ≥ p ( G ) − q ( G ) with equality if each internal vertex is a quasi-pendant vertex. If there is at least one internal vertex which is not a quasi-pendant vertex, the equality m G ( α ) = p ( G ) − q ( G ) + m N ( α ) is determined in which m N ( α ) is the multiplicity of α as an eigenvalue of the matrix N. This matrix is obtained from A α ( G ) taking the entries corresponding to the internal vertices which are non quasi-pendant vertices. These results are applied to search for the multiplicity of α as an eigenvalue of A α ( G ) when G is a path, a caterpillar, a circular caterpillar, a generalized Bethe tree or a Bethe tree.

In the first stage we have used regional data to estimate country-specific models in which regional growth is conditioned by a set of controls, considering population density as a measure of concentration. The results of this stage show that population density has a negative effect on the growth of Brazilian and Chilean regions. In the second stage we have simulated the impact of the actual changes in population observed in the regions within these countries between 1980 and 2010. Using the new densities, we have recalculated the growth of the regions, generating a new national growth rate as a weighted average of the estimated growth of the regional economies. The regional deconcentration observed in Brazil produced less negative results in terms of national growth. While the Chilean increasing spatial concentration resulted in negative effects for national growth: the national GDP growth rate was reduced by 0.8% on a yearly basis. These results replicate the findings of Brülhart and Sbergami (J Urb Econ 65:48–63, 2009) for Brazil and Chile in their cross-section of countries.

The surface chemistry of the samples and, in particular, the oxidation state of the Co atoms, was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were used to obtain structural information. Morphological information was acquired by atomic force microscopy. The dependence of the magnetic properties of the samples as a function of Co-doping level in BT and the effect of the base used in the synthesis of the compound (i.e. NaOH or KOH) was studied from the analysis of hysteresis curves and FORC diagrams. The results demonstrated that the level of ferromagnetic component tend to increases as the percentage of Co doping is decreased.","AcknowledgmentsThis work has been partially financed by:Proyecto Basal CEDENNA FB0807, Proyecto Anillo ACT 1204 and 1409.

To limit the risks of predation, many marine mesograzers live within nests or burrows, potentially causing more damage to plants than predicted from consumption alone. To test whether the growth of large primary producers can be affected by modification of plant structures by small herbivores, we quantified the effect of the nest-building amphipod Pseudopleonexes lessoniae on blades of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera in New Zealand. Amphipods create their nests by rolling the blade margin in close proximity to the meristem. Blades with nests were 40% shorter than blades lacking nests and reduced in area by 55%. We examined the composition of amphipods inhabiting each nest to assess the temporal persistence of grazer aggregations. Nests were occupied by a single female or male–female pairs, and their newly hatched offspring. Analysis of offspring size distributions suggested that offspring dispersed from the maternal nest and did not remain to breed themselves. By concentrating physical damage and feeding on valuable tissues, these results indicate that even low numbers of small herbivores can cause localized impacts on the morphology and size of fast-growing algal blades. Predicting the consequences of this damage on larger scales will require understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of amphipod nests on giant kelp.","We are very grateful to R.

In the sub-Antarctic ecoregion of Magallanes, the presence of two morphotypes of Durvillaea antarctica has recently been recorded that are related to the specific hydrodynamic configuration of the sites in the region. This study investigates the photosynthetic activity and pigment composition during two periods of the year in these two morphotypes of D. antarctica. One of them has broad and laminar fronds and occurs in wave-protected environments, while the other morphotype is characterized by cylindrical and elongated fronds and inhabits wave-exposed environments. The adult specimens of the “elongated-cylindrical” morphotype were collected in Seno Otway (53.1° S, 71.5° W) and the specimens of the “laminar” morphotype in Bahía el Águila, San Isidro (53.7° S, 70.9° W). ETRmax, α, and Ek as parameters of the ETR-E curves were higher for the “laminar” than the “elongated-cylindrical” morphotype, resulting in significant values. The concentration of fucoxanthin was statistically higher for the morphotype “laminar” compared to the morphotype “elongated-cylindrical.” Both morphotypes exhibited different photosynthetic activities, perhaps attributed to their morphology, floatation capacity, and environment.","Project FONDECYT 1131023 to FT and AM (long-distance dispersal of macroalgae at high latitudes-floating kelp rafts capacity of nature under conditions along latitudinal), 1140940-AM (macroalgal adaptive radiation: potential links to the diversity of ecological niches in the Magellan and Antarctic ecoregion) and 1180433-AM (genomic, physiological, and ecological approaches to examine Antarctic and sub-Antarctic macroalgal responses to climate change and glacial retreat) of the National Council of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT).

We provide evidence of existing models of knowledge across disciplines with the African universities and show that these models range from exclusively Western knowledge to a weak inclusion of African knowledge systems.

Most of the studies regarding the ability of C. quitensis and D. antarctica to cope with abiotic stress have been focused on their physiological adaptations to tolerate cold stress, but little is known about their tolerance to salinity. We investigated whether rhizospheric bacteria associated to D. antarctica and C. quitensis improve the ability of Antarctic plants to tolerate salt stress. Salt tolerance was assayed in rhizospheric bacteria, and also their effects on the ecophysiological performance (photochemical efficiency of PSII, growth, and survival) of both plants were assessed under salt stress. A total of eight bacterial rhizospheric strains capable of growing at 4 °C were isolated. The strains isolated from D. antarctica showed higher levels of salt tolerance than those strains isolated from C. quitensis. The ecophysiological performance of C. quitensis and D. antarctica was significantly increased when plants were inoculated with rhizospheric bacteria. Our results suggest that rhizospheric bacteria improve the ability of both plants to tolerate salinity stress with positive effects on the adaptation and survival of vascular plants to current conditions in Antarctic ecosystem.",We acknowledge the financial and logistic support of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH Projects: RT-14-08 and RT-11-13.

Very little research has been conducted on the relationship between the macrolevel scale of microfinance and income inequality over time in a country and across countries. Based on panel‐data techniques, with annual data from 85 countries from 2001 to 2012 and a broad theoretical framework on microfinance and inequality, we provide empirical evidence that suggests that increases in the macrolevel scale of microcredit in a country contribute to reducing income inequality within that country over time. Finally, since microfinance may be endogenous, we used instruments from the existing literature to control for this problem.",,"Provides detailed information on individual MFIs worldwide and is the most comprehensive database of its kind.

In such areas, high water demand caused by population increases and economic development can only be satisfied with seawater supply. Furthermore, most of the non-coastal users are located at long distances and sometimes at altitudes very diverse from the coastline, meaning long pipelines and several pumping stations will be required to effectively supply water. The proposed optimization approach based on a mixed integer nonlinear programming model offers optimal designs of water supply systems from an economic and technical perspective. It determines the location and size of desalination plants and the design of the water transport network including pipelines of specified length and diameter and pumping stations that minimize capital and operational costs of the whole system.

Therefore, bacteria identification plays a critical role to protect public health from infectious diseases. Optical spectroscopy has been widely used to identify bacteria by yielding unique signature spectra representing the structure and composition of the bacteria. Since bacteria exhibit very close sensing and analytical patterns, it is challenging to determine their distinctions. In this study, we introduce a novel integrative computational approach for analyzing infrared (IR) spectroscopy spectra to identify bacteria by measuring their similarities employing logarithmic-based wavelet features. A visual analytics tool is also developed to support an interactive visual analysis for characterizing bacteria features. Thirty-two signature IR spectra of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and forty spectra of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosai) collected by an advanced fiber-optic Fourier transform IR (FO-FTIR) spectroscopy sensor system are used for validating the proposed computational approach. Three machine learning techniques are employed to differentiate the bacteria by measuring their performances. Implementing the presented approach, we identified the overall accuracy of 92.5% in classifying the bacteria with logistic regression. We also found that both sensitivity and specificity are significantly high, exceeding 92%.",,,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,,,,2018-06-20,2018,2018-06-20,,25,1,1-8,Closed,Article,"Ji, Soo-Yeon; Jeong, Dong Hyun; Hassan, Moinuddin; Ilev, Ilko K.","Ji, Soo-Yeon (Department of Computer Science, Bowie State University, Bowie, MD, USA); Jeong, Dong Hyun (Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of the District of Columbia, Washington, DC, USA); Hassan, Moinuddin (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA); Ilev, Ilko K.

It produced good quality education and graduated numerous students who went on to university and became professionals. It was among the top two most prestigious high schools in Soweto. After a series of politically related closures the school regained some stability in the 1980s and 1990s but never really achieved the success or prestige of the previous era. This paper attempts to explain how Morris Isaacson managed to be so successful in spite of the newly implemented Bantu Education system which was designed to provide mass schooling but blunt black aspiration. It notes, among other things, the relatively manageable enrolment in the 1960s, the importance of institutional discipline and good leadership, and the prestige of the teaching profession and the quality of high school teachers in Soweto, especially in the context of the professional limitations imposed by the colour bar. The paper then analyses why high schooling, while expanding, declined dramatically in effectiveness in Soweto in the late 1970s and 1980s.",The funding I receive from an NRF rating was helpful in carrying out this research.,,South African Historical Journal,,,,2018-03-20,2018,2018-03-20,2018-07-03,70,3,505-518,Closed,Article,"Glaser, Clive","Glaser, Clive (University of the Witwatersrand)","Glaser, Clive (University of the Witwatersrand)","Glaser, Clive (University of the Witwatersrand)",2,1,,3.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101651306,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",4 Quality Education

Theoretically, parasitic crustaceans inhabiting relatively small and scarce hosts should be monogamous. Parasites are also expected to exhibit higher reproductive performance (RP) than their free-living relatives, a strategy thought to have evolved to increase host-to-host transmission, or to be the outcome of living in a ‘stable, nutrient-rich environment’. Here, the parasitic isopod Parabopyrella lata and its shrimp host Lysmata boggessi were used to test for monogamy and augmented RP, and to examine whether or not P. lata castrates its host. Prevalence, population distribution, and reproductive performance were examined in P. lata over 1 year (2012–2013) off Homosassa Springs, Florida USA (28.8037° N, 82.5761° W). Prevalence of P. lata on L. boggessi was greater during the warmer months of the year and infested shrimps were almost exclusively males. P. lata lives in male–female pairs within the gill chamber of infested shrimps more frequently than expected by chance alone. The sizes of paired males and females were tightly and positively correlated with each other and with host size. Average fecundity (3660 ± 1146 eggs female−1) and reproductive output (61 ± 19%) in P. lata, as with other bopyrid parasites, was much greater than those reported for free-living isopods. This evidence supports the hypotheses that parasites such as P. lata are adapted to be monogamous, display augmented RP, and reproductively castrate their host.",Drs. Judy Grassle and Jason D.

High potential responses to selection for growth traits have been estimated in several abalone species; however, the genetic bases underlying individual differences in physiological performance are unknown. The aims of this study were to estimate the heritable variation of physiological traits associated with energy intake and allocation for the red abalone Haliotis rufescens; and the potential correlated responses to selection between growth and physiological traits at three developmental stages. Growth traits (shell length and width, and total mass) and physiological traits [energy intake, standard metabolic rate (SMR), and energy losses by ammonia excretion and feces] were measured in individuals belonging to 60 full-sib families in 2-years old juveniles, 3-y old young adults, and 4-y old near-harvest adult (n = 500–380 individuals/age; total n = 1300). Food intake showed significant h 2 in juveniles and young adults (0.37 and 0.14, respectively); but near zero h 2 in near-harvest adults. Variation in energy required for SMR showed low but significant h 2 (0.13) in young and near-harvest adults. Variation in energy lost through ammonia excretion showed significant h 2 in juveniles (0.33) and in near-harvest adults (0.14). Heritability for variation in the energy losses through feces was not significant. Heritabilities for growth traits were all moderate to high and significant for young and pre-harvest adults, but were not significant for juveniles. At the young adult stage, food intake was negatively and highly genetically correlated with each of the growth traits (−0.70 to −0.85); and at the near-harvest adult stage both SMR and ammonia excretion showed high-negative genetic correlations with each growth trait (−0.88 to −1.00). Thus, estimated correlated response to selection indicated that if selection was exerted for higher growth (choosing 5% best individuals), we would be indirectly selecting for abalones with lower food intake (correlated responses of −11 to −15%); or lower metabolic demands of (−14 to −24%), if the selection was applied to young or near-harvest adults, respectively. In turn, shell length could be enhanced up to 18% per generation. These results suggest that higher growth in red abalone is genetically associated with a more efficient use of food and a lower metabolic demand. The possibility to reduce food intake or metabolic demands by selecting for faster growing abalones would be a very positive development for the sustainability of this culture.",We are grateful to the Centro de Producción de Abalón de la Universidad Católica del Norte (CPA-UCN) for their invaluable contribution in providing all the necessary facilities required to undertake this study under controlled conditions.

Crossroads for Chilean higher education,"The objective of this study is to analyse the professional training of the students of mining courses, regarding the career barriers and the strategies to reverse them. Twenty-seven interviews with programme heads and union leaders in the industry were carried out. The results show paradoxical discourses: the programme heads point out that the duty of the students is to adapt to the mining industry ‘without crying’, but also highlight their skills: orderly, responsible, meticulous; while the union leaders argue that the incorporation of women is a political decision, but not a conviction of the value that women add to the mining industry. They emphasise that higher education must train women to compete on an equal basis with men. In this sense, two educational paradigms emerge: gender equality and/or diversity. In the first, there is a model of ‘worker-miner-man’ as the unequivocal mentor of the mining industry, while the second questions this model, recognising the contributions of women to the mining industry.",,This study has been funded by Regular Fondecyt Project N° 1150055 y N°1180016.,Journal of Education and Work,,,,2018-11-17,2018,2019-01-11,2018-11-17,31,7-8,628-644,Closed,Article,"Salinas, Paulina; Romaní, Gianni; Silva, Jimena","Salinas, Paulina (School of Journalism/Faculty of Humanities, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Romaní, Gianni (Entrepreneurship Center and SME/ Faculty of Economics and Administration, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Silva, Jimena (School of Psychology/Faculty of Humanities, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Salinas, Paulina (Catholic University of the North)","Salinas, Paulina (Catholic University of the North); Romaní, Gianni (Catholic University of the North); Silva, Jimena (Catholic University of the North)",5,3,,2.71,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111371111,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education; 5 Gender Equality

However, its production relies completely on hatchery-reared seed, and the survival in early stages, particularly during the settling process, is the main limitation for this activity to become cost effective. Thus, in order to assess the feasibility of improving survival of larvae and post-larvae of A. nucleus through genetic selection without affecting growth, it was estimated the heritability and the genotype-environment interactions for such traits, as well as the genetic correlations between them. These parameters were estimated based on intraclass correlations of 40 full-sib families (10 half-sib families) at 1, 11 and 75 days post fertilization. Heritability values were very high for the post-larvae survival (0.49), while it was low and not significant for larvae survival (≤0.07) and medium to high for growth traits of larvae and post-larvae (>0.3). The traits analyzed in post-larvae exhibited significant genotype-environment interactions in relation to culture depth in the sea. No significant genetic correlations between the measured traits were found. The results suggest the existence of an important genetic component in the variation of post-larval survival, and larval and post-larval growth, as well as a high potential response to direct genetic selection, especially for post-larval survival (50% increase per generation), without affecting the growth traits.","The authors thank to William J.

The issues ranged from decolonisation of the curriculum to no paying of fees to challenging the hegemonic position of Afrikaans in historically Afrikaans universities. After the 2015 protests, the question of language in ensuring educational access and validating lived experiences of African language-speaking students remains largely unaddressed. This paper interrogates the intersection between language, epistemic access and social justice. Contention is made that university language policies play a central role in this interconnectedness. It is further argued that because a language policy is not a value-free document, but a text that embodies ideologies that inform its existence, the policy has an impact on how the languages are distributed for educational access and the implication of such distribution on social justice issues. Specifically, these issues are discussed with reference to North-West University. The institution's language policy is critically examined to show how the language strategies recommended in the language policy support and/or constrain access to knowledge by all students and the possible effects of the strategies on social justice issues. The article ends with a call for inclusive and transformative approaches to the language policy in order to address the educational needs of all students and therefore ensure social justice for all students.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2018-03-23,2018,2018-05-10,2018-03-23,36,1,13-24,Closed,Article,"Mkhize, Dumisile","Mkhize, Dumisile (School of Languages in Education, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa)","Mkhize, Dumisile (North-West University)","Mkhize, Dumisile (North-West University)",13,5,,10.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103940344,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 4 Quality Education"

A literature review shows the existence of papers related to flotation circuit design based on mathematical programming. However, due to the complexity of solving the mathematical model in most of the work, it is considered that a small number of species is present in the feed to the circuit, which differs from practice. In addition, simple bank models are generally used. This paper presents a methodology for designing mineral concentration circuits that overcomes the problems mentioned. It allows the use of more suitable cell or bank models and the inclusion of several species. The methodology is based on two phases. The first phase identifies the set of optimal structures using discrete values of stage recoveries, solving several mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. In the second phase, the optimal design for each of the structures obtained in the previous phase is determined using a suitable model for the recovery at each cell or bank, which results in a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. The design of a copper concentration plant with eight species and the design of a zinc concentration plant with three species and five size fractions by species are used to validate the proposed methodology.

Although the culture and terrestrial ecology of RN have been well studied, we know little about the marine environment of these islands, particularly the interplay among herbivores, algae, and corals, and how coral reef communities differ between islands, by wave energy exposure, and between depths. To address the potential roles of herbivores, wave-energy exposure, and depth on the sessile benthic communities, we examined herbivorous fish biomass, sea urchin (Diadema savignyi) density, and algal and coral cover to identify patterns and relationships among these groups. We found significant differences between islands. For example, turf and macroalgae were nearly absent from SyG, whereas D. savignyi density and Kyphosus sandwicensis biomass were ~28- and ~3-fold greater respectively at SyG. Benthic cover of coral and algae and density of D. savignyi significantly differed among levels of wave exposure, especially between wave-protected stations and semi-exposed and exposed stations. Likewise, community structure significantly differed at protected stations. Concordant patterns between herbivores and algae were observed. Therefore, herbivores and wave energy likely play important roles in structuring these benthic communities, especially for algal groups.","This work was funded by the National Geographic Society, the Waitt Foundation, Oceana Chile, and the Chilean Millennium Initiative, Ecology and Sustainable Management of Oceanic Islands (ESMOI).

One of the key challenges to develop the farming operations for this species from the current pilot scale to commercial level is to improve its harvest size. In this study, we tested three different methods for triploidy induction. Additionally, the effect of these protocols on survival, developmental rate and size of larvae and post‐larvae were assessed. Three different mechanisms to stimulate the inhibition of the release of the second polar body were tested; (1) cold shock (18°C); (2) 6‐dimethylaminopurine (6‐DMAP); (3) cytochalasin B (CB) and (4) dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). The treatment with 6‐DMAP yielded the highest percentage of triploid larvae (39%). The survival and development rate, however, were higher in non‐treated larvae (control) than in the treatment groups. Interestingly, larvae from CB and the DMSO control groups exhibited lower growth rates in length than those from control and the other two treatments. No influence of the triploidy induction treatments was observed on post‐larvae survival, but the size of post‐larvae was larger for the cold shock treatment and DMSO control group. Our results indicate that the use of 6‐DMAP has the greatest potential to produce triploid larvae of A. nucleus without affecting negatively growth and survival of post‐larvae.","The authors thank M.

From our bacterial collection, we selected two strains ( BBC 023 and BBC 047) for their outstanding antagonistic capacity against fungal phytopathogens and growth‐promoting abilities towards Arabidopsis thaliana . According to physiological and molecular characterizations, both strains were classified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and were tested against Botrytis cinerea in vitro and in a tomato. Both strains secrete lipopeptide‐like compounds that contribute to their in vitro antagonism. SEM ‐images showed altered B. cinerea mycelial structures that were consistent with previous reports of the direct action of lipopeptides against fungal hyphae. The strains were applied to the roots (R), leaves (foliar ‐ F) or root/leaves (R/F) on tomato plants. All treatments significantly reduced the severity of B. cinerea infection (measured as a control index). However, only root applications (R and R/F) led to growth promotion in the tomato plants. We detected the production of indole acetic acid ( IAA ) and 2,3‐butanediol as growth promotion traits in the two strains. For both strains, the R/F treatment showed the highest control index, suggesting a synergic effect of direct antagonism against B. cinerea and resistance induction in the plant. In addition, in vitro antagonism of BBC 023 and BBC 047 against B. cinerea was similar; whereas in the F application, strain BBC 047 significantly improved plant resistance and maintained a higher population density over time on tomato leaves, compared to BBC 023.

This could generate problems in regulations compliance, given the cultural differences between the western worldview and Polynesian culture of Easter Island. A total of 18 issues that must be considered previously to an intervention in the island were identified. Four of them scored the highest difference between Rapanui and public services representatives. Among them, “Integrating traditions and culture” had a little priority for the public services representatives, but was the most important for the Rapanui. According to the public services representatives in Easter Island and local fishermen, there is a little compliance with regulations related to fisheries and, due to cultural aspects, it is not possible to enforce regulations and apply sanctions. The low compliance with fisheries regulations is due to the lack of representativeness of regulations. Interventions in the island are based on western worldview that does not fit with social and ecological domains of social-ecological system. A flexible governance system, based on decision making at local level in line with local tradition is needed to navigate to a resource management and conservation in Easter Island.","This work was financed by the Chilean Millennium Initiative, ESMOI.

In spite of this, to date, few studies have examined the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the adaptation strategies of vulnerable farmers from emerging semi-arid regions with dualist agriculture, in which subsistence farms coexist with commercial farms. This study aims to assess the micro-level impact of climate change and the farm household adaptation strategies in a semi-arid region in Central Chile. To this end, we develop a modelling framework that allows for (1) the assessment of farm-household responses to both climate change effects and adaptation policy scenarios and (2) the identification of local capacities and adaptation strategies. Aggregated results indicate that climate change has a substantial economic impact on regional agricultural income, while the micro-level analysis shows that small-scale farm households are the most vulnerable group. We observe that household characteristics determine to a large extent the adaptation capacity, while an unexpected result indicates that off-farm labour emerges as a powerful option for adapting to climate change. As such, our approach is well suited for ex ante micro-level adaptation analysis and can thereby provide useful insights to guide smart climate policy-making.",The authors would like to thank the IDRC-Canada for providing financial support for this research (no. 106924–001).

Congo where Lingala music reigns supreme, it may seem unusual and unexpected to note the presence of English in lyrics where pervasive mixing of French in Lingala lyrics would be an unmarked phenomenon. This remarkable craze for English in Lingala lyrics in the 1970s and 1980s, by young musicians in a period where there was no obsession for, affiliation with, or inspiration from, the hip-hop movement which often carries the seed of (American) English, seems perplexing. It may assumedly symbolize, or project, values ranging from identity – imagined or real – to refusal, rebellion, or subversion and resistance. Better still, hybridization of this kind serves a variety of social, linguistic, or discourse functions. Would it signify a claim for an imagined or real hybrid identity? Was it a symbolic medium for expressing identity and solidarity? This type of phenomenon engenders a singular type of discourse embedded in the historical context of political, socio-economic and cultural changes of the time. The paper seeks to answers these key questions by reflecting on the music in which special crossing was prevalent at the time.","I am grateful to Professor Salikoko Mufwene (University of Chicago) whose judicious remarks and insightful suggestions (including some of his own incisive writings) helped improve the manuscript.

237,pub.1100994655,10.1080/15472450.2018.1439389,,,A multi-objective optimization approach to the location of road weather information system in New York State,"Inclement weather is a threat to the safety of transportation systems as well as the efficiency of their operation. A road weather information system (RWIS) is a network of environmental sensor stations (ESS) that collect a range of real-time data about weather and pavement conditions. These systems can support highway officials and civilians in making more informed transportation safety decisions, particularly in times of adverse weather, by giving them more accurate and localized weather information. This enables the proper maintenance activities to be executed and safety to be restored while using minimum resources. However, because of the range of network characteristics and geographical factors affecting the implementation of ESS, no widely adopted guidelines exist that outline where to implement ESS in a network beyond taking into the physical criteria of an appropriate site, although several methods have been suggested. This paper aims to take a practical approach to solving the location problem of RWIS by proposing a unified multi-objective optimization methodology that takes into account vehicular accident data, vehicle miles traveled, area coverage, access to power and maintenance, and existing ESS. This study produces an exact solution method that produces a Pareto set of multiple efficient solutions. The proposed methodology is applied to a real world case study focused on the deployment of additional ESS in the existing RWIS network across New York State. Further, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the effects of different parameters and a nonpreference solution is proposed.","The authors would like to thank Charlie Morgante, Michael Lashmet, and Joe Doherty, from New York State Department of Transportation, who provided the data and useful discussions for this study.",,Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2018-03,2018,2018-03,2018-11-02,22,6,503-516,Closed,Article,"Fetzer, Julie; Caceres, Hernan; He, Qing; Batta, Rajan","Fetzer, Julie (Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA); Caceres, Hernan (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA; Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); He, Qing (Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA); Batta, Rajan (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA)","He, Qing (University at Buffalo, State University of New York; University at Buffalo, State University of New York)","Fetzer, Julie (University at Buffalo, State University of New York; University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Caceres, Hernan (University at Buffalo, State University of New York; Catholic University of the North); He, Qing (University at Buffalo, State University of New York; University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Batta, Rajan (University at Buffalo, State University of New York)",9,2,,2.34,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100994655,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

While much of our understanding comes from positive effects of kelp on associated fauna, few studies focus on potential feedbacks that such fauna may provide to benefit kelp. This study aims to analyze the positive interactions between two closely associated fish and kelp species. Lessonia trabeculata, the bottom kelp, and the herbivorous fish, Aplodactylus punctatus, were sampled at four sites off northern-central Chile to evaluate the following: interactions during the ontogeny of the fish, the availability of reproductive tissue of the kelp blades, the effects of digestion by A. punctatus on L. trabeculata reproductive tissue, and the viability of zoospores after digestion. Our results show a network of direct and indirect positive interactions between these species. There was a positive correlation in their densities, possibly due to kelp functioning as a refuge and indirect food source. Juvenile A. punctatus feed on epifaunal species within the kelp, reducing grazer load and in turn generating a potential positive indirect effect on the kelp. Adult herbivorous fish consume kelp tissue as sustenance; when this kelp tissue is reproductive, digestion reduces epiphytic algal densities on the sori. Zoospores were found to remain viable after digestion, and microscopic sporophytes were produced at rates similar to those of undigested reproductive tissue. We conclude that positive links between A. punctatus and L. trabeculata occur along the geographic range distribution of both species and that this herbivorous fish could serve as a dispersal mechanism for L. trabeculata. To our knowledge, this is the first study that suggests that an herbivorous fish may have the potential to be a facilitator of kelp zoospore transport, and this may contribute positively to the recovery of natural kelp populations that are being intensively harvested in the region.","Acknowledgments The fisherman Tucho and Robinson for fish collections.

Burrowing generally followed an asymptotic curve over time, with a rapid initial phase for smaller juveniles, which slowed over time. In laboratory conditions, at low temperatures (8°C), juvenile burrowing was initially rapid (50–70% at first 2 min). In summer temperatures (15.5°C), the burrowing capacity of three sizes of juvenile clams was tested. Size determines differences in burrowing dynamics, where juveniles of 8.9 mm shell length (SL) take longer to burrow than smaller juveniles (4.9 and 6.3 mm SL). For longer transfer times in laboratory conditions (>12 hr), burrowing was slower. The results indicate a faster burrowing rate in smaller (<10 mm) juvenile clams than in larger ones. Transfer times over 24 hr in field experiments show burrowing levels of over 50% after a 60‐min evaluation, with larger juveniles (>10 mm) requiring longer for burrowing. Based on our results, we suggest sending seeds out to grow in natural environments at SL <10 mm, temperatures below 12°C, and transfer times shorter than 12 hr. These results are valuable for improving future transfer techniques from hatchery to growout for small‐scale aquaculture of this new native species in South America.","We thank Gonzalo Fernández from Orizon S.A. for providing the hatchery facilities in Teupa (Chiloé) and L.René Durán and the two anonymous reviewers for improving the manuscript.

In this study, we analyzed the predation pressure and the distributional patterns of macro- and meiofaunal assemblages in soft sediments surrounding two coral reef sites at Rapa Nui (Easter Island), in the central South Pacific. We tested the hypothesis that reef-associated predators negatively affect sediment-dwelling invertebrates, causing macro- and meiofauna to be less abundant and diverse in soft sediments near the reefs. As expected, predation intensity was greater nearer the reef than farther away, but macro- and meiofaunal assemblages did not differ significantly with distance from the reef. Taxon richness of macro- and meiofaunal assemblages were similar irrespective of distance from the reef. Only meiofauna showed significant variation in total abundance with distance from the reef, but this trend was not consistent between the two study sites. No gradient in sediment texture was observed with distance from the reef. Underwater video recordings at one study site also revealed that local hydrodynamics cause frequent disturbance and resuspension of the upper sediment layers. Our results suggest that soft-sediment assemblages are constantly reshuffled by oceanic waves, thereby blurring the potential effects of predation on invertebrate assemblages closer to the reef.","We thank Loti Garcia for his help with the underwater sampling and tethering experiment, Wilo Teao for boat assistance, Michel Garcia (R.I.P.) and the members of the Orca diving center for their professionalism and kindness.

Few information about habitat loss and species composition in South American coasts are available compared with other coasts. Here, I examine the distribution and identity of coastal artificial infrastructures, especially artificial breakwaters, present along the coast of Chile and the proportion of natural habitat loss derived from their construction. Differences in species taxonomic/functional composition in artificial breakwaters and natural habitats present in northern Chile are also examined. I also propose/discuss opportunities for coastal planning based on habitat rehabilitation and ecological engineering in Chile, which could guide future marine infrastructures construction. An important proportion of natural habitat has been replaced by artificial coastal defences along the coast of Chile, accounting for about 200km of total coastal length. Given their specific uses and functions, artificial granite breakwaters are one of the most important coastal infrastructures present in Chile (62% of the total of artificial breakwaters present). Differences in taxonomic/functional structure between artificial breakwaters and natural adjacent habitats are significant, and appear related to contrasting spatial heterogeneity. Artificial infrastructures like granite breakwaters can facilitate presence of native and non-native species, which live in the marine-terrestrial interphase (crabs, rats). The present study highlights how the recent proliferation of coastal artificial infrastructures is replacing important natural habitats in Chile, and how the taxonomic/functional structure of coastal ecosystems can be negatively impacted. Furthermore, this study showed how artificial infrastructures can have direct consequences for human-health security and specific guidelines can be conducted to buffer impacts on ecosystem structure to match social livelihood and wellness.","I like to thanks to Katherine Dafforn and Natham Waltham for invitation to submit this manuscript to this Special Issue.

Therefore, the overall performance of abalone was evaluated using four diets formulated to contain graded levels of beet-vinasse. Ulva and Porphyra, natural foods holding betaine as well, were used as reference diets. After 140 days of experimentation, the highest growth rate was obtained with Porphyra (58.6 µm day−1). However, when beet-vinasse was added, the feed intake was higher as higher amounts of beet-vinasse were incorporated. It was concluded that beet-vinasse had a positive response to induce the feed intake, probably due to better palatability.","We thank Lucía Soliño and Lúcia Peixoto for their assistance with this investigation.

In this paper, we report the Mg isotopic compositions of continental arc andesites from El Laco in northern Chile, and evaluate the contribution of the subducted slab to the formation of continental arc lavas. The andesites in the El Laco volcanic complex (ELVC) display relatively high (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios and negative age-corrected εNd(t) (t = 1.6 Ma) values. The δ26Mg values of the ELVC andesites range from −0.26 ± 0.05‰ to −0.15 ± 0.04‰ (average δ26Mg = −0.18 ± 0.05‰), slightly heavier than that of the primitive mantle. The δ26Mg values of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and magnetite grains separated from andesites are −0.27 ± 0.03‰ to −0.20 ± 0.04‰, −0.24 ± 0.06‰ to −0.18 ± 0.03‰ and +0.09 ± 0.06‰ to +0.33 ± 0.06‰, respectively. Our results suggest that Mg isotope fractionation occurred during the fractional crystallization of El Laco andesite, and imply complex Mg isotopic fractionation at high-temperature conditions than previously inferred. Combing the Mg isotopes with the geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data, we confirm that neither the deep process of partial melting nor the shallow process of crust contamination contributed to the heavier Mg isotopes of the andesites. The heavier Mg isotopic features of these lavas were mainly inherited from aqueous fluids derived from the subducted slab, which reacted with the primitive mantle wedge to produce a metasomatic mantle source for the continental arc lavas.","We thank Editor Prof. Andrew Kerr and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions which helped in improving this paper.

Location Southeast Pacific, along ~1,700 km of coastline.   Methods  We examined the epibionts on stranded individuals of D. antarctica on 33 beaches along the continental coast of Chile (28° S–42° S) within four biogeographic districts during the winter and summer of two years (2014/2015–2015/2016). Taxonomic richness and co‐occurrences of epibionts within a holdfast were examined. Known geographic ranges and rafting ranges were compared to determine possible range expansions via rafting dispersal.    Results  Sessile species were the most frequent epibionts. Taxonomic richness varied among biogeographic zones and seasons, and was higher between 33° S and 42° S than between 28° S and 33° S, particularly in summer compared to winter. Taxonomic richness decreased with floating time (indicated by the presence and size of Lepas spp.). Habitat‐forming epibionts such as mytilid mussels, the polychaete Phragmatopoma moerchi and the seaweeds Gelidium lingulatum and Lessonia spicata favoured co‐occurrences of other species within a holdfast, suggesting a habitat cascade (i.e. biogenic holdfast—sessile eco‐engineers—other epibionts), while the boring isopod Limnoria chilensis and the excavating limpet Scurria scurra were negatively correlated with many other species. Some rafting epibiont species with low dispersal ability were found more than 100–300 km outside of their known geographic ranges, with more extensive ephemeral range extensions at the southern edge of their respective ranges, probably facilitated by higher availability of rafts in those areas.    Main Conclusions These findings confirm that raft‐associated species are frequently dispersed outside their known geographic ranges, although these range extensions vary strongly depending on the availability and persistence of rafts, and on the biotic interactions within the rafting assemblage.","This study was financed by CONICYT/FONDECYT 1131082 to M.T., F.

226,pub.1103768343,10.1017/asr.2017.132,,,Academic Standards or Academic Imperialism? Zimbabwean perceptions of hegemonic power in the global construction of knowledge,"Abstract:
                  University cultures in the Global North generate powerful definitions of what constitutes “knowledge” and “good research.” When we ask who gets to represent the “African perspective,” we find it is decreasingly an African. This article argues that resource inequalities alone cannot explain this exclusion of African scholarship. Hegemonic academic standards undervalue the more positivist research orientation found in southern African universities. The struggle is not over the validity of that orientation, but over who has the power to validate it. This analysis is based upon interviews with senior university research managers in Zimbabwe and on a public roundtable on Structural Inequalities in Global Academic Publishing.
Résumé:
                  Les cultures universitaires de l’hémisphère nord produisent des définitions influentes sur ce qui constitue la « connaissance » et la « bonne recherche ». Lorsque nous demandons qui représente la « perspective africaine », nous constatons qu’il est de moins en moins africain. Cet article soutient que les inégalités de ressources ne peuvent à elles seules expliquer cette exclusion de l’érudition africaine. Les normes universitaires hégémoniques sous-estiment l’orientation plus positiviste de la recherche dans les universités d’Afrique du sud. La lutte ne porte pas sur la validité de cette orientation, mais sur qui a le pouvoir de la valider.

Using the seminal contribution made by Beeson and Eberts, this study performs a wage change decomposition into amenity (workers) and productivity (firms) components. The results reveal that firms are more significant when explaining high average wage regions in Chile, since they derive more benefits from agglomeration economies and natural resources. Finally, the results also confirm how important agglomeration economies are in developing countries.",,,Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie,,,,2018-03-26,2018,2018-03-26,2018-09,109,4,542-560,Closed,Article,"Iturra, Victor","Iturra, Victor (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Iturra, Victor (Catholic University of the North)",4,3,,1.58,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101787574,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Such is the case of an unconfined aquifer recharged over all its surface area. Concentrations greatly differ from the homogeneous residence time case. Data interpretation relies on knowledge of the groundwater flow pattern. To study relatively large systems, the conservative ion chloride and the decaying radiocarbon (14C) are considered. Radiocarbon (14C) activity in groundwater, after correction to discount the non-biogenic contribution, is often taken as an indication of water age, while chloride can be used to quantify recharge. In both cases, the observed tracer content in groundwater is an average value over a wide range which is related to water renewal time in the ground. This is shown considering an unconfined aquifer recharged all over its area under arid conditions, in which a period of greater recharge happened some millennia ago. The mathematical solution is given. As the solution cannot be made general, to show and discuss the changes in water reserve and in chloride and radiocarbon concentration (apparent ages), two scenarios are worked out, which are loosely related to current conditions in Northern Chile. It is shown that tracer concentration and the estimated water age are not directly related to the time since recharge took place. The existence of a previous wetter-than-present period has an important and lasting effect on current aquifer water reserves and chloride concentration, although the effect on radiocarbon activity is less pronounced. Chloride concentrations are smaller than in current recharge and apparent 14C ages do not coincide with the timing, duration and characteristics of the wet period, except in the case in which recharge before and after the wet period is negligible and dead aquifer reserves are non-significant. The use of chloride concentration in springs as a proxy of chloride concentration in recharge to estimate recharge from atmospheric deposition leads to recharge value larger than the real one and it approaches the wet period recharge. Drawing inferences about radiocarbon data and recharge by the chloride balance method has rarely been taken into account before. It is important to consider the variable aquifer groundwater reserve. Current recharge estimation can be improved by careful selection of groundwater samples, supported by tritium and radiocarbon measurements.","This research was undertaken as part of the project “Hydrogeological analysis of groundwater depending wetlands (AHDAS, 2316-CANOA 73.3.00.44.00)” funded by the Geological Institute of Spain (IGME), and is also linked to the Anillo Project ACT1203 of the CONICYT of Chile, and derives from the REDESAC Project CGL2009-12910-C03-01, MINECO, Spain.

Location The coast of north‐central Chile, western South America.   Taxon Mollusca, Gastropoda (Lottidae).   Methods We used field and laboratory experiments to study the ecology and physiology of individuals from populations located at the overlap of the rear and leading edges of their respective geographical distributions. At the same time, we characterized local environmental regimes, measuring seawater physical and chemical properties.   Results  Towards the edge of their range, individuals from the leading edge species gradually reduced their shell length, metabolic rate and thermal response capacity, and increased carbonate content in their shells. Individuals of the rear edge species showed dissimilar responses between sites. Contrasting behavioural responses to experimental heating reconciled observations of an unintuitive higher maximal critical temperature and a smaller thermal safety margin for individuals of the rear edge populations. Physical–chemical characterization of seawater properties at the site located on the core of the upwelling centre showed extreme environmental conditions, with low oxygen concentration, high pCO 2 and the episodic presence of corrosive seawater. These challenging environmental conditions were reflected in reduced growth for both species.    Main conclusions We found different spatial patterns of phenotypic plasticity in two sister species around the leading and trailing edges of their distributions. Our results provide evidence that environmental conditions around large upwelling centres can maintain biogeographical breaks through metabolic constraints on the performance of calcifying organisms. Thus, local changes in seawater chemistry associated with coastal upwelling circulation emerge as a previously overlooked driver of marine range edges.",,,Journal of Biogeography,,,,2018-07-27,2018,2018-07-27,2018-10,45,10,2314-2325,Closed,Article,"Broitman, Bernardo R.; Aguilera, Moisés A.; Lagos, Nelson A.; Lardies, Marco A.","Broitman, Bernardo R.

Meanwhile ENSO is tightly linked to the intraseasonal tropical variability (ITV) that is generally enhanced prior to El Niño development and can act as a trigger of the event. Here we revisit the ITV/ENSO relationship taking into account changes in ENSO properties over the last six decades. The focus is on two main components of ITV, the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) and convectively coupled equatorial Rossby waves (ER). We show that the ITV/ENSO relationship exhibits a decadal modulation that is not related in a straight-forward manner to the change in occurrence of El Niño types and Pacific decadal modes. While enhanced MJO activity associated to EP El Niño development mostly took place over the period 1985–2000, the ER activity is enhanced prior to El Niño development over the whole period with a tendency to relate more to CP El Niño than to EP El Niño. In particular the relationship between ER activity and ENSO was particularly strong for the period 2000–2015, which results in a significant positive long-term trend of the predictive value of ER activity. The statistics of the MJO and ER activity is consistent with the hypothesis that they can be considered a state-dependent noise for ENSO linked to distinct lower frequency climate modes.","B.

The approach being proposed simultaneously examines the growth processes of the co-authorship and citation networks by analyzing the evolutions of the rich get richer and the fit get richer phenomena. In particular, the preferential attachment function and author fitnesses, which govern the two phenomena, are estimated non-parametrically in each network. The approach is applied to the co-authorship and citation networks of the flagship journal of the strategic management scientific community, namely the Strategic Management Journal. The results suggest that the abovementioned phenomena have been consistently governing both temporal networks. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-authorship network is 0.30 while it is 0.29 in the citation network. This suggests that the rich get richer phenomenon has been weak in both networks. The right tails of the distributions of author fitness in both networks are heavy, which imply that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author has been playing a crucial role in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Since the total competitiveness in each temporal network is founded to be rising with time, it is getting harder to receive a new citation or to develop a new collaboration. Analyzing the average competency, it was found that on average, while the veterans tend to be more competent at developing new collaborations, the newcomers are likely better at acquiring new citations. Furthermore, the author fitness in both networks has been consistent with the history of the strategic management scientific community. This suggests that coupling node fitnesses throughout different networks might be a promising new direction in analyzing simultaneously multiple networks.",The authors thank the two reviewers for interesting suggestions on a previous version of the manuscript.

This general objective can be divided into two sub-objectives. First, to measure the relationship between social identity, altruism and perceived encouragement as antecedents of WOM in SNS. Second, to study the existence of SNS-user segments which have differentiated behaviors according to the proposed model. Partial least squares (PLS) has been used to analyze both validity and reliability of the measurement scales and the estimation of the structural model. Next, the heterogeneity of SNS-users has been analyzed using the finite mixture segmentation FIMIX-PLS. Furthermore, a multi-group analysis (MGA-PLS) has been used to analyze the differences between the behaviors of the resulting segments. The main conclusion of this study is that social identity and perceived encouragement are worthy predictors of WOM. Additionally, there is a strong relationship between social identity and perceived encouragement. Another significant consequence is the existence of a large quantity of unobserved heterogeneity. Unsociable users, habitual users and obligated users show different behaviors regarding the relationships between the variables of the proposed model. The results indicate that in general WOM communications transmitted by SNS-users are not motivated by altruism or by their willingness to help others. In addition, social identity and perceived encouragement are good predictors of WOM. Another originality of this research is that considering only one general model hides a large amount of unobserved heterogeneity: different segments of users showed diverse behaviors regarding the model’s variables.",,,Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,,,,2018-03-12,2018,,2018-03-12,12,1,105-124,Closed,Article,"Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge; Rondan-Cataluña, Francisco J.; Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.","Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge (Faculty of Economics and Business, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain); Rondan-Cataluña, Francisco J.

223,pub.1103399254,10.1785/0120170157,,,Earthquake Magnitude Conversion ProblemEarthquake Magnitude Conversion Problem,"General orthogonal regression (GOR) is a superior regression procedure for conversion of different magnitude types into preferred ones. It yields a linear relation between dependent (Yt) and independent variable (Xt) based on observed data (Xobs, Yobs). Recent investigations have shown that the conventional GOR procedure for obtaining Yt by substituting Xobs in the GOR relation is incorrect, because the error in Xobs introduces some bias in Yt. One way to reduce this bias in the Yt estimate is to use Xt (instead of Xobs) given by a standard linear regression (SLR) relation between Xt and Xobs. However, this approach does not have ease of application and does not permit statistical verification. Therefore, we propose a modified procedure in which the derived GOR relationship is used to develop a SLR relation directly between Yt and Xobs to estimate Yt for a given Xobs, thereby eliminating the need to estimate and substitute Xt. We verify the supremacy of the proposed GOR procedure over the conventional procedure (Xt replaced by Xobs) and the SLR procedure by using observed and synthetic datasets. We observe that the proposed GOR procedure provides an improved estimate of Yt compared with both the conventional GOR and SLR. The proposed GOR provides lower errors in slope and intercept compared with SLR and yields improved correlation coefficient (RXY) and standard error values as compared with the other two approaches. The newly developed GOR procedure with η=1 provides the highest accuracy in Yt estimates as compared with the SLR and conventional GOR approaches. Our analysis also concludes that incorrect application of regression procedure can introduce a bias in the Gutenberg–Richter parameter b in the 5%–42% range. Therefore, we recommend the use of the proposed GOR to develop regression relations for earthquake magnitude conversions.","The article has benefitted from funding by the FONDAP (Centro Nacional de investigation Para la Gestion Integrada de desastres Naturale [CIGIDEN]) 15110017 Grant.

To test this concept, we investigated the effect of heat stress on the tolerance of mussel populations towards a second stress event of the same kind. The heat challenges we mimicked can be faced by marine invertebrates that are transported through regions with high sea surface temperatures on ship hulls or in ballast water tanks. The study included 5 mussel species that were collected at sites in Brazil, Chile, Finland, Germany (Baltic Sea) and Portugal. In parallel laboratory experiments, monospecific groups of individuals were exposed to heat challenges that caused 60–83% mortality in the experimental groups within 15–28 days. The surviving individuals were exposed to a second stress event of the same kind, while their survival was then compared to the robustness of conspecifics that had not been exposed to elevated temperatures before. We observed that thermal tolerance was significantly enhanced by previous heat stress experience in case of Semimytilus algosus from Chile and in case of Mytilus edulis from Germany. Our results suggest that heat challenges, which marine invertebrates experience during transport, can enhance stress tolerance in founder populations of these species in their non-native range by potentially increasing the frequency of genetically adapted genotypes. This points at the necessity to learn more about selection acting on organisms during human-mediated transport—in the aquatic but also in the terrestrial environment.","The study was realized in the framework of the international research and student training programme GAME (Global Approach by Modular Experiments) that is coordinated by GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany.

Drawing on a detailed livelihood and land‐change analysis case study of Polokwane, South Africa, it is argued that combinations of social processes across scales contribute to the production of peri‐urban South Africa and offer an uncommon mixed‐methods approach by combining qualitative ethnographic interviews, quantitative survey data, and land‐cover change detection.

Although this species exhibits a relatively fast growth, its survival, fecundity and commercial size are lower than those of other economically important pectinids. To assess the feasibility to improve productive traits in this species through selective breeding, heritabilities (h 2) and genetic correlations (r G ) for survival, fecundity and growth were estimated. The existence of genotype by environment interactions (GEI) associated with the culture depth, i.e. location of culture systems in the water column, ware also examined. Fifty sexually mature individuals were individually spawned, collecting female and male gametes separately. The sperm of one “male” was used to fertilize the eggs of four female individuals randomly chosen from the base population, generating 10 half sibling families and 40 full sibling families, in a nested experimental design. Shell length, height, and width, and total wet weight, were measured in 3.5 (juveniles) and nine (adults) months old progenies. Additionally, at 9 months the adductor muscle and remaining soft tissues wet weight were separately measured, and fecundity and survival recorded. The components of the phenotypic variance and heritabilities were estimated using an animal model. Most of the traits exhibited medium to high heritability (h 2 ≥ 0.26), with the exception of shell width in juveniles and survival (h 2 ≤ 0.18). h 2 estimations were generally higher in juveniles than in adults and h 2 for fecundity was not significantly different from zero. The growth related traits exhibit significant positive genetic correlations (r G  ≥ 0.69), but were not genetically correlated with fecundity or survival. Interestingly, GEI in relation to culture depth were statistically significant. Results suggest a high potential response to direct and indirect selection, indicating that productive traits can be improved through selective breeding. The differential relative performance of different genotypes at different depths will be an important consideration to take into account in designing selective breeding plans for this species.","The authors thank to William J.

In addition, the western edge of the Pampa Mejillones is limited by the Mejillones Fault, which controls the development of the Mejillones Basin to the east. In this research, we created a dynamic characterization of the northern portion of the basin using an integrated modeling of geophysics observations. These observations were: gravimetric method, magneto-telluric method (MT) and multichannel analysis of surface waves. The results of the geophysical campaign show soil thicknesses up to 750m on the deeper zone with steeper slopes to the west and lower slopes to the east, in agreement with the normal-fault half-graben basin geometry. The sedimentary stratum is characterized by shear velocities between 300 and 700m/s, extremely low electrical resistivities (below 1Ω-m) and densities from 1.4 to 1.8g/cm3. The integrated interpretation allowed us to generate a spatial and petrophysical model of the Mejillones Basin, from which we studied the seismic behavior of the zone. Preliminary results of the dynamic site amplification (using the Spectral Element Method) show peak ground accelerations (PGA) of almost 100% higher than the solicitation and stronger basin-edge effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the presented methodology (integrated geophysical characterization and numerical simulation) can be applied to characterize any deep forearc basin to quantify their seismic response in order to assess their seismic hazard.","We acknowledge help in the fieldwork provided by Tony Rojas, Gerard Miranda, Tiaren García, and Isabel Santibañez.

                    Value co-creation amongst project stakeholders is often necessary for situations where the expertises or resources required are beyond a single stakeholder. Certain project delivery models (PDMs) with strong emphasis on relationships and trust are especially suited to value co-creation approach by encouraging collaborations amongst stakeholders and innovations. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that value co-creation impacts positively on particular types of projects but not on others. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of value co-creation on project performance (PP) and how the effect is moderated by requirements uncertainty (RU).
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Based on the data from a cross-sectional survey of 120 Chilean construction project managers, the study validated a conceptual framework on the moderated effects of value co-creation process.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Value co-creation process underpinned through relational engagement, collaboration and innovativeness positively impacts on PP, and project’s RU moderates this relationship.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The findings empirically show that collaborative PDMs are best suited to projects where requirements are uncertain. Identifying the most suitable delivery model for a given context can reduce the project’s risk of failure and help maximise project value. When RU is low, the co-creating value is less critical to PP; whereas, when RU is high, choosing a collaborative PDM is fundamental to superior PP.

This can be difficult to assess accurately, particularly in arid and semi-arid rainfed mid-mountain zones, as is the situation in the rural, low population density zones of North-Central Chile. In this study, recharge in the Punitaqui Basin, North-Central Chile, was characterized, contrasting the results of two methods: a modified Thornthwaite-Mather (MTM) and discharge recession analysis (DRA). We found a recharge rate of between 1 and 4% of average annual precipitation. Average recharge estimated by the MTM method is consistently higher than that estimated by DRA. Also, DRA tends to smooth the recharge values, resulting in a lower inter-annual variation coefficient. Both methods identified a threshold value of total annual precipitation, above which recharge can be expected to occur, of the order of 180 mm year−1, consistent with values reported in similar areas.","The authors would like to thank Professor E.

In accordance with the School Evacuation Plan, a drill was held in 2013 with the entire student body (n = 1600). The majority of the students had experienced the 2014 Pisagua earthquake. Considering the school's exposure to natural disasters and the experience of its students, we studied the perspectives of k-12 students relative to their school's evacuation plan for a major disaster, such as an earthquake and a tsunami. Materials and methods The study applied a qualitative methodology for in-depth exploration and insight into the students’ perceptions of the school evacuation plan. The methods applied were: (i) focus groups and (ii) individual mapping exercises. The participants recruited (n = 31), included children between the ages of 11 and 18 years old. The collected information was analyzed through a thematic analysis using NVivo 11 software. Results The results flagged significant issues that had not been considered during the development of the school evacuation plan, such as the family dimension, which in some cases is contradictory with the school evacuation plan, as well as the need of redefining the safe zones from a multidimensional perspective. Conclusions More participation from children in the local planning of the school evacuation plan was seen as necessary in order to strengthen their preparedness in case of disaster, integrating their school evacuation plan and their family ones.","We wish to thank the 31 students who participated in the study, as well as the staff of Colegio Ingles, especially the School Principal, Enrique Quintana, and the School Counselor, Thelma Varas.

                  The chronology of over 50 tephra layers preserved in a lake sediment core from Laguna La Trapananda (LLT) in the southern portion of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone (SSVZ), Chile, is constrained by new radiocarbon age determinations, which span the period from late Pleistocene glacial retreat to the late Holocene. The tephra are correlative with tephra previously described from other lake cores in the region and are attributed to explosive eruptions of the SSVZ volcanoes Mentolat, Hudson, Macá, and potentially Cay. The new age determinations are used to estimate the ages of the >50 tephra in the LLT core, as well as those from the other previously described lake cores in the area, by a Bayesian statistical method. The results constrain the frequency of explosive eruptions of the volcanic centers in the southernmost SSVZ. They indicate that there was essentially no increase in the rate of eruptions from late-glacial to recent times due to deglaciation. They also provide isochrones used to constrain the depositional histories of the small lacustrine systems within which they were deposited and they provide a tephrochronologic tool for other paleoclimatic, paleoecologic, archaeologic and tephrochronologic studies in central Patagonia.","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which greatly enhanced the quality of this manuscript and the Reserva Nacional La Trapananda (CONAF) for permission to core the Laguna La Trapananda, and the Hospital Público San Juan de Dios de La Serena for the digital X-ray images of the core.

A discrete time, single item inventory system is considered, where inventory levels are reviewed periodically and managed using a base-stock policy. At the end of each period, a replenishment order is placed, which enters a queue at the buffer stage and is consequently forwarded to the first available supplier. We present a mathematical model of this inventory system and determine optimal safety stock levels for it, in closed form, using matrix analytic techniques and the properties of phase type distributions. To account for the effect of order crossovers, which occur whenever replenishment orders do not arrive in the sequence in which they were placed, the inventory shortfall distribution is analyzed. Finally, a set of numerical experiments with a system with two suppliers is presented, where the proposed model is compared to other existing models.",,,Annals of Operations Research,,,,2018-01-18,2018,2018-01-18,2018-12,271,2,405-427,Closed,Article,"Caceres, Hernan; Yu, Dongchen; Nikolaev, Alexander","Caceres, Hernan (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Yu, Dongchen (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA); Nikolaev, Alexander (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA)","Caceres, Hernan (Catholic University of the North)","Caceres, Hernan (Catholic University of the North); Yu, Dongchen (University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Nikolaev, Alexander (University at Buffalo, State University of New York)",6,2,,2.07,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100468408,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",

We have applied a novel approach, by combining morphological and biological traits, to assess the relative importance of the large scale latitudinal gradient and regional morphodynamic drivers in shaping the functional diversity of polychaete assemblages in shallow water habitats, from exposed to estuarine sandy beaches. We used literature data on polychaetes from beaches along the southern and southeastern Brazilian coast together with data on beach types, slope, grain size, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration. Generalized linear models on the FDis index for functional diversity calculated for each site and a combined RLQ and fourth-corner analysis were used to investigate relationships between functional traits and environmental variables. Functional diversity was not related to the latitudinal gradient but negatively correlated with grain size and beach slope. Functional diversity was highest in flat beaches with small grain size, little wave exposure and enhanced primary production, indicating that small scale morphodynamic conditions are the primary drivers of polychaete functional diversity.","We would like to thank Barbara Gimenez, Maikon Di Domenico, Paulo Cesar Paiva and Gisele Morais for their precious help in the achievement of this work, originally presented as a MSc dissertation by the first author.","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Journal of Sea Research,,,,2018-05,2018,,2018-05,135,,18-30,Closed,Article,"Wouters, Julia M.; Gusmao, Joao B.; Mattos, Gustavo; Lana, Paulo","Wouters, Julia M.

In this article, I argue that an initially homogenising, determinist approach seeing a uniform rupture in all AICs from the Apostolic Faith Mission imported from Illinois in 1908 delayed adequate individual analyses of the AICs. I extend research on the ZCC specifically, by comparing and contrasting its recorded worship songs with those of other dominant AICs operating in its geographical vicinity. I intend to demonstrate that by juxtaposing this aspect of the ZCC with a similar phenomenon in the other ambient AICs in a geographical area, better determinate contours of existing knowledge about the ZCC will be achieved. While the Nazareth Baptist Church founded by Isaiah Shembe remains the first and among the biggest AICs, I exclude it from my comparison. First, I do so because adherents of this Church are most massively concentrated in KwaZulu-Natal Province (not the focus of this study), and not in the part of Limpopo Province that I focused on. Second, my view is that the AIC has received relatively adequate attention due to its earlier birth. Furthermore, my intention is not to conduct the study on a national scale, hence my inclusion of selected AICs due to their sharing of space with the ZCC in a specific place.",,,Muziki,,,,2018-07-03,2018,2019-02-27,2018-07-03,15,2,17-43,Closed,Article,"Rafapa, Lesibana","Rafapa, Lesibana (University of South Africa)","Rafapa, Lesibana (University of South Africa)","Rafapa, Lesibana (University of South Africa)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112436201,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3603 Music,
202,pub.1106909257,10.1016/j.epsl.2018.08.043,,,Abrupt increase in the coastal uplift and earthquake rate since ∼40 ka at the northern Chile seismic gap in the Central Andes,"Over long-term geological scales, the position and vertical movements of the coast are considered to be among the most important effects resulting from first-order plate tectonics interactions in the subduction zones. However, the relationship between short-term vertical deformation driven by earthquakes and long-term coastal uplift in the Andean subduction contact of northern Chile has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Based on precise radiocarbon dating and geomorphological analysis of littoral deposits in the Mejillones Peninsula at the southern edge of the major northern Chile seismic gap, we report a drastic increase in coastal uplift since marine isotope stage 3 (MIS 3) with uplift rates one order of magnitude more rapid than previously in the Late Pleistocene. Geomorphological evidence supplied by Holocene littoral deposits and marine terraces shows that this tectonic regime could be operating at present. Together with new geodetic data following the 2007 M w 7.7 Tocopilla event, these observations indicate that coastal uplift results from cumulative coseismic vertical displacement with low subsequent interseismic subsidence recovery driven by both deep-moderate and large megathrust earthquakes. We suggest that the accelerated coastal uprising and earthquake rate over the past ∼44 ka demonstrated in this work results from changes involving the entire subduction contact between the Nazca and South American plates in northern Chile.","The authors thank the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico projects #1161547 and #1140846.

Season-dependent, local storms favor detachment of seaweeds from the substratum, which can be reflected in the stranded biomasses on adjacent beaches after these events. Hence, we hypothesized that seaweed strandings are positively correlated with storm intensity. Using as a model the southern bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot, a species frequently found in seaweed strandings in Chile, bimonthly surveys were carried out on three beaches: Pichicuy (32° S), Itata Norte (36° S), and Curiñanco (39° S) for 3 years (2014 to 2017). Stranded biomass, total length, and wet weight of specimens were quantified and related to local storms (using the Douglas sea scale). Stranded biomasses decreased in the spring months of each year, being higher in Pichicuy and Curiñanco than Itata Norte. Regression models showed a better fit with recent storms in Curiñanco compared to other beaches. An interannual decrease of beach-cast raft size was observed, showing smaller specimens in Itata Norte than those in Pichicuy and Curiñanco. Reduced habitat availability and the exploitation of natural beds in the central zone (34°–37° S) might explain the decrease of biomasses and sizes of stranded bull kelps. Also, oceanographic features at intermediate (i.e., local winds and currents) and large scales (i.e., El Niño) can help to explain the temporal variability, particularly in spring and summer. Our results suggest that harvesting of stranded bull kelps might be most favorable in summer and autumn.","We wish to express our gratitude to Óscar Pino, Vieia Villalobos, and Ulyces Urtubia from Universidad Católica del Norte for their field assistance, as well as all the participants of the Universidad de Concepción (Algalab) and Universidad Austral de Chile (Lafkenchelab) who collaborated during field surveys in central and southern beaches, respectively.

Due to the growing demand for water in this region, recharge is investigated along with the impact of intense pumping activity in this aquifer. A conceptual model of the hydrogeological system is developed and implemented into a two-dimensional groundwater-flow numerical model. To assess the impact of climate change and groundwater extraction, several scenarios are simulated considering variations in both aquifer recharge and withdrawals. The estimated average groundwater lateral recharge from Precordillera (pre-mountain range) is about 4,482 m3/day. The scenarios that consider an increase of water withdrawal show a non-sustainable groundwater consumption leading to an over-exploitation of the resource, because the outflows surpasses inflows, causing storage depletion. The greater the depletion, the larger the impact of recharge reduction caused by the considered future climate change. This result indicates that the combined effects of such factors may have a severe impact on groundwater availability as found in other groundwater-dependent regions located in arid environments. Furthermore, the scenarios that consider a reduction of the extraction flow rate show that it may be possible to partially alleviate the damage already caused to the aquifer by the continuous extractions since 1974, and it can partially counteract climate change impacts on future groundwater availability caused by a decrease in precipitation (and so in recharge), if the desalination plant in Taltal increases its capacity.","The authors thank the associate editor and reviewers (Alan M.

The characteristics of the high net worth individuals in the Chilean resource periphery,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyse the characteristics of high net worth individuals (HNWI) as potential angel investor in Antofagasta, the main mining resource periphery in Chile.   Design/methodology/approach Using the resource periphery approach and angel investing, the authors apply a survey to a sample of 37 HNWI in this region. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics.   Findings Descriptive results show that the characteristics of these individuals do not significantly differ from those exhibited by angel investors in developed countries and that HNWI show a relative high willingness to become angels and to form a network.   Research limitations/implications This paper has some limitations regarding the size and scope of the sample. It is a relatively short sample that does not allow to make more sophisticated analysis and it is only regional and, therefore, it is not possible to make a comparison at a national level.   Practical implications From the perspective the design of policies and programmes oriented towards the promotion of a high potential start-ups in resources peripheries, it is essential to know what the characteristics of HNWI are and their propensity to become angel investors.   Originality/value Research on angel investment has been traditionally based on the experience of core regions in developed countries. This type of funding source, however, can play a significant role in the promotion of development and diversification in resource peripheries due to the limited access that these areas have to traditional capital funds and the orientation of angel investment towards innovative ventures, but studies from this perspective are very scarce. In this sense, this paper is pioneer in this topic in peripheral regions. 
 Propósito El objetivo de este artículo es identificar y analizar las características de las personas con alto patrimonio neto como potenciales inversionistas ángeles en Antofagasta, la principal fuente de recursos minerales en la periferia de Chile.   Diseño/metodología/enfoque A través del enfoque de las periferias de los recursos naturales y la inversión ángel, se aplicó una encuesta a una muestra de 37 personas con alto patrimonio neto en esta región. La información recogida fue analizada usando estadística descriptiva.   Hallazgos Los resultados muestran que las características de estas personas no difieren significativamente de los inversionistas ángeles en países desarrollados y muestran un fuerte deseo de ser inversionistas ángeles y formar una red.   Limitaciones/implicaciones Este artículo presenta algunas limitaciones en relación al tamaño y el alcance de la muestra. Es una muestra relativamente pequeña y no permite realizar análisis más sofisticados y es solo a nivel regional y, por lo tanto, no es posible comparar a nivel nacional.   Implicaciones prácticas Desde la perspectiva del diseño de políticas públicas y programas orientadas a la promoción de empresas de alto potencial de crecimiento en las periferias de recursos naturales, es esencial conocer las características de las personas con alto patrimonio neto y su propensión a convertirse en inversionistas ángeles.   Originalidad/valor La investigación sobre inversión ángel ha estado tradicionalmente enfocada en la experiencia de las regiones centrales de los países desarrollados. Sin embargo, esta alternativa de financiamiento puede jugar un rol preponderante en la promoción del desarrollo y la diversificación en las periferias de recursos naturales debido al limitado acceso a fuentes de capital tradicionales y la orientación de la inversión ángel hacia emprendimientos innovadores en estas regiones.

To this end, we use the 7th wave of the 2014 European Social Survey to run a quantile regression analysis to investigate whether any of these dimensions of social capital has a heterogeneous effect on the full distribution of well-being. We also perform a factor analysis to summarize the principal components of these three dimensions. Our results show that each dimension of social capital has a positive and significant correlation with SWB, but the different dimensions have a heterogeneous effect on the different quantiles of the well-being distribution. All of these dimensions of social capital have a stronger effect on the SWB of the least happy people in society than on the happiest.","We would like to thank the Editor of this journal, Dr. David Bartram, and two anonymous referees, for their valuable suggestions and helpful comments, which have greatly enhanced the quality of the paper.",,Journal of Happiness Studies,,,,2018-12-01,2018,2018-12-01,2019-12,20,8,2551-2579,Closed,Article,"Neira, Isabel; Lacalle-Calderon, Maricruz; Portela, Marta; Perez-Trujillo, Manuel","Neira, Isabel (Quantitative Economics Department, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Avda.

This work gives some new ideas about the control that ancient basement extensional faults exert on the crustal shortening and growth of those orogenic belts located over normal subduction zones similar to the Central Andes. In this work, two sedimentary basins were analyzed: the Salar de Atacama and the Salar de Punta Negra, both of which correspond to intra-montane basins bounded by the Domeyko Cordillera and the current volcanic arc of the Central Andes. The interpretation of a series of west to east-oriented 2-D seismic profiles revealed three types of structural interaction: i) pure positive reactivation; ii) decapitation of previous normal faults by reverse faults; and iii) transport of previous normal faults by thrust ramps. Inversion anticlines and basement-involved contractional structures were the most common observed structures, indicating that the geometry and distribution of inherited normal faults of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic basement played an important role in basin contraction. The different modes of tectonic interaction frequently created variations on the geometry and kinematic of the final structural styles present in the region. Commonly the Upper Cretaceous to Cenozoic synorogenic tectonosequences recorded the ages of contractional deformation that affected the region. Similar to other regions of northern Chile, basin inversion occurred during the Late Cretaceous and subsequent propagation of reverse faults occurred from the upper Late Cretaceous to the present. The basement-involved reverse fault structures usually create the most important positive topographic relief in this part of the western Central Andes. Using as example our study area, we finally conclude that the original position and distribution of ancient basement pre-orogenic normal faults in the orogenic belts condition the final vergence and kinematic of the subsequent thrust systems related to shortening episodes.","This work was supported by the Fondecyt project 11170098 “Structure and tectonic evolution of the Pre-Andean Depression, Central Andes: case study of the Salar de Punta Negra Basin”.

Patents and publications data have been used as output indicators to map the R&D activities of South African universities. The study observed that universities are the most prolific publishers and constitute about 91% of total South African publications. However, universities altogether produce only about 14% of total South African patents. Only a few universities are responsible for both patenting and publication portfolio of South Africa. The collaboration patterns from joint patents show that only about 19% patents are collaborative patents. South African public research institutes are more active in joint patents with universities followed by the foreign universities but local firms are less active in collaborative patents. The similar trends are observed in co-authored articles also. The study recommends that collaboration between universities and local firms need to be strengthened to develop technological capabilities in South Africa.

Field work mapping, stratigraphic sequences, and one new 40Ar/39Ar and eleven previous published 40Ar/39Ar, and K/Ar ages, indicate that the evolution of Paniri involved eruption of seven volcanic units (Malku, Los Gordos, Las Lenguas, Las Negras, Viscacha, Laguna, and Llareta) during four main stages occurring over more than 1 Myr: Plateau Shield (>800 ka); Main Edifice (800–400 ka); Old Cone (400–250 ka); and New Cone (250–100 ka). Considering glacial and fluvial action, an estimated 85.3 km3 of volcanic material were erupted during the eruptive history of Paniri volcano, giving a bulk eruption rate of 0.061 km3/ka, with major activity in the last 150 kyr (eruption rate of 0.101 km3/ka). Lava flows from Paniri show abundant plagioclase together with subordinate ortho-, and clino-pyroxene, and amphibole as main phenocrysts. Moreover, although true basalts are scarce in the Central Andes, olivine-bearing lavas were erupted at Paniri at ∼400 ka. Also, scarce phenocrysts of biotite, quartz, rutile, and opaque minerals (Fe-Ti oxides) were identified. The groundmass of these flows is composed mainly of glass along with pyroxene and plagioclase microlites. Consolidated and unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits of dacitic composition are also present. The consolidated deposits correspond to vitreous tuffs, whilst unconsolidated deposits are composed of pumice clasts up to 5 cm in diameter. Both pyroclastic deposits are composed of glassy groundmass (up to 80% vol.), and subordinated plagioclase, hornblende, and biotite phenocrysts up to 1 cm in length. Results of twenty-four new, coupled with previous published compositional analyses show that volcanic products of Paniri vary from 57% (basaltic-andesite) to 71% (rhyolite) vol. SiO2, with significant linear correlations between major element-oxide and trace-element concentrations. 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios range from 0.7070 to 0.7075, indicating that Paniri, similar to other volcanoes of the San Pedro – Linzor volcanic chain, have undergone significant crustal contamination of its parental magmas. However, the almost constant Sr-isotope compositions of the different volcanic units defined for Paniri volcano, suggested later fractional crystallization of magmas at upper crustal levels.","This work was funded by FONDAP-CONICYT nº 15090013, and CONICYT/FONDECYT Postdoctoral nº3160432 projects.

These levels will result in decreasing returns. However, local processes of agglomeration, spillover effects, or other forces could operate differently depending on the level of spatial disaggregation. The primary objective of this article is to observe whether different local, regional, and national convergence behaviors are possible in the European Union (EU). To capture the differences among spatial scales, a multilevel and spatial effects extension of the Solow–Swan theoretical growth model is proposed.

193,pub.1106903449,10.1016/j.epsl.2018.08.046,,,Dynamic triggering of shallow slip on forearc faults constrained by monitoring surface displacement with the IPOC Creepmeter Array,"The M w = 8.8 Maule Earthquake of February 27, 2010, remotely triggered minor surface displacement along the Atacama Fault System in Northern Chile located 1500–1800 km from the epicenter. Here we present evidence that surface displacement events recorded by the IPOC (Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory in N-Chile) Creepmeter Array are related to earthquakes on the underlying subduction zone interface or to large earthquakes around the world. Our observations document dynamic triggering of shallow slip on faults in a forearc setting. Continuous monitoring revealed that up to 30 displacement events per year occur on the monitored fault segments, >90% of them triggered by earthquakes in the near or far field synchronous to the passage of the seismic wave. We can clearly attribute far field triggering to the passage of the surface wave and near field triggering to the passage of the body wave. The most distant triggered displacement event monitored occurred after the 2011, M w = 9.0 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake located 16 468 km away following the passage of large amplitude SS waves. Comparing the triggered displacement events with other triggered phenomena like seismicity, volcanic eruptions, hydrological changes as well as with data from the California Creepmeter Array we find that the seismic energy density appropriately describes a magnitude–distance scaling relationship of slip triggering. Finally, the observed surface displacement is found to not occur by continuous creep, but rather through nearly exclusively discrete displacement events.","This work was only possible in the framework of IPOC and associated GFZ observatory fund.

In this study, natural populations of the carrageenophyte Chondracanthus chamissoi and the agarophyte Gelidium lingulatum from a latitudinal gradient along the Chilean coast (between 20° S and 41° S) were compared. We determined physiological and biochemical traits in field and culture samples. Sulfated polysaccharide contents ranged from 15.4 to 52.7% dry weight (DW) in C. chamissoi and from 10.9 to 25.1% DW in G. lingulatum. Carrageenan amounts were higher in gametophytes than tetrasporophytes and were also, depending on life cycle phase, negatively correlated with the geographic variation of temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and chlorophyll a (Chl a), whereas agar showed no significant correlation with these variables. The UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) shinorine and palythine in both species ranged from 0.8 to 6.8 mg g−1 DW and these contents were positively correlated to PAR and Chl a levels at the sampling site. In C. chamissoi variation among populations in their photosynthetic characteristics, pigment concentrations, antioxidant capacity, and MAA contents were persistent after acclimation under common-garden conditions, suggesting ecotypic differentiation in this species. Contrary, G. lingulatum seems to have a more generalist strategy because differences after cultivation were observed only in some photosynthetic parameters and phycobiliprotein concentration. This study confirms that intraspecific differences in phenotypic traits along the same geographic area are strongly dependent on species and life cycle phases.","We would like to thank the Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Algas (CIDTA-UCN) for providing laboratory facilities.

Climatology,"Rotational temperatures T rot from OH line intensities are an important approach to study the Earth's mesopause region. However, the interpretation can be complicated as the resulting T rot are effective values weighted for the varying OH emission layer. Moreover, the measured T rot only equal kinetic temperatures T kin if the rotational level population distribution for the considered OH lines is fully thermalised. In many cases, this basic condition of a local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) does not seem to be fulfilled. In order to better understand the non-LTE temperature excesses Δ T NLTE and their variations, we used T rot measurements based on 1526 high-resolution spectra of the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile in combination with T kin weighted for the OH emission layer based on 4496 nighttime temperature and OH emission profiles from the SABER radiometer onboard TIMED taken at a similar location. Both data sets were linked via climatologies consisting of the nighttime and seasonal temperature variations. The study focusses on the non-LTE effects at the vibrational level v = 9 , which is directly populated by the OH-producing hydrogen–ozone reaction and therefore especially prone to incomplete thermalisation of the rotational level population. In comparison to the less critical v = 3 , the Δ T NLTE climatology showed clear and strongly variable temperature excesses of several kelvins with minima in the evening around the equinoxes and a reliable maximum in the second half of the night around the turn of the year. The T rot non-LTE contributions are positively correlated with the effective OH emission height and volume mixing ratio of atomic oxygen. A significant anti-correlation is found for the air density. Thus, especially variations in the OH emission layer altitude and shape, which are related to changes in the layer-weighted chemical composition and density, are important for the amount of Δ T NLTE .","This project made use of the ESO Science Archive Facility.

This article examines South Africa's environmental law in order to derive an understanding of the origins and potential application of the doctrine. While the prima facie origin of the doctrine is the Bill of Rights right in South Africa's 1996 Constitution, multilateral environmental agreements in Africa appear to have had a significant influence on how the doctrine was conceptualized and embraced. This observation dispels the notion that the doctrine was a hermetic import into South Africa's environmental law from the United States.

Although psychotherapy and the alliance between clients and therapists is efficacious for treating mental illness in some contexts, cultures have developed equally as valid mechanisms for treating such conditions elsewhere. The purpose of this study was to explore beliefs about treatment for mental illness among a small Namibian Aawambo sample. Participants ( N = 14) were interviewed using a semistructured interview protocol. Grounded theory ethnographic analyses led to the identification of four categories: (a) witch doctors, frauds, and odudu (traditional healer); (b) counseling, medicine, and religion as means of healing; (c) seeking care—decisions based on beliefs and needs; and (d) the role of families for omunanamwengu (“mad one”). The idea of faith—or more aptly with the data, belief in a given treatment—emerged in the findings as key to understanding the type of intervention one may seek in the event of mental illness. Results highlight participants’ perceived importance of belief in treatment, traditional practices, families, and concurrent use of traditional and Western services to heal mental illness. These are discussed with respect to potential for integration of treatment modalities while recognizing that further research can expand understandings of treatment beliefs across Namibian cultures.
Impact and Implications This research documents an initial, exploratory effort to understand what is believed about the treatment of mental illness among a small sample of Aawambo Namibians. Though this research requires further empirical efforts to confirm the findings, the results demonstrate the culturally embedded value of traditional healing in a postcolonial context. Such findings are central to the development of culturally sensitive mechanisms for improving well-being and health in a context where empirical efforts such as these remain emerging.",,,International Perspectives in Psychology,,,,2018-10,2018,,2018-10,7,4,258-275,Closed,Article,"Bartholomew, Theodore T.","Bartholomew, Theodore T.

In the present study we evaluate the potential of F. maxima shells as a proxy of SST by analysing δ18O of modern shells collected alive from the Atacama desert (area of Taltal, 25°S) and archaeological shells from two Early Holocene rockshelter sites: 224A and Paposo Norte 9. Reconstructed SST from modern F. maxima shells were related to SST obtained from in situ thermometers, supporting the use of this mollusc species as a paleotemperature archive. Mean SST reconstructed from Early Holocene archaeological shells (14.13 °C) was 2.86 °C cooler than mean temperature recorded in modern shells (16.99 °C). Mean SST reconstructed from modern shells was ~1.04 °C warmer than the mean temperature of in situ thermometers (15.95°C). Hence the paleo–SST data from archaeological sites 224A and Paposo Norte 9 enrich the Early Holocene nearshore paleoceanographic scenario of the Pacific coast of South America, with mean SST cooler than present-day SST. Our results validate the use of F. maxima shells as a SST proxy and contribute to a better understanding of the latitudinal distribution of the coastal upwelling regime during the Early Holocene, temporal changes in the structure of the Humboldt Current along the Holocene, and its influence on human adaptation through the prehistory of South America.","Funding: This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT #1151203, 11150210, 3170913, 1181300); and the Fund for Research Centers in Priority Areas (FONDAP/CONICYT 151100 (to CR2)).

While much has been written about the ANC-SA’s relationship with the Pan African Congress (PAC), similar attention has not been given to how the ANC-SA reacted to BCM’s rise outside South Africa. From what has been written, the dominant narrative argues BCM was not a serious threat and that despite some early tensions was eventually absorbed into ANC-SA structures. This hegemonic narrative continues by arguing those who refused to be absorbed constituted a ‘Third Force’ that was being supported by international elements unfriendly to the ANC-SA. Both components of this dominant narrative downplay the real anxieties felt by the ANC-SA in exile concerning its own ineffectiveness in the early 1970s. At this time global recognition was not assured as BCM’s growing influence inside South Africa had many international allies of the ANC-SA questioning how relevant the ANC-SA was inside the country.

The pilot study presented herein is for the Chilean city of Iquique, which is located at the core of a seismic gap that extends from south Perú to north Chile, and has strategic geopolitical and economic importance for the country. The region was hit April 1, 2014, by an Mw$$M_\mathrm{w}$$ 8.2 earthquake that caused only moderate damage, but seismological evidence suggests that there is still a potential for a much larger event in the region. Therefore, a careful damage assessment study is fundamental to anticipate the possible physical, social, and economic consequences that Iquique may face in the future. In this work, the HAZUS-MH platform was adapted and used to simulate a set of ten plausible physics-based future seismic scenarios with magnitudes ranging from Mw$$M_\mathrm{w}$$ 8.40 to Mw$$M_\mathrm{w}$$ 8.98, which were proposed based on an analysis of interplate locking and the residual slip potential remaining after the April 1, 2014, earthquake. Successful application of this damage assessment methodology relies on the construction of a comprehensive exposure model that takes into account regional features and a good characterization of the physical vulnerabilities. For Iquique, a large body of public and local data was used to develop a detailed inventory of physical and social assets including an aggregated building count, demographics, and essential facilities. To characterize the response of the built environment to seismic demand, appropriate HAZUS fragility curves were applied, and outcomes were validated against the damage observed in the 2014 earthquake. After satisfactory testing, a deterministic earthquake damage assessment study was carried out for the collection of predictive scenarios aimed to estimate their expected impacts.

We focus on evidences of mobility and subsistence economy, discussing the data in terms of a concept of territoriality adapted from cultural geographers working with hunting-gathering societies. We attempt to show that the Huentelauquén Cultural Complex, usually considered the earliest evidence of human occupation in the coast of northern Chile, exhibits an already consolidated territorialisation process. We question whether it represents the earliest phases of the peopling process or if such evidence are still lacking at a regional level. We try to go beyond the characterization of Huentelauquén Cultural Complex as an early maritime adaptation, understanding it as the earliest socio-territorial identity known to date for the Arid Coast of northern Chile.","This research has been funded by FONDECYT 1151203 grant.

                    Be, and optically stimulated luminescence data indicate that after the last glacial maximum, Río Cisnes Glacier experienced ~100 km deglaciation between >19.0 and 12.3 ka, accompanied by the formation of large glacial paleolakes. Deglaciation was interrupted by several ice readvances, and by 16.9±0.3 ka, Río Cisnes Glacier extended only ~40% of its full glacial extent. The deglaciation of Río Cisnes Glacier and other sensitive Patagonian glaciers occurred at least 1 ka earlier than the ca. 17.8 ka normally assumed for the local termination, coincident with West Antarctic isotope records. This early deglaciation can be linked to an orbital forcing–driven decline of Southern Ocean sea ice associated with a distinct atmospheric warming that is apparent for West Antarctica through Patagonia.","This research was funded by FONDECYT #1161110, FONDECYT #1130128, National Geographic Society #HJ-150R-17, Programa Regional CONICYT R17A10002 grants.

In particular we determine forms of the unknown potential which drives the scalar field such that the field equations form a Liouville integrable system. For the determination of the conservation laws we apply the Cartan symmetries. Furthermore, inspired from our solutions, a toy model is studied and it is shown that it can describe the Supernova data, while at the same time introduces dark matter components in the Hubble function. When the extra matter source is a stiff fluid then we show how analytical solutions for Bianchi I universes can be constructed from our analysis.

A frequency diagram was performed with all the obtained ages. The diagram showed peaks representing emplacement or crystallization, depositional and inherited zircon ages. The zircons showed to be 300 Ma and younger form four major peaks. These peaks are consistent with previously dated emplacement and depositional ages, as well as, with the ages of the rock units recognized in this work. The oldest cluster ranges between 250 and 230 Ma and represents the first volcanic episode in the study area that corresponds to the Middle Triassic Sierra Miranda-Cerro Camaleón Rhyolites which yielded a zircon age of 240 ± 1.2 Ma. A second age cluster, between 220 and 130 Ma, can be associated with the Lower Jurassic volcanic and plutonic rocks, to Middle-Upper Jurassic plutonic rocks and Lower Cretaceous subvolcanic rocks. The Lower volcanic rocks correspond to La Negra Formation, which yielded ages that range between ca. 196 and 177 Ma. These ages are older than the Middle-Upper Jurassic ages commonly reported for this formation. The La Negra Formation and the interbedded marine Rencoret Beds are in stratigraphic continuity with the Middle Triassic Sierra Miranda-Cerro Camaleón Rhyolites. The ages that range between 170 and 150 Ma can be associated with the larger intrusive rock bodies from the Middle-Upper Jurassic Coastal Batholite of Northern Chile and Southern Perú. Lower Cretaceous ages (ca. 140 Ma) corresponds to subvolcanic rocks related to the metallogenic belt of the easternmost Coastal Cordillera of the Antofagasta region. A zircon ages gap is observed in the Lower Cretaceous (between 130 and 100 Ma). This gap indicates that either the study area did not undergo magmatic and volcanic activity at that time, or that the Peruvian tectonic phase allowed for the erosion of the geological record of such activity. An Upper Cretaceous cluster occurs at ca. 100-80 Ma and is correlated with the Cerro Empexa, Quebrada Mala, and Hornitos volcanic formations. The last volcanic activity occurred at about ca. 70-60 Ma. Lower Paleocene (ca. 63 Ma) volcanic unit indicates that the products of the Paleocene volcanism reached as far west as the Coastal Cordillera at the latitude of Antofagasta. Even the presence of lava indicates the proximity of effusive volcanoes, which, in turn, suggests that the Paleocene volcanic arc extended west away from the Domeyko Cordillera. Both Upper Cretaceous and Lower Paleocene volcanic units are restricted to the west by the Atacama Fault System.","This work was supported by a grant from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT grant no. 1121041) and LMI-COPEDIM project (IRD, France) .

Kinetic model,"OH rotational temperatures T r o t deviate from kinetic temperatures T k i n if the rotational level populations derived from the measured OH lines are not in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In particular,. from OH bands wi T rot th high upper vibrational level appear to be affected by incomplete rotational relaxation and corresponding non-LTE temperature excesses Δ T NLTE . The processes that lead to these non-LTE effects and their variations have not been investigated in detail so far since this requires thorough modelling of the rotational relaxation based on suitable observing data. We performed such an effort for the vibrational level v = 9 . As it is the highest v that can be populated by the OH-producing hydrogen–ozone reaction, the relaxation processes are the least complex ones. Nevertheless, there are many systematic uncertainties. Therefore, we studied the Δ T NLTE depending on the Einstein A-coefficients used, the very uncertain rate coefficient for the v = 9 deactivating collisions of OH with atomic oxygen, and the input profiles for T kin , air density, and the volume mixing ratios of N2, O2, O, and O3. For the profiles, we used SABER products, where we adapted the O retrieval for a better agreement with the model, and the empirical NRLMSISE-00 model. The profiles were selected or calculated for the Cerro Paranal region in Chile since this allowed us to combine OH T rot measurements based on high-resolution spectra of the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope with the SABER T kin and OH emission profiles for an alternative, fully observation-based Δ T NLTE derivation. Moreover, we measured OH( v = 9 ) rotational level populations up to the rotational state N = 10 based on UVES OH(9-3) and OH(9-4) line measurements. With these data in comparison with a grid of models, we derived the best-fitting crucial rate coefficients for the rotational relaxation at v = 9 , which have not been studied before. With the final models, we calculated Δ T NLTE climatologies and compared them with those from the UVES-based data. Significant Δ T NLTE and similar variability structures could be identified. Moreover, we analysed the model in order to find the mechanisms that cause the variations. Here, the steep increase of Δ T NLTE with altitude combined with the height variations of the OH layer appears to be the most important process.","This project made use of the ESO Science Archive Facility.

116,pub.1092417844,10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.10.016,,,Review of erosion dynamics along the major N-S climatic gradient in Chile and perspectives,"Chile is an elongated country, running in a north-south direction for more than 30° along a subduction zone. Its climate is progressively wetter and colder from north to south. This particular geography has been used positively by a growing number of studies to better understand the relationships between erosion processes and climate, land use, slope, tectonics, volcanism, etc. Here we review the erosion rates, factors, and dynamics over millennial to daily periods reported in the literature. In addition, 21 new catchment mean erosion rates (suspended sediment and 10Be) are provided, and previous suspended sediment-derived erosion rates are updated. A total of 485 local and catchment mean erosion rates are reported. Erosion rates vary between some of the smallest values on earth (10 −5 mm/a) to moderate values ≤0.5mm/a compared to other active ranges. This review highlights strong limitations concerning the quantification of local erosion factors because of uncertainties in sampling point location, slope and rainfall data. For the mean erosion rates E for the millennial and decennial catchments, a model of the form E ∝ S/ [1−(S/0.6)2] R α with α =[0.3,0.8] accounts for 40 to 70% of the erosion variance, confirming a primary role of slope S compared to precipitation rate R over this time scale. Over the long-term, this review points to the long (5 to >10Ma) response time of rivers to surface uplift in north-central arid Chile. Over millennia, data provide evidence for the progressive contribution of extreme erosion events to millennial averages for drier climates, as well as the link between glacier erosion and glacier sliding velocity. In this period of time, a discrepancy exists between the long-term offshore sedimentological record and continental decennial or millennial erosion data, for which no single explanation appears. Still, little information is available concerning the magnitude of variation of millennial erosion rates. Over centuries, data show the variable role of groundwater in the dynamics of suspended load and document a decrease in erosion over hundreds of years, probably associated with historical harvesting.","We thank the Editors of Geomorphology for having invited us to review the erosion rates in Chile.

97,pub.1092179995,10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.10.002,,,Large-scale porphyry-type mineralization in the Central Asian metallogenic domain: A review,"A series of porphyry-type Cu-(Mo)-(Au) deposits including some giant world-class deposits such as Kounrad, Aktogai, Kal’makyr, Oyu Tolgoi and Chalukou occur in the Central Asian metallogenic domain (CAMD). The outline of the CAMD almost overlaps with that of the Central Asian orogenic belt (CAOB), which is located between the East Europe, Siberia, Tarim and North China cratons. The CAMD comprises sparsely exposed tectonic slices of Precambrian high-grade metamorphic basement rocks that are sandwiched between Phanerozoic accretionary complexes and arc rocks. According to geological, metallogenic, geochronological and tectonic setting characteristics, the CAMD comprises three metallogenic provinces: (1) the Kazakhstan Cu-Au-Mo, (2) the Mongolia Cu-Au and (3) the Northeast China Mo-Cu metallogenic provinces. Early Paleozoic (∼490 to 440 Ma) and Late Paleozoic (∼330 to 295 Ma) large scale porphyry-type mineralization in the Kazakhstan metallogenic province is intimately associated with the evolution of the Central Tianshan–Yili–Northern Tianshan–Kokchetav–Chingiz Paleozoic arc system which was terminated by the late Permian closure of the western segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. In contrast, the ∼370 Ma and ∼240 Ma porphyry-type mineralization of the Mongolia metallogenic province is related to the Tuva–Mongolia arc collage system that was formed during the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the Paleozoic and the Mongol–Okhotsk Ocean in the early Mesozoic. Furthermore, the Northeast China metallogenic province was affected by three distinct geodynamic processes that were associated with the Paleo-Asian, Mongol–Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific Oceans during the Paleozoic (>250 Ma), the early Mesozoic (>200 Ma) and the late Mesozoic (200–90 Ma), respectively. Except for the Early Paleozoic Cu mineralization at Duobaoshan (∼480 Ma) and Bainaimiao (440 Ma), the porphyry-type mineralization of this metallogenic province is predominantly characterized by widespread Mesozoic Mo mineralization. In general, porphyry-type deposits of the CAMD have geological, structural, metallogenic, alteration and fluid characteristics, which are consistent either with those related to the oceanic subductional arc settings of the Circum-Pacific metallogenic domain or with those of the continental collisional environment in the Tethyan metallogenic domain. The involvement of highly oxidized intermediate to felsic magmas is fundamental for the formation of porphyry deposits. Even though the prevalent MASH and slab melting models can be employed to interpret the genesis of some porphyry Cu deposits in the CAMD, a here newly suggested model, which is based on ‘pre-enriched mafic lower crust and the subduction of a relictic mid-oceanic ridge’, is thought to explain the large scale copper mineralization in the Balkhash–West Junggar metallogenic belt of the Kazakhstan metallogenic province. Nevertheless, most of the porphyritic suites associated with the Mo deposits in the Northeast China metallogenic province have relatively depleted mantle-like neodymium and hafnium isotopic compositions, suggesting that the ore-forming granitic magma may have predominantly been derived from juvenile lower crust. Upwelling of asthenosphere may have triggered the melting of the lower crust during post-collisional extension subsequent to the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the Triassic, the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific ocean in the Jurassic and the thinning of the lithosphere caused by rollback of the Paleo-Pacific plate in the Cretaceous. Ancient crustal components were only locally found to have been involved in the magma source of several medium-large Mo deposits.","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41390445, 41390440).

Jurkat cells are among cells more frequently used for this purpose. In the current study, various cell clones or cells stocks derived from this cell line were shown to vary substantially in their response to viral infection and in their ability to support productive virus multiplication. The formation of syncytia, the effect of Vpu on viral export, and especially the specific infectivity of the viruses released, can vary significantly among independent cell stocks. This suggests that the choice of an adequate cell clone or cell line could be critical while evaluating specific properties of the virus and further stresses the limitations of tissue culture models. However, these observations also raise the possibility of exploiting these differences among cells to study specific aspects of host-cell interactions contributing to viral multiplication.","AcknowledgementsWe thank Christopher C.

For this study 82 strains of extreme halophilic archaea were selected. The characterization was performed by using the phenotypic characters including morphological, physiological, biochemical, nutritional and antimicrobial susceptibility test. The results, together with those from reference strains, were subjected to numerical analysis, using the Simple Matching (S(SM)) coefficient and clustered by the unweighted pair group method of association (UPGMA). Fifteen phena were obtained at an 70% similarity level. The results obtained reveal a high diversity among the halophilic archaea isolated. Representative strains from the phena were chosen to determine their DNA base composition and the percentage of DNA-DNA similarity compared to reference strains. The 16S rRNA studies showed that some of these strains constitutes a new taxa of extreme halophilic archaea.",,,Systematic and Applied Microbiology,,,"Archaea; Chile; DNA, Archaeal; Phenotype; Phylogeny",2001-01,2001,,2001-01,24,3,464-474,All OA; Green,Article,"Lizama, Catherine; Monteoliva-Sánchez, Mercedes; Prado, Bernardo; Ramos-Cormenzana, Alberto; Weckesser, Jurgen; Campos, Victoriano","Lizama, Catherine (Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Granada, Campus Universitario de Cartuja Granada, Spain; Laboratory of Microbiology, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Basic and Mathematics Sciences, Catholic University of Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile); Monteoliva-Sánchez, Mercedes (Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Granada, Campus Universitario de Cartuja Granada, Spain); Prado, Bernardo (Laboratory of Microbiology, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Basic and Mathematics Sciences, Catholic University of Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile); Ramos-Cormenzana, Alberto (Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Granada, Campus Universitario de Cartuja Granada, Spain); Weckesser, Jurgen (Institute of Biology and Microbiology, Freiburg, Germany); Campos, Victoriano (Laboratory of Microbiology, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Basic and Mathematics Sciences, Catholic University of Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile)",,"Lizama, Catherine (University of Granada; Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Monteoliva-Sánchez, Mercedes (University of Granada); Prado, Bernardo (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Ramos-Cormenzana, Alberto (University of Granada); Weckesser, Jurgen (Institute of Biology and Microbiology, Freiburg, Germany); Campos, Victoriano (Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)",40,3,0.68,2.38,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.384.939,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026259186,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 3107 Microbiology,

The sample consisted of 50 traditional healers (13 females and 37 males) and 50 faith healers (12 females and 38 males). They were interviewed on local terminology, clinical manifestations, causes, curability, and treatment for diabetes, help-seeking behaviour of diabetes patients, and the healers' sources of information about diabetes. Results indicate that all healers were familiar with ""diabetes"", however, not all of them had seen patients suffering from diabetes. The perceived causes of diabetes by both traditional and faith healers could be divided into (1) diet (especially too much of sugar), (2) heredity, (3) supernatural, and (4) psychological causes. Most traditional healers (92%) and faith healers (90%) indicated that diabetes is curable. Treatments used by the healers in this study included the use of prayer, diet, and herbs.

The sample consisted of 206 participants, 146 female and 60 male, the mean age was 20.9 years (SD = 3.4), with a range from 17 to 34 years. Results indicated that one third (29.2%) of the sample reported never using condoms, 35.4% always, 19.8% regularly and 8.5% irregularly in the past three months. About 90% levels of correct answers for condom use were found for the items of 'condoms as protection against STD and AIDS', 'expiry date of condoms', and 're-using condoms'. More than 15% were not aware that a condom should be put on before any contact with the vagina. The most common mistakes with respect to condom use were ignorance about the correct moment to put on a condom (56%), and when to take off a condom (55%). Male sex and especially increasing recent sexual encounters was associated with correct condom knowledge.

DESIGN: Cross sectional.
SETTING: University of the North.
SUBJECTS: 793 Black University students from non-health courses chosen by random sampling, of these 370 (46.7%) were males and 423 (53.3%) were females in the age range of 18 to 25 years (M age 21.0 years, SD = 3.48).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A measure of smoking, the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, the Health as a Value Scale, and a measure for subjective health and subjective well-being.
RESULTS: The average prevalence of current tobacco use was 15% in men and 1% in women. The proportion of tobacco users who were classified as light users (1-10 per day) averaged 10% in men and 1% in women. Age and being male were significantly positively associated with status and frequency of tobacco use. Awareness of the link between smoking and lung cancer was high (93%), but awareness of the role of smoking in heart disease was very low (16%). The importance to health of not smoking was associated with smoking status (non-smoking versus smoking). Overall, 75% of the current smokers stated that they would like to reduce the amount they smoked. Poor subjective health status and low subjective well-being was associated with smoking status. No significant differences were found among non-tobacco users and tobacco users in relation to the three subscales of the Health Locus of Control (Internal, Chance, and Powerful others) and Value for health.
CONCLUSION: For about 9% of the male students investigated, a high risk exists to become regular tobacco users for the next 30 years.",,,Curationis,,,"Adult; Black or African American; Analysis of Variance; Black People; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Internal-External Control; Male; Risk-Taking; Smoking; South Africa; Students",2001-05,2001,2001-09-28,2001-05,24,2,4-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peltzer, K","Peltzer, K (Department of Psychology, University of the North.)",,"Peltzer, K (Department of Psychology, University of the North.)",12,1,0.24,1.8,https://curationis.org.za/index.php/curationis/article/download/810/747,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072217761,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Samples were pooled and screened microbiologically using standard methods. Fatty acid analyses of total lipids, neutral lipid, glycolipid and phospholipid fractions were also conducted, to determine at which point the fish was regarded as spoiled and which packaging method provided a longer shelf-life. OPP limits storage to a maximum of 4 d (aerobic plate count of 8.2 x 105 cfu g-1), whereas VP extends the shelf-life of the fillets to between 6 and 8 d (aerobic plate count of 9.2 x 104 cfu g-1 and 1.66 x 106 cfu g-1, respectively). Similarly, coliform counts increased with time; however, packaging material had no statistical influence thereon.
CONCLUSION: Until d 13, when the experiment was terminated, no deterioration in lipid composition of the various fractions was noted.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: An extended shelf-life microbiologically-speaking, for potential processors, could thus be obtained by using VP instead of OPP.","This research was made possible from a Foundation for Research Development grant. Dr D. J. Coetzee of the Department of Microbiology, University of the Free State is thanked for the fatty acid analyses. Prof J. F.

The sample included 90 nurse clinicians (73 primary health care nurses and 17 midwives) in the age range of 24 to 59 years (M age 38.4 yr., SD = 9.3) in the Northern Province. Results indicate that nurses (66.6%) had an inadequate knowledge score on health promotion in this sample. Higher knowledge scores on health promotion were not associated with age and years of experience. However, male nurses had significantly higher knowledge scores on health promotion than female nurses. The majority strongly supported the centrality of their role in health promotion acknowledging the time constraints involved. Better knowledge on health promotion was associated with more positive views on health promotion. More nurses had a satisfactory positive attitude towards health promotion (63.3%) than knowledge about health promotion (33.3%).

The serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) may provide more information in this regard. The iron status of 561 pre-school children was determined and classified using the conventional measurements. The value of the concentration of sTfR, the ratio of sTfR (microg/ml) to LogSF (microg/l) (TfR-Index), and the Log of the ratio of sTfR (microg/l) to SF (microg/l)--(LogTfR:Fer ratio), in the classification of the iron status were determined by comparing their distributions across the classification of iron status. Although there were significant differences in sTfR and TfR-Index across the categories of iron status, there was considerable overlap. All subjects with iron deficiency had LogTfR:Fer ratio > 2.55, whereas in all subjects classified as AI it was < 2.55, thus clearly separating the two. The LogTfR:Fer ratio was not able to exclude IDA in the presence of inflammation. However, in cases of combined IDA and AI the LogTfR:Fer ratio was < 2.55 but increased to > 2.55 after resolution of the inflammation. This novel method of calculating the LogTfR:Fer ratio may provide a more precise classification of the iron status of children.",The help and co‐operation of the community of the Dikgale village and their Chief is gratefully acknowledged.

The tympanic papilla, located dorsally on the tympanic membrane, is covered by an epidermal surface and is composed of non-ossified, spongiform tissue containing a number of globular, fluid-filled vesicles found at highest density near the papillar tip. These vesicles appear to have exit pores and are probably simple alveolar exocrine glands. Injecting sound into the pressurized vocal cavity of the male and measuring the vibration velocity response of the tympanic membrane revealed that from 0.3 to 2.0 kHz the tympanic papilla velocity amplitude is on average 20 dB lower than that of a point diametrically opposite on the ventral half of the tympanic membrane. The close agreement between the dominant frequency of the call and the frequency of the maximum spectral peak of the Fast Fourier Transform of the impulse response of the eardrum is consistent with the use of the eardrum in this species both as a call receiver and as a call radiator, similar to the function suggested for the eardrum of the male bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. Unexpectedly, surgically removing the tympanic papilla lowered the frequency of the peak vibrational amplitude, testifying to the importance of membrane tension as a dominant factor in the vibratory behavior of the eardrum. During normal positive-pressure breathing, the tympanic papillae move conspicuously, suggesting a possible rôle as a visual signal.",,,Journal of Experimental Biology,,,"Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Female; Male; Ranidae; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Sound; Tympanic Membrane; Vibration; Vocalization, Animal",2001-04-01,2001,2001-04-01,2001-04-01,204,Pt 7,1223-32,Closed,Article,"Narins, Peter M.; Lewis, Edwin R.; Purgue, Alejandro P.; Bishop, Phillip J.; Minter, Leslie R.; Lawson, Dwight P.","Narins, Peter M.

The questionnaire administered to students in a class room situation included sociodemographic data, and sections on familiarity, beliefs about cause and treatment, sources of information, attitudes about epileptics, and prevention of epilepsy. Results showed that the majority of students, in particular from a rural background, were familiar with epilepsy. Health care institutions were the most important source of information on epilepsy, especially for women. Those who believed in traditional causes of epilepsy also endorsed traditional treatment for it, though they did not see such treatment as curative. Those who believed in a medical treatment did however see such treatment as curative. Although the majority of the students had a positive attitude towards epileptics through sharing a meal or room and willingness to marry an epileptic, 17% thought that epileptics can infect others with their saliva during a seizure, 12% felt an epileptic is a witch or wizard, and about 10% said an epileptic must be isolated.

In the Bloch representation, differential cross-sections for scattering in one-dimensional optical lattices result in spin-polarized diffraction patterns.

1478,pub.1072217787,10.4102/curationis.v24i4.878,11993259,,Abortion - a philosophical perspective,"The central issue in the abortion debate is the moral status of the conceptus. There are two positions that argue this issue. At one extreme are the views of the pro-life group which argues that human life begins at the moment of conception whilst at the other are views of the pro-choice group that argues in favour of a woman's right to self-determination. Two basic principles come into conflict in this debate, namely the Value of Life and that of Self-determination. In this paper the arguments forwarded by each group in justification of its position are presented. Also discussed is the moderate developmental viewpoint which accepts that the genetic basis of an individual is established at conception. Some development, however, has to occur before the conceptus can be called a person. The fact that an entity is a potential person is a prima facie reason for not destroying it. On the other hand, we need not conclude that a person has a right to life by virtue of that potentiality. Simultaneously we should recognise that the right a potential entity has, may be nullified by the woman's right to self-determination.",,,Curationis,,,"Abortion, Induced; Ethics, Nursing; Female; Humans; Philosophy, Nursing; Pregnancy; South Africa; Value of Life",2001-09-28,2001,2001-09-28,2001-11,24,4,25-31,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jali, M N","Jali, M N (Department of Nursing Science, University of the North.)",,"Jali, M N (Department of Nursing Science, University of the North.)",2,1,0.05,1.47,https://curationis.org.za/index.php/curationis/article/download/878/815,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072217787,42 Health Sciences; 4204 Midwifery; 4205 Nursing,

The HBV vaccine is given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, in parallel with OPV, DTP and Hib vaccines. This study assessed the impact of universal childhood HBV vaccination programme in reducing HBsAg carriage, in the first five years (1995--1999) since its implementation. In parallel, we investigated the current burden of HBV infection in mothers of vaccinees and the adult general population. A total of 598 babies (mean age=23.3 months) who received 3 doses of 1.5 microg/0.5 ml Hepaccine-B (Cheil) were recruited from the Northern Province (one of the nine provinces in South Africa). HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, HBeAg and anti-HBe were tested using the IMx or Axsym kits (Abbott Laboratories). PCR assays were performed following established protocols. The overall seroprotection rate (i.e. anti-HBs titre> or =10 mIU/ml) was 86.8% (519/598) in vaccinated babies, while 13.2% had anti-HBs levels<10 mIU/ml. Seroprotection rates and geometric mean titres (GMT) decreased significantly with increasing age, possibly reflecting waning anti-HBs titre over time. Total HBV exposure (positive for either HBsAg, anti-HBs, or anti-HBc) was 31.0% (58/187) in mothers of vaccinees and 40% (72/180) in the adult general population. HBsAg carrier rate was virtually similar in both groups (3.2% in mothers of vaccinees vs. 3.3% in the general population). Against this background, no vaccine failures resulting in HBsAg and HBV DNA positivity were seen in vaccinated babies, including 6 babies born to HBsAg positive carrier mothers (one carrier mother was positive for HBeAg and HBV DNA). However, 0.9% (5/582) babies, aged between 8--11 months, tested positive for anti-HBc, all of whom had anti-HBs titres>10 mIU/ml and were negative for HBV DNA. Anti-HBc positivity was probably maternal in origin, or may represent sub-clinical averted HBV infections. It can be concluded that the HBV vaccine is highly effective within the framework of the South African EPI and already shows a positive impact in the elimination of HBsAg carrier rate in children<5 years.","AcknowledgementsWe thank staff members of the Northern Province Department of Health and Welfare, as well as the students and staff members of the Department of Medical Sciences of the University of the North, for their technical support.

Measures were of sexual behavior and condom use, knowledge about correct condom use, intention of condom use, behavioral norms, attitudes, normative beliefs, and subjective norms about condoms, HIV/AIDS vulnerability (likelihood to get it) and severity of the illness in the country, and condom use self-efficacy. Bivariate analysis gave positive significant relations among normative beliefs, subjective norms, and attitudes towards condom use as well as HIV/AIDS vulnerability and HIV risk behavior. Regression analysis indicated that for boys, younger age at first vaginal intercourse, less intention for condom use, and HIV/AIDS vulnerability were predictive for HIV/AIDS risk behavior and explained 39% of the variance. It is suggested that these predictors should be included in intervention programs for HIV prevention.",,,Psychological Reports,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Black or African American; Black People; Condoms; Female; HIV Infections; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Safe Sex; South Africa; Students",2001-08,2001,2016-08-31,2001-08,89,1,51-56,Closed,Article,"Peltzer, Karl","Peltzer, Karl (University of the North)","Peltzer, Karl (University of the North)","Peltzer, Karl (University of the North)",9,0,0.17,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070822000,52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Los datos presentados coinciden para rechazar el modelo colonizador y apoyan al modelo indirecto de presencia tiwanaku de ""clientelaje"" (Berenguer 1998). Se establece que, dada la escasez de información sobre prácticas funerarias estatales, la importancia de la cerámica en los entierros altiplánicos recuperados cuando los ejemplos sanpedrinos carecen de la misma, la incorporación casi exclusiva del material cultural tiwanaku en contextos de carácter local y la posibilidad de que los objetos de oro puedan proceder de otros lugares no basta para confirmar una identidad tiwanaku a estos entierros excepcionales.",,,Boletín de Arqueología PUCP,,,,2001-05-10,2001,2001-05-10,,,5,375-395,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Stovel, Emily","Stovel, Emily (Ripon College)",,"Stovel, Emily (Ripon College)",21,1,,,https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/boletindearqueologia/article/download/2511/2455,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158515712,,

Twelve parasite species were recovered, including 5 ectoparasites (2 Monogenea, 2 Copepoda and 1 Piscicolidae) and 7 endoparasites (1 Digenea, 3 Cestoda, 2 Acanthocephala, and 1 Nematoda). The copepod Holobomolochus chilensis, the monogenean Neoheterobothrium sp., the adult acanthocephalan Floridosentis sp. and the hirudinean, Gliptonobdella sp. are new geographical and host records. The most prevalent ectoparasitic species were the monogenean, Neoheterobothrium sp. and the copepod, H. chilensis. Among endoparasites, the acanthocephalans Floridosentis sp. and Corynosoma australe were most prevalent and abundant. Prevalence and mean intensity of infection for most parasitic species were not affected by host sex, however the prevalence of Floridosentis sp. was significantly greater in males. Intensity of infection was positively correlated with host age for Neoheterobothrium sp., and negatively correlated for Floridosentis sp. and H. chilensis.

Genetic research on inheritance of color variations in the north-Chilean scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) has now been expanded to analyze color segregation in juvenile scallops produced under controlled conditions employing self- and cross-fertilization. Calculations from the results were used for comparison with different numerical models based on Mendelian inheritance, and results were also obtained on the inheritance of a dorsoventral white line often observed on the left (upper) valve in this species. The results confirmed the hereditary basis for color variation in the shell of this scallop, suggesting a simple, dominant model of epistasis to explain the distribution of the different color variants observed (purple, brown, orange, yellow, and white). The presence of the white line may be controlled by a recessive allele with simple Mendelian traits on a locus distinct from those that control color variation.","The authors thank Dr. M.

Viable counts of antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from gill and intestinal content samples showed high frequencies of resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline, while the proportion of chloramphenicol resistance was rather low. A high incidence of resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and nitrofurantoin, as well as almost an absence of resistance to gentamicin, amikacin and cotrimoxazole was found among selected isolates which represented the resistant bacterial population. These strains mainly belonged to Vibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and were predominantly resistant to 3 and 4 antibacterials. Isolates from demersal fish exhibited resistance to as many as 8-10 compounds, whereas those from pelagic fish were resistant to seven or fewer antibiotics.

The questionnaire asked for the demographic information and experiences of psychological, physical, and emotional abuse by their parents or adult caretakers as well as ritualistic abusive experiences before they were 17 years of age plus an estimate of self-perceived abuse during childhood and an overall rating of their own childhood. Analysis showed the self-reported prevalence rates to be as follows: 70.7% psychologically abused (but 14.4% for extreme cases), 27.0% physically abused, 35.3% emotionally abused, and 10.0% ritualistically abused. 13.4% of those who reported themselves as psychologically abused, 20.7% of the physically abused, 19.3% of the emotionally abused, and 35.8% of the ritualistically abused perceive themselves as not abused in any form during childhood. Yet, of the psychologically abused 23.4%, of the physically abused 18.2%, of the emotionally abused 22.0%, and of the ritualistically abused 28.3% rated their childhood as 'very unhappy'. It appears these various forms of abuse are experienced by the participants as widespread, suggesting that a much more serious problem may exist than has been recognised.

Se utilizaron mediciones de cadmio y molibdeno en dos testigos de sedimento marino para reconstruir la oxigenacin de las aguas subsuperficiales en la baha Mejillones del sur (norte de Chile), durante el pasado reciente. Condiciones anxicas/hipxicas en el fondo de la baha permiten considerar que uno de los principales procesos de incorporacin de Cd y Mo a los sedimentos es la formacin de compuestos insolubles en el agua adyacente al piso marino. As, las variaciones de la concentracin observadas a lo largo de dos testigos que abarcaron los pasados 3000 aos, representaran cambios en la oxigenacin de las aguas subsuperficiales. La estructura laminada de los testigos y concentraciones de Cd (media = 34 ppm) y Mo (media = 50 ppm) elevadas indican que el ambiente de fondo de la baha se ha caracterizado, durante los ltimos tres milenios, por presentar niveles de oxgeno muy bajos, mientras que las fluctuaciones de la concentracin a lo largo de los testigos se interpretan como cambios en la oxigenacin de fondo, dentro de una condicin de hipoxia/anoxia. En general, se ha producido una intensificacin de condicin de mnimo oxgeno hacia el presente. Una buena correlacin entre los estratos oscuros identificados en ambos testigos y el aumento de la concentracin de Cd y Mo permite indicar que estos estratos representaran periodos en que el fondo de la baha se caracteriz por presentar condiciones reforzadas de hipoxia/anoxia. Se propone que estos cambios habran sido provocados por variaciones en la circulacin de la baha y/o intensidad de la surgencia ABSTRACT. Variations in cadmium and molybdenum content along two marine cores were used to reconstruct former oxygen abundance in subsuperficial water in Mejillones Bay (northern Chile), in a recent past. Particular hypoxic/anoxic conditions met at the bottom of this embayment, may have permitted Cd and Mo to be incorporated in the sediments, directly from the bottom water. In this way the variations of content of these two elements measured in the sedimentary columns deposited in the last 3000 years may reflect changes in the oxygenation conditions of the lower part of the water column. The laminated structure of the cores and the high concentration of Cd (mean 34 ppm) and of Mo (50 ppm) suggest that the oxygen content did remain very low in the course of the last 3000 years, and the fluctuation of the concentrations along the core its interpreted as changes of the oxygenation between hypoxic and anoxic condition. The general pattern seems to be an intensification of the hypoxic conditions toward anoxia in the recent time. The fact that the highest levels of Cd and Mo content are found in the darkest layers may be interpreted as a confirmation of intensified hypoxic/anoxic conditions. These conditions may have been linked to changes in the nearshore oceanic circulation and/or variations in the upwelling intensity",,,Investigaciones marinas,,,,2001,2001,2001,,29,1,25-35,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valds, Jorge; Ortlieb, Luc","Valds, Jorge (Universidad de Antofagasta Facultad de Recursos del Mar Instituto de Investigaciones Oceanolgicas, Antofagasta, Chile); Ortlieb, Luc (IRD (ex ORSTOM Programa PVC, Francia)",,"Valds, Jorge (University of Antofagasta); Ortlieb, Luc (IRD (ex ORSTOM Programa PVC, Francia)",13,0,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/imar/v29n1/art03.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042896192,,

At the distal tips of these tubules, stem cells termed E-cells differentiate into three other cell types, R-cells, F-cells and B-cells, each of which have different absorptive and secretory roles in the biology of the overall organ. This investigation uses centrifugal elutriation to separate the individual hepatopancreatic epithelial cell types of Homarus americanus and to investigate their plasma membrane copper transport properties using the copper-sensitive fluorescent dye Phen Green. Results show highly dissimilar endogenous concentrations of copper in each cell type and within the vacuoles (vesicles) released from these cells during the centrifugation process ([copper] in vacuoles>E-cells>R-cells>F-cells approximately B-cells). All four cell types were able to absorb copper from external concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 8 micromol l(-1), but considerable differences in transport rates occurred between the cell types. External calcium (0--10 mmol l(-1)) stimulated the uptake of external copper in a saturable fashion, suggesting the occurrence of carrier-mediated metal uptake. Addition of the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil (30 micromol l(-1)) to the external medium reduced the uptake rate of copper by all four cell types, but to different extents in each type of cell. External zinc (0--1000 nmol l(-1)) was a competitive inhibitor of copper influx in E- and R-cells, suggesting that the two metals shared the same binding and transport mechanism. A model is proposed which suggests that copper may enter all hepatopancreatic epithelial cell types by a divalent cation antiport process that exchanges intracellular Ca(2+) (or other cations) with either external copper or zinc. Verapamil-sensitive Ca(2+) channels may allow access of external calcium to cytoplasmic exchange sites on the antiporter or to activator sites on the same transport protein. The results suggest that elutriation is an excellent technique for the separation of complex invertebrate organ systems into their separate cell types and for analyzing the physiological properties of each cell type in isolation.","References This study was supported by NSF grants IBN97-30874 and IBN99-74569 and EPA grant R-823068-01-0.

As development projects are designed and implemented by Third World men and women, local symbolic constructions of gender, class, and race permeate development discourse. The result is a multilayered discourse of development that negotiates Western discourse of modernity with local discourses of race, class, and gender. This analysis examines the intersection of development discourse and local patriarchal discourse in a World Bank project implemented in the agricultural frontier in Colombia. Through textual analysis of project documents and a consultant's field diary, the analysis sheds light on the rhetorical formulas, metaphors, and iconic signifiers that articulate women as ahistorical, static, and passive subjects. Despite its bottom—up, participatory approach to development, this World Bank project keeps marginalizing women, assuming that only men play crucial roles in processes of community and nation building and considering only male community members in processes of empowerment. In conclusion, the article explains how this type of development discourse maintains and reinforces patriarchal cultural codes that exclude women from active participation in development projects.",,,Communication Theory,,,,2001-11,2001,2006-01-10,2001-11,11,4,472-494,Closed,Article,"Rodriguez, Clemencia","Rodriguez, Clemencia (The University of Oklahoma)",,"Rodriguez, Clemencia (University of Oklahoma)",17,0,,11.95,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040802236,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",5 Gender Equality

Las tesis del intercambio desigual que propugnaba Prebisch y su concepto de la economía mundial organizada sobre la base de una relación entre un centro y una periferia, por controvertidos que fueran, le merecieron un lugar reconocido en la historia del pensamiento económico. A través de la CEPAL y luego de la unctad las ideas de Prebisch afectaron a los gobiernos e instituciones de toda América Latina y de todo el mundo. Los orígenes teóricos y la evolución del pensamiento de Prebisch han sido analizados extensamente por economistas e historiadores.” En cambio, no se ha discutido casi nada cómo Prebisch formó a su equipo ni cómo difundió sus tesis en la región y en el plano internacional. La siguiente entrevista fue concedida por Prebisch a David Pollock, su asistente y amigo de mucho tiempo, y viene a colmar ese vacío. En esta conversación, Prebisch pasa revista a algunos de los momentos más importantes de su vida y de la CEPAL.

The hydrothermal evolution of this deposit is associated with the emplacement of a late Eocene-Oligocene quartz monzonitic to granodioritic intrusive stock complex composed of at least three intrusive phases and hosted by Paleocene andesite. This Paleocene andesite is underlain by Mesozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which are characteristic of the basement of the Precordillera de Domeyko province in northern Chile. We propose that the intrusive stock associated with the mineralization at Escondida was emplaced in a tensional gash formed between sinistral strike-slip faults of the regional Domeyko fault system. The complete evolution of the porphyry system is characterized by overprinting of pervasive and vein-associated alteration-mineralization styles grouped in three main hydrothermal stages. The early stage includes a zone of pervasive biotitization of andesite and development of a silicification shell around the intrusive complex, propylitic alteration around the biotitic zone, and a vein-associated orthoclase-quartz ± anhydrite-biotite alteration that mark the end of stage one. This early alteration contains magnetite, chalcopyrite, and bornite, with less than 0.5 vol percent of sulfides and a hypogene copper grade of <0.2 wt percent. The second hydrothermal stage is represented by vein and vein selvage-associated chlorite-sericite ± quartz and by quartz-sericite with sulfides including chalcopyrite, pyrite, and molybdenite. In the chlorite-sericite and quartz-sericite zones the content of sulfides ranges from less than 0.5 to 2 vol percent with a chalcopyrite to pyrite ratio of 3 to 1 and copper grades that range between 0.4 and 0.6 wt percent. The intrusion of a rhyolite dike and a dome are at least 3 m.y. younger than the first and second hydrothermal stages and separate them in time from the late hydrothermal stage. The late hydrothermal stage is represented by an acid-sulfate mineral association that includes pyrophyllite, alunite, and quartz as alteration minerals and a variety of sulfides that include bornite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, chalcocite, covellite, enargite, sphalerite, tennantite, and galena. This acid-sulfate event occurred mainly in west-northwest–striking veins and also along the contact of the rhyolite and its host rock. Where sulfides from this event overprint previous sulfides, the primary copper grades range from 0.6 to higher than 1.0 wt percent. In the Escondida deposit, the highest hypogene and supergene copper grades occur in areas where all three hydrothermal stages are present.",,,Economic Geology,,,,2001-03-01,2001,,2001-03-01,96,2,307-324,Closed,Article,"Garza, Ruben A.

Hydrothermal alteration associated with mineralization and/or contact metamorphism caused by the Coastal Batholith exposed in the west resulted in new mineral assemblages and significant changes in the geochemical composition of its rocks. This paper presents a redefinition of the Punta del Cobre Formation and discusses its geologic context. The Punta del Cobre Formation is subdivided, from bottom to top, into: (1) the ‘Geraldo–Negro Member’, composed mainly of massive andesitic volcanic rocks (>300m) and locally dacitic rocks (up to 200m) that overlie the latter, and (2) the ‘Algarrobos Member’ (up to >800m) comprising mainly volcaniclastic rocks, basalt andesitic and basaltic flows, and volcanic breccias. The Punta del Cobre Formation is overlain by the Chañarcillo Group, the lowest part of which is represented by alternating carbonate and volcaniclastic beds of the Abundancia Formation, which pass vertically and laterally into limestones of the Nantoco Formation. The contact between the Punta del Cobre Formation and the overlying Abundancia Formation is transitional and defined by the first continuous bed of massive limestone or its metamorphosed equivalent. A pre-upper Valanginian age for the Punta del Cobre Formation is suggested by ammonites of Berriasian age found in the upper part of the Algarrobos Member and Late Valanginian–Early Hauterivian fauna in the overlying Abundancia Formation. Despite the intense alteration, immobile element compositions of the volcanic rocks of the Punta del Cobre Formation enable the recognition of a calc-alkaline suite with a trend to more primitive, less differentiated magmas towards the top of the stratigraphic sequence, reflecting initial stages of basin development. The transgressive nature of the sedimentary part of the Punta del Cobre Formation marks the onset of increased subsidence that eventually culminated in the Early Cretaceous marine backarc basin south of Copiapó (Chañarcillo Group). The present investigation shows that the Punta del Cobre Formation could be considered as the lower part of the Bandurrias Group, both having similar lithologies and geochemical affinities and occupying similar paleogeographic positions.","AcknowledgementsWe thank the geologists and managements of Cı́a.

638,pub.1068934121,10.2113/gsecongeo.96.2.325,,,"Multiple Centers of Mineralization in the Indio Muerto District, El Salvador, Chile","The porphyries that formed copper deposits in the Indio Muerto district include both 44 Ma rhyolitic subvolcanic intrusions and 42 to 41 Ma granodioritic stocks and dikes. All are aligned for 4 km along a north-northeast trend, which is the apparent hinge line of a 58 Ma trap-door caldera. Three separate centers of mineralization were associated with the earlier rhyolites, Cerro Pelado, Old Camp, and probably M Gulch-Copper Hill. Four separate centers were associated with the later granodiorites, M Gulch-Copper Hill, O Nose, Turquoise Gulch, and Sector Granito. Patterns of lithology, structure, mineralization, and alteration in the various centers, which have been documented by systematic mapping partially supported by studies of mineralogy and geochemistry, are presented and compared to the previously described Turquoise Gulch center. Cerro Pelado is a 750-m diameter rhyolitic volcanic neck, intruding host andesite at the northeast end of the district. Very weak Cu but much stronger Mo mineralization, with analogies to Climax-type deposits, is associated with this intrusion. Surficial sericitic alteration with weak pyrite-(chalcopyrite-bornite)-specularite-gold mineralization shows decreasing sericite, pyrite, Cu, and Au contents downward. This strong vertical zonation grades downward to alkali feldspar-biotite alteration with increasing molybdenite and magnetite content below an abrupt top of quartz veining. The Old Camp is a 250-m diameter, roughly cylindrical body of disseminated chalcopyrite-bornite and quartz veining with K feldspar-biotite alteration, centered within a rhyolitic quartz porphyry dike. This dike was emplaced and mineralized within 1 m.y. of Cerro Pelado. Mineralization zones outward through chalcopyrite-pyrite to pyrite with sericite-chlorite and then chlorite-epidote-albite alteration. A supergene sulfide enrichment blanket has been largely oxidized. M Gulch-Copper Hill was first mineralized in and around quartz porphyry dikes with quartz veining, disseminated chalcopyrite-bornite, and K feldspar-biotite alteration. Roughly 1 m.y. later, intrusion of a series of feldspar porphyries and igneous breccia displaced the center of the mineralization at M Gulch-Copper Hill. Late-stage hydrothermal activity reworked earlier mineralization and superimposed pyrite-chalcopyrite assemblages with sericite. Aside from some rich D veins containing pyrite-bornite-digenite, economic grade in the M Gulch-Copper Hill pit is mostly due to supergene enrichment. Ore at O Nose was largely supergene chalcocite-covellite on chalcopyrite-pyrite, centered on early QG feldspar porphyry and brecciated and biotized andesite. Subsequent intrusion of intramineral L feldspar porphyry and late hydrothermal activity apparently reworked earlier mineralization. At the contact, this produced a fringing chalcopyrite-pyrite zone in andesite, which is sharply zoned upward to pyrite-bornite-chalcopyrite with higher grade. This is apparently the same L porphyry that intruded the center of the main Turquoise Gulch orebody and controlled transitional and late patterns of alteration and mineralization described previously. The supergene enrichment blanket which makes ore in Sector Granito, to the southwest of Turquoise Gulch, is connected to the main orebody but primary mineralization is spatially separate and related to a different set of intrusions. Although less well known than other centers, a chalcopyrite-bornite core is apparently related to unusually intense, texture-destructive K feldspar alteration in early equigranular X porphyry and later G feldspar porphyry. This core mineralization grades outward to pyrite-sericite and abruptly upward to pyrite-bornite-chalcopyrite with sericite-andalusite-pyrophyllite-diaspore. Extending the trend to the southwest is the barren Granite Gulch feldspar porphyry, emplaced between the two mineralizing periods. 40Ar/39Ar dating demonstrates that two episodes of mineralization associated with the early rhyolitic and later granodioritic intrusions each lasted approximately 1 to 1.4 m.y., from 44.5 to 43.5 and 42.3 to 40.9 Ma, respectively. The barren Granite Gulch porphyry and perhaps the early and equigranular X and O porphyries were intruded between 43 and 42 Ma. Magmatic activity, therefore, occurred episodically over at least 3 m.y. The individual centers are best explained as expressions of different cupolas on a magma chamber, which evolved from granitic to granodiorite to quartz diorite with progressive injection of new magma. Despite our best efforts to date 16 carefully selected samples, it was not possible to define the sequence and duration of the partially overlapping centers within each of the larger mineralization periods. The different centers exhibit a wide diversity of characteristics, which mirror variations on the general theme of porphyry Cu-Mo development. Changing hydrothermal input from an evolving and growing magma chamber and major remobilization of early mineralization by both intrusion and hydrothermal activity are major factors in this diversity.",,,Economic Geology,,,,2001-03-01,2001,,2001-03-01,96,2,325-350,Closed,Article,"Gustafson, Lewis B.; Orquera, Walter; McWilliams, Michael; Castro, Mario; Olivares, Osman; Rojas, Gonzalo; Maluenda, Juan; Mendez, Marcello","Gustafson, Lewis B.

A decrease in the degree of crystallinity, as determined from the DSC melting enthalpies, was observed with an increase in the dicumyl peroxide (DCP) concentration. The Young's modulus increased with increased wax portions, and there was a higher increase for crosslinked blends. The yield stress generally decreased with increased peroxide content. Crosslinking caused an increase in elongation at yield, but increased wax content caused a decrease in elongation at yield. The stress at break generally increased with increasing peroxide content, but it decreased with increased wax content. The elongation at break decreased with an increase in the DCP concentration. Melt flow rate measurements indicated a mutual miscibility in LLDPE/wax blends. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Subjects (n=180; 20 ± 4,4 years old) were weighed, their height was measured and they completed the Body Shape Questionnaire, EAT-26, Eating Inventory (restraint scale), Adolescent Self-Concept Scale and a questionnaire concerning weight management behaviours. Main findings include lower prevalences of overestimation of body weight and body shape dissatisfaction, similar prevalences for dieting and the use of Hazardous weight reduction methods, and higher prevalences for overweight, obesity, disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, and dietary restraint among subjects than among similar white groups. Furthermore, those with urban origins were more likely to be restrained eaters, to have attempted weight reduction, to aim for weight loss and to fear weight gain. These data indicate that there are signs of more realism concerning weight status among black female students. However, there are also signs of assimilation of Western cultural norms concerning body shape, eating attitudes and behaviours and weight management.

In an attempt to put the South African situation in a broader context, institutional arrangements related to credit provision to small-scale farmers in Ghana, Tanzania and Pakistan are described. For two case studies from South Africa, regression models are used to estimate the impact of credit, extension and land tenure arrangements on small-scale farmers' net income. The findings confirm the positive impact of access to institutions on farmers' performance. We conclude by stressing the importance of institutions in small-scale irrigation farming and suggest that more emphasis should be put on the development of effective institutions in policy, program implementation and research.",,,Agrekon,,,,2001-03,2001,,2001-03,40,1,66-75,All OA; Green,Article,"Hedden-Dunkhorst, B.; Mathonzi, T.

The selection of students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds for mathematics‐, science‐, and technology‐based programmes is a problem for which most South African higher education institutions still have to find adequate solutions. Dynamic testing procedures are often seen as more fair to use for selection than single‐session tests in situations of unequal educational opportunity. The possibility that a selection instrument using a dynamic testing process could add significantly to the selection effectiveness already achieved in a South African mathematics and science foundation year using single‐session tests was investigated. The performance of a group of educationally disadvantaged black South African students on the Raven Progressive Matrices is compared to that of other groups reported in research literature.

The objective is to determine patterns of associations among production increasing factors, namely, use of recommended technologies, participation in a cooperative or project, accessibility of inputs in time, security of land ownership, as well as ability to run own finance. The results reveal that participation in a project and the use of technology are always associated. Only land tenure model resulted in a significant saturated model, where a three way association with both technology and project participation had significant effects. Access to input on time was only associated with technology use, but not with participation in a project. The ability to run own finances was associated with project participation, but not with technology use. The dynamic relationships among these factors are important when introducing technologies and support services for the future.",,,Agrekon,,,,2001-09,2001,2010-06-09,2001-09,40,3,334-343,All OA; Green,Article,"Makhura, M.; Mathye, M.; Mathabatha, M.

427,pub.1051986566,10.1002/jsfa.863,,,The quality of frozen African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) fillets under long‐term storage conditions,"Abstract  The quality of frozen catfish fillets was monitored over a period of 11 months at −20 °C, in two types of packaging materials, namely vacuum packaging (VP) and oxygen‐permeable packaging (OPP). Representative samples ( n = 5) from both types of packaging materials were drawn at random, monthly for the full period of the trial. Samples were pooled and analysed microbiologically using standard methods. Fatty acid analyses of total lipids, neutral lipid, glycolipid and phospholipid fractions as well as sensory evaluation were also conducted every 3 months on the pooled samples. These tests were conducted to determine whether OPP (cheaper option) could be used instead of VP for long‐term superchilling of catfish without detracting from its quality. Low microbiological counts were maintained throughout the trial, ie 4.1 × 10 4 cfu g −1 (VP) and 8.9 × 10 4 cfu g −1 (OPP) in the 11th month for aerobic plate count. No significant human pathogens were isolated, with the exception of Aeromonas hydrophila (Stanier). Lipid oxidation, irrespective of packaging, showed no fixed trends during the 11 months of investigation. Also, no significant deviation from sensory characteristics was noted. These results indicate that storing catfish fillets in OPP is a feasible and cheaper option for long‐term freezing.  © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry","This research was made possible by a Foundation for Research Development grant for which the authors are grateful.

Gamma irradiation also strongly influences the mechanical properties. Young's modulus increases with an increase in radiation dose, though cross-linking does not have a significant influence on the yield stress. Elongation at yield, elongation at break and stress at break depend strongly on the radiation dose. SEM demonstrates a difference in mechanisms of rupture.

DSC measurements indicated that blends consisting of 10 and 20% of wax are probably miscible in the crystalline phase. For 30% and more wax, phase separation of the two components were observed. The DSC curves of both pure LLDPE and blends show, beside the main exothermic peak, another small peak at about 70°C. Since this peak was observed for both pure LLDPE and the blends, it is probable that its origin is partly in the LLDPE structure, but it is also influenced by wax crystallization. An increase in Young’s modulus with an increase in wax content was observed. An increase in wax content causes a decrease in elongation at yield. A small increase in yield stress was observed for blends consisting of 10 and 20% of wax.

Sin embargo este grupo de anfpodos no ha sido muy bien estudiado en la costa chilena. El estudio de los caprlidos se ha visto dificultado por su gran variabilidad morfolgica y el hecho de que la literatura as como los especmenes de los museos son difciles de localizar. El objetivo de este estudio fue entregar las herramientas taxonmicas para la identificacin de las especies de crustceos caprlidos comunes en el centro-norte de la costa de Chile. Se muestrearon distintos hbitats (boyas, bolones intermareales, praderas de algas y fanergamas marinas) y se encontraron seis especies distintas de caprlidos: Caprellina longicollis (Nicolet, 1849), Caprella equilibra Say, 1818, C. scaura Templeton, 1836, C. verrucosa Boeck, 1871; Deutella venenosa Mayer, 1890 y Paracaprella pusilla Mayer, 1890. Caprella scaura, C. verrucosa y D. venenosa fueron muy abundantes sobre las algas, hidrozoos y briozoos asociados a boyas. Caprella equilibra, tambin presente en boyas, fue ms abundante bajo piedras en zonas intermareales rocosas expuestas, donde tambin se encontraron ejemplares de D. venenosa y de P. pusilla. Caprella scaura tambin se encontr sobre algas rojas de las playas arenosas, especialmente sobre Gracilaria chilensis y sobre la fanergama marina Heterozostera tasmanica, donde cohabit junto a Caprellina longicollis. Paracaprella pusilla constituye una nueva cita para las costas pacficas sudamericanas, siendo nueva para la fauna de Chile. La especie D. venenosa, que se cita por primera vez despus de la descripcin original de Mayer en el ao 1890, es considerada una especie endmica de la costa central de Chile Caprellids are abundant in many littoral habitats of the marine environment. Nevertheless, this group of amphipods has been scarcely studied along the coast of Chile. The study of the Caprellidea is particularly difficult due to the high degree of intra-specific morphological variability and the fact that literature and specimens from Museums are not easily located. The objective of the present study was to provide the taxonomical tools to identify the most common caprellid species from northern-central Chile. Several habitats were examined (buoys, boulders, algal/seagrass beds) and six caprellid species were found: Caprellina longicollis (Nicolet, 1849), Caprella equilibra Say, 1818, C. scaura Templeton, 1836, C. verrucosa Boeck, 1871; Deutella venenosa Mayer, 1890 and Paracaprella pusilla Mayer, 1890. Caprella scaura, C. verrucosa and D. venenosa were most abundant among algae, hydrozoans and bryozoans growing on buoys. Caprella equilibra, also present on buoys, was most abundant underneath boulders in exposed rocky intertidal zones, where additionally D. venenosa and P. pusilla were found. Caprella scaura was dominant in plant beds above sandy subtidal bottom, especially among the alga Gracilaria chilensis and the seagrass Heterozostera tasmanica, where it occurred together with Caprellina longicollis. Paracaprella pusilla represents a new citation for the pacific coasts of S-America, being a new record for Chile.

This study was initiated to quantify yield response of two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV-2) and a cowpea variety, PAN311 to different crop arrangements and to assess the level of Chilo partellus infestation in sorghum in the intercropping system. Superior intercropped sorghum yield was obtained when component crops were arranged in alternate rows at a 0.90 m spacing whereas cow- pea yields were similar to or lower than sole crop yield in the different component crop arrangements. The overall land use efficiency, assessed by the land equivalent ratio (LER), was improved by an average of 11% with intercropping at a row spacing of 0.90 m. However, no yield benefit was observed when crops were arranged in an alternate row pattern at a narrow row spacing of 0.45 m.

DSC analysis showed only one endothermic peak, despite the fact that pure wax shows two significant peaks. An increase in wax content of the blends hardly changes the onset and peak temperatures, or the specific enthalpies of melting of the blends. The TGA analyses of the blends show that the thermal stability of blends decreases with an increase in wax content, particularly after the 50% stage, since the thermal stability of the wax is much lower than the thermal stability of LLDPE. A small increase in Young's modulus of the blends with an increase in wax content was observed. Wax content was found to have no influence on the yield point (elongation at yield and yield stress) of the blends. An increase in wax content decreases both stress and elongation at break. An increase in flow rate with an increase in wax content of the blends was observed. We also observed that our wax slightly improves the polarity of the blends.

410,pub.1040561780,10.1080/09523980110041908,,,Integration Of Educational Media in Higher Education Large Classes,"The potential of new technologies that have been developed to support greater teacher effectiveness has increased, but, teachers/lecturers at higher education institutions do not use such technology enough in developing new methods of instruction. This is possibly because of the frustration experienced in slow equipment delivery and setting it up each time they want to use it. Too often, hardware and facility improvements are funded without the resources necessary to help lecturers make significant changes in courseware and teaching methods. There is too much reluctance on the part of lecturers to use instructional media as a way of improving teaching and learning. It is further acknowledged by this paper that, today, the diversification of technologies makes it possible to reach a new stage, making the integration of these new media essentials: the Internet, cyberspace, multimedia, hypermedia, and so on. The current width of this evolution, undoubtedly, calls for an urgent response to the problems raised by the use of educational media. Moreover, the particular characteristics of these new media, the digital whole, addresses new questions such as: what teaching scenarios are relevant and innovating? What is the impact of these media on methodologies and the organization of the learning and teaching institution? L’éducation des médias éducatifs dans l’enseignement supérieur. Les nouvelles technologies ont été développées pour soutenir une plus grande efficacité des enseignants mais l'on constate que ceux-ci ne s'appuient pas suffisamment sur ces technologies pour développer de nouvelles méthodes et de nouveaux usages pédagogiques. Trop souvent le hardware et les services sont financés sans que le soient aussi les mesures d'accompagnement susceptibles d'entraîner chez les enseignants des modifications significatives dans leurs méthodes d'enseignement. Il y a donc une certaine résistance de leur part À utiliser les nouveaux médias éducatifs afin de développer l'enseignement et l'apprentissage. L'évolution des médias actuels fait surgir de nombreuses questions telles que : quels sont les scénarios pédagogiques pertinents et innovatifs ? Quel est l'impact de ces médias sur les méthodologies, sur l'organisation des apprentissages et des systèmes de formation. Die Integration pädagogischer Medien in der höheren Bildung. Neue Technologien wurden entwickelt, um die Effektivität in der Bildung zu unterstützen. Man stellt jedoch fest, dass Lehrkräfte an höheren Bildungsinstitutionen diese Technologien nicht genügend einsetzen, um neue pädagogische Methoden zu entwickeln. Finanzielle Mittel für Hardware und weitere Einrichtungen werden häufig bereitgestellt, jedoch ohne die notwendigen Ressourcen, die den Lehrkräften bei der signifikanten Veränderung ihrer Lehrmethoden helfen sollen. Es existiert somit eine gewisse Abneigung seitens der Lehrkräfte, die neuen Medien zur Verbesserung ihrer Unterrichtsqualität einzusetzen. Die gegenwärtige Entwicklung der neuen Medien werfen somit Fragen wie diese auf : Welche Bildungsszenarien sind relevant und innovativ ? Welche Auswirkungen haben diese Medien auf die Methodik und die Bildungsinstitutionen ?",,,Educational Media International,,,,2001-01,2001,,2001-01,38,2-3,95-99,Closed,Article,"Papo, William","Papo, William ()",,"Papo, William ()",13,1,,3.31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040561780,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

That is, not all meanings occur with equal frequency (Simpson, 1979). This implies that given an ambiguous word, one retrieves its most frequent meaning first. This meaning is tested against the context, and if it is determined to be appropriate, it is accepted. If it is not appropriate, the next most frequent meaning is retrieved. It is the main aim of this article to test ambiguity of words in a sentence, starting from the most dominant meaning to the most subordinate meaning. In this respect, context plays a very important role. The company/situation in which one finds oneself determines the dominant meaning.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2001-01,2001,2012-10-24,2001-01,21,1,67-74,Closed,Article,"Chokoe, Sekgaila","Chokoe, Sekgaila (University of the North, Department of Northern Sotho, P/Bag X1106, Sovenga, E-mail:, Sekgailac@unin.unorth.ac.za)",,"Chokoe, Sekgaila (University of the North, Department of Northern Sotho, P/Bag X1106, Sovenga, E-mail:, Sekgailac@unin.unorth.ac.za)",1,0,,0.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106839140,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

Scholars like Lombard et. al.(1985) and Louwrens (1991) say nothing about the preposition, but instead talk about particles. This paper seeks to look at the preposition from another perspective. It presents an argument that the particle is an umbrella term, which can justifiably be called a convenient term, a term used to refer to elements that don't clearly enter any class of lexical items. Taking into consideration the functions performed by prepositions, it will be a great injustice to classify them as particles. Within the GB theory, prepositions are assignors of case and theta role, and, traditionally, they do not have phi-features such as gender, number and person, which participate in agreement. To regard prepositions as particles seems to be a linguistic fallacy. It is argued in this paper that what seem like particles are in fact genuine prepositions in the traditional sense. The paper acknowledges and indicates that there are few prepositions in Northern Sotho and this results in their overloading with meanings.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2001-01,2001,2012-10-24,2001-01,21,1,59-66,Closed,Article,"Sepota, Moloko","Sepota, Moloko (Department of Northern Sotho, University of the North, P/Bag X1106, SOVENGA, 0727)",,"Sepota, Moloko (Department of Northern Sotho, University of the North, P/Bag X1106, SOVENGA, 0727)",1,0,,0.49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106839139,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

This paper seeks to open a debate on this issue and also discusses how and why the study of folklore must be revisited for the simple reason that at the present moment the approach that is in use, especially at the secondary school level and some tertiary institutions, leaves much to be desired. At times one is not even sure what folklore really means, and whether one is doing folklore any justice by limiting it to a mere study of the structure and contents of the condensed form of folktales, riddles, proverbs, to mention but a few. This type of approach is gradually making the study of folklore more and more complex. It is even worsened by the current thinking in governmental circles, whose focus seems to be on the production of students for a technological future only. Some other aspects like history, music and religion, are often overlooked, and even those that are included in the syllabus, most students find it difficult to relate to them (which is often form and content) to their everyday situations. Some of the same students who are studying folklore and philosophy cannot even understand that proverbs actually constitute African philosophy. The paper advocates a holistic approach towards the study of folklore, an approach that will definitely contribute towards the realization of the global dream of the African Renaissance.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2001-01,2001,2012-10-24,2001-01,21,3-4,291-297,Closed,Article,"Sepota, Moloko","Sepota, Moloko (Department of Northern Sotho, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, SOVENGA, 0727, E-mail:, Molokos@unin.unorth.ac.za)",,"Sepota, Moloko (Department of Northern Sotho, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, SOVENGA, 0727, E-mail:, Molokos@unin.unorth.ac.za)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106839153,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

The dopant distribution and lattice damage were investigated using Rutherford backscattering, channeling spectrometry and X-ray diffraction, whereas photoluminescence was used to probe the optical response. Random implantation results in substantial damage accumulation, which is difficult to recover during subsequent annealing. To reduce the ion-induced damage, we applied channeled implantation, i.e. directing the Er-beam along the nitride c-axis. Using this implantation geometry, a drastic decrease in the induced damage is observed. Channeled implantation generally results in green luminescence lines at room temperature, whereas no Er-related luminescence is observed after random implantation.","AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders (FWO), the Inter-University Attraction Pole (IUAP P4/10) and the bilateral projects BIL 98/51 (Flanders/South Africa) and BIL 99/07 (Flanders/China).

Six soils with silt-plus-clay contents varying between 8 and 41% were selected. The determination consisted of pouring the soil samples into moulds 100 mm high with 106 and 158 mm diameters from three different falling heights, viz. 150, 300 and 450 mm. The uniformity of packing of the soil particles was varied by including or excluding a sleeve equipped with a wire mesh in the procedure. A mould 106 mm in diameter and 100 mm high attached beneath a 150 mm long sleeve which had a wire mesh with 6.5 mm openings fitted 20 mm from the top, was found to be the apparatus producing the most reliable results.

These doses are suitable for channelled ion beam synthesis (CIBS) of ErSi1.7 layers. A study of the influence of the implantation temperature between 470–800°C and the effect of the angle up to ±5° from the 〈111〉 direction has been carried out. Increasing the temperature results in significant improvements in the as-implanted material. The optimal temperature range is 600–700°C. Higher temperatures result in diffusion of the implanted Er to the surface where it is sputtered away by the incoming ions. Comparison of the experimental angular dependence with simulations and theory shows good agreement. Implantations at <4° from the channelling direction form a continuous silicide layer after annealing.,"AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Belgian Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders (FWO), the Inter-University Attraction Pole (IUAP P4/10) and the bilateral projects BIL 98/51 (Flanders/South Africa) and BIL 99/07 (Flanders/China).

Pragmatic failure may lead, in the long term, to resentment, which, in turn, may lead to ethnic (cross-group) stereotyping and negative labelling. Misperceptions of non-native speakers of English has often contributed to the perpetuation (unintentionally though it may sometimes be) of exclusion and discrimination of the non-native speakers by native speakers, as observation in academic settings and the job market has shown. In this article, I use observational and elicited data of requests in English by university students to highlight the difficulties (and risks) posed by their lack of pragmatic competence in intercultural interaction. I tentatively discuss the teachability of speech act realisation and argue for the inclusion of pragmatic instruction in English language teaching and of pragmatics in teaching/learning materials, with two aims in mind: (i) to sensitise learners to the importance of pragmatic issues and heighten their metapragmatic awareness; and (ii) to alert 'gatekeepers' to the inevitability of variation in pragmatic competence due to the learners' or users' first language (L1), individual choices and preferences.",,,Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies,,,,2001-08,2001,,2001-08,19,3-4,253-273,Closed,Article,"Kasanga, Luanga A","Kasanga, Luanga A ()",,"Kasanga, Luanga A ()",11,0,,5.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070957636,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

Countries that lack a sound higher education infrastructure can thereby tap the resources of the more developed countries. They can also use the resources of the information and communication technologies to transmit educational offerings to isolated areas and/or areas in which local higher education possibilities are not available. But there are problems. The telecommunications networks, which are almost always owned and headquartered in the developed countries of the North, charge exorbitant rates for their services. Courses and courseware designed in developed countries are frequently not suitable, from a cultural point of view, for use in the developing countries in the South.

The animals were each cultured in separate tanks, and effluent from each was directed through separate tanks, which contained dense cultures of the Gracilaria chilensis . Inflow‐outflow monitoring was conducted for the presence of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and phosphate. Also evaluated were particulate nitrogen and phosphate. The most significant wastes were ammonium from the fish culture and nitrate from the oyster culture. These were completely removed from the water, with minor exceptions, by the alga during all seasons of the year. Lesser amounts of soluble phosphate and nitrite, arising from the fish cultures, were also removed. Of the particulate matter, only nitrogen was in evidence from the fish cultures in the summer. It was concluded that Gracilaria chilensis culture was highly efficient at biofiltration of the soluble nutrients tested but had little effect on particulate emissions.

This archive houses documentation from three former liberation movements: the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, the Azanian People's Organization and the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania. Bhengu, from 1991 to 1994 the first black rector of Fort Hare, had signaled a new era for the university.
                  It was during Bhengu's administration that the university received ANC archival documents, firstly from the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College (SOMAFCO), the ANC school in Tanzania during the exile period between 1978 and 1992, followed by other documents from ANC missions in different parts of the world. The arrival of these sources, which are lodged in the University Library, was followed by the official opening of the ANC archives on 17 March 1996 by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of behalf of Nelson Mandela. Even before they were officially opened, the university had begun to receive scholars who combed the documents in an effort to reconstruct the history of the exiled liberation movements. Fort Hare historians also utilized the archives.
                  The presence of the ANC archives at Fort Hare seems to have inspired Mbulelo Mzamane, Bhengu's successor as Vice Chancellor, to state that Fort Hare should be a home for all South African liberation movements' archival material. Soon, sources from the three liberation movements were sent to the university and the former Centre for Cultural Studies (CCS), now NAHECS, took charge of the documents. While these papers were being sorted out, a building was being constructed on campus to house the papers.",,,History in Africa,,,,2001,2001,2014-05-13,2001,28,,417-438,Closed,Article,"Maaba, Brown Bavusile","Maaba, Brown Bavusile (Govan Mbeki Research and Development Centre, University of Fort Hare, maaba/lmaaba@hotmail.com)",,"Maaba, Brown Bavusile (University of Fort Hare)",9,1,,10.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070216844,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies",

The MML principle seeks to identify an optimal model within some specified parameterised class of models and for this paper we have chosen to concentrate on a single model class, that of mixture separation or fuzzy clustering. The first section presents, in outline, an MML methodology for fuzzy clustering. We then present some applications, including the nature of the within-cluster model, examination of the univocality of results for different groups of species and the effectiveness of presence data compared to purely quantitative data. Finally, we examine some possibilities of extending MML methodology to include within-class correlation of species, the existence of dependence between observed samples and the comparison of different classes of models.",Our thanks to Sanyi Bartha who provided some extremely useful and important comments on an earlier draft.,,Community Ecology,,,,2001-06,2001,2001-12-30,2001-06,2,2,231-247,Closed,Article,"Dale, M.

Provenances were not replicated within site. The leaves and leaf stalks sampled were dried at 55°C and then analysed for total phenolics and proanthocyanidins (PAs). Variations in content of PAs and total phenolics of the Acacias were studied. Three assay methods for phenolics were evaluated.Total phenolics were estimated by precipitation with trivalent ytterbium after extraction with acetone:water (7:3v/v) or colorimetrically by the Folin–Ciocalteu method. PAs were estimated colorimetrically by the butanol–HCl method. The results from the colorimetric methods are reported as absorbance units (au).A. senegal contained the lowest level of ytterbium precipitated phenolics (Ybppt) (mean=47g/kg DM), while A. nilotica contained the highest (mean=298g/kg DM). Amounts of Ybppt for A. karroo, A. erioloba and F. albida were not significantly different (P>0.05) from one another. The amount of Ybppt for A. tortilis was significantly different (P<0.05) from the amount for A. karroo but not different from the amount for F. albida and A. erioloba (P>0.05).A. senegal was again the lowest in total phenolics detected by the Folin–Ciocalteu method (A675=0.370au/g DM), while A. nilotica was the highest (A675=5.261au/g DM). A. karroo, F. albida and A. tortilis were not significantly different (P>0.05) from one another.PAs were lowest for A. senegal (A550=0.040au/g DM) and highest for A. karroo (A550=2.011au/g DM). Values for A. tortilis, F. albida and A. erioloba were not significantly different (P>0.05) from one another. For all the three assay methods, there were no significant differences (P>0.05) between Cyrene and Mahiye sites.The regression analysis of PAs on Ybppt showed the relationship to be highly significant (P<0.05) for A. karroo, F. albida and A. erioloba (R2=0.904, 0.892, 0.884, respectively, and significant for A. tortilis (R2=0.680). It was poor for A. senegal and A. nilotica (R2=0.347 and 0.460, respectively).

S.: Southern African herbaria and Red Data Lists. – Taxon 50: 593–602. 2001. – ISSN 0040‐0262.  The southern African region is facing a major information backlog with regard to compiling plant Red Data Lists. This article examines the need for synergising these attempts by enlisting the aid of herbaria. It focuses on integrating ongoing Red Data List work with herbarium activities, with particular emphasis on the network of southern African herbaria. It is proposed that herbaria adopt a means to code specimens with a known or suspected Red Data List status. This practical suggestion presents one way in which southern African herbaria can adopt a more proactive stance towards threatened plant and other conservation‐related issues to help overcome this information backlog. The southern African region has much to do, if it is to emulate the international Red Data List status quo, and herbaria are at the centre of this.",,,Taxon,,,,2001-05,2001,2001-05,2001-05,50,2,593-602,Closed,Article,"Golding, Janice S.","Golding, Janice S.

An increasing proportion of the eggs necessary to sustain the culture are locally produced by some hatcheries. However, there is no information about the origin or the genetic variability in these strains. The present study analysed allozymic variability and its distribution within and between some commercial strains of coho salmon in southern Chile. The genetic variability was estimated using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. Samples of coho salmon were obtained randomly from four Chilean hatcheries. Twenty‐five enzymatic systems were examined, representing 51 enzymatic loci. Eight loci showed variability in at least one strain, which represented a total polymorphism (P) of 15.7%. Only the PGM‐1* locus was variable in all strains. The remaining loci were fixed in at least one strain. Total heterozygosity (HT) and within population heterozygosity (HS) were 0.35% and 0.36% respectively. The index of genetic diversity (GST) was 1.5%. The results confirm previous reports of low genetic variability in cultured strains of coho salmon in Chile, below that observed in their native range, which suggests loss of the genetic variability caused by genetic drift or other causes in these strains.","We would like to thank the following people for their assistance in obtaining the samples: Dr Roberto Neira, Arturo Inostrosa and Gustavo Yáñez, and to Enzo Acuña for reviewing the English version of the manuscript.

The burrow complex is attributed to the therapsid Trirachodon, based on disarticulated but fairly complete skulls and skeletons of at least 20 individuals recovered from a nearby, less well-preserved system. The entrance shaft slopes gently downward and is characterized by a bilobate floor and vaulted roof. The bilobate floor has a central flat-topped scratch-marked ridge flanked by two smooth grooves, each approximately the width of the occupant. At deeper levels, tunnels display tighter lateral curvatures, progressively decreasing burrow diameters, variable orientations, and some right angle branches. Burrow floors at these levels are vaguely bilobate. Distally, burrows flatten dorso-ventrally, becoming wedge-shaped before they terminate. These complexes are interpreted as colonial dwelling structures. Numerous branching tunnels and terminal chambers, as well as an enlarged entrance, constitute an unrealistically high expenditure of energy for a single occupant. Furthermore, the bilobate floor is atypical of a single occupant system. Absence of scratch marks in the depressions reflects the regular locomotory activity of Trirachodon. In single-occupant burrows, the center of the structure is worn. The bilobate floor with preferential wear along the flanks suggests routine travel on one side of the tunnel or the other, as multiple occupants moved past one another during daily activity. The presence of numerous fossilized Trirachodon individuals in terminal chambers at the second locality supports multiple cohabitation. There, the uniform sedimentary fill and vertebrate taphonomy suggest that the occupants were drowned in a flash flood. Vertebrate remains are absent at the first locality, where sediment influx was incremental, permitting the escape of burrow occupants. This constitutes the earliest record of multiple cohabitation of a burrow complex by tetrapods. The Trirachodon (Cynodontia) of the Early Triassic Cynognathus Zone probably displayed complex social behaviors previously regarded to be restricted to the mammals of the Cenozoic. This fossorial behavior may have been for thermoregulation, protection from predators, sites of reproduction, and the rearing of young.","We thank Messers.

Land invasions and displacements, the introduction of technologies more suited to European conditions, and increased use of the mouldboard plough and hand hoe slowed and almost halted this revolution. In recent decades farmers have in some areas regained security of tenure, recognised the potential value of indigenous knowledge, and begun to understand the degradation caused by soil inversion and other ‘modern’ technologies. Conservation tillage is defined as any cropping system which results in conservation of natural or other resources, and sustainable agriculture as the use of agricultural practices which conserve water and soil and are environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable. Synergising of the will, findings and knowledge of African farmers and agriculturists with the experience and understanding of other conservation tillage researchers, advisers and practitioners throughout the world has resulted in this agrarian revolution gathering momentum.

The translocated population was derived from individuals from the upper Blyde River. We used starch gel-electrophoresis to compare the genetic structure of these two populations. Polymorphism was detected at 34% of the loci and the average heterozygosities were 0.048 for the translocated population and 0.062 for the founder population. Deviations of observed genotype frequencies from expected proportions occurred at seven loci and were the result of a deficit of heterozygotes in all instances. Estimates of population differentiation and gene flow between populations suggest that the two populations are experiencing genetic drift.

The author does not suggest that the bottom line is unimportant, rather that we need to look beyond that. The challenge is to seek knowledge that will assist in addressing the issues that are pertinent to the South African workplace without being oblivious to the bottom line. Improperly framed questions will not elevate the discipline and the profession from a marginal to a strategic role, at least not in organisational settings. The author asserts that Industrial Psychology has a great deal to offer managers regarding what the thrust should be in the creation of new futures in turbulent times. This would require focussing on relevant issues rooted in the workplace. Opsomming Die artikel berus op die argument dat die huidige bestuursparadigma plaas ‘n oordrewe klem op finansiële state en vergelykings, of koste-verlaging, ongeag die lang termyn organisatoriese en sosiale prys wat betaal word. Die skrywer stel geensins voor dat finansiële prestasie onbelangrik is nie, eerder dat verder as hierdie prestasie gekyk moet word. Die uitdaging is om kennis te skep wat tersaaklike kwessies in die Suid-Afrikaanse werkplek sal aanspreek sonder om finansiële prestasie te onderbeklemtoon. Onbehoorlik geformuleerde vrae sal die dissipline en professie nie vanaf die kantlyn na ‘n strategiese rol verskuif nie, ten minste nie in ‘n organisatoriese opset nie. Daar word geredeneer dat die Bedryfsielkunde ‘n groter bydrae kan maak aan bestuurders t.o.v. wat beklemtoon behoort te word in die skep van nuwe toekomstige moontlikhede tydens dinamies veranderende tye.

Most females, regardless of their reproductive stage, were accompanied by males. Within a particular burrow, females of the two species often were in the same reproductive stage, i.e. both were with embryos in a similar developmental stage, or both were without embryos. These data suggest that male and female conspecifics, as well as the pairs of the two species, remain together in the same burrow for relatively long time periods.

Recent analysis of three Crucibulum populations obtained in northern Chile demonstrates the existence of morphological, genetic, and reproductive differences among populations. Two populations present in Bahía Tongoy (30°15′S), one inhabiting the shells of the snail Turritellacingulata and the other shells of the pectinid Argopectenpurpuratus, showed morphological differences. However, both had planktonic larval development and show low genetic divergence (D=0.002). A third population from Bahía La Herradura (29°58′S), which also inhabits the shells of T. cingulata, did not show morphological differences compared with its counterpart from Bahía Tongoy. However the Bahía La Herradura population had intracapsular development and metamorphosis, and a larger genetic distance (D=0.06) from both Tongoy populations. The results of the reproductive and genetic analyses strongly suggested that the two Tongoy populations, although showing morphological differences, are biologically the same species, Crucibulumquiriquinae, whereas the La Herradura population is a new species.",,,Marine Biology,,,,2001-09,2001,,2001-09,139,3,527-534,Closed,Article,"Véliz, D.; Guisado, C.; Winkler, F.","Véliz, D.

It also argues for the use of an L2 since there are many learners world-wide who are successfully receiving an education via a second language. The article further argues that for the benefit of the Black majority learners, there is need for educationists and language planners to have a clear and realistic understanding of the educational outcomes of instruction in second a language such as English, as such a knowledge is important where realistic expectations can inform language planners in educational contexts. The latter part of the article argues that the language-in-education policy is doomed to fail. The reasons for this include factors such as lack of trained teachers in mother-tongues and in the powerful second language, English; lack of curriculum materials, poor infrastructure from books to buildings, and the total lack of the political will to effectively implement the promulgated language-in-education policy.

Several aggregations of specialised grooming setae are located mainly on the carpus, propodus, and dactylus of 5th pereiopods. Under laboratory conditions, ovigerous females were frequently observed to groom brooded embryos with this appendage. Grooming of the brood mass was most often observed during the day when brooding females remained relatively immobile, while embryo grooming was almost absent during the night when brooding females were otherwise highly active. When small shell pieces, dead embryos belonging to the same species, or small epoxy resin balls were inserted into the brood mass, the 5th pereiopods did not search for, manipulate, nor actively discard them. However, foreign objects were “incidentally removed” from the brood mass due to the preening of brooded embryos by the 5th pereiopods. Females that had the 5th pereiopods experimentally removed suffered higher embryo mortality during incubation than females with intact 5th pereiopods. Thus, brood grooming by 5th pereiopods significantly enhances survival of embryos during incubation. Compared to females with intact 5th pereiopods the hatching process of experimental females was significantly longer. Active brood care behaviour as described here for P. violaceus may also occur in other Anomuran species, because most of them bear a 5th pereiopod modified as a chelated grooming structure.","We deeply appreciate comments and ideas from Dr. Martin Thiel, Dr. Gerhard Pohle, Randy Finke, and two anonymous reviewers that substantially improved the present manuscript.

The leaves from the legumes had significantly less N and higher cell wall, neutral detergent insoluble N (NDIN) and acid detergent insoluble N (ADIN) contents than cottonseed meal. The values of NDIN as a fraction of total N were 19, 456, 526 and 816g/kg for cottonseed meal, L. leucocephala, A. angustissima and C. calothyrsus, respectively.Proanthocyanidin contents were 33, 196 and 134g/kg DM for A. angustissima, C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala, respectively.

Small-eye flounder, Paralichthys microps, and chilean flounder P. adspersus, are native, high-value flatfish present off the coasts of Perú and Chile, that are commonly exploted by artisanal fishermen. Since 1986 both species have been objects of research studies for culture based on techniques developed for Japanese flounder. This paper is a review of current knowledge of this species and to identify research needs for the near future. Natural spawning of small-eye flounder and chilean flounder broodstock in captivity is already possible, but the manipulation of spawning using photoperiod and hormonal inducement, as well as the role of broodstock nutrition in egg and larval quality, needs to be explored. Successful incubation and larval culture protocol for both species have been developed, with larval survival over 24% from certain egg batches. Nutritional characterization and requirements for chilean flounder eggs and larvae during the culture period, optimal temperature, density, light intensity and green-water culture, are all subjects of ongoing research. Efforts to improve early culture protocol continues with emphasis on causes of larval mortality, early use of dry feed, microbial ecology of culture tanks and water quality. Weaning from live to formulated diets has been investigated, demonstrating survival of 30-50%. Presently only about 1-5% of hatchery raised flounder show a pigment disorder. Research on formulated diets and the weaning process are under way to ameliorate these results. Juveniles are being grown experimental in tanks and net pens systems and their performance (growth, survival, health) in both systems is being evaluated. Chilean flounder require approximately 2.8 years to reach 1 kg. Effort is also focusing on improving juvenile growing protocol, including recirculation systems, culture environment and diet formulation. Much future research will be required to attain optimal production of the species, such as species-specific nutritional requirements, optimum stocking density, disease and health management and growing protocols with new systems (shallow raceway). At present there is enough known about chilean flounder to begin a pilot-stage that will be the key for future development of its culture.",,,Journal of Applied Aquaculture,,,,2001-01,2001,,2001-01,11,1-2,147-164,Closed,Article,"Silva, Alfonso","Silva, Alfonso (Laboratorio Cultivo de Peces, Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Católica del Norte, Casilla 117, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"Silva, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)",12,0,,0.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007354609,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3005 Fisheries Sciences",14 Life Below Water

Oceanographic stations in a 12 nm transect off the upwelling focus of Punta Lengua de Vaca and adyacent area were occupied using CTD and bottles to 350 m depth on August 10 to 17, 1990. The characteristics and dynamics of coastal and oceanic waters are analyzed and interpreted by means of T-S profiles and geostrophic speed estimates. The observational period coincided with a relaxation of the coastal wind followed by an upwelling-favorable wind event, as observed ""in situ"" by an automatic metereological station. Differences of the temperature and salinity behavior at the coastal stations with respect to the oceanic ones are explained by intrusion of oceanic water masses and the influence of internal gravity waves. Geostrophic estimates relative to the 300 db level indicate northward currents of the order of 10 cm*s-1 in the first 100 m depth layer and southward ones under that level, consistent with the classical coastal upwelling scheme.

The removal of natural frequencies of the structure from resonance bands is therefore of great importance. This problem is called frequency isolation problem and is the subject of this paper. A new inverse eigenvalue method is proposed and applied to spring–mass systems, which have generated much interest in the literature as prototypes of vibrating structures. The novelty of the method lies in using the zeros of the frequency response function at the last mass as control variables in an optimization problem to minimize the impact of redesign. Numerically accurate algorithms for computing the sensitivity with respect to the control variables are presented, which form the basis of an efficient multidimensional search strategy to solve the frequency isolation problem.

The aims of this study were to determine whether the limited flight ability of moths has an effect on gene flow between two geographically distant I. belina populations, whether there are gene expression differences between moths, worms and pupae and whether staggered generations have different genotypic expressions. Gene products of 19 protein-coding loci from moths collected at two locations, one of which included two staggered generations, were analysed by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. High levels of polymorphism (42% and 47%) and heterozygosity (0.182 to 0.210) were present in all groups. There were developmental constraints on the expression of the phosphoglucomutase enzyme coding locus, and only allozyme and not isozyme differences between individuals from the various developmental stages were found at other loci. Although the groups displayed a large amount of variation, little differentiation and a large amount of gene flow were observed between them. Results indicate that the genetic diversity of I. belina populations is relatively high. The February-hatching Messina group is recommended for commercial utilisation due to the large amount of genetic variation in this population.

Nemerteans occur in most marine environments although usually in low abundances. Some species, particularly in intertidal habitats, may reach locally high densities. During specific time periods appropriate for hunting, nemerteans roam about in search of prey. Upon receiving a stimulus (usually chemical cues), many nemertean species actively pursue their prey and follow them into their dwellings or in their tracks. Other species (many hoplonemerteans) adopt a sit-and-wait strategy, awaiting prey items in strategic locations. Nemerteans possess potent neurotoxins, killing even highly mobile prey species within a few seconds and within the activity range of its attacker. Most nemertean species prey on live marine invertebrates, but some also gather on recently dead organisms to feed on them. Heteronemerteans preferentially feed on polychaetes, while most hoplonemerteans prey on small crustaceans. The species examined to date show strong preferences for selected prey species, but will attack a variety of alternative prey organisms when deprived of their favourite species. Ontogenetic changes in prey selection appear to occur, but no further information about, e.g. size selection, is available. Feeding rates as revealed from short-term laboratory experiments range on the order of 1–5 prey items d−1. These values apparently are overestimates, since long-term experiments report substantially lower values (0.05–0.3 prey items d−1). Nemerteans have been reported to exert a strong impact on the population size of their prey organisms through their predation activity. Considering low predation rates, these effects may primarily be a result of indirect and additive interactions. We propose future investigations on these interactive effects in combination with other predators. Another main avenue of nemertean ecological research appears to be the examination of their role in highly structured habitats such as intertidal rocky shore and coral reef environments.",,,Hydrobiologia,,,,2001-07,2001,,2001-07,456,1-3,21-32,Closed,Article,"Thiel, Martin; Kruse, Inken","Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo, 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Kruse, Inken (Wattenmeerstation Sylt, Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Meeresforschung, D-25992, List/Sylt, Germany)",,"Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North); Kruse, Inken (Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research)",55,9,,5.74,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041189939,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,14 Life Below Water

The present work provides information regarding the existence of different customs related to artificial cranial deformation, based on remains from several Archaic sites in Arica, Chile. These sites include Morro 1, Morro 1/6, and Morro de Arica (Uhle). Following a morphoscopic analysis, a series of measurements of 101 skulls were obtained; these were compared statistically to test the differences between deformed skulls of different types and crania that were not deformed. This included an analysis of variance (ANOVA), using sex, age, and cultural group as variables. The results obtained confirm the cranial deformation, and find that such deformation is consistent with types of deformation including circular erect, circular oblique, and tabular erect.

Herein we conducted controlled and repeatable laboratory experiments on the predation rate of the hoplonemertean Amphiporus nelsoni Sánchez 1973, which is common at exposed rocky shores along the central Chilean coast. During the austral fall (April, May 2000), nemerteans were observed in relatively high numbers crawling in the intertidal zone during early morning or late-afternoon low tides. When these nemerteans were offered living amphipods held by a forceps, they immediately attacked the amphipods and fed on them. In the laboratory experiments, nemerteans preferred the amphipod Hyale maroubrae Stebbing, 1899, which is also very common in the natural habitat of A. nelsoni. The nemerteans preyed to a higher extent on small males and non-ovigerous females than would have been expected from their abundance. We suggest that these (non-reproductive) stages of H. maroubrae are very mobile and therefore have a high likelihood of encounters with nemerteans. Predation rates reached maxima when nemerteans were provided prey densities of four or more of their preferred prey species, H. maroubrae, furthermore indicating that encounter rates with prey may affect predation rates. In long-term laboratory experiments, A. nelsoni consumed more amphipods during low tide conditions than during high tide conditions. Many nemerteans in the field prefer particular environmental conditions (e.g. nocturnal low tides), which restricts the time available for successful feeding. In the long-term experiment, predation rates of A. nelsoni never exceeded 0.5 amphipods nemertean−1 d−1. Maximum feeding events were 3 or 4 amphipods nemertean−1 d−1, but this only occurred during 10 out of a possible 2634 occasions. Nemerteans that had consumed 3 or 4 amphipods during 1 day, consumed substantially less prey during the following days. Towards the end of the long-term experiment, average predation rates decreased to ∼0.2 amphipods nemertean−1 d−1, corresponding to predation rates reported for other nemertean species (0.1–0.3 prey items nemertean−1 d−1). We suggest that predation rates from laboratory experiments represent maximum estimates that may not be directly transferable to field populations.

Although the lack of terrestrial organic macrofossils and the presence of a significant 14C reservoir effect make radiocarbon dating of lake sediments very difficult, we propose the following palaeoenvironmental history. An initial shallow freshwater lake (ca. 22,000 14C years BP) disappeared during the extremely dry conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18,000 14C years BP). That section is devoid of pollen. The late-glacial lake transgression started around 12,000 14C years BP, peaked in two phases between ca. 11,000 and <9000 14C years BP, and terminated around 8000 14C years BP. Effective moisture increased more than three times compared to modern conditions (∼200 mm precipitation), and a relatively dense terrestrial vegetation was established. Very shallow hypersaline lacustrine conditions prevailed during the mid-Holocene until ca. 3600 14C years BP. However, numerous drying and wetting cycles suggest frequent changes in moisture, maybe even individual storms during the mid-Holocene. After several humid spells, modern conditions were reached at ca. 3000 14C years BP. Comparison between limnogeological data and pollen of terrestrial plants suggest century-scale response lags. Relatively constant concentrations of long-distance transported pollen from lowlands east of the Andes suggest similar atmospheric circulation patterns (mainly tropical summer rainfall) throughout the entire period of time. These findings compare favorably with other regional paleoenvironmental data.","AcknowledgementsThis article is part of the Swiss NSF Projects 20-36382.92, 21-50854.97 and 21-57073.99.

Milne Edwards, 1837) (Decapoda: Anomura: Porcellanidae)","Allopetrolisthes spinifrons has been reported as a commensal crab of sea anemones, sea stars, and gastropods. Previous studies had shown that small crabs (carapace length, CL<4.0 mm) inhabit various hosts, while adults only dwell on sea anemones. This last observation suggests that these commensal crabs may change their host-use pattern during ontogeny. We examined the host-use pattern of A. spinifrons in the field and the host selection behaviour in the laboratory to examine if different hosts are used during ontogeny. Allopetrolisthes spinifrons was found on 77% and 58% of collected sea anemones and sea stars, respectively. On gastropod hosts, frequency of occurrence of A. spinifrons was low (<20%). The occurrence of the association was affected by the size of the host, large hosts being more frequently inhabited by commensal crabs. In general, one or two crabs were observed per host. Usually no more than five crabs were found on a single host, with the exception of one large sea star that hosted a maximum of 12 crabs. The analysis of the host-use pattern demonstrated that all the life stages (including mature crabs) of A. spinifrons inhabit sea anemones while on the remaining hosts only megalopa larvae and small juveniles (crabs<4.3 mm CL) were found. In laboratory experiments, crabs of all sizes preferred sea anemones over limpets (Fissurella spp.).

The Ending of Apartheid and Recent Trends in South African Historiography,"During the 1970s and 1980s a rich seam of revisionist scholarship emerged in South African historiography out of a radical critique of pre-existing discourses. The article traces the emergence of these new approaches with particular reference to the contribution made by Shula Marks. It goes on to consider the challenge faced by this radical historiography in light of the disintegration of the apartheid state, the transition to majority rule and the resulting popular perception that the new South Africa should 'look to the future, not to the past.' It argues, in addition, that radical historiography was facing a challenge in the 1990s from postmodernist and post-colonial critiques of its methodologies and preoccupations, which were striking at its conceptual roots in a variety of ways. The article suggests that new currents and complexities evident in revisionist forms of social history from the mid 1980s, not least in the work of Shula Marks herself, helped to prepare the way for a fertile response to these various challenges. Finally, the article considers the broader issue of history's future as a discrete academic discipline in post-apartheid South Africa.",,,Journal of Southern African Studies,,,,2001-09,2001,,2001-09,27,3,613-625,Closed,Article,"Cobley, Alan","Cobley, Alan ()",,"Cobley, Alan ()",40,0,,66.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040882851,"44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

Using an Input Output matrix for the II region, we calculate the impact on output, income and employment. Later, we compare the impact on the labor market between private and state owned firms, showing that there is a significant difference in the management system of each firm that results in different costs and benefits for regional development. There also are important differences in impacts associated with fly-in fly-out workers from other regions that are partially measured by the multipliers.The analysis shows that the mining sector is not important in terms of the backward and forward linkages within the region, but is very important in terms of its volume of production. The main linkages of the mining sector are with the three sectors with the highest backward and forward linkages; when these linkages are considered along with mining's level of production, mining is by far the most important sector of the Chilean II region. Finally, we survey other impacts on the quality of life of the regional population, describing the actions that have been taken by private and state owned firms, as well as the role of the government in promoting development in the II region.","AcknowledgementsI am indebted to Geoffrey J.D.

It also examines how holistic programmes such as Street Law/Democracy For All can have an impact on the social values of law students, and ultimately the society at large. The article concludes that Street Law/Democracy For All serves as an excellent model for advancing democratic values in education and in society, and deserves the support of the entire legal community.

Implication for recycling of ancient evaporites","Volcanic formations in the central Andes overlie extensive amounts of ancient evaporites of Cenozoic age. Recycling of buried salts in present closed basins through the hydrological cycle is a well-known process. Another salt recycling process through volcanic activity has been detected in a recent eruption of the Lascar volcano in northern Chile. About 109 metric tons of air-fall tephra was deposited over the surrounding closed basins. Leaching experiments were carried out on ashes deposited near the summit and in a lower neighbouring valley. Summit ash leachates are almost pure CaSO4 solutions, whereas the valley ashes leachates are enriched in minor components. Leachates of the summit ash are near-neutral, whereas those of the valley ash have pH as high as 10.5. Sulfur isotope composition of the leached sulfate is consistent with the volcanic recycling of Tertiary gypsum present in the sedimentary section beneath the volcanic cordillera. As a rough estimate, about 700,000tons of easily soluble CaSO4 were added in only three days to the surrounding closed basins. The high pH of the valley ash leachates is due to the hydration of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides formed during pyrolysis of vegetation by hot ash. Efflorescent salts encrusted on plants and dissolution of volcanic glass provided some of the minor components. The almost pure CaSO4 composition of the leach waters is compositionally distinct from any present inflow waters in the central Andes. Addition of CaSO4 may explain some of the differences between the observed brine compositions and those predicted by simulating the evaporation of regular inflows. The recycling of sedimentary gypsum is probably not restricted to Lascar volcano. The recycling of ancient salts, and possibly also the pyrolysis of vegetation, may have been crucial processes in the salt balance of closed basins during the intense volcanic activity of the Tertiary.","AcknowledgementsThis study was done within the framework of a Convention between The Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD, ex Orstom), France and the Universidad Catolica del Norte at Antofagasta, Chile.

Statutes of various universities also allow them to get external aid and donations mainly for capital developments, technical assistance and staff training. In the last decade, there has been pressure on public universities in the region to cut back on their budgets as a result of declining government grants occasioned largely by political and economic structural changes. Universities are responding by putting in place a wide range of programmes to generate their own income to augment the dwindling allocation from national governments.

Particularly in semiarid areas with marginal food, and water resources, changes from humid to arid conditions coincided with major changes in human occupational, and cultural patterns. The end of the first period of human occupation in central Chile coincided with rapidly increasing aridity, when trees were replaced by shrubs and herbs, the Pleistocene paleolakes disappeared, and the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. The Paleo-Indian hunters occupied ecological refuges around lakes, where the resources were concentrated in an environment under general water stress. A similar process was observed 2000 years later in the Atacama Desert, and Altiplano of northern Chile, when the first period of human occupation came to an abrupt end, synchronously with the rapid desiccation of early Holocene paleolakes, and the disappearance of abundant water, vegetation, and animal resources. The subsequent extremely arid mid-Holocene environments resulted in a general hiatus of human occupation in the Atacama basin, whereas widespread resettlement coincided again with a rise of the paleolake levels to the modern levels.",,,,Interhemispheric Climate Linkages,,,2001,2001,,2001,,Boletín del Museo Arqueológico de la Serena141971,105-117,Closed,Chapter,"Núñez, Lautaro; Grosjean, Martin; Cartajena, Isabel","Núñez, Lautaro (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Grosjean, Martin (Department of Physical Geography, University of Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland); Cartajena, Isabel (Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Chile, Ignacio Carera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile)",,"Núñez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North); Grosjean, Martin (University of Bern); Cartajena, Isabel (University of Chile)",30,1,,2.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046387867,37 Earth Sciences; 3702 Climate Change Science; 3705 Geology; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,13 Climate Action
202,pub.1035768298,10.1016/s0254-6299(15)31122-4,,,"Morphology, ontogeny and functional anatomy of the seeds of Colophospermum mopane","Only one seed is carried inside the indehiscent fruit of Colophospermum mopane. Both the seed and fruit constitute the dispersal unit and the seed germinates while still inside the fruit. The mature seed of C. mopane has a thin seed coat that shows little differentiation, similar to the seed coats of typical Leguminous overgrown seeds. The malpighian cells that usually form a mechanical layer of protection are absent and this may be attributed to the seed being enclosed in an indehiscent fruit where the pericarp forms the protective layer. The thin, undifferentiated seed coat may also be an adaptation to low rainfall as it allows for the rapid uptake of water where rainfall occurs in small quantities or is of short duration. The seed originates from a bitegmic ovule. The inner layer of the inner integument persists throughout most of seed development and differentiates into an endothelium. The remainder of the inner integument degenerates completely at the time of fertilisation but the entire outer integument persists and differentiates into the seed coat. The integumentary cells display high mitotic activity in both the anticlinal and periclinal planes throughout seed ontogeny another feature reminiscent of overgrown or neotenous seeds. Up to the 5mm stage of the young seed, the older cell layers towards the outside of the integument are obliterated and resorbed as they are continually being replaced by new cell layers that originate from the inner layers. After the 5mm stage, the cells of the subepidermal layer begin to divide periclinally and anticlinally to keep pace with the inner layers. The senescent cells of the middle layer are then obliterated between the dividing cells of the inner integumentary layers and the subepidermal layers. The number of cell layers remains more or less constant throughout seed ontogeny because the obliteration of the older layers prevents the seed coat from becoming thick and multiplicative. The anticlinal divisions bring about the lateral extension of the seed coat to give rise to an aril that circumvents the seed. Another feature reminiscent of overgrown seeds is the convoluted appearance of the cotyledons which suggests that extensive seed growth is limited by the size of the fruit locule. As a consequence of the convoluted cotyledons the seeds may be regarded as ruminate. Rumination is, however, not only an outcome of seed growth inside the limited space of the fruit locule but also of uneven anticlinal divisions in the endothelium during early stages of embryogenesis. The entire vascular supply of the seed is limited to the aril and no secondary ramifications of vascular traces occur in the remainder of the seed coat. Due to extensive anticlinal divisions of the seed coat the primary vascular bundle is stretched in a lateral plane, causing the xylem strands to separate from the surrounding parenchyma cells, as well as from one another. This causes an air canal to develop in the primary vascular bundle that originates from the funiculus. The lateral extension of the aril also causes the position of cambiai-like meristematic areas that initially surround the primary vascular bundle to shift so that the area occupied by these cells becomes V-shaped or U-shaped. The cambial-like meristematic areas give rise to secondary vascular bundles. The micropyle is small and occluded with a dark staining substance that makes it impermeable to water. The integuments as well as the mature seed coat contain high concentrations of tanniniferous substances. The large seed size of the xerophytic C. mopane may be explained by its common origin from the ancestors of Guibourtia and Copaifera that occurred in high rainfall zones.",,,South African Journal of Botany,,,,2001-07,2001,,2001-07,67,2,214-229,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Jordaan, A.; Wessels, D.C.J.; Kruger, H.","Jordaan, A.

I begin by demonstrating the relevance of this question to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and I draw attention to André du Toit’s long-standing interest in ways in which truth commissions may function to consolidate political change. In the second section of the article, I argue that truth commissions should be regarded as a defensible moral compromise between the values of justice and social unity, and I criticize claims that truth commissions promote transitional justice, when that is understood as a distinctive conception of justice that emerges in circumstances of regime transition. In the third section, I criticize the claim that truth commissions are not a moral compromise at all but embody a superior, restorative conception of justice. I conclude by showing why retribution is required by criminal justice, and why truth commissions must be seen, not as an end in themselves, but as institutions whose function is to emphasize the importance of the rule of law, normal criminal justice, and legal recognition.",,,South African Journal of Philosophy,,,,2001-01,2001,2013-10-28,2001-01,20,1,22-41,Closed,Article,"Allen, Jonathan","Allen, Jonathan ()","Allen, Jonathan ()","Allen, Jonathan ()",5,0,,2.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033593311,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5003 Philosophy,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The transition not only symbolised the end of a protracted struggle against apartheid but also ushered in a new era of the reconstruction of state and society. My intention in this paper is to analyse the reconstruction of the post-apartheid state in South Africa against the backdrop of the post-colonial state in Africa. The paper focuses on territorial restructuring and nation-building as some of the main challenges facing the new polity. Such challenges, I argue, are not unique to South Africa, but are a familiar feature of the post-colony on the continent. However, South Africa faces those challenges against a pessimistic record of its counterparts in Africa, and under different circumstances. Notwithstanding that pessimism, the question that is central to the analysis presented here is how South Africa has responded to challenges of territorial restructuring and nation-building.","AcknowledgementsI would like to thank David Slater and the three anonymous referees for their critically constructive comments on this paper.

Then follows detailed examinations of private‐sector HE in countries representative of all these geographical areas to determine how far privatisation has stimulated diversity. The preliminary results indicate that in each case the private sub‐sector has promoted limited and partial diversification. In general, though, the more recent private establishments, created to satisfy increasing demand for HE, have nonetheless focused predominately on teaching, have undertaken little, or no, research and appear to be of lower quality than the older institutions. The private sub‐sector is characterised mostly by its low‐risk behaviour, and a concentration on low‐cost and/or safer initiatives.

Geochemical and isotopic data indicate that recycling of the Early Paleozoic metamorphic basement was the predominant process in the formation of felsic magmas in the Central Andes from the Odovician to late Paleozoic. The metamorphic basement, in turn, is derived in part from older intrusions and sedimentary rocks of Eocambrian age. Compositional characteristics of Ordovician and late Paleozoic sediments reflect the erosion of this crust. Mafic metamorphic and igneous rocks do not contribute significantly to the Paleozoic crust. The Paleozoic crust is mainly felsic in composition, which is supported by evidence from lower crustal xenoliths and limited exposures of lower crust. The crust consolidated in the Paleozoic remained largely intact until the formation of the overthickened Andean crust in the Cenozoic. The dominance of the Paleozoic crust in the crust of the present high plateaus of the central Andes is seen in the geochemical and isotopic signatures of the Cenozoic ignimbrite and andesite. Thermodynamic calculation of the stable mineral assemblages from the average bulk composition derived from our compilation indicate that the volumetrically most important minerals are quartz and feldspars under all reasonable P–T conditions expected for the thickened Andean crust. The resulting density–depth model is in accordance with geophysical observations of the velocity–density distribution at 21°–24°S. Radiogenic heat production is estimated from the average U–Th–K concentrations in the Paleozoic metamorphic and granitic rocks that are very similar to average values of the upper crust.","Various institutions and individuals contributed to this study.

While politico-constitutional intelligence was gathered by the National Intelligence Service to support constitutional efforts to achieve a settlement of the conflict and bring about a new political dispensation in South Africa, the apartheid government relied on the covert operational capabilities of the security forces (especially the Security Branch) to not only halt the ‘Revolutionary Onslaught’ of the liberation movements, but to eliminate them as a viable political and revolutionary force.

The level of conventional water resources utilization in the country is very high and new approaches are necessary to stretch the limited water supplies available to meet projected demands for water. Significant research into new technologies and sources of supply has been carried out in South Africa and abroad during the past few decades. This has resulted in the development and evaluation of a number of innovative concepts and methodologies, as well as novel adaptations to existing approaches. These concepts and methodologies include: integration of surface water transfers into a national water grid, transfers of untapped surface water resources from countries located to the north of South Africa, exploitation of deep groundwater and the use of aquifers for storage of surplus water, atmospheric water (fog and cloud) harvesting, iceberg water utilization, desalination and direct use of sea water. Some of these options are still theoretical and unproven, while others have reached different stages of practical testing and implementation. Information on these alternatives for water supply is widely scattered over many different sources. This paper reviews the available information and examines some of these unconventional sources and options for future water supply in terms of their technical aspects, potential applications, likely impacts, approximate costs, and regional relevance in terms of alleviating predicted water shortages.",,,Water International,,,,2001-09,2001,,2001-09,26,3,314-334,Closed,Article,"Smakhtin, Vladimir; Ashton, Peter; Batchelor, Allan; Meyer, Reinhard; Murray, Eric; Barta, Bohuslav; Bauer, Norbert; Naidoo, Dhesigen; Olivier, Jana; Terblanche, Deon","Smakhtin, Vladimir (IWRA); Ashton, Peter (Division of Water, Environment and Forestry Technology (CSIR: Environmentek), Pretoria, South Africa); Batchelor, Allan (Division of Water, Environment and Forestry Technology (CSIR: Environmentek), Pretoria, South Africa); Meyer, Reinhard (Division of Water, Environment and Forestry Technology (CSIR: Environmentek), Pretoria, South Africa); Murray, Eric (Division of Water, Environment and Forestry Technology (CSIR: Environmentek), Pretoria, South Africa); Barta, Bohuslav (IWRA, University of Witwatersrand, Sandton, South Africa); Bauer, Norbert (Institute for Environmental Affairs, Munich, Germany); Naidoo, Dhesigen (Department of Water and Forestry Affairs, Pretoria, South Africa); Olivier, Jana (University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa); Terblanche, Deon (South African Weather Bureau (METSYS), Bethlehem, South Africa)",,"Smakhtin, Vladimir (IWRA); Ashton, Peter (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research); Batchelor, Allan (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research); Meyer, Reinhard (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research); Murray, Eric (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research); Barta, Bohuslav (University of the Witwatersrand); Bauer, Norbert (Institute for Environmental Affairs, Munich, Germany); Naidoo, Dhesigen (Department of Water and Forestry Affairs, Pretoria, South Africa); Olivier, Jana (University of South Africa); Terblanche, Deon (South African Weather Bureau (METSYS), Bethlehem, South Africa)",33,3,,6.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038873445,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

Conflicts between the needs of the region's nations and diminishing revenues and environmental quality have induced awareness of coastal ecological problems and motivated financial support for restoration and management. The volume provides a competent review on the structure, processes and function of 22 important Latin American coastal marine ecosystems. Each contribution describes the environmental settings, biotic components and structure of the system, considers trophic processes and energy flow, evaluates the modifying influence of natural and human perturbations, and suggests management needs. Although the focus of the book is on basic ecological research, the results have application for coastal managers.",,,Ecological Studies,,"Ulrich Seeliger, Björn Kjerfve",,2001,2001,,2001,144,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,96,17,,14.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019472740,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management,14 Life Below Water

90,pub.1102359873,10.2139/ssrn.1754544,,,Study of the Incidence and Nature of Chronic Poverty and Development Policy in South Africa: An Overview,"The purpose of this study is fourfold: first, to summarise the current state of knowledge about chronic poverty in South Africa; second, to describe the range of existing governmental and civil society initiatives which address chronic poverty; third, to identify challenges to addressing chronic poverty in South Africa; and fourth, to identify themes for further research. The introduction to the paper is followed by a brief survey of the historical background, current economic context and poverty profile of South Africa. The paper then presents a quantitative and qualitative picture of South Africa's chronically poor. To date, there has been only one data set collected in South Africa allowing an inter-temporal comparison among the same households. This is the KwaZulu-Natal Income Dynamics Study (KIDS), covering one of the provinces rather than the whole country. Because this data set and the analyses based upon it are unique, we discuss them at length. The KIDS data suggest that at least half of households that are poor are chronically poor; that 'ultra-poverty' is not synonymous with chronic poverty; and the there is a large degree of employment volatility experienced by households. The KIDS-based studies as well as other poverty analyses allow identification of groups especially likely to be chronically poor. These include rural households, women-headed households, households effectively headed by elderly people, and former (retrenched) farm workers. Over the next 10 years, however, AIDS orphans and households directly affected by AIDS, will likely figure as the most prominent category of people mired in chronic poverty. The paper goes on to survey the variety of anti-poverty measures of government and civil society. Measured by expenditure, the government's social security system is by far the largest anti-poverty instrument in the country, and probably one of the more functional. The paper suggests that a number of challenges face government and civil society to address poverty in general and chronic poverty in particular. Among these are: first, the absence of a coherent anti-poverty strategy, and particularly one that takes into account the distinction between chronic poverty and transitory poverty; second, the bleak prospects for growth in formal sector employment over the medium terms, together with general uncertainty about how to improve support to the SMME sector; and third, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the effects of which will likely be far more apparent in the next 15 years than to date. The paper concludes with suggested priority areas for further research.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2001,2001,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Aliber, Michael Alexander","Aliber, Michael Alexander (Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa (HSRC))",,"Aliber, Michael Alexander (Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa (HSRC))",59,0,,30.0,https://repository.uwc.ac.za:443/xmlui/bitstream/10566/4451/1/cpdp_1_incidence_nature_chronic_poverty_development_policy_south_africa.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102359873,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,1 No Poverty

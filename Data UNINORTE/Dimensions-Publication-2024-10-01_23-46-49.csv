A robust understanding of angiosperm evolution is required to explain their rise to ecological dominance. So far, the angiosperm tree of life has been determined primarily by means of analyses of the plastid genome3,4. Many studies have drawn on this foundational work, such as classification and first insights into angiosperm diversification since their Mesozoic origins5–7. However, the limited and biased sampling of both taxa and genomes undermines confidence in the tree and its implications. Here, we build the tree of life for almost 8,000 (about 60%) angiosperm genera using a standardized set of 353 nuclear genes8. This 15-fold increase in genus-level sampling relative to comparable nuclear studies9 provides a critical test of earlier results and brings notable change to key groups, especially in rosids, while substantiating many previously predicted relationships. Scaling this tree to time using 200 fossils, we discovered that early angiosperm evolution was characterized by high gene tree conflict and explosive diversification, giving rise to more than 80% of extant angiosperm orders. Steady diversification ensued through the remaining Mesozoic Era until rates resurged in the Cenozoic Era, concurrent with decreasing global temperatures and tightly linked with gene tree conflict. Taken together, our extensive sampling combined with advanced phylogenomic methods shows the deep history and full complexity in the evolution of a megadiverse clade.","The PAFTOL project was funded by grants from the Calleva Foundation to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

It underpins established practical applications as well as current frontier research, ranging from magnetic-memory technology3–7 to topological quantum matter8–14. Traditionally, LKSD has been considered to originate from two possible internal symmetry-breaking mechanisms. The first refers to time-reversal symmetry breaking by magnetization of ferromagnets and tends to be strong because of the non-relativistic exchange origin15. The second applies to crystals with broken inversion symmetry and tends to be comparatively weaker, as it originates from the relativistic spin–orbit coupling (SOC)16–19. A recent theory work based on spin-symmetry classification has identified an unconventional magnetic phase, dubbed altermagnetic20,21, that allows for LKSD without net magnetization and inversion-symmetry breaking. Here we provide the confirmation using photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. We identify two distinct unconventional mechanisms of LKSD generated by the altermagnetic phase of centrosymmetric MnTe with vanishing net magnetization20–23. Our observation of the altermagnetic LKSD can have broad consequences in magnetism. It motivates exploration and exploitation of the unconventional nature of this magnetic phase in an extended family of materials, ranging from insulators and semiconductors to metals and superconductors20,21, that have been either identified recently or perceived for many decades as conventional antiferromagnets21,24,25.","We acknowledge fruitful discussions with K.

116,pub.1166302386,10.1051/0004-6361/202347897,,,The SOPHIE search for northern extrasolar planets,"Transiting planets with orbital periods longer than 40 d are extremely rare among the 5000+ planets discovered so far. The lack of discoveries of this population poses a challenge to research into planetary demographics, formation, and evolution. Here, we present the detection and characterization of HD 88986 b, a potentially transiting sub-Neptune, possessing the longest orbital period among known transiting small planets (<4 R ⊕ ) with a precise mass measurement ( σ  M  /M > 25%). Additionally, we identified the presence of a massive companion in a wider orbit around HD 88986. To validate this discovery, we used a combination of more than 25 yr of extensive radial velocity (RV) measurements (441 SOPHIE data points, 31 ELODIE data points, and 34 HIRES data points), Gaia DR3 data, 21 yr of photometric observations with the automatic photoelectric telescope (APT), two sectors of TESS data, and a 7-day observation of CHEOPS. Our analysis reveals that HD 88986 b, based on two potential single transits on sector 21 and sector 48 which are both consistent with the predicted transit time from the RV model, is potentially transiting. The joint analysis of RV and photometric data show that HD 88986 b has a radius of 2.49 ± 0.18 R ⊕ , a mass of 17.2 −3.8 +4.0 M ⊕ , and it orbits every 146.05 −0.40 +0.43 d around a subgiant HD 88986 which is one of the closest and brightest exoplanet host stars (G2Vtype, R = 1.543 ± 0.065 R ⊙ , V = 6.47 ± 0.01 mag, distance = 33.37 ± 0.04 pc). The nature of the outer, massive companion is still to be confirmed; a joint analysis of RVs, H IPPARCOS , and Gaia astrometric data shows that with a 3 σ confidence interval, its semi-major axis is between 16.7 and 38.8 au and its mass is between 68 and 284 M Jup . HD 88986 b’s wide orbit suggests the planet did not undergo significant mass loss due to extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star. Therefore, it probably maintained its primordial composition, allowing us to probe its formation scenario. Furthermore, the cold nature of HD 88986 b (460 ± 8 K), thanks to its long orbital period, will open up exciting opportunities for future studies of cold atmosphere composition characterization. Moreover, the existence of a massive companion alongside HD 88986 b makes this system an interesting case study for understanding planetary formation and evolution.","We warmly thank the OHP staff for their support on the observations.

In particular, considering a short transition from the matter contracting phase to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, we find naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales which can collapse and form primordial black holes. Interestingly, the primordial black hole masses that we find can lie within the observationally unconstrained asteroid-mass window, potentially explaining the totality of dark matter. Remarkably, the enhanced curvature perturbations, collapsing to primordial black holes, can induce as well a stochastic gravitational-wave background, being potentially detectable by future experiments, in particular by SKA, PTAs, LISA and ET, hence serving as a new portal to probe the bouncing nature of the initial conditions prevailing in the early Universe.",,,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,,,,2024-06-01,2024,2024-06-26,2024-06-01,2024,06,066,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Papanikolaou, Theodoros; Banerjee, Shreya; Cai, Yi-Fu; Capozziello, Salvatore; Saridakis, Emmanuel N.","Papanikolaou, Theodoros (Scuola Superiore Meridionale, Largo San Marcellino 10, 80138 Napoli, Italy; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Sezione di Napoli, Via Cinthia 21, 80126 Napoli, Italy; National Observatory of Athens, Lofos Nymfon, 11852 Athens, Greece); Banerjee, Shreya (Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, Jharkhand-826004, India); Cai, Yi-Fu (Department of Astronomy, School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China; CAS Key Laboratory for Researches in Galaxies and Cosmology, School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China; Deep Space Exploration Laboratory, Hefei 230088, China); Capozziello, Salvatore (Scuola Superiore Meridionale, Largo San Marcellino 10, 80138 Napoli, Italy; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Sezione di Napoli, Via Cinthia 21, 80126 Napoli, Italy; Dipartimento di Fisica “Ettore Pancini”, Complesso Universitario di Monte S.

Such changes, in principle, may affect the field equations that arise through the semiclassical variation procedure of gravitational actions. Although in the case of Einstein-Hilbert action the presence of microscopic wormholes does not lead to any nontrivial result, when the Gauss-Bonnet term is added in the gravitational action, the above effective topological variation procedure induces an effective cosmological constant that depends on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the wormhole density. Since the latter in a dynamical spacetime is in general time-dependent, one obtains an effective dark energy sector of topological origin.",The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the COST Action CA21136 “Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics (CosmoVerse)”.

This study used a global survey to analyze SAIDs in susceptible individuals' post-vaccination.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among participants with self-reported new-onset SAIDs using the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) 2 study dataset-a validated, patient-reported e-survey-to analyze the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Baseline characteristics of patients with new-onset SAIDs and vaccinated healthy controls (HCs) were compared after propensity score matching based on age and sex in a 1:4 ratio.
RESULTS: Of 16 750 individuals, 74 (median age 52 years, 79.9% females, and 76.7% Caucasians) had new-onset SAID post-vaccination, mainly idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) (n = 23, 31.51%), arthritis (n = 15; 20.53%), and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (n = 12, 16.40%). Higher odds of new-onset SAIDs were noted among Caucasians (OR = 5.3; 95% CI = 2.9-9.7; p < .001) and Moderna vaccine recipients (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.3-5.3; p = .004). New-onset SAIDs were associated with AID multimorbidity (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-1.7; p < .001), mental health disorders (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.3-1.9; p < .001), and mixed race (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-4.2; p = .010), where those aged >60 years (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-0.8; p = .007) and from high/medium human development index (HDI) countries (compared to very high HDI) reported fewer events than HCs.
CONCLUSION: This study reports a low occurrence of new-onset SAIDs following COVID-19 vaccination, primarily IIMs, PMR, and inflammatory arthritis. Identified risk factors included pre-existing AID multimorbidity, mental health diseases, and mixed race. Revaccination was well tolerated by most patients; therefore, we recommend continuing COVID-19 vaccination in the general population. However, long-term studies are needed to understand the autoimmune phenomena arising post-vaccination.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

182,pub.1169735019,10.1007/s12665-024-11445-0,,,Contamination of urban soils in a historical mining town of northern Chile,"In northern Chile, economic activities related to mining and thermoelectric energy have existed in the city of Tocopilla since the early 1900s and metal concentrations in soils have likely been altered by historic anthropogenic activities. To assess the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Co, and Cr in urban soils of Tocopilla, a total of 70 superficial (2 cm) and 70 deep (20 cm) soil samples were collected in 2014. Furthermore, to analyze concentration changes in soils over time, 18 superficial (5 cm) samples were collected in 2020–2021. A numerical evaluation (geoaccumulation index, and enrichment factor), principal component analysis, and spatial distribution approach were applied to infer geogenic and anthropogenic influence on the concentrations of these elements. The main conclusions of this research indicate that urban soils of Tocopilla contain geogenic Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Co and Cr. However, elevated concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Pb cannot be attributed to a geogenic origin alone, as a proportion of their enrichment is considered to be anthropogenically sourced. The contamination of anthropogenic elements has been found to be related to historic copper mining and thermoelectric energy production. Furthermore, when compared to other sites globally, median concentrations of Cu (945 mg/kg in 2014 and 823 mg/kg in 2020) and Zn (305 mg/kg in 2014 and 196 mg/kg in 2020) in superficial urban soils are among the highest worldwide. Regarding 2020–2021 sampling, Zn and Pb concentrations have increased, while Cu, Cr, Co, and Ni have remained similar to the 2014 samples.","This study was partly funded by the National Agency of Research and Development (ANID) of Chile through the Fondecyt Regular grant 1200390 and by an internal grant from Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico of Universidad Católica del Norte (Fondo para el desarrollo en investigación científica y tecnológica de actividades de titulación de pregrado y postgrado, 2022).

The volume explores how early rock art research’s Eurocentric biases have shifted with broadened global horizons to facilitate new conversations and discourses in new post-colonial realities. The book uses seven main themes to explore theoretical, methodological, ethical, and practical developments that are orienting the study of Pleistocene and Holocene arts in the age of globalization. Compiling studies as diverse as genetics, visualization, with the proliferation of increasingly sophisticated archaeological techniques, means that vast quantities of materials and techniques are now incorporated into the analysis of the world’s visual cultures. Deep-Time Images in the Age of Globalization aims to promote critical reflection on the multitude of positive – and negative – impacts that globalization has wrought in rock art research. The volume brings new theoretical frameworks as well as engagement with indigenous knowledge and perspectives from art history. It highlights technical, methodological and interpretive developments, and showcases rock art characteristics from previously unknown (in the global north) geographic areas. This book provides comparative approaches on rock art globally and scrutinises the impacts of globalization on research, preservation, and management of deep-time art. This book will appeal to archaeologists, social scientists and art historians working in the field as well as lovers of rock art.",,,Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology,,"Oscar Moro Abadía, Margaret W.

This was not an easy win. Feminist activists and women politicians pushed for gender parity in 2020-21 in a country that had adopted gender quotas relatively late (Figueroa 2021; Reyes-Housholder, Suárez-Cao, and Le Foulon 2023; Suárez-Cao 2023; personal interview #1, April 21, 2023). Reserving seats for Indigenous groups and using other mechanisms to allow space for independent constituents further broadened the convention’s ostensible inclusiveness. After the September 2022 rejection of the 2021–22 Constitutional Convention’s draft, political parties immediately started over by crafting an elite-controlled process. Lawmakers—this time with surprising speed—again coalesced around the idea that an equal number of men and women should write the new draft.",We thank the Center for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies for financial support through grant ANID/FONDAP/15130009.

184,pub.1173718314,10.1101/2024.07.10.602499,,,Global genomics of the man-o’-war (Physalia) reveals biodiversity at the ocean surface,"Abstract  The open ocean is a vast, highly connected environment, and the organisms found there have been hypothesized to represent massive, well-mixed populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o’-war ( Physalia ) is uniquely suited to dispersal, sailing the ocean surface with a muscular crest. We tested the hypothesis of a single, panmictic Physalia population by sequencing 133 genomes, and found five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence showing strong reproductive isolation despite range overlap. We then scored thousands of citizen-science photos and identified four recognizable morphologies linked to these lineages. Within lineages, we detected regionally endemic subpopulations, connected by winds and currents, and identified individual long-distance dispersal events. We find that, even in these sailing species, genetic variation is highly partitioned geographically across the open ocean.   Summary  The open ocean is a vast and highly connected environment. The organisms that live there have a significant capacity for dispersal and few geographic boundaries to separate populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o’-war or bluebottle (genus Physalia ) is uniquely suited to long-distance travel, using its gas-filled float and muscular crest to catch the wind and sail the sea surface. Physalia are distributed across the globe, and like many pelagic organisms, have been hypothesized to represent a massive, well-mixed population that extends across ocean basins. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing whole genomes of 133 samples collected from waters of over a dozen countries around the globe. Our results revealed five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence indicating strong reproductive isolation, despite regions of range overlap. We combined these data with an independent dataset of thousands of images of Physalia uploaded to the citizen-science website inaturalist.org, which we scored for morphological characters including sail size, tentacle arrangement, and color. From these images, we identified four recognizable morphologies, described their geographical distribution, and linked them to four of the lineages identified with genomic data. We conclude there are at least four species, three of which correspond to species proposed by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries: P. physalis , P utriculus , and P. megalista , along with one as yet unnamed species Physalia sp. from the Tasman Sea. Within each species, we observe significant population structure, with evidence of persistent subpopulations at a regional scale, as well as evidence for individual long-distance dispersal events. Our findings indicate that, instead of one well-mixed, cosmopolitan species, there are in fact multiple Physalia species with distinct but overlapping ranges, each made up of regionally endemic subpopulations that are connected by major ocean currents and wind patterns.","We thank Adachi Aya, Stephen Chiswell, Lynne Christianson, Gary Cobb, Andy Coetzee, Joey DiBatista, Steve Dunn, Leanne Elder, Jose Fernández-Simón, Luke Finley, Steve Gerber, Rosemary Hill, Kazuhisa Hori, Takato Izumi, Michiyo Kawabata, Itaru Kobayashi, Hisanori Kohtsuka, Izumi Komori, Hiromi Kurihara, Yukio Kurihara, Nate Lo, Juan Moles, Kirrily Moore, Natasha Picciani, Nicola Puharich, Fae Spafford, John Stimson, Hiroyuki Tachikawa, Nikolai Tatarnic, Yi-Kai Tea, Kosuke Uchiwa, Diego Vazquez Alcaide, Kensuke Yanagi, the Miura Fisher Cooperative Association, and the East Matunuck State Beach lifeguards for additional support in collecting specimens.

At COP26, the governments of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador committed to the expansion of existing MPAs to create a new Mega MPA, safeguarding the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor. It offers a profound step forward in conservation efforts but is not specifically designed to protect against the more diffuse anthropogenic threats, such as plastic pollution. We combine published data with our own unpublished records to assess the abundance and distribution of plastic pollution in the region. Macro- and microplastic concentrations varied markedly and were not significantly different when comparing areas inside and outside existing MPA boundaries. These findings highlight the diffuse and complex nature of plastic pollution and its ubiquitous presence across MPA boundaries. Understanding the sources and drivers of plastic pollution in the region is key to developing effective solutions.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We studied the association of RCD with genetic variants in AD.
METHODS: RCD was evaluated in 62 familial AD (FAD) and 53 sporadic AD (SAD) cases, and analyzed by whole-exome sequencing for association with common exonic functional variants. Findings were validated in post mortem brain tissue.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two gene variants in FAD, and 227 gene variants in SAD associated with RCD. In FAD, performance decline of the immediate recall of the Rey-Osterrieth figure test associated with 122 genetic variants. Olfactory receptor OR51B6 showed the highest number of associated variants. Its expression was detected in temporal cortex neurons.
DISCUSSION: Impaired olfactory function has been associated with cognitive impairment in AD. Genetic variants in these or other genes could help to identify risk of faster memory decline in FAD and SAD patients.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors express their highest appreciation to the patients and relatives enrolled in this study for more than 30 years.

Dyspnea, chest pain, and shock are conditions susceptible to evaluation with ultrasound considering diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact already proven. There is scarce evidence in diagnosis agreement using ultrasound as an extension of physical examination. We aimed to evaluate ED patients in whom POCUS was performed, to analyze agreement between clinical initial diagnosis using ultrasound images and final diagnosis. Furthermore, we analyze failed diagnosis, inconclusive POCUS exams, and discuss details. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on adults who visited the emergency department with any of these three chief complaints: dyspnea, chest pain, and shock. All were evaluated with ultrasound at admission. Agreement between initial diagnosis using POCUS and final definite diagnosis was calculated. Failed diagnosis and inconclusive exams were analyzed. A total of 209 patients were analyzed. Populations: mostly males, mean age 64 years old, hypertensive. Agreement on patients with dyspnea and suspicion of acute decompensated heart failure was 0.98; agreement on chest pain suspicion of non-ST acute coronary syndrome was 0.96; agreement on type of shock was 0.90. Among the population, 12 patients had an inconclusive POCUS exam, and 16 patients had a failed diagnosis. The use of POCUS in the emergency department shows almost perfect agreement when compared with the final diagnosis in individuals experiencing acutely decompensated heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and shock. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the impact of this tool on mortality and prognosis when there are diagnostic errors.",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Internal and Emergency Medicine,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Point-of-Care Systems; Heart Failure; Ultrasonography; Aged; Shock; Emergency Service, Hospital; Dyspnea; Chest Pain",2024-06-12,2024,2024-06-12,2024-09,19,6,1585-1592,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Núñez-Ramos, José Atilio; Duarte-Misol, Dagoberto; Petro, María Andrea Burgos; Pérez, Keren Jemima Sarmiento; Echeverry, Vanessa Paola Gutiérrez; Malagón, Sergio Velasco","Núñez-Ramos, José Atilio (Health Science Division, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Emergency Department, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Duarte-Misol, Dagoberto (Emergency Department, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Petro, María Andrea Burgos (Emergency Department, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Pérez, Keren Jemima Sarmiento (Emergency Department, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Echeverry, Vanessa Paola Gutiérrez (Emergency Department, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Soledad, Colombia); Malagón, Sergio Velasco (Department of Internal Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Grupo de Interés en Ultrasonido Enfocado UN-HUN., Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Internal Medicine, Clínica Nueva El Lago, Bogotá, Colombia)","Núñez-Ramos, José Atilio (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)","Núñez-Ramos, José Atilio (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte); Duarte-Misol, Dagoberto (Universidad del Norte); Petro, María Andrea Burgos (Universidad del Norte); Pérez, Keren Jemima Sarmiento (Universidad del Norte); Echeverry, Vanessa Paola Gutiérrez (Universidad del Norte); Malagón, Sergio Velasco (National University of Colombia; Grupo de Interés en Ultrasonido Enfocado UN-HUN., Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Internal Medicine, Clínica Nueva El Lago, Bogotá, Colombia)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11739-024-03639-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172785222,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Here, we provide a comprehensive study aiming to analyze the association between climate and cranial variation of high latitude populations living in temperate to cold environments of Asia, North America, and South America. For this, we compiled a large morphometric dataset (N = 2633), which was combined with climatic and genomic data. We tested the influence of climate on the facial skeleton, nasal protrusion, and cranial vault and through multiple statistical tests at two geographical scales: intracontinental and intercontinental. We show that populations living in cold areas share a morphological pattern characterized by an increase in nasal height, facial and orbital heights and widths, a decrease in facial protrusion, and larger, longer, and lower cranial vaults. There are also distinctive features; populations from north Asia present the tallest noses, largest faces, and cranial vaults of the whole sample. Nasal breadth dimensions show small values in Asians, large values in South Americans, and non-significant changes in arctic North America. The morphological pattern in populations living at high latitude may be the result of parallel adaptation, as supported by physiological, morphometric, ecological, and genetic explanations, while the differences in magnitude and phenotypic expression could be due to the diverse population histories, severity of climate, and cultural strategies. Overall, our study shows that climate is a relevant factor shaping modern human morphology and it should be considered when studying modern human evolution and diversification.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This project was developed thanks to a visiting fellowship and a postdoc fellowship provided by the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research (KLI, Klosterneuburg, Austria), granted to A.E. and L.P.M.

NGTS-26 b orbits around a G6-type main sequence star every 4.52 days. It has a mass of 0.29 -0.06 +0.07 M Jup and a radius of 1.33 -0.05 +0.06 R Jup making it a Saturn-mass planet with a highly inflated radius. NGTS-27 b orbits around a slightly evolved G3-type star every 3.37 days. It has a mass of 0.59 -0.07 +0.10 M Jup and a radius of 1.40±0.04 R Jup , making it a relatively standard hot Jupiter. The transits of these two planetary systems were re-observed and confirmed in photometry by the SAAO 1.0-m telescope, 1.2-m Euler Swiss telescope as well as the TESS spacecraft, and their masses were derived spectroscopically by the CORALIE, FEROS and HARPS spectrographs. Both giant exoplanets are highly irradiated by their host stars and present an anomalously inflated radius, especially NGTS-26 b which is one of the largest objects among peers of similar mass.","This study is based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programmes 099.C-0303, 0103.C-0719, 0104.C-0588 and 0103.A-9004.

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 vaccination in autoimmune diseases (COVAD) study, a series of ongoing, patient self-reported surveys were conceived with the vision of being a unique tool to gather patient perspectives on AIRDs. It involved a multinational, multicenter collaborative effort amidst a global lockdown.
METHODS: Leveraging social media as a research tool, COVAD collected data using validated patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The study, comprising a core team, steering committee, and global collaborators, facilitated data collection and analysis. A pilot-tested, validated survey, featuring questions regarding COVID-19 infection, vaccination and outcomes, patient demographics, and PROs was circulated to patients with AIRDs and healthy controls (HCs).
DISCUSSION: We present the challenges encountered during this international collaborative project, including coordination, data management, funding constraints, language barriers, and authorship concerns, while highlighting the measures taken to address them.
CONCLUSION: Collaborative virtual models offer a dynamic new frontier in medical research and are vital to studying rare diseases. The COVAD study demonstrates the potential of online platforms for conducting large-scale, patient-focused research and underscores the importance of integrating patient perspective into clinical care. Care of patients is our central motivation, and it is essential to recognize their voices as equal stakeholders and valued partners in the study of the conditions that affect them.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thanks all the patient support groups for their support.

1511,pub.1169396097,10.1016/j.spc.2024.03.006,,,Advancing circular bioeconomy: A critical review and assessment of indicators,"The concept of the circular bioeconomy is fundamental in merging the circular economy and bioeconomy principles to advance sustainable resource management and economic growth. This concept addresses critical global challenges, including climate change and resource depletion, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Despite its potential, the application of circular bioeconomy in bio-based products faces obstacles, notably the absence of comprehensive frameworks and an understanding of relevant indicators. This study aims to fill these gaps by analyzing circular bioeconomy indicators through a systematic literature review, followed by an evaluation based on criteria such as alignment with circular economy principles, quantitative precision, the scope of application, ease of data collection, integration with sustainability goals, holistic lifecycle view, adaptability to different end-of-life strategies, multidimensionality, scalability, ease of interpretation and, integration with other tools. The main findings reveal the significant impact of these indicators on sustainable and circular production patterns, detailing their benefits, limitations, and integration into broader sustainability strategies. This study proposes categorizing these indicators to help stakeholders in circular bioeconomy projects and outlines a future research agenda focused on enhancing the application of circular bioeconomy indicators across diverse contexts and life cycle stages. This work underscores the need to select tailored sustainability indicators and combine them to generate a specific set of indicators to foster a more integrated approach to sustainability assessment.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The last international consensus guidelines on the management of CMV in SOT were published in 2018, highlighting the need for revision to incorporate recent advances, notably in cell-mediated immunity monitoring, which could alter the current standard of care. A working group including members from the Group for the Study of Infection in Transplantation and the Immunocompromised Host (GESITRA-IC) of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) and the Spanish Society of Transplantation (SET), developed consensus-based recommendations for managing CMV infection in SOT recipients. Recommendations were classified based on evidence strength and quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The final recommendations were endorsed through a consensus meeting and approved by the expert panel.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Julian Torre-Cisneros reports administrative support, article publishing charges, travel, and writing assistance were provided by Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology.

The oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5, a promising health exposure metric, was assessed in five Colombian cities using the synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid assay that tracks the depletions of glutathione and ascorbate. For this, a set of 91 integrated 2-week ambient PM2.5 samples were collected using Ultrasonic Personal Aerosol Samplers (UPAS) at background (5), traffic (37), industrial (12) and residential (37) sites. Across all site types, mean PM2.5 mass concentration was 20.20 ± 9.36 µg m− 3. The oxidative potential (OPAA for ascorbate and OPGSH for glutathione) varied widely across cities with an average of 2.67 ± 1.27 for AA and 2.93 ± 1.22 % depletion m− 3 for GSH. OP metrics among cities were not correlated with PM2.5 mass concentrations. Overall, industrial sites showed higher PM2.5 mass concentrations and OPAA. In contrast, OPGSH was not found to differ among industrial, traffic, or residential sites, but was lower for background sites. Our findings provide substantial evidence of variations in PM2.5 OP between cities and within the cities. Further research is needed to assess the association between OP and adverse health effects, as well as to attribute the sources that cause such variations.","The opinions, findings, ideas, and conclusions expressed in this publication are of personal responsibility and do not commit the institutions to which authors are affiliated or those of the supporting agencies.","This work was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology -MINCIENCIAS Grant No. 905–2019, and Grant No. 874 of 2020.

It relies on a combination of archival evidence (audio and documentary sources) from both countries, and interviews conducted with the broadcasters and other media workers of both Radio Freedom and the Zambian national broadcaster. The article argues that Zambia offered immense support to Radio Freedom in the form of broadcasting equipment, working space and airtime on the external services of the national broadcaster. While it waxed and waned in the early years, this assistance increased considerably in the aftermath of the Soweto student uprising of 1976, which enabled the ANC to have a sonic presence among its supporters back home, where listening to this radio was illegal. The support given to Radio Freedom was not isolated but part of a wider struggle and solidarity with the liberation movements in the Southern African region fighting white minority rule. Through Radio Freedom, the ANC was able to shape the course of the unfolding struggle and internal political developments and to attain the cultural hegemony of the Charterist tradition over the Africanist and Black Consciousness camp.","This article is based on research funded by the National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS). We acknowledge Kalumbu Lumpa, a Zambian journalist who played a critical role in introducing the researchers to some of the former broadcasters of Radio Zambia International, and to the archivists at the Zambia News and Information Services, the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation archives, as well as the National Archives of Zambia. Dr Mosoabuli Ike Maamoe and Sinazo Mtshemla at the National Heritage and Cultural Studies Centre were very helpful in making available the materials on Radio Freedom.

Previous literature on psychosocial intervention has used network analysis techniques to examine: (a) the interaction between participants, (b) the facilitators' link to the intervention target group, (c) the transfer of knowledge between experts and facilitators, and (d) the interaction of facilitators with each other. However, there has been little research on how facilitators connect with other figures in their organisational context, impacting both intervention fidelity and the fit of the programme to the local context. In this study we combine the analysis of personal networks with qualitative interviews with 102 teachers in 72 schools in Barranquilla (Colombia), with whom we describe the implementation of the psychoeducational programmes Pisotón and Metodologías Flexibles. The results show that programme implementation networks not only rely on facilitators but also on the contribution of the schools' director of studies, the coupling with the regular classroom teachers, and occasional collaborations from the rest of the school staff. After conducting a cluster analysis, we detected the existence of two types of personal networks, some based on the functioning of highly cohesive teams and others with a greater level of centralisation around the head of studies. Implementation networks not only enable the implementation of programme activities, but also the integration of the programme into educational organisations. In the discussion we reflect on how the analysis of facilitators' personal networks can be used to improve the process of programme implementation.","Declaration of Competing Interest Authors declare no conflict of interest.

METHOD: Our analysis is based on a large-scale research project involving 42 countries (International Sex Survey, N=72,627, 57% women, Mage=32.84; SDage=12.57).
RESULTS: The ASRS Screener demonstrated good reliability and validity, along with partial invariance across different languages, countries, and genders. The occurrence of being at risk for adult ADHD was relatively high (21.4% for women, 18.1% for men). The highest scores were obtained in the US, Canada, and other English-speaking Western countries, with significantly lower scores among East Asian and non-English-speaking European countries. Moreover, ADHD symptom severity and occurrence were especially high among gender-diverse individuals. Significant associations between adult ADHD symptoms and age, mental and sexual health, and socioeconomic status were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Present results show significant cross-cultural variability in adult ADHD occurrence as well as highlight important factors related to adult ADHD. Moreover, the importance of further research on adult ADHD in previously understudied populations (non-Western countries) and minority groups (gender-diverse individuals) is stressed. Lastly, the present analysis is consistent with previous evidence showing low specificity of adult ADHD screening instruments and contributes to the current discussion on accurate adult ADHD screening and diagnosis.","The authors would like to thank Anastasia Lucic and Natasha Zippan for their help with project administration and data collection, and Abu Bakkar Siddique, Anne-Marie Menard, Clara Marincowitz, Club Sexu, Critica, Digital Ethics Center (Skaitmeninės etikos centras), Día a Día, Ed Carty, El Siglo, Jakia Akter, Jayma Jannat Juma, Kamrun Nahar Momo, Kevin Zavaleta, Laraine Murray, L’Avenir de l’Artois, La Estrella de Panamá, La Voix du Nord, Le Parisien, Lithuanian National Radio and Television (Lietuvos nacionalinis radijas ir televizija), Mahfuzul Islam, Marjia Khan Trisha, Md.

162,pub.1173556624,10.1051/0004-6361/202450212,,,Photo-dynamical characterisation of the TOI-178 resonant chain,"Context . The TOI-178 system consists of a nearby, late-K-dwarf with six transiting planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regime, with radii ranging from to 2.9 R ⊕ and orbital periods between 1.9 and 20.7 days. All the planets, but the innermost one, form a chain of Laplace resonances. The fine-tuning and fragility of such orbital configurations ensure that no significant scattering or collision event has taken place since the formation and migration of the planets in the protoplanetary disc, thereby providing important anchors for planet formation models.   Aims . We aim to improve the characterisation of the architecture of this key system and, in particular, the masses and radii of its planets. In addition, since this system is one of the few resonant chains that can be characterised by both photometry and radial velocities, we propose to use it as a test bench for the robustness of the planetary mass determination with each technique.   Methods . We performed a global analysis of all the available photometry from CHEOPS, TESS and NGTS, and radial velocity from ESPRESSO, using a photo-dynamical modelling of the light curve. We also tried different sets of priors on the masses and eccentricity, as well as different stellar activity models, to study their effects on the masses estimated by transit-timing variations (TTVs) and radial velocities (RVs).   Results . We demonstrate how stellar activity prevents a robust mass estimation for the three outer planets using radial velocity data alone. We also show that our joint photo-dynamical and radial velocity analysis has resulted in a robust mass determination for planets c to 𝑔, with precision of ~ 12% for the mass of planet c, and better than 10% for planets d to 𝑔. The new precisions on the radii range from 2 to 3%. The understanding of this synergy between photometric and radial velocity measurements will be valuable for the PLATO mission. We also show that TOI-178 is indeed currently locked in the resonant configuration, librating around an equilibrium of the chain.","CHEOPS is an ESA mission in partnership with Switzerland with important contributions to the payload and the ground segment from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

201,pub.1168848780,10.1051/0004-6361/202347954,,,Near-infrared spectroscopic characterisation of Gaia ultra-cool dwarf candidates,"Context . The local census of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is crucial to improving our understanding of the stellar-substellar transition and their formation history. These objects, known as ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs), are essential targets for searches of potentially habitable planets. However, their detection poses a challenge because of their low luminosity. The Gaia survey has identified numerous new UCD candidates thanks to its large survey and precise astrometry.   Aims . We aim to characterise 60 UCD candidates detected by Gaia in the solar neighbourhood with a spectroscopic follow-up to confirm that they are UCDs, as well as to identify peculiarities.   Methods . We acquired the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of 60 objects using the SOFI spectrograph between 0.93 and 2.5 µm ( R ~ 600). We identified their spectral types using a template-matching method. Their binarity is studied using astrometry and spectral features.   Results . We confirm that 60 objects in the sample have ultra-cool dwarf spectral types close to those expected from astrometry. Their NIR spectra reveal that seven objects could host an unresolved coolest companion and seven UCDs share the same proper motions as other stars. The characterisation of these UCDs is part of a coordinated effort to improve our understanding of the Solar neighbourhood.","This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Gaia (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia), processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium).

Beyond the traditional disease measures, there is an emerging acknowledgment of the less-explored aspects, including subjective well-being, social determinants of health, comorbidities, mental health, and medication adherence. Moreover, digital health services have empowered patients to engage actively in decision-making alongside clinicians. To explore these domains within the context of AIRDs, the “Collating the Voice of People with Autoimmune Diseases” COVAD survey was conceived, a successor of the previous two COVAD surveys. In this document, we present the study protocol in comprehensive detail.MethodsThe COVAD-3 survey is a cross-sectional patient self-reported e-survey incorporating multiple widely accepted scales/scores to assess various aspects of patients’ lifestyles objectively. To ensure the survey's accuracy and usability across diverse regions, it will be translated into multiple languages and subjected to rigorous vetting and pilot testing. It will be distributed by collaborators via online platforms and data will be collected from patients with AIRDs, and healthy individuals over eight months. Data analysis will focus on outcome measures related to various social, demographic, economic, and psychological factors.ConclusionWith the increasing awareness to adopt a holistic treatment approach encompassing all avenues of life, the COVAD-3 survey aims to gain valuable insights into the impact of social, demographic, economic, and psychological determinants of health on the subjective well-being in patients with AIRDs, which will contribute to a better understanding of their overall health and well-being.",The authors are thankful to our patient research partners for their valuable feedback on survey design.,"No specific funding was received from any funding bodies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors to carry out the work described in this manuscript.",Rheumatology International,,,Humans;

1633,pub.1174646847,10.1007/s11205-024-03397-6,,,Adapting and Validating a Survey to Assess Host Communities Support for Migration,"Migration presents challenges to receiving communities, as it tests their ability to respond to unexpected expenditures and social stresses. Evaluating the local impact of rapid and substantial migration flows is difficult due to the absence of a validated instrument for assessing community support for migration. Our study adapted and validated a Support for Migration Assessment survey (SMA) based on Social Exchange Theory (SET). The validation of the SMA contributes in two significant ways. First, it establishes an instrument that enables the assessment of support for migration (SFM) by considering community-level factors: trust in institutions (TII), overall community satisfaction (OCS), and perceived negative impact on infrastructure (INF). Second, the SMA extends SET to the context of migration to assess support by a receiving community. We recruited 333 survey participants between January and July 2022 using proportional stratified random sampling to measure locals’ perceptions toward the Venezuelan migrant population in Barranquilla, Colombia. The internal consistency of the factors was calculated with Cronbach’s alpha (α) and omega coefficient (ω), resulting in α = 0.88, ω = 0.89 for TII; α = 0.90, ω = 0.92 for OCS; α = 0.87, ω = 0.88 for INF; and α = 0.84, ω = 0.86 for SFM. After conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, construct validity was confirmed based on the model’s goodness of fit (CFI = 0.939, TLI = 0.935, RMSEA = 0.062, SRMR = 0.076). The adapted survey demonstrates adequacy in assessing perceived community support for migration.","Liss Romero &amp; Lia Castillo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia) helped in the data collection process.",This research is funded by grant number N000141912624 by the Office of Naval Research through the Minerva Research Initiative; none of the views reported in the study are those of the funding organization.,Social Indicators Research,,,,2024-08-09,2024,2024-08-09,2024-09,174,2,697-720,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Botello, Jhon G.; Palacio, Katherine; Frydenlund, Erika; Llinás, Humberto; Padilla, Jose J.","Botello, Jhon G.

194,pub.1168370083,10.1016/j.icarus.2024.115979,,,Disparate Pb-isotopic ages of silicate and phosphate minerals in the diabasic angrite Northwest Africa 12320,"Pb-isotopic dating of the recently discovered diabasic angrite Northwest Africa (NWA) 12320 yielded ages of 4564.17 ± 0.50 Ma and 4562.82 ± 0.37 Ma for acid-insoluble and soluble minerals respectively. These ages are calculated using measured 238U/235U ratios of soluble and insoluble minerals, thereby excluding the possibility that the apparent age difference is caused by internal U-isotopic variations. The age of the insoluble minerals is indistinguishable from published Pb isotopic ages of other medium-grained angrites SAH 99555 and D'Orbigny. The age of acid-soluble minerals is distinctly younger, with a 1.35 ± 0.62 Ma age gap between the PbPb ages of the two mineral fractions. The mineral hosts of U, Th and radiogenic Pb in the meteorite were identified through in-situ SIMS measurements of these elements in all minerals. The principal carriers of U, Th and radiogenic Pb are acid insoluble Al-Ti-rich augite and soluble Si-rich phosphate. Closure temperatures for diffusion of radiogenic Pb in these minerals are calculated to be respectively 820 ± 90 °C and 450 ± 80 °C using the observed range of crystal dimensions and the published experimental data for Pb diffusion in augite and apatite. The age difference between the pyroxene and phosphates has two potential explanations: (1) a late reheating event >450 °C which may have re-set the UPb systematics of the phosphates but not the pyroxenes or (2) slow cooling of the rock from ∼450–820 °C. If slow cooling is the reason for the age difference, we can estimate a model cooling rate of 270 ± 150 °C/Ma over the estimated closure temperature range between pyroxenes and phosphates. This rate is ∼11 orders of magnitude slower than petrologic cooling rates of quenched angrites at temperatures above 1000 °C determined experimentally using the composition of Asuka 881371 groundmass (Keil, 2012), which is similar to NWA 12320 groundmass. If there was no late reheating event, the discrepancy between fast cooling rates at high temperatures near the solidus, followed by much slower cooling at lower temperatures, might have been caused by impact melting. It could also be attributed to the initial eruption of the source magma of NWA 12320 near the surface of the parent body, followed by burial due to subsequent eruptions.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

999,pub.1169455356,10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105090,,,Exceptionally preserved subfossil woods from late Pleistocene volcanic deposits from the Northern Andes of Colombia,"The recent geological history of the Northern Andes is characterized by the interaction of dynamic surface processes such as volcanic activity, fluvial erosion, mass movements, etc. that have shaped landscapes for millennia. Despite its great geological and biological importance, the long-term ecological history of middle-elevation tropical habitats (between 1000 and 2500 m.a.s.l.) is unknown, due to the scarcity of suitable paleo archives preserving the paleoecological signal, leading to a critical data gap. This manuscript reports well-preserved subfossil woods of the Pleistocene volcanoclastic deposits from the Central Cordillera of Colombia. Four wood specimens are described and identified as Terminalioxylon gumminae sp.nov., Andesanthus risaraldense sp.nov., Anacardium quindiuense sp.nov., and Chrysochlamys colombiana. This report demonstrates the potential of volcanic deposits in the Northern Andes as paleo archives, and contributes to the fossil record of the tropical Andes, as it contains elements of mid-altitude vegetation preserved in association with the Pleistocene volcanic activity of the Central Cordillera. The environments where these subfossil species lived resemble present environmental conditions. This is a baseline for future paleobotanical exploration and paleoenvironmental analyses.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up from different facilities, confirmed the substellar nature of TIC 4672985 b , a massive gas giant in the transition between the super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs mass regime. From the joint analysis we derived the following orbital parameters: P = 69.0480 −0.0005 +0.0004 d,  M p  = 12.74 −1.01 +1.01  M j  ,  R p  = 1.026 −0.067 +0.065  R j  and e = 0.018 −0.004 +0.004 . In addition, the RV time series revealed a significant trend at the ~350 m s −1 yr −1 level, which is indicative of the presence of a massive outer companion in the system. TIC 4672985 b is a unique example of a transiting substellar companion with a mass above the deuterium-burning limit, located beyond 0.1 AU and in a nearly circular orbit. These planetary properties are difficult to reproduce from canonical planet formation and evolution models. For TOI-2529 b , we obtained the following orbital parameters: P = 64.5949 −0.0003 +0.0003 d,  M p  = 2.340 −0.195 +0.197  M j  ,  R p  = 1.030 −0.050 +0.050  R j  and e = 0.021 −0.015 +0.024 , making this object a new example of a growing population of transiting warm giant planets.","The results reported herein benefited from collaborations and/or information exchange within NASA’s Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) research coordination network sponsored by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate under Agreement No. 80NSSC21K0593 for the program “Alien Earths”.

193,pub.1173430324,10.1051/0004-6361/202450182,,,Projection factor and radii of Type II Cepheids,"Type II Cepheids are old pulsating stars that can be used to trace the distribution of an old stellar population and to measure distances to globular clusters and galaxies within several megaparsecs, and by extension, they can improve our understanding of the cosmic distance scale. One method that can be used to measure the distances of Type II Cepheids relies on period-luminosity relations, which are quite widely explored in the literature. The semi-geometrical Baade-Wesselink technique is another method that allows distances of radially pulsating stars, such as Type II Cepheids, to be measured if the so-called projection factor is known. However, the literature concerning this parameter for Type II Cepheids is limited to just a few pioneering works. In determining projection factors for eight nearby short-period Type II Cepheids, also known as BL Her type stars, we aim to calibrate the Baade-Wesselink method for measuring distances for this class of stars. Using the surface brightness-colour relation version of the Baade-Wesselink technique, we determined the projection factors and radii of eight nearby BL Her type stars. We adopted accurate distances of target stars from $Gaia$ Data Release 3. Time series photometry in the $V$ and $K_ S $ bands have been collected with two telescopes located at the $Rolf$ $Chini$ Cerro Murphy Observatory (former Cerro Armazones Observatory), while spectroscopic data have been obtained within dedicated programmes with instruments hosted by the European Southern Observatory. The measured projection factors for the stars with good quality data are in the range between 1.21 and 1.36. The typical uncertainty of projection factors is 0.1. The mean value is 1.330pm 0.058, which gives the uncertainty of sim 4. The main sources of uncertainty on the $p$-factors are statistical errors of the Baade-Wesselink fit (related to the dispersion and coverage of light and radial velocity curves) and parallax. In the case of radii, the biggest contribution to the error budget comes from the $K_ S $ band photometry's systematic uncertainty and parallax. The determined radii allowed us to construct the period-radius relation for BL Her stars. Our period-radius relation is in good agreement with the previous empirical calibration, while two theoretical calibrations found in the literature agree with our relation within 2sigma . We also confirm that BL Her and RR Lyr stars obey an apparent common period-radius relation.","P.W. gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Polish National Science Center grant PRELUDIUM 2018/31/N/ST9/02742.

121,pub.1167393433,10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104349,,,"Late Pleistocene to modern precipitation changes at the Paranal clay pan, central Atacama Desert","The Atacama Desert in Chile is known to be one of the driest deserts on Earth, with dominating hyperaridity at least since the Miocene. During recent times, however, especially the southern part of the Atacama repeatedly experienced exceptional precipitation events, like in 2015 and 2017. Locally, these events with high rainfall rates caused catastrophic floods with significant destruction and human fatalities. Although the meteorological drivers of these heavy rains are widely understood, only little is known about the frequency and amplitude of similar events on geological timescales. Here we present the results of a study on an endorheic clay pan at the southern edge of the hyperarid core of the Atacama, an area with a mean precipitation of approx. 5 mm per year. A modern ground-truthing approach combining sediment data, remote-sensing and meteorological data as well as climate-modelling was applied. Our observations indicate that the clay pan reacted very sensitively to local precipitation during the past 30 years, with four events >20 mm total rain causing sufficient surface run-off in the catchment to partially flood the basin. Comparative analyses of the four events illustrate that the amount of run-off is dependent on the maximum rain rate during the events rather than the total rain sum. A 1.88-m long sediment core recovered from the centre of the clay pan records the local hydrological and -environmental history since the Late Pleistocene. Sedimentological, mineralogical, geochemical, and biological core analyses imply strong variations in the amplitude of the recorded rainfall, with a clear shift from enhanced alluvial activity caused by higher-amplitude rain events during the Late Pleistocene to lower-amplitude Holocene events. The Holocene background sedimentation is superimposed by seven severe “Millennial-scale rain events”, which imply precipitation maxima on sub-orbital timescales that are potentially driven by changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results of the study shed new light on the glacial-interglacial but also the sub-orbital precipitation variability in the Coastal Cordillera of the Atacama Desert and its potential driving mechanisms, and provide perspectives of the future precipitation development in the region under progressive global warming.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

1859,pub.1168048211,10.1016/j.jad.2024.01.127,38244805,,Cross-cultural validation and measurement invariance of anxiety and depression symptoms: A study of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) in 42 countries,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental health issues experienced worldwide. However, whereas cross-cultural studies utilize psychometrically valid and reliable scales, fewer can meaningfully compare these conditions across different groups. To address this gap, the current study aimed to psychometrically assess the Brief Symptomatology Index (BSI) in 42 countries.
METHODS: Using data from the International Sex Survey (N = 82,243; Mage = 32.39; SDage = 12.52; women: n = 46,874; 57 %), we examined the reliability of depression and anxiety symptom scores of the BSI-18, as well as evaluated evidence of construct, invariance, and criterion-related validity in predicting clinically relevant variables across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations.
RESULTS: Results corroborated an invariant, two-factor structure across all groups tested, exhibiting excellent reliability estimates for both subscales. The 'caseness' criterion effectively discriminated among those at low and high risk of depression and anxiety, yielding differential effects on the clinical criteria examined.
LIMITATIONS: The predictive validation was not made against a clinical diagnosis, and the full BSI-18 scale was not examined (excluding the somatization sub-dimension), limiting the validation scope of the BSI-18. Finally, the study was conducted online, mainly by advertisements through social media, ultimately skewing our sample towards women, younger, and highly educated populations.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support that the BSI-12 is a valid and reliable assessment tool for assessing depression and anxiety symptoms across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. Further, its caseness criterion can discriminate well between participants at high and low risk of depression and anxiety.","Declaration of competing interest JBurkauskas works as a consultant at Cronos.

5011,pub.1166324100,10.1037/pas0001270,38010780,,The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale: Cross-National Measurement Invariance and Convergent Validity Evidence,"Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) is a widely used measure that captures somatic symptoms of coronavirus-related anxiety. In a large-scale collaboration spanning 60 countries (Ntotal = 21,513), we examined the CAS's measurement invariance and assessed the convergent validity of CAS scores in relation to the fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S) and the satisfaction with life (SWLS-3) scales. We utilized both conventional exact invariance tests and alignment procedures, with results revealing that the single-factor model fit the data well in almost all countries. Partial scalar invariance was supported in a subset of 56 countries. To ensure the robustness of results, given the unbalanced samples, we employed resampling techniques both with and without replacement and found the results were more stable in larger samples. The alignment procedure demonstrated a high degree of measurement invariance with 9% of the parameters exhibiting noninvariance. We also conducted simulations of alignment using the parameters estimated in the current model. Findings demonstrated reliability of the means but indicated challenges in estimating the latent variances. Strong positive correlations between CAS and FCV-19S estimated with all three different approaches were found in most countries. Correlations of CAS and SWLS-3 were weak and negative but significantly differed from zero in several countries. Overall, the study provided support for the measurement invariance of the CAS and offered evidence of its convergent validity while also highlighting issues with variance estimation.

RadioImmunoPrecipitation Assay (RIPA) is recommended to detect AChR AAbs, but its complexity and radioactive requirements limit widespread use. We compare non-RIPA anti-AChR immunoassays, including Cell-Based Assay (CBA) and two ELISA kits, against the gold standard RIPA.
Methods/Results: 145 samples were included with medical indication for anti-AChR testing. By the RIPA method, 63 were negative (RIPA-Neg < 0.02 nmol/L), 18 were classified as Borderline (≥0.02 -1 nmol/L), and 64 were positive (RIPA-Pos > 1 nmol/L). The competitive ELISA showed poor agreement with RIPA (Kappa = 0.216). The indirect ELISA demonstrated substantial agreement with RIPA (Kappa = 0.652), with ∼76% sensitivity and ∼94% specificity for MG diagnostic. The CBA, where fixed cells expressing clustered AChR were used as substrate, exhibited almost perfect agreement with RIPA (Kappa = 0.984), yielding ∼98% sensitivity and 96% specificity for MG. In addition, a semiquantitative analysis showed a strong correlation between CBA titration, indirect ELISA, and RIPA levels (r = 0.793 and r = 0.789, respectively).
Conclusions: The CBA displayed excellent analytical performance for MG diagnostic when compared to RIPA, making it a potential replacement for RIPA in clinical laboratories. Some solid-phase assays (such as the indirect ELISA applied here), as well as CBA titration, offer reliable options to estimate anti-AChR AAb levels after confirming positivity by the CBA.∥.",The authors have no acknowledgments to report.,"This work was mainly supported by Sao Paulo Government agency FAPESP (Sao Paulo State Research Foundation) grant numbers #2017/20745-1 and #2021/04588-9, granted to G.D.K. and L.D.S.

Most tools measuring nature exposure and attachment were developed in high-income countries and little is known about their robustness across national and linguistic groups. Therefore, we used data from the Body Image in Nature Survey to assess measurement invariance of the Nature Exposure Scale (NES) and the Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) across 65 nations, 40 languages, gender identities, and age groups (N = 56,968). While multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) of the NES supported full scalar invariance across gender identities and age groups, only partial scalar invariance was supported across national and linguistic groups. MG-CFA of the CNS also supported full scalar invariance across gender identities and age groups, but only partial scalar invariance of a 7-item version of the CNS across national and linguistic groups. Nation-level associations between NES and CNS scores were negligible, likely reflecting a lack of conceptual clarity over what the NES is measuring. Individual-level associations between both measures and sociodemographic variables were weak. Findings suggest that the CNS-7 may be a useful tool to measure nature connectedness globally, but measures other than the NES may be needed to capture nature exposure cross-culturally.",,,Journal of Environmental Psychology,,,,2024-11,2024,,2024-11,99,,102432,All OA; Hybrid,Article,Viren Swami; Mathew P.

1704,pub.1172881082,10.1145/3665921,,,Identifying Difficult Questions and Student Difficulties in a Spanish Version of a Programming Assessment Instrument (SCS1),"Currently, there is little evidence about how non-English-speaking students learn computer programming. For example, there are few validated assessment instruments to measure the development of programming skills, especially for the Spanish-speaking population. Having valid assessment instruments is essential to identify the difficulties of the students, make formative decisions, and evaluate the impact of pedagogical interventions. This article presents the outcomes of the early steps toward a validation in Spanish of the SCS1 assessment, derived from the first conceptual inventory to measure programming knowledge decoupled from a particular language. The goal of this initial step is twofold: (1) identifying the questions that are too difficult in this version and might need to be adapted based on empirical evidence of how students answer them and (2) identifying students’ common difficulties with the most challenging questions. This study started with a “think-aloud” protocol to validate whether the Spanish version was similar to the original instrument and if the students understood the translation as intended. Then, the instrument was applied to a sample of 71 university students who had previously taken an introductory programming course using Python. We computed the difficulty index for each question and identified students’ difficulties in answering them. We also propose potential improvements for these items. The main contributions of this study include (1) progress toward the validation of an instrument for evaluating programming skills in Spanish, (2) noting the advantage that experienced students in Python have to complete the instrument, (3) identifying the tendency of students to translate the pseudo-code from Spanish into English, and (4) the identification of common mistakes, like misunderstanding the scope of local variables or the confusion between returning and printing.",,,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,,,,2024-08-19,2024,2024-08-19,2024-09-30,24,3,1-17,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Vieira, Camilo; Vásquez, Andrea; Meza, Federico; Quintero-Manes, Roxana; Godoy, Pedro","Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Vásquez, Andrea (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Chile); Meza, Federico (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Chile); Quintero-Manes, Roxana (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Godoy, Pedro (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Chile)","Meza, Federico (Federico Santa María Technical University)","Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Vásquez, Andrea (Federico Santa María Technical University); Meza, Federico (Federico Santa María Technical University); Quintero-Manes, Roxana (Universidad del Norte); Godoy, Pedro (Federico Santa María Technical University)",0,0,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3665921,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172881082,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

Altermagnets offer advantages of spin-polarized current akin to ferromagnets, and THz functionalities similar to antiferromagnets, while introducing new effects like spin-splitter currents. A key challenge for future applications and functionalization of altermagnets is to demonstrate controlled transitioning to the altermagnetic phase from other conventional phases in a single material. Here we prove a viable path toward overcoming this challenge through a strain-induced transition from an antiferromagnetic to an altermagnetic phase in ReO2. Combining spin group symmetry analysis and ab initio calculations, we demonstrate that under compressive strain ReO2 undergoes such transition, lifting the Kramers degeneracy of the band structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in the nonrelativistic regime. In addition, we show that this magnetic transition is accompanied by a metal-insulator transition, and calculate the distinct spin-polarized spectral functions of the two phases, which can be detected in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments.","A.C. acknowledges financial support from an Alexander von Humboldt postdoctoral fellowship.

WDS replacements are often delayed due to high immediate costs without considering long‐term environmental consequences. This study is the first to examine a real‐world WDS using a novel workflow transferrable to other WDSs that integrates GIS, hydraulic modeling, breakage prediction, and life cycle analysis to evaluate environmental impacts and water loss of five replacement schedules (25‐, 50‐, 75‐, 100‐, 150‐year intervals). Environmental impacts were reduced by half when replacement interval changed from 25 year to 150 years, yet volume of water leaked from the system quadrupled. Benefits plateaued beyond 50–75‐year replacement while water loss steadily increased. Lowering water loss through break management enabled one‐sixth pipe replacement without exceeding original leakage at 25‐year replacement. Results were robust to uncertainty parameters and assert the importance of equilibrating environmental impacts and water loss when designing pipe replacement frequency.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by two National Science Foundation Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research projects including (1) “RII Track‐2 [grant number 2019561] FEC: IGM—A Framework for Harnessing Big Hydrological Datasets for Integrated Groundwater Management” and (2) “RII Track‐4 [grant number 2228903]: NSF: Characterization of Extractable Organic Fluorine as an indicator of total PFASs to close the fluorine mass balance in potable reuse scenarios”.

To what extent has this dividend materialized and what have been the experiences of companies in different regions and cities of the economy? To evaluate the impact of the peace agreement on key indicators, we conducted a subnational analysis in post-agreement Colombia. We examined nine cities and created a model to determine the relationship between the conflict—represented by the Victimization Risk Index released by the Colombian national victim’s unit—and a business dynamic variable. We found that the cities presenting a higher VRI tend to have lower business dynamic scores. We paired the findings from our business dynamics model with the results of a survey conducted in 2018 by the Bogotá Chamber of Commerce (CCB). This comparison confirms that the majority of the regions most affected by the conflict had the largest peace dividend both in terms of perception and in reality. Peace will not lift all boats across the country evenly. Policymakers can leverage these insights to ground their expectations and devise more effective policies and interventions capable of navigating the challenges of peacemaking and the opportunities peace can offer the private sector.",,,Business Horizons,,,,2024-08,2024,,2024-08,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"García, Juana; Rettberg, Angelika; Dupont, Federico","García, Juana (School of Management, Universidad de los Andes, Calle 21 No 1–20, Bogotá, Colombia); Rettberg, Angelika (School of Social Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1 Este No 18A–12, Bogotá, Colombia); Dupont, Federico (School of Social Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Carrera 1 Este No 18A–12, Bogotá, Colombia)","Rettberg, Angelika (Universidad de Los Andes)","García, Juana (Universidad de Los Andes); Rettberg, Angelika (Universidad de Los Andes); Dupont, Federico (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2024.07.007,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174394983,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"
237,pub.1167629356,10.5194/cp-2023-97,,,Exploring the causes of multicentury pluvials in the Altiplano with a climate modelling experiment,"Proxy records have long documented the existence of multicentury hydroclimate anomalies in the Altiplano of South America. However, the causes and mechanisms of these events are still largely unknown. Here we present the results of an innovative climate modelling experiment that explores the oceanic drivers and atmospheric mechanisms conducive to long-term precipitation variability in the southern part of the Altiplano (18–25° S). For doing so, we performed 100-yr-long hydroclimate simulations using a regional climate model forced by climatological conditions that resulted in pluvial December-January-February (DJF) seasons during historical times. Our modelling simulations produce long-term negative DJF precipitation trends for the southern Altiplano, suggesting that the mechanisms leading to historical wet summers are unable to sustain century-scale pluvials such as the ones documented in paleoclimate records. Our simulations show that permanent La Niña conditions, as well as SSTs anomalies in the southern tropical Atlantic, progressively reinforce upper and lower-troposphere features that inhibit moisture transport towards the Altiplano. We further observed increases in March-April-May precipitation, suggesting the emergence of a long-term seasonal shift. Our simulations reproduce a sustained northward migration of the Atlantic trade winds, resulting in contrasting hydroclimate responses between the Altiplano and the tropical Andes. The atmospheric processes associated with these differences provide a useful analogue for explaining divergences in proxy records. Our study shows how regional climate modelling can be used to test paleoclimate hypothesis, emphasizing the necessity of combining proxy and modelling data to improve our understanding of long-term hydroclimate change.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2024-01-03,2024,2024-01-03,,2024,,1-19,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Jara, Ignacio A.; Astudillo, Orlando; Salinas, Pablo; Torrez-Rodriguez, Limbert; Lampe, Nicolás; Maldonado, Antonio","Jara, Ignacio A.

Mabuza,"Abstract This article analyses British policymakers’ efforts to court Enos John Mabuza, Chief Minister of the self‐governing South African homeland of KaNgwane, in the final years of apartheid. It contends that despite taking place nearly 30 years apart, there were striking similarities between British policy at the end of apartheid and in the era of decolonisation, particularly the efforts to build relations with moderate nationalists in an effort to maintain long‐term influence. While KaNgwane was a small territory lacking in material resources, Mabuza, as a moderate Black leader working within the law to challenge apartheid, took on greater importance in the minds of British policymakers seeking a peaceful transfer of power in South Africa. This was helped by Mabuza's ability to maintain relations with a diverse range of important political actors including the South African government, KwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the African National Congress in exile. Additionally, KaNgwane's close proximity to Mozambique, which at the time was in the midst of a civil war, also gave the territory greater prominence. This article will highlight how Mabuza used these interconnecting factors to demonstrate his value as an important ‘interlocutor’ for Britain, which in turn saw him extract important resources for both the KaNgwane people and his own family, as well as a degree of protection from interference by the South African government.",,"I would like to thank the British International Studies Association for funding some of the research undertaken in South Africa which has been used in this article.

Of 20,685 complete responses, we identified 6010 from patients aged 18–35 years (1692 RMD, 400 nrADs, 3918 HC) who received up to 4 vaccine doses. BNT162b2 was the most frequently administered vaccine and prior to vaccination, 7% of people with nrAD were taking immunosuppressants (IS) versus 80% in RMDs. Early mild AEs were more frequent in RMDs (93%) and nr-ADs (92%) compared to HC (85%). The frequency of late mild AEs was < 20% in all groups. Severe AEs were rare. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were similar across all groups, however, RMD patients reported a single episode of infection more frequently than nrADs and HC, while nrADs reported multiple infections more frequently than RMD. Self-reported disease flares were reported by 10% or RMD and 7% of nrAD patients. Our study reinforces the safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine also in young people with ADs, but it also highlights that among young individuals the number and clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infections is affected more by the type of AD rather than by coexisting IS therapy.",,Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi dell’Aquila within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,Rheumatology International,,,Humans; COVID-19; Young Adult; Female; Adult; Male; COVID-19 Vaccines; Autoimmune Diseases; Adolescent; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Rheumatic Diseases; BNT162 Vaccine; Vaccination; Breakthrough Infections,2024-07-13,2024,2024-07-13,2024-09,44,9,1725-1731,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Alunno, Alessia; Carubbi, Francesco; Tan, Ai Lyn; Sen, Parikshit; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Joshi, Mrudula; Day, Jessica; Saha, Sreoshy; Gutiérrez, Carlos Enrique Toro; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo Vinicio; Distler, Oliver; Chinoy, Hector; Aggarwal, Rohit; Agarwal, Vikas; Gupta, Latika","Alunno, Alessia (Internal Medicine and Nephrology Division, Department of Clinical Medicine, Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L’Aquila and San Salvatore Hospital, Piazzale Salvatore Tommasi 1, 67100, L’Aquila, Italy); Carubbi, Francesco (Internal Medicine and Nephrology Division, Department of Clinical Medicine, Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L’Aquila and San Salvatore Hospital, Piazzale Salvatore Tommasi 1, 67100, L’Aquila, Italy); Tan, Ai Lyn (NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, UK; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK); Sen, Parikshit (Maulana Azad Medical College, 2-Bahadurshah Zafar Marg, 110002, New Delhi, Delhi, India); Cavagna, Lorenzo (Rheumatology Unit, Dipartimento di Medicine Interna e Terapia Medica, Università degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Lombardy, Italy); Joshi, Mrudula (Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India); Day, Jessica (Department of Rheumatology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, 3050, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 3052, Parkville, VIC, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, 3052, Parkville, VIC, Australia); Saha, Sreoshy (Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh); Gutiérrez, Carlos Enrique Toro (Reference Center for Osteoporosis, Rheumatology and Dermatology, Pontifica Universidad Javeriana Cali, Cali, Colombia); Caballero-Uribe, Carlo Vinicio (Department of Medicine, Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia); Distler, Oliver (Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland); Chinoy, Hector (Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; National Institute for Health Research Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Department of Rheumatology, Salford Royal Hospital, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, Salford, UK); Aggarwal, Rohit (Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA); Agarwal, Vikas (Department of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India); Gupta, Latika (Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Department of Rheumatology, Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, Wolverhampton, UK; Department of Rheumatology, City Hospital, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK)","Alunno, Alessia (University of L'Aquila)","Alunno, Alessia (University of L'Aquila); Carubbi, Francesco (University of L'Aquila); Tan, Ai Lyn (NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit; University of Leeds); Sen, Parikshit (Maulana Azad Medical College); Cavagna, Lorenzo (University of Pavia); Joshi, Mrudula (B.

BI was defined as COVID-19 infection occurring in individuals vaccinated with ≥ 2 doses (or 1 dose of J&J) ≥ 14 days after vaccination and not after 6 months since the last vaccine dose. Data were analysed using linear and logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 91/852 (10.7%) SLE patients reported at least one BI. The frequency of BIs in SLE patients was comparable to that among HCs (277/2671; p = 0.847) and patients with nrAID (39/414; p = 0.552) but higher than that among patients with other rAIDs (235/3098; p = 0.005). No demographic factors or treatments were associated with BIs in SLE patients (p ≥ 0.05 for all). Joint pain was more frequent in SLE patients than in HCs (odds ratio [OR]: 3.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89–6.04; p < 0.001) or nrAID patients (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.04–5.75; p = 0.041). Patient with SLE did not report a higher frequency of hospitalisation or need for advanced treatment for COVID-19 infection compared with disease controls and HCs, respectively.ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccination conferred similar protection against COVID-19 infection in terms of frequency and severity in patients with SLE to that reported by healthy individuals.","COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) Study Group: COVAD Study Group: The complete list of members of the COVAD Study Group as well as their affiliations are provided in the Supplementary Material.

In this study, we examined the temporal order of all components of this theory using a cross-lagged panel analysis. A sample of 354 students (62.10% female, mean age = 20.63 y.o.) participated in a 5-week study and completed weekly self-reported measures of prospective appraisal, coping, core burnout, and mental health (i.e. depression, anxiety, and stress). Using cross-lagged panel network analyses, we analyzed how each measured variable is predicted by all variables from the previous measurement moment. Convergent with the transactional stress theory, we found that threat appraisals and negative self-perception predicted future anxiety and depression. Contrary to expectations, core burnout and somatization emerged as significant predictors of poor mental health outcomes, suggesting a self-perpetuating spiral. Furthermore, our study highlighted the importance of recognizing the bidirectional connections between appraisals, coping strategies, and mental well-being.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, CNCS—UEFISCDI, project number PN‐III‐P4‐ID‐PCE‐2020‐1760, within PNCDI III.

Debates around the chronology of the site and the lack of additional evidence supporting contact, gave origin to a new archaeological excavation focusing on refining the site’s chronology and recovering further archaeological materials. The results appear to reconfirm a pre-Columbian date for this site; however, our findings did not produce any evidence of contact with Polynesia. Instead, clear evidence of South American interregional interaction was detected with the territory of Neuquén, Argentina.","We would like to acknowledge the reviewers, and many collaborators from Chile, New Zealand, and beyond, who supported this research.

While mammalian MAO enzymes, MAO A and MAO B, have been extensively studied, the molecular properties of the other family members are only partly uncovered. This study aims to explore the evolution of monoamine oxidases, emphasizing understanding the MAO gene repertoire among vertebrates. Our analyses show that the duplication that gave rise to MAO A and MAO B occurred in the ancestor of tetrapods, between 408 and 352 million years ago. Non-tetrapod jawed vertebrates possess the ancestral preduplicative condition of MAO A/B. Our results also identified a new family member, MAO C, in non-tetrapod jawed vertebrates. Thus, most jawed vertebrates possess a repertoire of two MAO genes, MAO A and MAO B in tetrapods and MAO A/B and MAO C in non-tetrapod jawed vertebrates, representing different MAO gene lineages. Jawless vertebrates possess the ancestral condition of a single copy gene, MAO A/B/C. Enzymatic assays conducted on the MAO recombinant enzymes of the Indo-Pacific tarpon show that both proteins, MAO A/B and MAO C, have enzymatic and molecular properties more similar to human MAO A, with the former featuring a strikingly higher activity rate when compared to all other MAO enzymes. Our analyses underscore the importance of scanning the tree of life for new gene lineages to understand phenotypic diversity and gain detailed insights into their function.","This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico from Chile, FONDECYT 1210471 to JCO, and FONDECYT 1211481 to GAM.

This study explored structural attributes of gorgonian gardens formed by rose gorgonians (Leptogorgia sp. nov.) and associated macrofaunal assemblages in Caleta Pichicuy (Central Chile). Hierarchical sampling was conducted at 20 m depth (maximum colony abundances) in order to assess spatial variability in abundance and colony attributes at two spatial scales (among sites and rocky walls). The abundance and composition of the associated vagile and sessile macrofauna were also examined using univariant (Taxa richness and Shannon index (H’e)) and multivariant approaches and were compared with adjacent bare rocky habitats. Our results showed a high abundance of gorgonians (ca. 28.9–36.5 colonies m−2) compared to other gorgonian gardens in the world. For structural attributes, our results showed smaller colonies with thicker holdfasts in more exposed sites, suggesting the influence of hydrodynamic forces on the colony morphology. Taxa richness and H’e of vagile fauna showed threefold and twofold, respectively, higher values in gorgonian gardens compared to bare walls, but no differences were observed for sessile fauna. In addition, PCoA and PERMANOVA evidenced a distinctive assemblages’ composition between habitats for both vagile and sessile fauna. Correlation analyzes and dbRDA showed, however, little association between structural attributes and associated faunal assemblages (R2 = 0.06, and ca. 3–9.4% of the total variation explained, respectively). Our results constitute the first assessment of structural habitat complexity and accompanying fauna in these gorgonian gardens and establish the baseline for understanding possible future changes associated to human activities.","We are grateful to the staff of Buceo Pichicuy for providing us lodging and boat to our sampling work.

167,pub.1170448842,10.1051/0004-6361/202449307,,,NGTS-30b/TOI-4862b: An ~1 Gyr old 98-day transiting warm Jupiter★★★,"Context . Long-period transiting exoplanets bridge the gap between the bulk of transit- and Doppler-based exoplanet discoveries, providing key insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The wider separation between these planets and their host stars results in the exoplanets typically experiencing less radiation from their host stars; hence, they should maintain more of their original atmospheres, which can be probed during transit via transmission spectroscopy. Although the known population of long-period transiting exoplanets is relatively sparse, surveys performed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) are now discovering new exoplanets to fill in this crucial region of the exoplanetary parameter space.   Aims . This study aims to characterise a new long-period transiting exoplanet by following up on a single-transit candidate found in the TESS mission.   Methods . The TOI-4862 system was monitored using a combination of photometric instruments (TESS, NGTS, and EulerCam) and spectroscopic instruments (CORALIE, FEROS, HARPS, and PFS) in order to determine the period, radius, and mass of the long-period transiting exoplanet NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b. These observations were then fitted simultaneously to determine precise values for the properties and orbital parameters of the exoplanet, as well as the refined stellar parameters of the host star.   Results . We present the discovery of a long-period ( P = 98.29838 ± 0.00010 day) Jupiter-sized (0.928 ± 0.032 R J ; 0.960 ± 0.056 M J ) planet transiting a 1.1 Gyr old G-type star, one of the youngest warm Jupiters discovered to date. NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b has a moderate eccentricity (0.294 −0.010 +0.014 ), meaning that its equilibrium temperature can be expected to vary from 274 −46 +30 K to 500 −84 +55 K over the course of its orbit. Through interior modelling, NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862b was found to have a heavy element mass fraction of 0.23 −0.06 +0.05 and a heavy element enrichment ( Z p / Z  ★  ) of 20 −6 +5 , making it metal-enriched compared to its host star.   Conclusions . NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b is one of the youngest well-characterised long-period exoplanets found to date and will therefore be important in the quest to understanding the formation and evolution of exoplanets across the full range of orbital separations and ages.","This work has been carried out within the framework of the National Centre of Competence in Research PlanetS supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under grants 51NF40_182901 and 51NF40_205606.

Use of paleo-oxygen proxies have the potential to extend the spatial and temporal range of current records, bound pre-anthropogenic baselines, provide datasets necessary to test climate models under different boundary conditions, and ultimately understand how ocean oxygenation responds beyond decadal scale changes. This review seeks to summarize the current state-of-knowledge about proxies for reconstructing Cenozoic marine oxygen: sedimentary features, sedimentary redox-sensitive trace elements and isotopes, biomarkers, nitrogen isotopes, foraminiferal trace elements, foraminifera assemblages, foraminifera morphometrics, and benthic foraminifera carbon isotope gradients. Taking stock of each proxy reveals some common limitations in that the majority of proxies function best at low-oxygen concentrations and many reflect multiple environmental drivers. We also highlight recent breakthroughs in geochemistry and proxy approaches for constraining pelagic (in addition to benthic) oxygenation that are rapidly advancing the field. In light of both the emergence of new proxies and the persistent multiple driver problem, the need for multi-proxy approaches and FAIR data storage and sharing is emphasized. Continued refinement of proxy approaches and both proxy-proxy and proxy-model comparisons are likely to support the growing needs of both oceanographer and paleoceanographers interested in paleo-oxygenation records.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2024-01-09,2024,2024-01-09,,2024,,1-154,All OA;

There is unexplained variability in prenatal brain injury and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcomes, suggesting disease modifiers. Discordant outcomes among dizygotic twins could be explained by genetic susceptibly or protection. Among several well-recognized threats to the developing brain, Zika is a mosquito-borne, positive-stranded RNA virus that was originally isolated in Uganda and spread to cause epidemics in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In the Americas, the virus caused congenital Zika syndrome and a multitude of neurodevelopmental disorders. As of now, there is no preventative treatment or cure for the adverse outcomes caused by prenatal Zika infection. The Prenatal Infection and Neurodevelopmental Genetics (PING) Consortium was initiated in 2016 to identify factors modulating prenatal brain injury and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcomes for Zika and other prenatal viral infections.
Methods: The Consortium has pooled information from eight multi-site studies conducted at 23 research centers in six countries to build a growing clinical and genomic data repository. This repository is being mined to search for modifiers of virally induced brain injury and developmental outcomes. Multilateral partnerships include commitments with Children's National Hospital (USA), Instituto Nacional de Salud (Colombia), the Natural History of Zika Virus Infection in Gestation program (Brazil), and Zika Instituto Fernandes Figueira (Brazil), in addition to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.
Discussion: Our goal in bringing together these sets of patient data was to test the hypothesis that personal and populational genetic differences affect the severity of brain injury after a prenatal viral infection and modify neurodevelopmental outcomes. We have enrolled 4,102 mothers and 3,877 infants with 3,063 biological samples and clinical data covering over 80 phenotypic fields and 5,000 variables. There were several notable challenges in bringing together cohorts enrolled in different studies, including variability in the timepoints evaluated and the collected clinical data and biospecimens. Thus far, we have performed whole exome sequencing on 1,226 participants. Here, we present the Consortium's formation and the overarching study design. We began our investigation with prenatal Zika infection with the goal of applying this knowledge to other prenatal infections and exposures that can affect brain development.","We thank research participants and their families, and the faculty and staff at our institutions. We are also grateful for the support of Children’s National Hospital for translational research.","This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (K08NS119882 to Y.A.K; R01HD102445 to S.B.M).

SDG-06, focused on clean water, drives the increase in basic sanitation coverage, the management of wastewater discharges, and water quality. Wastewater treatment could contribute to achieving 11 of the 17 SDGs. For this purpose, phytoremediation is a low-cost and adaptable alternative to the reduction and control of aquatic pollutants. The objective of this study is to highlight the role of macrophytes in the removal and degradation of these compounds, focusing on Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, commonly known as water hyacinth. The reported values indicate that this plant has a removal capacity of over 70% for metals such as copper, aluminum, lead, mercury, cadmium, and metalloids such as arsenic. Additionally, it significantly improves water quality parameters such as turbidity, suspended solids, pH, dissolved oxygen, and color. It also reduces the presence of phosphates, and nitrogen compounds to values below 50%. It also plays a significant role in the removal of organic contaminants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and dyes. This study describes several valuable by-products from the biomass of the water hyacinth, including animal and fish feed, energy generation (such as briquettes), ethanol, biogas, and composting. According to the analysis carried out, E. crassipes has a great capacity for phytoremediation, which makes it a viable solution for wastewater management, with great potential for water ecosystem restoration.Graphical abstract",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,"Eichhornia; Biodegradation, Environmental; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Sustainable Development; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Purification; Water Quality",2024-06-25,2024,2024-06-25,2024-07,31,31,43561-43582,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Monroy-Licht, Andrea; Carranza-Lopez, Liliana; De la Parra-Guerra, Ana C.; Acevedo-Barrios, Rosa","Monroy-Licht, Andrea (Chemistry and Biology Group, Chemistry and Biology Department, Universidad del Norte, 081007, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carranza-Lopez, Liliana (Medicine and Biotechnology Research Group, School of Health Sciences, Universidad Libre Sectional Barranquilla, Bacteriology Program, 080016, Barranquilla, Colombia); De la Parra-Guerra, Ana C.

3395,pub.1171065744,10.1016/j.jand.2024.04.013,38677364,,Empathy in Nutrition and Dietetics: A Scoping Review,"BACKGROUND: Empathy is fundamental to the provision of efficacious patient-centered health care. Currently, there is no comprehensive synthesis of peer-reviewed empirical research related to empathy in the nutrition and dietetics profession. Understanding empathy in the context of nutrition and dietetics care may lead to improved teaching practices that support nutrition and dietetics students and practitioners to provide high-quality, empathic, patient-centered care.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to understand the approaches through which empathy is conceptualized, measured, and taught in the field of nutrition and dietetics.
METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Reviews Statement and Checklist, a scoping review process was undertaken. Five databases were searched in February 2023: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, and Scopus, with no date limits. Eligible studies were English language-based, peer-reviewed, empirical research exploring or measuring empathy as an outcome in primary data stratified to nutrition and dietetics. Extracted qualitative data were synthesized and analyzed thematically with an inductive, interpretivist approach applied to conceptualize the interrelationship between empathy and dietetic practice. Quantitative data were extracted and summarized in a table.
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in the scoping review. Analysis identified 2 overarching themes underpinning the current literature on empathy in nutrition and dietetics that described empathy as a key skill in the application of patient-centered care, which was supported by approaches to lifelong cultivation of empathy in the nutrition and dietetics profession. A range of tools has measured empathy in nutrition and dietetics students and practitioners with no clear consensus in findings across studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified the extent and nature of empathy within nutrition and dietetics, from both practitioner and patient perspectives, and the vast array of approaches used to teach and quantify empathy in students and practitioners. Insights from this review inform the need for future studies. The results of this review suggest that future research include exploring implications of empathic dietetics care on patient outcomes and identification of best practice, evidence-based curricula and strategies to support sustainable cultivation and maintenance of empathic care across the career span of nutrition and dietetics practitioners.",,FUNDING/SUPPORT There is no funding to disclose.,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,,,Dietetics; Humans; Empathy; Patient-Centered Care; Nutritionists,2024-04-25,2024,2024-04-25,2024-09,124,9,1181-1205,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"de Graaff, Emma; Bennett, Christie; Dart, Janeane","de Graaff, Emma (Department of Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food, School of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.); Bennett, Christie (Department of Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food, School of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.

of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within insulating
materials. Whenever this number is a non-zero even integer, it distinguishes
the material as a spin Chern insulator, and the number is a topological
invariant whenever there is a symmetry that commutes with the spin and protects
Chern numbers. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the material has
non-trivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the value of the
spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the bandgap. For systems where the spin
commutes with the Hamiltonian, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the
non-commutativity of the spin with the Hamiltonian cannot be neglected, both
values are non-zero simultaneously. The ASCN is therefore a good complement for
the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and permits to detect topological
information of the material which is not possible alone from the value of the
SHC.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-04-12,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gonzalez-Hernandez, Rafael; Uribe, Bernardo","Gonzalez-Hernandez, Rafael (); Uribe, Bernardo ()",,"Gonzalez-Hernandez, Rafael (); Uribe, Bernardo ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170701510,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

The literature and some of the most widely discussed cases suggest that this process typically takes place on the basis of majoritarian levels of popular support, often combined with an anti-establishment narrative. In this article, we show that this representation fails to capture the diversity characterizing these transitions and that general conclusions on these processes may have been influenced by the analysis of only a part of existing cases. Through the analysis of the universe of cases since 2000 and using V-Dem ERT and V-Party data, first we show that widely discussed cases are not representative of gradual transitions to electoral autocracy and describe the existence of alternative patterns to electoral autocracy, including an overlooked pattern that is opposite to the more discussed majoritarian-anti-establishment path. Then, we discuss and provide preliminary evidence of how different patterns to electoral autocracy can influence the types of strategies adopted by incumbents, and, as a consequence, the elaboration of potential countermeasures to contemporary attacks on democracy.",,,Democratization,,,,2024-06-13,2024,2024-06-13,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-22,All OA; Green,Article,"Balderacchi, Claudio; Tomini, Luca","Balderacchi, Claudio (Department of Political Science and International Relations, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Tomini, Luca (Centre d'Etude de la Vie Politique - CEVIPOL, Université libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium)","Balderacchi, Claudio (Universidad del Norte)","Balderacchi, Claudio (Universidad del Norte); Tomini, Luca (Université Libre de Bruxelles)",0,0,,,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Alternative_patterns_to_electoral_autocracy_recognizing_diversity_in_contemporary_autocratization_processes/26029676/1/files/47031209.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172856804,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The primary objective of this paper is to introduce and assess the viability of an innovative infrastructure termed Underground Reefer Container Storage (URCS) devised to mitigate the significant and increasing energy demand posed by reefer containers in ports. This study employs a discrete-event simulation (DES) model to evaluate the feasibility, environmental implications, and cost-effectiveness of three distinctive URCS infrastructure designs. These designs are compared against conventional storage methods to ascertain their capacity for minimizing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis reveals that the best scenario for a specific case study involves a multi-block layout comprising two underground yards, capable of accommodating 39% of the overall refrigerated container capacity at a port. This layout cuts CO 2 emissions by 61% from the 2.704 GWh/year energy used by refrigerated containers, yielding around 1.4 million USD/year cost savings. Further analyses using weighted searches to prioritize URCS container slotting led to shorter container dwell times at ports, rendering energy savings 23% higher than in similar unplanned settings. Moreover, this study presents URCS as an eco-friendly alternative for port-based reefer container storage, offering practical alignment with sustainability goals and regulations. The innovative design and its successful application provide holistic insights, paving the way for enhanced port energy management and environmental care. In addition, the implementation of URCS has the potential to reshape port procedures, yielding economic and ecological benefits. This initiative contributes to diminishing the carbon footprint of ports, aligning with global endeavors towards greener and more responsible practices.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2024-08,2024,,2024-08,466,,142664,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Moros-Daza, Adriana; Castro, Dariela; Bonifacio, Jose; Amaya-Mier, Rene; Voß, Stefan","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Atlantico, Colombia); Castro, Dariela (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Atlantico, Colombia); Bonifacio, Jose (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Atlantico, Colombia); Amaya-Mier, Rene (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Atlantico, Colombia); Voß, Stefan (Institute of Information Systems (IWI), University of Hamburg, Von-Melle-Park 5, Hamburg, 20146, Hamburg, Germany; Escuela de Ingenieria Industrial, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile)","Voß, Stefan (Universität Hamburg; Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)","Moros-Daza, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); Castro, Dariela (Universidad del Norte); Bonifacio, Jose (Universidad del Norte); Amaya-Mier, Rene (Universidad del Norte); Voß, Stefan (Universität Hamburg; Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142664,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172053297,40 Engineering,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter w(z) exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing -1 from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for f(R),f(T), and f(Q) gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the ΛCDM scenario is mildly favored.","Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

We analyze and identify sand fly specimens obtained through national efforts by the Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos (InDRE, Mexico), collected between 1995 and 2001, 2008-2012, and 2017-2023, and add bibliographic information (427 additional records). After a principal components analysis of WorldClim variables and altitudinal ranges, variables that better explain the distribution of sand fly species were chosen (BIO6, BIO12, and BIO16, explaining 72 % of variation). A total of 1,187 specimens of 22 species were retrieved from eight states, providing 29 new municipalities and 48 new localities, being Lutzomyia cruciata, Micropygomyia chiapanensis, and Psathyromyia shannoni the most common species. We presented new historical records of distribution for sand fly species from Morelos (3), Oaxaca (7) and Tabasco (1). The 82.7 % of sand fly species analyzed were distributed in areas with altitudinal ranges below 420 m. The anthropophilic species Psathyromyia shannoni, and Lutzomyia cruciata showed the greatest variability regarding altitudinal range, and climatic preferences, while several wild species showed abiotic preferences. It is likely that the effect of urbanization and climate change generate new beneficial biotopes for the proliferation of the vector sand fly species. Complementary studies that consider seasonality, vegetation types, and change in land use could provide new information to better understand the spread of vector-borne diseases.","Declaration of competing interest On behalf of all the co-authors, I declare that we have no conflict of interest.

Here we used the commercial catch data from a local fisher over a 50-year period (1971-2020) to estimate western Baltic spring-spawning (WBSS) herring mean arrival time Q50 (i.e., the week when 50% of the total fish catches had been made) at their spawning ground within the Kiel Fjord, southwest Baltic Sea, and the duration of the spawning season for each year. The relationship between the seawater temperature in the Kiel Bight and other environmental parameters (such as water salinity, North Atlantic and Atlantic multidecadal oscillations) and Q50 was evaluated using a general linear model to test the hypothesis that fish arrived earlier after warm than cold winters. We also estimated the accumulated thermal time to Q50 during gonadal development to estimate the effects of seawater temperature on the variations of Q50. The results of this study revealed a dramatic decrease in herring catches within the Kiel Fjord since the mid-1990s, as documented for the whole southwestern Baltic Sea. Warmer winter seawater temperature was the only factor related to an earlier arrival (1 week for one January seawater temperature degree increase) of herring at their spawning ground. The relationship was found for the first time on week 52 of the year prior to spawning and was the strongest (50% of the variability explained) from the fourth week of January (8 weeks before the mean Q50 among the studied years). A thermal constant to Q50 (~316°C day) was found when temperatures were integrated from the 49th week of the year prior to spawning. These results indicate that seawater temperature enhanced the speed of gonadal maturation during the latest phases of gametogenesis, leading to an early fish arrival under warm conditions. The duration of the spawning season was elongated during warmer years, therefore potentially mitigating the effects of trophic mismatch when fish spawn early. The results of this study highlight the altering effects of climate change on the spawning activity of a migratory fish species in the Baltic Sea where fast global changes presage that in other coastal areas worldwide.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Anton Kardel for kindly sharing with us all the data of his fishing activity without which this study would not have been possible.

To this end, intercultural sensitivity (hereafter, IS) is a determining factor. This situation has led to a proliferation of studies and research on this concept. However, no review of the scientific literature reporting on the current advancements has been found. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse recently published research and studies (2017–2021) on IS, so to obtain an approximation on the advances that have been made in this field and at which point is the research currently. The methodology followed for the systematic review is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model. The initial search yielded 221 articles and, after an exhaustive review, 32 studies were selected. The main findings revolve around the description of the studies, their aims and their new contributions on the subject.

However, despite the promising role and potential benefits of the CE for companies and society, there has still been insufficient analysis examining the challenges for circular transition faced by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the role that standards, such as British Standard (BS) 8001:2017, play during the transition process from linear to circular economy practices. Given this context and to further increase our understanding of the factors preventing the transition from linear to CE, this study aims to assess the CE implementation in MSMEs in developing economies in light of BS 8001:2017 through a survey with Brazilian MSMEs. The primary findings emphasize that CE practices from the Administration dimension occupied top positions in the ranking of implementation, along with one practice from the Innovation dimension. However, the results show that several practices associated with Transparency and Product Optimization in the value chain held the last level of evidence of implementation. Findings suggest that assessing MSMEs through BS 8001:2017 is beneficial for aiding them in analysing and reconsidering their practices related to the conventional linear business models of take-use-dispose. Collectively, the findings improve our understanding of the level of adoption of CE components implementation, the most and the least adopted practices during the CE transition. The study also provides implications for policy, theory, and practical applications in cases where there is an interest in assessing the maturity of CE implementation within MSMEs in developing economies.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2024-02,2024,,2024-02,439,,140787,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"de Jesus Pacheco, Diego Augusto; Rampasso, Izabela Simon; Michels, Guilherme Schafer; Ali, Syed Mithun; Hunt, Julian David","de Jesus Pacheco, Diego Augusto (Aarhus University, Aarhus Business School, Department of Business Development and Technology, Birk Centerpark 15, Herning, Denmark); Rampasso, Izabela Simon (Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

278,pub.1174364237,10.1051/0004-6361/202450496,,,Non-thermal radio emission in Sakurai’s Object,"Context. The very late thermal pulse (VLTP) affects the evolution of ∼20% of 1–8 M ⊙ stars, repeating the last red giant phases within a few years and leading to the formation of a new, but hydrogen-poor, nebula within the old planetary nebula. The strong dust formation in the latter obscures the optical and near-infrared radiation of the star.   Aims. We aimed to determine the reheating timescale of the central star in Sakurai’s Object, which is an important constraint for the poorly understood VLTP evolution.   Methods. We observed the radio continuum emission of Sakurai’s Object for almost 20 years, from 2004 to 2023. Continuous, multi-frequency observations proved to be essential for distinguishing between phases dominated by photoionization and shock ionization.   Results. The flux density fluctuates by more than a factor of 40 within months to years. The spectral index remained negative between 2006 and 2017 and has been close to zero since 2019. The emission region has been only barely resolved since 2021.   Conclusions. Non-thermal radio emission observed from 2004 to 2017 traces shocks induced by wind interactions due to discrete mass-loss events. Thermal emission dominates from 2019 to 2023 and may indicate photoionization of the nebula by the central star.","The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.

In particular, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker geometry and within the framework of scalar nonmetricity theory, we consider a generalization of the Brans–Dicke theory in nonmetricity gravity. Introducing a pressureless gas as the matter source, we also incorporate a coupling function responsible for the interaction. Our findings reveal that the choice of connection in nonmetricity gravity significantly impacts the interaction between the scalar field and the matter source. For one particular connection, we discover the absence of asymptotic solutions with a nontrivial interacting component. More precisely, in this scenario, the matter source does not directly interact with the scalar field; however, there is an interaction with the dynamical degrees of freedom provided by the connection.","Declaration of competing interest I declare no conflict of interest.

Traditionally, globular clusters (GCs) have been assumed to be quasi-relaxed non-rotating systems, characterized by spherical symmetry and orbital isotropy. However, in recent years, a growing set of observational evidence has been unveiling an unexpected dynamical complexity in Galactic GCs. Indeed, kinematic studies have demonstrated that a measurable amount of internal rotation is present in many present-day GCs.   Aims. The objective of this work is to analyse the APOGEE-2 value-added catalog (VAC) DR17 data of a sample of 21 GCs to extend the sample exhibiting signatures of systemic rotation and better understand the kinematic properties of GCs overall. Also, we aim to identify the fastest rotating GC from the sample of objects with suitable measurements.   Methods. From the sample of 23 GCs included in this work, the presence of systemic rotation was detected in 21 of the GCs, using three different methods. All these methods use the radial velocity referred to the cluster systemic velocity ( Ṽ  r  ). Using the first method, it was possible to visually verify the clear-cut signature of systemic rotation; whereas using the second and third methods, it was possible to determine the amplitude of the rotation curve ( A rot ) and the position angle (PA) of the rotation axis.   Results. This study shows that 21 GCs have a signature of systemic rotation. For these clusters, the rotation amplitude and the position angle of the rotation axis (PA 0 ) have been calculated.

This study draws on group interviews and focuses on how teacher educators understand and respond to the policy through practical argumentation. The paper identifies different variations and interrelationships in policy enactment and discusses the tension between a qualification-oriented and a critical-reflective perspective on PDC. This paper contributes to the literature on teacher educators and their enactment of education policy by highlighting the influence of beliefs and values and the wider context of teacher education. In particular, it highlights how the multiple professional roles held by teacher educators adds an additional level of complexity to teacher educators’ policy enactment.",,,Journal of Education Policy,,,,2024-07-31,2024,2024-07-31,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-22,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Bussesund, Erik Straume; McGarr, Oliver; Engen, Bård Ketil","Bussesund, Erik Straume (Department of Primary and Secondary Teacher Education, Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway); McGarr, Oliver (School of Education, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland); Engen, Bård Ketil (Department of Primary and Secondary Teacher Education, Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway)","Bussesund, Erik Straume (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University)","Bussesund, Erik Straume (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University); McGarr, Oliver (University of Limerick); Engen, Bård Ketil (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University)",0,0,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02680939.2024.2379821?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174348103,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education
204,pub.1175891109,10.1007/s00382-024-07434-5,,,Chile Niño/Niña in the coupled model intercomparison project phases 5 and 6,"The north and central coast of Chile is influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) through oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections. However, it also experiences episodic oceanic warmings off central Chile (30°S) lasting a few months that are not necessarily associated with ENSO. These episodes, called “Chile Niño” events, besides their ecological and socio-economical impacts, have also the potential to influence tropical Pacific variability. Here, we investigate how realistically the models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP, Phases 5 and 6) simulate Chile Niño/Niña (CN) events, and quantify their changes under anthropogenic forcing. Despite limitations of the global models in simulating realistically coastal upwelling dynamics, we show that they simulate reasonably well the observed spatial pattern, amplitude and seasonal evolution of CN events. They however fail to properly represent the positive skewness from observations. The analysis of a sub-group of models (36) that simulate ENSO realistically reveals that CN events increase in amplitude and variance in the future climate with no changes in their frequency of occurence. This is interpreted as resulting from compensating effects amongst changes in remote drivers and local feedbacks. In particular, ENSO variance increases while that of the South Pacific Oscillation decreases. Conversely, we found that while the Wind-Evaporation-SST feedback tends to increase and the coupling between mixed-layer depth and SST weakens, favoring the development of CN events, the thermocline and wind-SST feedbacks decrease. However, only the change in the thermocline feedback is correlated to changes in CN variance amongst the models, suggesting a dominant role of local oceanic stratification changes in constraining the sensitivity of CN to global warming.","We thank Pr.

174,pub.1173978277,10.1016/j.dark.2024.101584,,,Addressing the Hubble tension in Yukawa cosmology?,"In Yukawa cosmology, a recent discovery revealed a relationship between baryonic matter and the dark sector. The relation is described by the parameter α and the long-range interaction parameter λ - an intrinsic property of the graviton. Applying the uncertainty relation to the graviton raises a compelling question: Is there a quantum mechanical limit to the measurement precision of the Hubble constant ( H 0 )? We argue that the uncertainty relation for the graviton wavelength λ can be used to explain a running of H 0 with redshift. We show that the uncertainty in time has an inverse correlation with the value of the Hubble constant. That means that the measurement of the Hubble constant is intrinsically linked to length scales (redshift) and is connected to the uncertainty in time. On cosmological scales, we found that the uncertainty in time is related to the look-back time quantity. For measurements with a high redshift value, there is more uncertainty in time, which leads to a smaller value for the Hubble constant. Conversely, there is less uncertainty in time for local measurements with a smaller redshift value, resulting in a higher value for the Hubble constant. Therefore, due to the uncertainty relation, the Hubble tension is believed to arise from fundamental limitations inherent in cosmological measurements. Finally, our findings indicate that the mass of the graviton fluctuates with specific scales, suggesting a possible mass-varying mechanism for the graviton.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Such Yukawa-like corrections are encoded in two parameters, α and λ , that modify Newton’s law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter ℓ 0 , which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in α , which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to α M , mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to λ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the quasinormal frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the quasinormal modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of 1 0 − 9 , meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by 1 0 − 18 . Such Yukawa-like corrections are, therefore, difficult to measure by observations of gravitational waves using the current technology.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

NGC 1566 is a local face-on Seyfert galaxy and is known for exhibiting recurrent outbursts that are accompanied by changes in spectral type. The most recent transient event occurred from 2017 to 2019 and was reported to be accompanied by a change in Seyfert classification from Seyfert 1.8 to Seyfert 1.2.   Aims. We aim to study the transient event in detail by analyzing the variations in the optical broad-line profiles. In particular, we intend to determine the structure and kinematics of the broad-line region.   Methods. We analyzed data from an optical spectroscopic variability campaign of NGC 1566 taken with the 9.2 m Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between July 2018 and October 2019 triggered by the detection of hard X-ray emission in June 2018. We supplemented this data set with optical to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic archival data taken by VLT/MUSE in September 2015 and October 2017, and investigated the emission from different line species during the event.   Results. NGC 1566 exhibits pronounced spectral changes during the transient event. We observe the emergence and fading of a strong power-law-like blue continuum as well as strong variations in the Balmer, He  I , and He  II lines and the coronal lines [Fe  VII ], [Fe  X ], and [Fe  XI ]. Moreover, we detect broad double-peaked emission line profiles of O  I λ 8446 and the Ca  II λ λ 8498, 8542, 8662 triplet. This is the first time that genuine double-peaked O  I λ 8446 and Ca  II λ λ 8498, 8542, 8662 emission in AGN is reported in the literature. All broad lines show a clear redward asymmetry with respect to their central wavelength and we find indications for a significant blueward drift of the total line profiles during the transient event. The profiles and the FWHM of the Balmer lines remain largely constant during all observations. We show that the double-peaked emission line profiles are well approximated by emission from a low-inclination, relativistic eccentric accretion disk, and that single-peaked profiles can be obtained by broadening due to scale-height-dependent turbulence. Small-scale features in the O  I and Ca  II lines suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the broad-line region.   Conclusions. We conclude that the broad-line region in NGC 1566 is dominated by the kinematics of a relativistic eccentric accretion disk. The broad-line region can be modeled to be vertically stratified with respect to scale-height turbulence with O  I and Ca  II being emitted close to the disk in a region with high (column) density, while the Balmer and helium lines are emitted at greater scale height above the disk. The observed blueward drift might be attributed to a low-optical-depth wind launched during the transient event. Except for this wind, the observed kinematics of the broad-line region remain largely unchanged during the transient event.","The authors thank the anonymous referee for detailed and useful comments, which contributed significantly to the improvement of the manuscript.

This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between phthalate exposure and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis, using surrogate markers such as carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaques. The literature search was performed using four databases (Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, and Scopus), and this systematic review includes all available observational studies until July 6th, 2023. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed, and random effects models were used. Six high-quality cross-sectional studies and 2570 participants aged 12 to 70 were included. Six phthalate metabolites showed significant associations with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis. Exposure to MBzP, ΣDEHP, and MnBP was associated with increased carotid IMT. Exposure to MEP was associated with a higher prevalence of carotid plaques, and MiBP was associated with a lower prevalence. Mixed results were observed for MMP in older adults. The meta-analyses showed a high degree of heterogeneity, and the results are based on single studies. This study accurately describes the evidence of this association to date, suggesting that phthalates are associated with increased carotid IMT and a higher prevalence of carotid plaques. Further research is needed to elucidate this association, as phthalates are still used in the manufacture of everyday products, humans continue to be exposed to them, and atherosclerosis is a public health concern.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Environmental Pollution,,,Humans; Phthalic Acids; Carotid Artery Diseases; Environmental Exposure; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Environmental Pollutants; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies,2024-04-25,2024,2024-04-25,2024-06,350,,124044,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Mérida, Diana María; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Bayán-Bravo, Ana; Moreno-Franco, Belén; Laclaustra, Martín; Guallar-Castillón, Pilar","Mérida, Diana María (Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health.

Here we illustrate the conceptual and practical advantages of fitting stochastic population dynamics models to multi-species bacterial time series data. We show how the stability properties, fluctuation regimes and persistence probabilities of human vaginal microbial communities can be better understood by explicitly accommodating three sources of variability in ecological stochastic models of multi-species abundances: 1) stochastic biotic and abiotic forces, 2) ecological feedback and 3) sampling error. Rooting our modeling tool in stochastic population dynamics modeling theory was key to apply standardized measures of a community's reaction to environmental variation that ultimately depends on the nature and intensity of the intra-specific and inter-specific interaction strengths. Using estimates of model parameters, we developed a Risk Prediction Monitoring (RPM) tool that estimates temporal changes in persistence probabilities for any bacterial group of interest. This method mirrors approaches that are often used in conservation biology in which a measure of extinction risks is periodically updated with any change in a population or community. Additionally, we show how to use estimates of interaction strengths and persistence probabilities to formulate hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms and genetic composition that underpin different types of interactions. Instead of seeking a definition of ""dysbiosis"" we propose to translate concepts of theoretical ecology and conservation biology methods into practical approaches for the management of human-associated bacterial communities.","We would like to thank the valuable input and advice at various stages of this work from Drs Mark L Taper, Brian Dennis, and Robert D.

We systematically reviewed studies of the relationships between media use/influence, body image, and sociocultural appearance ideals in Latin America (CRD42021254607). We searched PsycINFO/Medline, Pubmed, Web of Science, ERIC, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations, SciElo, and LILACS for quantitative and qualitative peer-reviewed articles and doctoral theses in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Research conducted in Latin America, published 1991-2023, measuring a) media use/influence, and b) body image or appearance ideals was included. 68 articles met inclusion criteria, and quality appraisal concluded that most were of medium/high quality. A narrative review found consistent quantitative relationships, stronger in women than men, between media use/internalisation of media ideals and both body dissatisfaction and thinner appearance ideals. In contrast, participants in qualitative studies acknowledged media influence on their body image, but perceived greater influence from family and peers. Limitations included a predominance of cross-sectional research from Brazil and Mexico with adolescents and young adults. Additional longitudinal, experimental, and interventional work from elsewhere in Latin America is needed, recruiting more diverse samples and assessing more culturally salient appearance aspects (e.g., skin tone and hair texture).",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This research was supported by a Wellcome Trust research grant awarded to LB (217399/Z/19/Z).,Body Image,,,,2024-08-07,2024,2024-08-07,2024-12,51,,101774,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Andres, Fabienne E; Boothroyd, Lynda G; Thornborrow, Tracey; Chamorro, Ana Maria; Dutra, Natália B; Brar, Manjot; Woodward, Ruby; Malik, Neetu; Sawhney, Manya; Evans, Elizabeth H","Andres, Fabienne E (Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham, United Kingdom.

For example, sEMG biofeedback is shown to be beneficial in adults with swallowing disorders (dysphagia), whereas there are no easily identifiable studies to support such evidence in paediatrics. The current review aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing sEMG during swallowing tasks in paediatric populations with various diagnoses. Additionally, the review aimed to describe findings in publications involving participants with cerebral palsy (CP) and dysphagia. Paediatric-related publications were sourced using English keywords and phrases across the following seven databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. The search included all available publications without language and date restrictions. Publications using sEMG during chewing tasks were also accepted in the review as chewing is considered to be part of the act of swallowing. The feasibility of measuring sEMG during swallowing in children with various health conditions was supported by 116 publications (n = 6 literature reviews) that met the inclusion criteria for the final full-text review. However, a few publications described some difficulties occurring directly during the sEMG data collection sessions. The review identified 15 publications involving 177 participants with CP who underwent sEMG while swallowing (n = 1 publication focused solely on the assessment of chewing). Ten publications described studies that recruited children with dysphagia. Children with CP who had dysphagia were recruited in five of these studies.Conclusions: The acquisition of sEMG measurements while performing swallowing tasks was shown to be feasible in children with various diagnoses including those who have CP and dysphagia. Future studies should investigate the implementation of sEMG as a part of paediatric dysphagia therapy alongside biofeedback swallowing skill training.

Understanding and assessing cognitive loads when learning computer programming is key to supporting student learning. While there are instruments in English and German assessing the different types of cognitive loads, there is no validated instrument in Spanish. This study took place during the implementation of an online training program in basic programming, with a sample of 1162 students. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to validate the structure of the instrument. The results allowed us to establish a factorial structure of the subjective scale of differentiated cognitive loads, managing to measure the germane, intrinsic, and extraneous cognitive loads.

Radar estimates are obtained by applying an automatic method based on digital image processing, threshold segmentation and first-order derivative filters on X-Band radar variance images. The study site is covered by the endemic Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow at the seabed. It represents a challenge on the estimation of local shoreline. Results reveal that X-band radar estimate the shoreline location with a mean bias of 4.66 m, a relative error of 2.95% and a RMSE of 14.07 m. Also, the beach morphology is assessed by the identification of surrounding rocky outcrops and a submerged sandbar. Since the obtained radar estimation errors are comparable with the reported by previous studies but using video-cameras, results reveal a potential complementary use of both marine radars and optical cameras to provide higher-resolution and more accurate shoreline measurements in a broader area.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1780,pub.1171320227,10.1007/s13369-024-08794-0,,,Development of a Machine Learning (ML)-Based Computational Model to Estimate the Engineering Properties of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC),"Portland cement concrete (PCC) is the construction material most used worldwide. Hence, its proper characterization is fundamental for the daily-basis engineering practice. Nonetheless, the experimental measurements of the PCC’s engineering properties (i.e., Poisson’s Ratio -v-, Elastic Modulus -E-, Compressive Strength -ComS-, and Tensile Strength -TenS-) consume considerable amounts of time and financial resources. Therefore, the development of high-precision indirect methods is fundamental. Accordingly, this research proposes a computational model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to simultaneously predict the v, E, ComS, and TenS. For this purpose, the Long-Term Pavement Performance database was employed as the data source. In this regard, the mix design parameters of the PCC are adopted as input variables. The performance of the DNN model was evaluated with 1:1 lines, goodness-of-fit parameters, Shapley additive explanations assessments, and running time analysis. The results demonstrated that the proposed DNN model exhibited an exactitude higher than 99.8%, with forecasting errors close to zero (0). Consequently, the machine learning-based computational model designed in this investigation is a helpful tool for estimating the PCC’s engineering properties when laboratory tests are not attainable. Thus, the main novelty of this study is creating a robust model to determine the v, E, ComS, and TenS by solely considering the mix design parameters. Likewise, the central contribution to the state-of-the-art achieved by the present research effort is the public launch of the developed computational tool through an open-access GitHub repository, which can be utilized by engineers, designers, agencies, and other stakeholders.","The authors thank the Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) and the Universidad del Norte for funding this investigation through the “Research Project 745/2016, Contract 037-2017, No. 1215-745-59105”.",Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.,Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering,,,,2024-05-03,2024,2024-05-03,2024-10,49,10,14351-14365,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo; Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita; Duque, Jose","Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Duque, Jose (Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Charles University; Universidad del Norte)","Polo-Mendoza, Rodrigo (Charles University; Universidad del Norte); Martinez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Universidad del Norte); Peñabaena-Niebles, Rita (Universidad del Norte); Duque, Jose (Charles University; University of the Coast)",1,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13369-024-08794-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171320227,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The study aimed to determine variability of textural properties, suspended sediment concentration, effective density, and settling velocity under non-stationary, stratified, and turbid conditions. The suspended sediment consisted of 84.3% silt-size material (3.9–62.5 μm), with the remaining 15.7% a sand-size fraction (62.5–177 μm). Nevertheless, most of these fractions consisted of flocs, up to 995 μm in size, composed of primary particles that ranged in size from 9 to 35 μm. Most sediments were very poorly sorted, near symmetrical and platykurtic, with mean volumetric suspended sediment concentration, settling velocity, and effective density values of 253.1 μl l−1, 5.8 × 10−3 mm s−1, and 0.96 kg m−3, respectively. These properties exhibited significant depth-related differences regardless of tidal phase. Data dispersion also increased with depth. Our findings illustrate the influence of stratification on suspended sediment properties, with marked vertical variability over short time scales. Textural properties highlighted different multi-modal features of grain-size distribution. The study also revealed spatial and temporal transitions associated with contrasting sediment transport conditions. Textural analysis enabled comprehensive interpretation of large datasets obtained through laser diffraction measurements.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests.

Advancements in AI algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy.   Objectives To survey trends in AI research in paediatric radiology. To evaluate use cases, tasks, research methodologies and underlying data. To identify potential biases and future directions.   Methods A systematic search of paediatric radiology AI studies published from 2015 to 2021 was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. The search included papers utilizing AI techniques for radiological diagnosis or intervention in patients aged under 18. Narrative synthesis was used due to methodological heterogeneity.   Results A total of 292 articles were included, with an increasing annual trend in the number of published articles. Neuroradiology and musculoskeletal radiology were the most common subspecialties. MRI was the dominant imaging modality, with segmentation and classification as the most common tasks. Retrospective cohort studies constituted the majority of research designs. Data quality and quantity varied, as did the choice of research design, data sources, and evaluation metrics.   Conclusions AI literature in paediatric radiology shows rapid growth, with advancements in various subspecialties and tasks.

1496,pub.1175738369,10.1103/physrevb.110.125129,,,Average spin Chern number,"In this work we propose the average spin Chern number (ASCN) as an indicator of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within insulating materials. Whenever this number is a nonzero even integer, it distinguishes the material as a spin Chern insulator, and the number is a topological invariant whenever there is a symmetry that commutes with the spin and protects Chern numbers. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the material has nontrivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the value of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the band gap. For systems where the spin commutes with the Hamiltonian, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the noncommutativity of the spin with the Hamiltonian cannot be neglected, both values are nonzero simultaneously. The ASCN is therefore a good complement for the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and permits us to detect topological information of the material, which is not possible alone from the value of the SHC.","R.G.-H. gratefully acknowledges the computational time granted on the supercomputer MOGON 2 at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.

The temperature- and angle-dependent torque magnetometry measurements revealed at least nine different frequencies ranging from ∼10 T up to ∼9000 T. These frequencies correspond to extremal areas of the Fermi surface ranging from ∼0.2% up to 50% of the first Brillouin zone, qualitatively consistent with the electronic band structure calculations. The angle-dependent dHvA oscillation frequencies indicate that the smaller pockets of the Fermi surface have an almost three-dimensional character whereas the bigger pockets of the Fermi surface are mostly two dimensional. We also find evidence of the presence of light [0.28(1)m0] as well as heavy [2.37(18)m0] charge carriers through the analysis of the temperature dependence of dominant frequencies. The comparison of the observed frequencies with the electronic band structure calculations indicates that the heavy masses correspond to saddle-point-like features of electronic band structure at the M point. The observation of the multiple low frequencies and the calculated contributions from various bands to such low frequencies prevent the estimation of the topological nature of bands containing lighter fermions. In conclusion, our work reveals the features of a Fermi surface containing enhanced mass fermions originating from saddle points in the electronic band structure at the M point, which is inherent to kagome lattices.","This work is based upon the work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DMR- 2213443.

Using genetic screening platform we identify MAPK14 (which encodes the protein kinase p38α) as a specific requirement for HGEC in spheroid culture. MAPK14 /p38α has broad roles in programing the phosphoproteome, transcriptome and metabolome of HGEC spheroids, yet has negligible impact on monolayer cultures. MAPK14 promotes tumorigenicity in vivo and is specifically required to sustain a sub-population of spheroid cells that is enriched in cancer stemness markers. Therefore, spheroid growth of HGEC activates unique biological programs, including p38α signaling, that cannot be captured using 2D culture models and are highly relevant to malignant disease pathology.","We thank Dr. Pablo Ariel for his assistance in microscopy image acquisition and data analysis.

Lithological Control on Contribution to Silt‐ to Clay‐Sized Fractions,"Abstract The composition of 27 fluvial silt and clay sediments was used in this study to identify and quantify the processes in the upper valley of the Magdalena river in South Colombia. The combination of seismic activity, intense precipitation, and landsliding resulted in limited chemical weathering and a very efficient transfer of weathered products to the transfer zone of both tributary rivers and the main trunk. Inputs from plutonic, high‐grade metamorphic, volcanic, and low‐ to medium‐grade metamorphic lithologies vary in coarse silt‐sized versus fine silt‐ and clay‐sized sediments, reflecting inherited textural parameters and mineralogy. Plutonic and high‐grade metamorphic rocks mostly produce sand‐sized sediments, up to two times more than coase silt and up to 10 times more than fine silt to clay. The prevalence of siltstone in the area enhances the contribution of sedimentary rocks to fine silt and clay (up to 50% higher than to sand). Volcanic rocks mainly produce coarse silt (up to 2.5 times more than sand). Low‐grade metamorphic detritus is enriched in silt and clay (up to 5–7 times). These findings highlight the critical role of lithology in regulating sediment generation. The study's approach can establish or modify factors modeling lithological control on suspended sediment flux, such as in the BQART equation.
Plain Language Summary This study examines the production of sediment finer than sand (clay and silt) from different rock types in a region with enhanced sediment transfer, tropical climate and earthquakes: the upper reaches of the Magdalena river in Colombia. Compositional data of river sediments were analyzed with statistical methods and subjected to mathematical modeling. Sediment compositions demonstrate that extreme rainfall is able to move sediment produced by landslides before it is significantly modified by environmental influences. Our mathematical models show how bedrock characteristics affect the production of clay, silt and sand. This highlights the need to consider rock type as a crucial control in any sediment production‐related study. The approach presented in this study has the potential to establish or modify correction factors for local or global modeling of sediment production, transport and transfer.
Key Points    Textural and compositional signatures of silt‐ and clay‐sized sediment reflect fast sediment removal from the weathering environment   Textural parameters and mineralogical assemblages of drainage lithologies determine differential contributions to sand, silt, and clay   Lithological characteristics have to be considered as major control in studies focusing on sediment flux and budgets",Acknowledgments This study was partially funded by grants from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; Project CA 2099/2‐1) and Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD; 57448047) to Luca Caracciolo.

nilpotent graph of the symmetric group of degree n is disconnected if and only
if n or n-1 is a prime number, and no finite non-nilpotent group has a
self-complementary nilpotent graph. For the dihedral group Dn, it is determined
the number of connected components of its nilpotent graph is one more than n
when n is odd; or one more than the 2'-part of n when n is even. In addition, a
formula for the number of connected components of the nilpotent graph of

sufficient conditions for specific subsets of a group, containing connected

We employ a multiorbital Slater-Koster tight-binding approach to derive effective   k · p   -type Hamiltonians that describes the dominant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects of the Rashba and intrinsic origin at the high  Γ  and  S  high symmetry points in phosphorene. In the absence of SOC effects a minimal admixture of   p z   and   p y   atomic orbitals suffices to reproduce the well-known anisotropy of highest valence and the lowest conduction bands at the  Γ  point, consistent with density functional theory (DFT) and   k · p   methods. In contrast, the inclusion of the   p x   and  s  atomic orbitals are rather crucial for an adequate description of the SOC effects in phosphorene at low energies, particularly at the  S  point. We introduce useful analytical expressions for the Rashba and intrinsic SOC parameters in terms of the relevant Slater-Koster integrals. In addition, we report simple formulas for the interband dipole strengths, revealing the nature of the strong anisotropic behavior of its lower bands.

In this context, a viable option is biomass, since by subjecting it to chemical processes such as pyrolysis, it is possible to obtain platform molecules that are the basis for the generation of value-added chemical products. Acetals are molecules obtained from biomass derivatives, which have various applications in cosmetic chemistry, in the pharmaceutical industry as intermediates or final compounds, food additives, among others. Different catalysts have been used in the acetalization reaction, including MOFs, which have the advantage of being porous materials with high surface area values. The large surface area translates into a greater number of catalytically active sites available for the reaction. Among the MOFs that have been used for this purpose is MOF-808, which is characterized by having a lower number of ligands attached to its metal cluster, therefore, it has a greater exposure of the metals that make up its structure. In this context, the work carried out studied the catalytic performance of MOF-808 when its Zr(IV) metal centers are replaced by Hf(IV) and Ce(IV) atoms in the acetalization reaction of benzaldehyde with methanol. The MOFs obtained by solvothermal synthesis were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption and desorption, FT-IR spectroscopy, acid-base potentiometric titration, XPS and thermogravimetric analysis. The results of the catalysis indicate that the MOF with the best performance was MOF-808-Ce, which achieved conversions greater than 80% in a period of ten minutes. MOF-808-Ce exhibits a higher number of defects and therefore a higher availability of catalytic sites for the reaction to occur, which explains the better performance. Finally, the performance of MOF-808 in the acetalization of benzaldehyde with methanol was also supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",,,Dalton Transactions,,,,2024-09-25,2024,2024,2024-09-25,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Arellano, Yazmín; Pazo, César; Roa, Vanesa; Hidalgo-Rosa, Yoan; Zarate, Ximena; Llanos, Jaime; Escalona, Nestor; Schott, Eduardo","Arellano, Yazmín (Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Centro de Energía UC, CIEN-UC, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna, 4860, Santiago, Chile. maschotte@gmail.com.; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.); Pazo, César (Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Centro de Energía UC, CIEN-UC, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna, 4860, Santiago, Chile. maschotte@gmail.com.; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.); Roa, Vanesa (Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Centro de Energía UC, CIEN-UC, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna, 4860, Santiago, Chile. maschotte@gmail.com.; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.); Hidalgo-Rosa, Yoan (Centro de Nanotecnología Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Camino La Pirámide 5750, Huechuraba, Santiago, Chile 8580745.; Escuela de Ingeniería del Medio Ambiente y Sustentabilidad, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Camino La Pirámide 5750, Huechuraba, 8580745 Santiago, Chile.); Zarate, Ximena (Instituto de Ciencias Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Santiago, Chile.); Llanos, Jaime (Departamento de Química, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.); Escalona, Nestor (ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.; Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Bioprocesos, Escuela de Ingeniería, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago, Chile.; Departamento de Química Física, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.); Schott, Eduardo (Departamento de Química Inorgánica, Facultad de Química y de Farmacia, Centro de Energía UC, CIEN-UC, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna, 4860, Santiago, Chile. maschotte@gmail.com.; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.)",,"Arellano, Yazmín (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.); Pazo, César (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.); Roa, Vanesa (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.); Hidalgo-Rosa, Yoan (Universidad Mayor; Universidad Mayor); Zarate, Ximena (Universidad Autónoma de Chile); Llanos, Jaime (Catholic University of the North); Escalona, Nestor (ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Schott, Eduardo (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Millennium Nuclei on Catalytic Process Towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC), Chile.)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1039/d4dt01959h,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175662117,34 Chemical Sciences; 3402 Inorganic Chemistry,

Natural and Anthropic Controls on the Sand Fraction,"Abstract This study investigates the upper Magdalena river basin (Colombia), which is characterized by tectonic activity, tropical climate, heterogeneous lithological assemblages, and anthropic influence. It aims to comprehend factors controlling sediment generation, flux, and composition by incorporating petrographic data from 27 recent fluvial samples along with geochemistry, geomorphological parameters, historical precipitation, land cover, landsliding and suspended sediment load data. The analysis shows mismatches between sand composition and drainage lithology distribution. A new set of endmember mixing models is presented, quantifying the impacts of erodibility, sand generation potential (related to lithology), and sediment connectivity between hillslopes and river outlets (related to geomorphology). Results show enhanced sediment generation from sedimentary rocks (up to 40%) due to high erodibility, and decreased sediment flux from low‐ to medium‐grade metamorphic rocks (up to 60%) due to controlling morphometric parameters. Overrepresentation of plutonic and high‐grade metamorphic rocks and underrepresentation of volcanic rocks (up to 100%) are controlled by mineralogical and textural parameters. Enhanced landsliding activity in areas with volcanic activity occasionally overshadows basin‐wide compositional trends driven by morphological and lithological characteristics, as it controls rare overrepresentation of volcanic and low‐grade metamorphic detritus in the sand fraction. Sediment retention by hydroelectric dams significantly decreases suspended sediment flux by 30%, while deforestation plays a minor role in sediment flux. This study underscores the importance of coupling sediment generation, geomorphology and the distribution of stochastic events related to seismic activity in any sediment production‐focused study and for developing numerical models in Quantitative Provenance Analysis (QPA).
Plain Language Summary This study examines what controls the production of sand and its transport in rivers in a region with a tropical climate, earthquakes, different rock types and human interventions in nature: the upper reaches of the Magdalena River in Colombia. Compositional data of river sediment along with various spatial data sets have been used. The analysis shows that rock types do not occur in the same proportions in the sand as they do in the catchment areas. A new mathematical model is presented showing how different rock types and characteristics of the mountain slopes affect sand production and transport. Mobilization of sediment by landslides can significantly alter sand compositions, particularly in areas with active volcanism. Sediment transport in suspension decreased by 30% due to the operation of the hydroelectric Betania dam. This study underscores the importance of carefully considering rock type and geomorphology in any study on sediment production and transport as well as in creating mathematical models in this field.
Key Points    Lithological characteristics and hillslope morphometry are the dominant controls on sand generation and flux in the Upper Magdalena Valley   The distribution of landsliding events locally overshadows lithological and morphometric basin‐wide controls on sand compositions   The construction of hydroelectric reservoirs decreased suspended sediment flux by 30%","Acknowledgments This study was partially funded by Grants from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; Project CA 2099/2‐1) and Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD; 57448047) to Luca Caracciolo.

thermal gradient in magnetically ordered systems. The effect was previously
considered excluded in compensated magnetic materials with collinear ordering.
However, in the recently identified class of compensated magnetic materials,
dubbed altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking in the electronic band
structure makes the presence of the anomalous Nernst effect possible despite
the collinear spin arrangement. In this work, we investigate epitaxial Mn5Si3
thin films known to be an altermagnetic candidate. We show that the material
manifests a sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient despite the small net
magnetization of the films. The measured magnitudes of the anomalous Nernst
coefficient reach a scale of microVolts per Kelvin. We support our
magneto-thermoelectric measurements by density-functional theory calculations
of the material's spin-split electronic structure, which allows for the finite
Berry curvature in the reciprocal space. Furthermore, we present our
calculations of the intrinsic Berry-curvature Nernst conductivity, which agree
with our experimental observations.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-03-19,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Badura, Antonin; Campos, Warlley H.; Bharadwaj, Venkata K.; Kounta, Ismaïla; Michez, Lisa; Petit, Matthieu; Rial, Javier; Leiviskä, Miina; Baltz, Vincent; Krizek, Filip; Kriegner, Dominik; Zemen, Jan; Telkamp, Sjoerd; Sailler, Sebastian; Lammel, Michaela; Ubiergo, Rodrigo Jaeschke; Hellenes, Anna Birk; González-Hernández, Rafael; Sinova, Jairo; Jungwirth, Tomáš; Goennenwein, Sebastian T.

The sources for the analysis included a revision of its contemporary discussion in printed media coupled with an analysis of TV shows currently available on streaming services and interviews with relevant figures of the time. The television content shot on location was praised for representing the nation, while simultaneously giving rise to debates about decentralization, which was finally addressed by the creation of regional broadcasters. The hybrid system fostered diversity, production quality, and a national representation that was strongly contested from the regions. At the same time, the system unintendedly hampered the creation of an audiovisual archive, and complaints about its tender systems resonate with the plight of contemporary public service broadcasting in Colombia.","We would like to thank the students in the Práctica Investigativa courses of 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 at the School of Social Communication and Journalism, Universidad Externado de Colombia for their work digitalizing TV magazines, and to César Mora Moreo, Alessandra Puccini Montoya, Danna Guerrero, Camila Tenjo, María Alejandra Pérez, Daniela Martín Sanabria, Sofía Sepúlveda and Laura Rosero for setting up and transcribing research interviews.","Universidad de La Sabana, code COM-110-2023, grupo de investigación Cultura Audiovisual.

Over time, these rankings have evolved into crucial references for both students and academic institutions when making decisions. Several well-established university rankings, such as the QS and Scimago Ranking, utilize various evaluation criteria to classify universities. However, these criteria may adversely affect universities in different regions, including Latin America. In this study, we aim to address the unique reality of Latin American universities, considering their specific characteristics and challenges. Our focus will be on a comprehensive review of the evaluation criteria used in these two renowned rankings and their impact on the region, including how they influence the performance of universities. We propose a novel ranking model using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to counter these potential biases and regional disparities. This multicriteria optimization approach enables us to evaluate and compare universities based on multiple criteria, considering their similarities to the ideal solution and differences from the anti-ideal solution. By adopting the TOPSIS method, we aim to create a more robust and balanced approach incorporating carefully selected criteria. It allows us to include economic and inclusion criteria often overlooked in conventional rankings. Our study seeks to establish a fairer, more relevant university ranking system tailored to Latin America's needs and aspirations. Our proposed TOPSIS-based model aims to contribute significantly to the ongoing discussions on higher education excellence in Latin America by providing a comprehensive evaluation considering the region's specific circumstances.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, there is a lack of information regarding which specific nature-based recreation activities are related to specific well-being indicators. We conducted a cross-sectional study to explore how different types of nature-based recreation (i.e., any nature-based activities, forest-based activities, gardening, nature-based adventure activities) related to five indicators of well-being on the WHO-5 index among American (n = 606), Brazilian (n = 448), and Spanish (n = 438) adults. Americans and Brazilians who reported engaging in nature-based recreation at least monthly in the last 12 months, or weekly during a typical week, were more likely to feel cheerful, relaxed, vigorous, rested after waking up, and interested in life than those who did not engage that frequently. Results in these two countries were similar across all five indicators of well-being and types of nature-based activity, except for gardening, where we observed slightly weaker correlations. In Spain, the correlation between nature-based recreation and well-being tended to be null or even negative, highlighting some variability in these relationships across countries.

It is a crucial aspect of human behavior, affecting everything from interpersonal relationships to mental health. The relationship between ER and Attachment Theory (AT) is pivotal. AT suggests that early bonds with primary caregivers influence future relationship expectations and behaviors. These initial experiences shape internal models of self and others, affecting how individuals regulate their emotions. Understanding the interplay between ER and AT is essential for comprehending the human affective system. In this study, we explored the neural underpinnings of ER, focusing on two distinct strategies: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined changes in neural oscillations from 52 adults during an ER task. Specifically, we observed increased frontal theta activity (3-6 Hz) during reappraisal compared to suppression strategies. This frontal theta activity suggests enhanced cognitive control engagement. Conversely, during suppression, we noted a decrease in beta frequency (15-30 Hz) activity from central electrodes, indicative of differing neural processes. Further integrating psychological theories, we explored the relationship between these neural markers and dimensions of human attachment. Employing the Experiences in Close Relationships-12 scale (ECR-12), we identified a negative correlation between attachment anxiety and frontal theta activity. Lower levels of attachment anxiety were associated with increased theta activity, reflecting potentially more effective emotion regulation. Additionally, we found that higher theta activity corresponded with fewer difficulties in emotional control measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Regarding central beta activity, our findings revealed an interesting correlation with Emotional Inattention, a concept tied to Attachment Avoidance. This suggests that central beta activity may serve as a neural marker for specific attachment-related ER processing. These results highlight the distinct neural pathways involved in different ER strategies and their relationship with the AT and neural responses during emotional processing.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Our framework is based on a sequential structure imposed on a Banach space, which allows us to deduce properties of interpolation methods from properties of sequential structures. Our framework has a formulation modelled after both the real and the complex interpolation methods. This enables us to extend various results, previously known only for either the real or the complex interpolation method, to all interpolation methods that fit into our framework. As applications, we prove an interpolation result for analytic operator families and an interpolation result for intersections.",,,Advances in Mathematics,,,,2024-03,2024,,2024-03,440,,109506,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lindemulder, Nick; Lorist, Emiel","Lindemulder, Nick (Institute of Analysis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Englerstraße 2, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany); Lorist, Emiel (Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics, Delft University of Technology, P.O.

422,pub.1170366028,10.1007/s10064-024-03643-8,,,Analytical and experimental studies on toppling behavior of blocks misaligned with the slope face,"The stability of potentially toppling rock blocks has been typically addressed for the case of regular block geometries showing symmetry planes and resting on surfaces aligned with the slope face, i.e., the strike of the slope is parallel to the block sides and their basal planes. However, these simple geometries with ideally oriented blocks are not often found in nature. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap through analytical and experimental approaches, in the form of laboratory physical models, to study toppling cases for non-conventional scenarios. An engineering geology review was first conducted, identifying potential non-standard cases in nature. Then, the current analytical solutions for both the factor of safety and critical toppling angle were modified for these misaligned cases, focusing on single block and standard block toppling, and considering the effect of block-edge rounding. Physical models support the analytical approach. It is concluded that toppling stability is slightly improved when the orientation of the basal plane of the blocks differs with the strike of the slope. In this way, for single blocks, the critical toppling angle increases a few tenths of a degree when the difference between strikes is 10°, about 1° with strike differences about 20° and 2 to 3° for misalignments about 30°. Similar increases are observed for block toppling cases. Accordingly, small differences in strike of basal planes and the slope contribute to slightly increasing the factor of safety of slopes prone to block toppling. This approach improves practical engineering toppling stability analyses.","The first author Jingyun Gui acknowledges China Scholarship Council (CSC) for her stay at the University of Vigo by means of a CSC grant number 202106560049.

I show that this similarity is due to the presence of global spatial trends in the variables (first-order non-stationarity), which produce spurious regressions. Formal tests and graphical models confirm that any variable displaying a core–periphery spatial pattern produces similar predictions for European regional per capita income. Empirical tests of spatial theories should thus pay attention to the geographical features of the administrative units and the global spatial trends of the variables analysed.","Previous drafts of this paper have been presented in various forums, such as the Spanish Association of International Economics and Finance (Salamanca, Spain), Spanish Regional Science Association (Bilbao, Spain), European Regional Science Association (Lisbon, Portugal), Meeting of Economics at the National Polytechnic School (Quito, Ecuador), workshop in honour of Geoffrey Hewings (Santiago de Compostela, Spain), School of Geographical Sciences (Bristol, United Kingdom), Department of Global Economics and Management (Groningen, The Netherlands); and the Departments of Economics of the following universities: A Coruña and Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain), Catholic University of the North (Chile) and Porto (Portugal).

Utilizing a cross-configuration involving inhomogeneous static electric fields and homogeneous static magnetic fields, the analysis of the probability of bosons pair production identifies three different regimes determined by a critical magnetic field. Below the critical value, creation is exponentially suppressed; at the critical value, the number density of created bosons remains constant, and above the critical field, there is exponential amplification. This behavior prompts an additional investigation using von Neumann entanglement entropy to analyze fluctuations in the bosonic vacuum.","LBC acknowledges the support provided in part by funds from CNPq, Brazil, Grant No. 311925/2020-0, FAPEMA, and CAPES - Finance code 001.

Considering the electromagnetic interaction as a minimal coupling, an incorrect value is identified for the gyromagnetic factor (g-factor). Furthermore, it is shown that it is cumbersome to find analytical solutions due to the presence of the so-called anomalous term for the spin-1 sector of the DKP theory. Suspecting that the anomalous term results from an incomplete version of the DKP equation to describe the electromagnetic interaction, we consider the addition of a non-minimal coupling. This leads to the correct g-factor and, as a consequence, the anomalous term becomes proportional to an external four current. As an application, the DKP equation with a static uniform magnetic field is considered, yielding the corresponding Landau levels.","This work was supported in part by means of funds provided by CNPq, Brazil, Grants No. 09126/2019-3 and 311925/2020-0, FAPEMA and CAPES - Finance code 001.

Centromere pattern (AC-3) observed in the immunofluorescence assay in HEp-2 cells (HEp-2-IFA) suggests the presence of antibodies against CENP antigens, mainly CENP-B/A. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of reactivity to CENP-B and CENP-A in samples with an AC-3 pattern in the HEp-2-IFA. We also correlated the demographic and clinical characteristics of SSc patients according to the presence of the AC-3 pattern.   Methods Samples from 39 SSc patients with AC-3 pattern were included and evaluated for CENP-B/A reactivity by line-blot and indirect ELISA. As controls, 48 lcSSc without the AC-3 pattern (Non-AC-3 group) were included. Clinical characteristics were recovered for 69 patients, 21 with AC-3 and all those in the Non-AC-3 group.   Results  Out of 39 samples with AC-3, 33 (84.6%) were reactive against CENP-B and 32 (82.1%) were reactive against CENP-A using the line-blot assay. Using anti-CENP-B ELISA, 36 (92.3%) of the samples with AC-3 were positive for anti-CENP-B. There was 79.5% concordance for CENP-B reactivity between ELISA and line-blot. Using the immunoblot assay, 27 (69.2%) of the samples with AC-3 were reactive against CENP-B and CENP-A, and one sample was positive only for CENP-A. Altogether, 38 samples (97.4%) were reactive against CENP-B by at least one method and all 39 samples (100%) were positive for either CENP-B or CENP-A in at least one of the tests. Regarding the clinical features, interstitial lung disease was less frequent in patients with AC-3 pattern compared to Non-AC-3 (10% versus 54.2%; p=0.001). Other organ involvement parameters had similar frequencies between the groups.    Conclusions In conclusion, the HEp-2-IFA method was 100% sensitive in detecting antibodies to CENP-A and CENP-B. Anti-CENP-B is the predominant autoantibody in samples yielding the AC-3 pattern, but exclusive anti-CENP-A reactivity was observed less frequently. Among lcSSc patients, anti-centromere reactivity was associated with less frequent lung involvement.",,"This study was funded by Sao Paulo Government agency FAPESP (Sao Paulo State Research Foundation) grant numbers #2017/20745-1 and #2021/04588-9, granted to G.D.K. and L.D.

A simple model of a harmonic oscillator is employed to estimate the dissociation energy of the N–S poles, as well as the corresponding breakdown temperature and internal pressure. The results indicate that the separation of magnetic poles occurs in two states: (a) in an ultra-hot plasma medium with extremely high temperatures, such as in the core of a hot star and (b) at extremely high pressures, such as between internal plates in complex superlattices of layered solids. The breakdown temperature is found to be on the order of [Formula: see text]–[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]K, which is only achievable in an ultra-hot plasma environment as the fifth phase of matter. Based on this model, the possibility of dissociation of bonds between N and S magnetic poles for solid superlattices under very high pressures between crystal plates is also calculated. The results suggest that the presence of isolated magnetic monopoles in superlattices of solids under ultra-high-pressure conditions is possible. Consequently, the model proposes that the conductivity of magnetic monopole carriers can be applied in the manipulation of nanomaterials for the production of advanced devices, such as new generations of superconductors, new spin devices and magnetic-electronics, advanced materials with magnetic monopoles and super-dielectrics.","Prabir Rudra acknowledges the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India for granting visiting associateship.",,International Journal of Modern Physics D,,,,2024-01-15,2024,2024-01-29,2024-01-15,33,01,2350115,All OA; Green,Article,"Bagheri-Mohagheghi, Mohammad Mehdi; Pourhassan, Behnam; Saridakis, Emmanuel; Capozziello, Salvatore; Rudra, Prabir","Bagheri-Mohagheghi, Mohammad Mehdi (School of Physics, Damghan University, Damghan 3671641167, Iran); Pourhassan, Behnam (School of Physics, Damghan University, Damghan 3671641167, Iran; Physics Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul 34469, Turkey; Canadian Quantum Research Center 204-3002 32 Ave Vernon, BC V1T 2L7, Canada; University of British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, Canada); Saridakis, Emmanuel (Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS), National Observatory of Athens, Athens, Greece; Deep Space Exploration Laboratory/School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China; Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Católica del Norte Avda.

261,pub.1166534048,10.1016/j.dark.2023.101394,,,Compact stars in scalar–tensor theories with a single-well potential and the corresponding f ( R ) theory,"The macroscopic properties of compact stars in modified gravity theories can be significantly different from the general relativistic (GR) predictions. Within the gravitational context of scalar–tensor theories, with a scalar field ϕ and coupling function Φ ( ϕ ) = exp [ 2 ϕ / 3 ] , we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium structure of neutron stars for the simple potential V ( ϕ ) = ω ϕ 2 / 2 defined in the Einstein frame (EF). From the scalar field in the EF, we also interpret such theories as f ( R ) gravity in the corresponding Jordan frame (JF). The mass–radius relations, proper mass, and binding energy are obtained for a polytropic equation of state (EoS) in the JF. Our results reveal that the maximum-mass values increase substantially as ω gets smaller, while the radius and mass decrease in the low-central-density region as we move further away from the pure GR scenario. Furthermore, a cusp is formed when the binding energy is plotted as a function of the proper mass, which indicates the appearance of instability. Specifically, we find that the central-density value where the binding energy is a minimum corresponds precisely to d M / d ρ c J = 0 on the M ( ρ c J ) -curve.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Such a construction is based on the symmetric teleparallel geometry, but apart form the non-metricity scalar Q we incorporate in the Lagrangian the boundary term C of its difference from the standard Levi-Civita Ricci scalar R̊. We extract the general metric and affine connection field equations, we apply them at a cosmological framework, and adopting three different types of symmetric teleparallel affine connections we obtain the modified Friedmann equations. As we show, we acquire an effective dark-energy sector of geometrical origin, which can lead to interesting cosmological phenomenology. Additionally, we may obtain an effective interaction between matter and dark energy. Finally, examining a specific model, we show that we can obtain the usual thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, while the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter can be quintessence-like, phantom-like, or cross the phantom-divide during evolution.",,,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,,,,2024-03-01,2024,2024-03-26,2024-03-01,2024,03,050,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"De, Avik; Loo, Tee-How; Saridakis, Emmanuel N.","De, Avik (Department of Mathematical and Actuarial Sciences, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Sungai Long, Cheras 43000, Malaysia); Loo, Tee-How (Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia); Saridakis, Emmanuel N.

In particular, thin films of TMDCs can be used in photovoltaic devices. In this work, we employ ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the G 0 W 0-BSE approach to accurately compute the optoelectronic properties of thin films of 2H-TMDCs composed of Mo, W, S, and Se. Subsequently, we evaluate their photovoltaic performance, including exciton recombination effects, and show that this is a key ingredient. We obtain efficiencies of up to 29% for a 200 nm thick film of WSe2, thus providing an upper limit. We also include other phenomenological recombination mechanisms that could be present in the current samples. This slightly reduces efficiencies, indicating that even with current synthesis technologies, there is still potential for further enhancement of TMDCs’ performance in photovoltaic applications.","E.M. and A.R.R. acknowledge the financial support from the Brazilian agency FAPESP, grant nos 20/13172-8 and 2017/02317-2.

The methodology used was quantitative, with multivariate data analysis through structural equation modelling. The sample consisted of 604 students of technological higher education from the São Paulo State Technological Colleges. The results proved that the female gender had a more intense influence on self-efficacy and persistence influence on entrepreneurial intention. The male gender had a more significant influence on the relationship between sociability and entrepreneurial intention. For technological higher education institutions to implement an effective entrepreneurial education, it is fundamental to encourage entrepreneurial characteristics differently between genders.

Our investigation focuses on teleparallelism and involves a gravitational model featuring two scalar fields, where one scalar field is coupled to the torsion scalar. We consider coupling in the two scalar fields’ kinetic and potential components. We employ exponential functions for the scalar field potentials and analyse the field equations’ equilibrium points to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Remarkably, we discover many equilibrium points in this multiscalar field model, capable of describing various eras of cosmological evolution. Hence, this model can be used to describe the early and late time acceleration phases of the universe and as a unification model for the elements of the dark sector of the universe.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Unlike existing methods that rely on labor-intensive trial-and-error experiments, our proposed approach leverages a multilayer perceptron network. To develop this approach, we compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising 271 sets and 3,252 experimental data points. Our methodology involved evaluating 22,246 network configurations, employing Monte Carlo cross-validation over 20 iterations, and using 4 training algorithms, resulting in a total of 1,779,680 training iterations. This results in an optimized model that integrates diverse mix design parameters, enabling accurate predictions of permeability and compressive strength even in the absence of experimental data, achieving R² values of 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. Sensitivity analyses validate the model's alignment with established principles of pervious concrete behavior. By demonstrating the efficacy of machine learning as a complementary tool for optimizing pervious concrete mix designs, this research not only addresses current methodological limitations but also lays the groundwork for more efficient and effective approaches in the field.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Pablo Pujadas reports financial support was provided by Government of Catalonia Agency for Administration of University and Research Grants.

This mechanism introduces new scalars and Majorana fermions to the Standard Model. It assumes the existence of a global    U ( 1 )  ×   Z   2     symmetry which after partial breaking provides the stability of the dark matter candidates of the theory. The rich structure of the potential allows for the possibility of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe which can lead to the generation of primordial gravitational waves. Taking into account relevant constraints from lepton flavor violation, neutrino physics, as well as the trilinear Higgs couplings at next-to-leading order accuracy, we have found a wide range of possible FOPTs which are strong enough to be probed at the proposed gravitational-wave interferometer experiments such as LISA.

However, it shows great biodiversity harboring vast forms of adapted life and can be used as a model of desertification processes. While desertification is increasing as result of climate change and human activities, is necessary to optimize soil and water usage, where stress-resistant crops are possible solutions. As many studies have revealed the great impact of rhizobiome over plant growth efficiency and resistance to abiotic stress, we set up to explore the rhizospheric soils of Suaeda foliosa and Distichlis spicata from the Atacama Desert. By culturing these soils and using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we address the community taxonomy composition dynamics, the stability through time and the ability to promote lettuce plants growth. The rhizospheric soil communities were dominated by the families Pseudomonadaceae, Bacillaceae and Planococcaceae for S. foliosa and Porphyromonadaceae and Haloferacaceae for D. spicata . Nonetheless, the cultures were completely dominated by the Enterobacteriaceae family (up to 98%). Effectively, lettuce plants supplemented with the cultures showed greater size and biomass accumulation, we identify 12 candidates that could be responsible of these outcomes, of which 5 ( Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Paenisporosarcina and Ammoniphilus ) were part of the built co-occurrence network, being Klebsiella a major participant. We aim to contribute to the efforts to characterize the microbial communities as key for the plant’s survival in extreme environments, and as a possible source of consortia with plant growth promotion traits aiming agricultural applications.   IMPORTANCE The current scenario of climate change and desertification represents a series of incoming challenges for all living organisms, also as the human population grows rapidly, so is rising the demand for food and natural resources; thus, it is necessary to make agriculture more efficient by optimizing soil and water usages thus ensuring future food supplies. Particularly, the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) is considered the most arid place on Earth as a consequence of geological and climatic characteristics, such as the naturally low precipitation patterns and high temperatures, which makes it an ideal place to carry out research that seeks to aid agriculture to the future sceneries, which are predicted to resemble these.

Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet theory, where the Gauss–Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein–Scalar–Gauss–Bonnet model, the Gauss–Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe’s early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"G.L., A.D.M., and A.P. thank the financial support of ANID through Proyecto Fondecyt Regular 2024, Folio 1240514, Etapa 2024 and of Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico (VRIDT) at Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN).

This process includes quasi-instantaneous release during megathrust earthquakes and long-term creep. Both mechanisms can coexist in a given subducting margin, defining a seismotectonic segmentation in which seismically active segments are separated by zones in which ruptures stop, classified for simplicity as asperities and barrier, respectively. The spatiotemporal stability of this segmentation has been a matter of debate in the seismological community for decades. At this regard, we explore in this paper the potential role of the interaction between geological heterogeneities in the overriding plate and fluids released from the subducting slab towards the subduction channel. As a case study, we take the convergence between the Nazca and South American plates between 18°–40° S, given its relatively simple convergence style and the availability of a high-quality instrumental and historical record. We postulate that trans-lithospheric faults striking at a high angle with respect to the trench behave as large fluid sinks that create the appropriate conditions for the development of barriers and promote the growth of highly coupled asperity domains in their periphery. We tested this hypothesis against key short- and long-term observations in the study area, obtaining consistent results. If the spatial distribution of asperities is controlled by the geology of the overriding plate, seismic risk assessment could be established with better confidence.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2024-05-27,2024,2024-05-27,,2024,,1-36,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Yanez, Gonzalo; Piquer, Jose; Rivera, Orlando","Yanez, Gonzalo (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Av.

162,pub.1172575080,10.5194/egusphere-2024-1290,,,Evolution of biogeochemical Properties Inside Poleward Undercurrent Eddies in the Southeast Pacific Ocean,"Oceanic eddies are ubiquitous features of the circulation through to be involved in transporting water mass properties over long distances from their source region. Among these is a particular type with a core within the thermocline with little signature visible from space. Despite their significance, their role in the ocean circulation remains largely undocumented from observations. This study characterizes the variations in internal biogeochemistry, disparities with external properties, and processes influencing the dissolved oxygen budget of Poleward undercurrent eddies (PUDDIES) during their transit to oceanic waters. Employing a high-resolution coupled simulation of the Southeast Pacific, we scrutinize eddy dynamics and biogeochemical processes associated with the nitrogen cycle, including characteristic mechanisms of Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) such as denitrification. Our findings reveal that Puddies capture a biogeochemical signal contingent upon their formation location, particularly associated with the core of the Peru-Chile Undercurrent at the core of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). While permeability at the periphery facilitates exchange with external waters, thereby modulating the original properties, the core signal retains negative oxygen (O2) anomalies and positive anomalies of other biogeochemical tracers. These disturbances likely contribute to average properties that exceed the 90th percentile threshold in the open ocean, contrasting with the formation zone where they surpass 50th percentile levels. Suboxic cores are prevalent near the coast but decrease in abundance with distance from shore, giving way to a predominance of hypoxic cores, indicative of core ventilation during transit. The principal mechanism governing O2 input into, or output from the eddy core entails lateral and vertical advection, with vertical mixing supplying O2 to a lesser extent. Biological activity consumes O2 for approximately 6 to 12 months more intensely the first 100 days, thereby facilitating the persistence of low O2 conditions and extending the lifetime of biogeochemical anomalies within the core. The ammonium and nitrite depleted out of time in the eddy core with a decay rate greater than the nitrate and nitrous oxide, while these are accumulating in open sea. Our observations suggest that southern regions of the southeast Pacific OMZ undergo greater deoxygenation and nutrient enrichment due to Puddies compared to northern regions. This underscores the significant role of Puddies in modifying biogeochemical conditions in the open ocean and in extending the boundaries of the Southern tip of the OMZ.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2024-06-05,2024,2024-06-05,,2024,,1-39,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ortiz-Castillo, Lenna Oriana; Pizarro, Oscar; Cornejo-D'Ottone, Marcela; Dewitte, Boris","Ortiz-Castillo, Lenna Oriana (Centro de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas de la Patagonia (CIEP), Coyhaique, Chile; Programa de Postgrado en Oceanografía, Departamento de Oceanografía, Facultad de Ciencias Naturales y Oceanográficas, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile; Millennium Institute of Oceanography, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile); Pizarro, Oscar (Millennium Institute of Oceanography, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile; Department of Geophysics, University of Concepcion, Concepción, Chile); Cornejo-D'Ottone, Marcela (Escuela de Ciencias del Mar and Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile); Dewitte, Boris (Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Aridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Departamento de Biología Marina, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; LEGOS‐CNRS/IRD/UPS/CNES, Toulouse, France)",,"Ortiz-Castillo, Lenna Oriana (Patagonian Ecosystems Investigation Research Center; University of Concepción; Millennium Institute of Oceanography); Pizarro, Oscar (Millennium Institute of Oceanography; University of Concepción); Cornejo-D'Ottone, Marcela (Escuela de Ciencias del Mar and Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile; Pontificial Catholic University of Valparaiso); Dewitte, Boris (Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Aridas (CEAZA), Coquimbo, Chile; Catholic University of the North; LEGOS‐CNRS/IRD/UPS/CNES, Toulouse, France)",0,0,,,https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-1290/egusphere-2024-1290.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172575080,37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography,14 Life Below Water

The main goal of this study is to examine the connection between DT and SD and showcase examples of what has been done to deploy it, using real-case situations. From a methodological perspective, the paper deploys a set of two methods: bibliometric analysis and case studies. Among other findings, the paper shows that DT can be used to help implement the UN SDGs by providing an approach that emphasizes human-centered design. This includes identifying problems, creating user-friendly solutions, and testing them in order to ensure that they are effective. Also, by using DT, companies, organisations, and governments can create low-cost, high-impact, and sustainable solutions to help achieve SDGs such as SDG8, SDG9, SDG12, and SDG13, among others. Overall, DT provides a framework for combining creative and analytical reasoning, specific mindsets, and diverse hands-on tools and techniques to improve critical thinking abilities towards sustainability challenges. The novelty of the paper relies on the fact that the combined use of the two methods allowed the identification of some useful features of DT, which may facilitate its deployment in sustainability contexts. This may assist future studies since it provides a theoretical basis for the field.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This is especially true in medical contexts. This study explored the relationship between the metacognitive profile of students of human anatomy, the classification of questions according to their difficulty, and the anatomical domain. It also covered the integration of educational technologies to create personalized learning environments. The identification of metacognitive profiles (""Active"", ""Pragmatic"", ""Theoretical"", and ""Reflective"") has been highlighted as a critical influence on students' responses to different pedagogical approaches. Personalized adaptation based on these profiles has shown potential for improving grades and increasing student satisfaction and engagement with learning. The results revealed variations in student performance in relation to different pedagogical approaches, learning units, and evaluation modalities. The ""Experience"" evaluation modality, personalized according to metacognitive profiles, level of competence, and learning objectives, resulted in higher average scores. However, there was significant variability in the results. Those findings confirm the effectiveness of metacognitive adaptation in improving academic performance. Furthermore, they provide a solid basis for formulating personalized and effective pedagogical strategies in medical education. They recognize the influence of metacognitive profiles on student performance and contribute to advancing medical pedagogy.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Our gratitude goes out to the researchers from the Clinical Anatomy, Embryology and Neuroscience (NEOMA) research group and the participating students and teachers from the Introduction to the Study of Medicine: Study of the Structure and Function of the Human Body II at the University of Girona, Spain.

Investigated parameters include the conventional time-averaged shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m (V S30 ), the predominant period of the site, and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios. To assess the performance of these parameters, we estimate the amplification of seismic waves within shallow soil layers (i.e., site effects) at recording stations across northern South America. The site amplification is estimated by analyzing the residuals calculated from ground-motion records with respect to model predictions for hard-rock site conditions. Several functional forms were introduced to express the linear site amplification in terms of the explored parameters. We evaluate the efficacy of the parameters, as well as their advantages and limitations, by considering their impact in the site-to-site standard deviation of the residuals between observations and predictions using the introduced functional forms.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Despite the nest depth (Zhypo ≥ 100 km), these events play a crucial role in the seismic hazard assessment for several cities in northern South America (NoSAm), particularly those situated close to their epicenters. Moreover, these earthquakes are widely felt across the country, even hundreds of kilometers away from the nest. This paper assesses the performance of commonly used subduction intraslab Ground Motion Models (GMMs) in predicting the updated nest database gathered and processed by the Colombian Geological Survey. This analysis confirms the necessity of a partially non-ergodic ground motion model for estimating the spectral accelerations produced by Bucaramanga nest earthquakes in northern South America. The GMM presented herein is the first model developed specifically for seismic nests in the region and is conceived as a regionalization of the recent NGA-Sub Abrahamson and Gülerce (Earthq Spectra 38(4):2638−2681, 2022) GMM. Additionally, we provide estimates of the variance components at both the earthquake and station levels and compare the developed GMM with the spectral accelerations recorded for typical earthquakes, for the highest magnitude earthquake in the database, and for a recent Bucaramanga nest earthquake having a moment magnitude over 5.","The authors express their gratitude to the Colombian Geological Survey for granting access to the recordings of the Colombian strong motion database, particularly the group responsible for the evaluation and monitoring of seismic activity. The valuable discussions with Fernando Díaz-Parra at the Colombian Geological Survey significantly contributed to the characterization of the seismic stations and the consideration of local effects in GMMs. Special recognition is given to Julio García for his valuable guidance in compiling the strong motion databases.","Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium.

In Latin America, seismic design provisions commonly adhere to the ACI 318 building code, which is predominantly based on United States construction practices. However, in some Latin American countries, the construction methods and geometrical configurations of structural walls significantly differ from those in the U.S.; hence, the available information about the actual behavior of such walls under seismic loads is limited. This study focuses on a thin and lightly reinforced concrete wall (TLRCW) building system, which is characterized by walls thinner than 150 mm and primarily reinforced with a single layer of electrowelded wire steel mesh, with no boundary elements but with additional reinforcing bars at the edges. Past experiments on rectangular and T-shaped walls of the TLRCW building system, which were tested under unidirectional cyclic loading, exhibited limited rotational capacities. This article extends these findings by presenting results from a multidirectional loading test on a U-shaped thin wall and assessing its failure modes, strength and displacement capacity, deformation components, and stiffness degradation. A numerical model based on a nonlinear beam-truss approach was implemented to evaluate the accuracy of the estimates of key performance variables of the wall. The experimental results show limited displacement capacity below 1.15% drift, with a failure mode controlled by concrete crushing at the flange toes. The numerical model was able to capture some of the key global response parameters for all the load directions and at the local level, but with less accuracy.","This document is the result of a project financed by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation through the leading house at the University of St Gallen and under the direction of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).

Dyspnea, chest pain and shock are conditions valuable to evaluate with ultrasound considering diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact already proven. There is scarce evidence in diagnosis agreement using ultrasound as an extension of physical examination. We aimed to evaluate ED patients in whom POCUS was performed, to analyze agreement between clinical initial diagnosis using ultrasound images and final diagnosis. Furthermore, we analyze failed diagnosis, inconclusive POCUS exams and discuss details. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in adults who visited the emergency department with any of these three chief complaints: dyspnea, chest pain, shock. All were evaluated with ultrasound at admission. Agreement between initial diagnosis using POCUS and final definite diagnosis was calculated. Failed diagnosis and inconclusive exams were analyzed. Results: A total of 209 patients were analyzed. Populations mostly males, mean age 64yo, hypertensive. Patients with dyspnea, agreement in heart failure diagnosis was 0.98; agreement in chest pain with non-ST acute coronary syndrome was 0.96; agreement in type of shock was 0.90. Twelve 12 (5%) patients had an inconclusive POCUS exam, and 16 (7%) patients had a failed diagnosis. Conclusion: The use POCUS in the emergency department shows almost perfect agreement when compared with the final diagnosis in individuals experiencing acutely decompensated heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and shock. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the impact of this tool on mortality and prognosis when there are diagnostic errors.",,,Research Square,,,,2024-01-03,2024,2024-01-03,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ramos, José Atilio Núñez; Misol, Dagoberto Duarte; Petro, María Andrea Burgos; Pérez, Keren Jemima Sarmiento; Echeverry, Vanesa Paola Gutiérrez; Velasco-Malagón, Sergio","Ramos, José Atilio Núñez (Universidad del Norte Division Ciencias de la Salud); Misol, Dagoberto Duarte (Hospital Universidad del Norte.

The soil's mechanical behavior was simulated using a pressure-dependent multi-surface plasticity constitutive model, which was carefully calibrated based on cyclic soil tests performed on Ottawa F-65 sand. These tests covered a wide range of initial densities, initial effective stresses, and cyclic stress ratios. The comparison between laboratory and numerical element tests revealed that the adopted constitutive model reasonably replicated most features of the material's undrained cyclic response, including liquefaction occurrence and the progressive development of double-amplitude permanent shear strains. The calibrated constitutive model was then used to blindly predict the dynamic behavior of centrifuge experiments composed of a sheet pile-soil system using the OpenSees finite elements software framework; these simulations are referred to as Type-B predictions. The numerical simulation showed that the model provided reasonable representation of soil responses in terms of accelerations and pore water pressure build-up; however, the simulations consistently overpredicted the displacements of the sheet piles. Therefore, based on the centrifuge experimental results, minor adjustments of the material parameters were performed, and the centrifuge tests were re-simulated; these simulations are referred to as Type-C predictions. The comprehensive evaluation exposed both the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling approach for the simulation of liquefiable deposits. Despite the discrepancies in sheet pile displacement, the study instills confidence in the model's applicability to liquefaction-related projects with similar conditions.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Due to their location, Latin America and the Caribbean have a significant renewable energy potential. For instance, Colombia has an installed thermoelectric capacity accounting for over 40% of its total power generation resources. Nevertheless, its legislation promotes the fair transition toward alternative sources while leveraging the installed infrastructure. Additionally, worldwide projections show that hydrogen-based power generation will foster the hybridization of power generation systems. This research addresses the evaluation of four increasingly complex systems, starting with a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), successfully adding subsystems up to a hybrid system comprising a CCGT, a photovoltaic field, a methane reformer with carbon capture, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and a hydrogen compression-storage stage. The appraisal is performed with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), using technical, economic, sociopolitical, and environmental indicators. We used the Colombian energy market as a case study. The evaluation found that the scenario incorporating all the subsystems achieves the best trade-off across all considered criteria. In nominal conditions, this scenario achieves an overall efficiency of 63.67%, a levelized cost of energy of 0.032 USD/kWh, a carbon footprint of 0.047 kgCO2/kWh, and a conventional-to-total power ratio of 70.77%. Integrating electrolysis, reforming with carbon capture for hydrogen generation, and using surplus gas and power reduce CO2 emissions while increasing profits. Additionally, the combination of hydrogen storage and solar energy enhances overall power generation capabilities. The proposed assessment methodology can be extended to evaluate the viability of similar hybrid systems in other regions and energy markets.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: [Adriana Rincon-Montenegro reports article publishing charges was provided by University of the North.

One of the commonly used strategies by utilities to deal with this challenge is the use of Fault Indicators (FIs), which indicate to the operator the path taken by the fault current. However, a good performance of this scheme depends on the number of installed devices, a high number of them could cause a high cost for the utility investment planning. In this context, this paper presents an artificial intelligence-based fault location strategy that determines the number and location of FI into ADN to maximize performance in fault section estimation. To achieve this objective, the ADN is divided into sections, and the FL problem is modeled as a classification problem to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). To determine the number of FIs to be installed and their location, the strategy uses the three-phase current magnitudes measured by the FI as features for an ANN model. Also, the strategy uses a feature selection and tuning scheme based on a multiverse optimization algorithm (MOA) to identify the features that maximize the accuracy of the ANN model. The strategy was validated on the IEEE123-node test feeder. The results showed accuracy close to 99.4 % with a reduction of 40 % of the number of FIs when compared with other method. The strategy shows its simplicity and promising prospects to apply it in the utility's investment planning.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This article explores the polysemic use of reflection and the role that design practitioners and researchers could play in the Global South, and how their work may become a decolonial practice, transitioning from a design-led intervention approach to a collaborative process of joint inquiry. We explore how to decolonise ourselves, by reviewing work done in the past in the Colombian Caribbean shores. In collaboration with People from Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta and a team of designers, researchers and several organisations, we built a palaphitic building for cultural tourism practices.We look at what the process entailed in retrospect, to understand how to move from dialectics to dialogics. In an effort to rebuild ourselves as decolonial researchers and practitioners. In the work that we’re reviewing, we tracked four different categories of reflection. We identified two sets of intertwined results. The first set is related to transitional forms of reflection that fluctuate from design interventions to joint inquiries, and; the second set is related to the process of how people flow from a dialectical position to a participatory dialogical feeling-thinking-doing.",,,CoDesign,,,,2024-07-29,2024,2024-07-29,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-19,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Quijano, Edgard David Rincón; Barrios, Deyanira Andrea Jiménez; Parra-Agudelo, Leonardo","Quijano, Edgard David Rincón (Design Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Barrios, Deyanira Andrea Jiménez (Design Department, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy); Parra-Agudelo, Leonardo (Design Department, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia)","Quijano, Edgard David Rincón (Universidad del Norte)","Quijano, Edgard David Rincón (Universidad del Norte); Barrios, Deyanira Andrea Jiménez (Politecnico di Milano); Parra-Agudelo, Leonardo (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/15710882.2024.2352717,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174255541,33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design,

Co-infections by different viruses are frequent and, in some cases, associated with severe disease outcomes. Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to identify respiratory viruses circulating in Barranquilla during the COVID-19 pandemic peaks and estimate the prevalence of viral co-infections in samples from individuals with different degrees of respiratory infection. Methods: Between August and October 2021, 101 samples were collected from individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) by the District Health Laboratory of Barranquilla and four local health care institutions and analyzed at Universidad Simón Bolívar. Eighteen respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed via qRT-PCR using nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. Results: Of the 101 study individuals, 56 were male and 45 were female (55.5% and 44.5%, respectively); 25.7% of individuals were infected with at least one of the evaluated viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were the two most frequently detected viruses (30.7% and 15.4% of total positives, respectively). Co-infections with two or more respiratory viruses accounted for 42% of the total positive cases. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the presence of different respiratory viruses in swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from individuals with ILI, including coinfection. These results reveal the circulation of several respiratory viruses in the city of Barranquilla, confirming their importance as potential causes of SARI in Colombia and the need for their active surveillance.",,,Preprints.org,,,,2024-08-26,2024,2024-08-26,,,,202408.1839.v1,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Arrieta-Rangel, Leonardo; Bello-Lemus, Yesit; Luna-Rodriguez, Ibeth; Guerra-Simanca, Martha; Bermúdez, Valmore; Díaz-Olmos, Yirys; Quiroz, Elkin Navarro; Pacheco-Lugo, Lisandro; Acosta-Hoyos, Antonio J.","Arrieta-Rangel, Leonardo (); Bello-Lemus, Yesit (); Luna-Rodriguez, Ibeth (); Guerra-Simanca, Martha (); Bermúdez, Valmore (); Díaz-Olmos, Yirys (); Quiroz, Elkin Navarro (); Pacheco-Lugo, Lisandro (); Acosta-Hoyos, Antonio J.

However, studies conducted globally exhibit inconsistencies in both the factor structure and the number of items comprising the MDS. This study was conducted to assess the reliability and factor structure of the MDS within a sample of Colombian adolescents (N = 375; M age = 13.3; SD = 1.69) and to compare the use of MD mechanisms across victims, perpetrators, non-involved students, and bystanders of school bullying. To begin, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) compared the fit indices of theoretical models proposed in the existing literature. The results revealed that all previously suggested models exhibited similar fit indices, indicating that these structures could be equally applicable for evaluating various dimensions of moral disengagement among adolescent populations. In order to identify the most suitable model for our culturally specific sample, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) pointed towards a more concise 13-item version of the MDS as the optimal solution. Individuals meeting the scores for “bullies” employed more MD mechanisms compared to victims and non-involved students. There were no significant differences in MDS scores between pro-victim bystanders and those remaining passive or supporting aggressors. In light of these findings, targeting cognitive mechanisms that neutralize moral self-sanctions in perpetrators and potential bystanders of bullying may prove to be a valuable strategy in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-bullying interventions.","The authors express their gratitude to Dr. Vicente Mercado for his insightful comments and suggestions, which greatly contributed to the enhancement of this manuscript.","Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium This work was supported by the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia (Colciencias) under Grant #785.",International Journal of Bullying Prevention,,,,2024-02-02,2024,2024-02-02,,,,1-11,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Restrepo Cervantes, Dayana; Chamorro Coneo, Ana; Bolivar Pimiento, Daniel; Hoyos de los Rios, Olga; Llinás Solano, Humberto","Restrepo Cervantes, Dayana (Social and Educational Research Group, Social Sciences Department, Universidad de La Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia); Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Human Development Research Group, Psychology Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Bolivar Pimiento, Daniel (Human Development Research Group, Psychology Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Hoyos de los Rios, Olga (Human Development Research Group, Psychology Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Llinás Solano, Humberto (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Restrepo Cervantes, Dayana (University of the Coast)","Restrepo Cervantes, Dayana (University of the Coast); Chamorro Coneo, Ana (Universidad del Norte); Bolivar Pimiento, Daniel (Universidad del Norte); Hoyos de los Rios, Olga (Universidad del Norte); Llinás Solano, Humberto (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42380-024-00215-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168532891,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

It is structurally analogues of arsenate-As(V). Given the food safety risks associated with As accumulation in rice it is important to understand how thiolated As species are taken up and metabolized by plants. In this work, MTA reduction was evaluated using the model system Arabidopsis thaliana. The analysis was carried out in the accessions Col-0 (Wild type = WT) as well as in two hac1 null alleles Krefeld (Kr-0) and a AtHAC1 mutant. Total arsenic accumulation and speciation assays in shoots for those plants showed that hac1 null alleles plants accumulated more arsenic than wild type (Col-0) under As(V) conditions. HAC1 represents the known arsenate reductase. However, HAC1 mutant plants did not show this phenotype under MTA exposition. In spite of this, Shoot-As-speciation showed mainly As(III), followed by As(V) and few amounts of MTA, which could indicate that most of the MTA that is translocated to the shoots is first reduced to As(III), although a minor part remains as MTA. Arsenic speciation in roots showed that the dominant As species was arsenite for both plants in MTA/As(V) treatments. Nevertheless, a reduction in the percentage of the total accumulated arsenic present as arsenite was observed, hac1 null alleles has lower As(III) amount than Col-0, under As(V) conditions. Similarly, in plants exposed to MTA, the dominant As species in the roots was arsenite for all genotypes, followed by As(V) and a lower MTA proportion. The reduction of MTA to arsenite in roots gave evidence that MTA is actively taken up by plants and reduced inside the plant to As(III). A. thaliana exposed to MTA showed higher rates of As translocation from roots to shoots than plants under As(V) treatment. A better understanding of thioarsenate translocation will be especially important in order to prevent/reduce the T-As accumulation in edible plant parts.",,,,Arsenic in the Environment: Bridging Science to Practice for Sustainable Development As2021,,,2024-01-09,2024,2024-01-09,,,,185-187,All OA; Hybrid,Chapter,"Monroy-Licht, A.; Rafferty, C.; Kerl, C.F.; Planer-Friedrich, B.; Clemens, S.","Monroy-Licht, A.

This phenomenon not only affects consumers, who may find themselves with quickly outdated devices but also poses a dilemma for designers and manufacturers who must balance constant innovation with sustainability and product durability. In this dynamic scenario, there arises a critical need to understand how design attributes impact obsolescence and how this relationship can influence the creation of more sustainable and resilient products. This paper develops a taxonomy of product design attributes influencing different types of obsolescence to address the research gap between product design and obsolescence. It investigates the significance of obsolescence types across product categories, the impact of design attributes on these obsolescences, and the role of design in product sustainability. Employing a theoretical framework combining product design and lifecycle analysis, the methodology includes a literature review and an expert survey to evaluate design attributes against obsolescence types. From the literature review, 21 design attributes were identified and evaluated by 26 industry and academia experts. The findings reveal distinct patterns of obsolescence in various product categories, emphasizing the influence of specific design attributes. The role of attributes such as upgradeability and compatibility in technological, functional, and planned obsolescence was highlighted. Limited familiarity with certain types of obsolescence among experts was acknowledged, underscoring the importance of raising awareness within the design community. These insights are critical to align product design with sustainability goals and challenging traditional product development practices. The study has significant implications for designers, manufacturers, and policymakers, highlighting the importance of understanding design choices in reducing obsolescence and promoting sustainable consumption.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación, Universidad del Norte, under contract UN-OJ-2022-57010.",Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2024-10,2024,,2024-10,475,,143635,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly; Ruiz-Pastor, Laura; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Mesa, Jaime A.","Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly (GIMYP Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia); Ruiz-Pastor, Laura (Department of Mechanical Engineering and Construction, Universitat Jaume I, Castellón de la Plana, 12006, Spain); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia); Mesa, Jaime A.

The efficiency of this process relies heavily on accurately determining the remanufacturability of products, especially at the component level. The article introduces the Remanufacturing Potential Index (RemPI) to address this issue. This diagnostic tool is based on two main characteristics: i) disassemblability, which is the ability of a product to be dismantled, and ii) integrity, referring to its physical condition upon return. Notably, RemPI provides a robust understanding by weighing the functional importance of each component in the remanufacturing process. Contributions of this research include: a detailed remanufacturability assessment at the component level, highlighting its role in the overall assembly; and a focus on balancing disassemblability with integrity, providing insights for potential product redesigns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through two case studies.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Field observations, detailed petrography, and U–Pb age dating of the entire stratigraphic sequence were used to characterize the magmatic evolution of the district and to obtain new insights into the evolution of the SMO. The stratigraphy at Plomosas is distinct from other areas to the north as it lacks Jurassic marine units, Cretaceous continental volcanic successions as well as Cretaceous and Palaeocene batholiths. The local basement is composed of undeformed Late Jurassic volcaniclastic units and coeval felsic intrusions. Early to late Oligocene silicic ignimbrites, intermediate lava flows, and occasional basaltic flows unconformably overlie the Jurassic basement. Several Oligocene intermediate to felsic porphyry bodies and rhyolitic domes crosscut the stratigraphy. The upper volcanic sequence is separated into two packages by an angular unconformity. Mineralization produced an early Pb–Zn-mineralized hydrothermal fault breccia, followed by Cu–Ag veins and late Au veins. The Pb–Zn mineralized breccia is hosted by ~30 Ma Oligocene volcanic units that form the basal sequence. The Cu–Ag and Au-rich veins overlap and crosscut the early hydrothermal features and cut the late Oligocene volcanic cover that unconformably overlie the basal sequence. Our results highlight the importance of episodes of Oligocene magmatism to the genesis of mineralization in the southwestern SMO specifically through a genetic link between Pb–Zn veins and intermediate Oligocene intrusive bodies, and of Ag and Au veins with late Oligocene volcanism.","We thank Minera La Rastra S.A de C.V. geology staff for their contribution to this study, we also thank Dr Marina Vega for assistance at Cortical Fluid Laboratory, Juan Tomás Vazquez for the elaboration of thin sections at Centro de Geociencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.",This research was founded by the project called “Quotation for a scientific consultant to develop a fluid inclusions characterization of the mineralization styles of the Plomosas (Pb–Zn)–(Cu–Ag)–Au deposit” by the Universidad del Norte and Minera La Rastra S.A de C.V.,International Geology Review,,,,2024-06-28,2024,2024-06-28,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-17,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Montoya-Lopera, Paula; Levresse, Gilles; Ferrari, Luca; Catchpole, Honza; Coto, Luis; Mar, Felipe; Cárdenas-Castro, Andrés","Montoya-Lopera, Paula (Centre for Ore Deposit and Earth Science (CODES), University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia; Departamento de Física y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Centro de Geociencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Juriquilla, México); Levresse, Gilles (Centro de Geociencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Juriquilla, México); Ferrari, Luca (Centro de Geociencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Juriquilla, México); Catchpole, Honza (Geology Department, GR Silver Mining Ltd, ., Vancouver, Canada; Geology Department, Metallerz Exploration, Vancouver, Canada); Coto, Luis (Geology Department, GR Silver Mining Ltd, ., Vancouver, Canada); Mar, Felipe (Geology Department, GR Silver Mining Ltd, ., Vancouver, Canada); Cárdenas-Castro, Andrés (Departamento de Física y Geociencias, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Montoya-Lopera, Paula (University of Tasmania; Universidad del Norte; National Autonomous University of Mexico)","Montoya-Lopera, Paula (University of Tasmania; Universidad del Norte; National Autonomous University of Mexico); Levresse, Gilles (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Ferrari, Luca (National Autonomous University of Mexico); Catchpole, Honza (Geology Department, GR Silver Mining Ltd, ., Vancouver, Canada; Geology Department, Metallerz Exploration, Vancouver, Canada); Coto, Luis (Geology Department, GR Silver Mining Ltd, ., Vancouver, Canada); Mar, Felipe (Geology Department, GR Silver Mining Ltd, ., Vancouver, Canada); Cárdenas-Castro, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/00206814.2024.2372607,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173293879,37 Earth Sciences; 3703 Geochemistry; 3705 Geology; 3706 Geophysics,

It is often thought that their respective accounts have been conclusively refuted by objections from Quine, Dummett and others. We argue that this verdict is premature. Several of the most popular anti‐conventionalist arguments fail, partly because they misconstrue the idea of truth by convention in Wittgenstein and/or logical positivism. Correctly understood, conventionalism claims that, given certain linguistic conventions, some sentences are unconditionally true, that is true irrespective of how the world happens to be.

Since the spin does not in general commute with the Hamiltonian, some of the topological features of the material can be extracted from its study. In insulating materials, the spin operator induces a projected operator on valence states called the spin valence operator. Its spectrum contains information with regard to the different phases of the spin Chern class. If the spin valence spectrum is gapped, the spin Chern numbers are constant along parallel planes thus defining spin Chern insulating materials. If the spin valence spectrum is not gapped, the changes in the spin Chern numbers occur whenever this spectrum is zero. Materials whose spin valence spectrum is gapless will be denoted spin Weyl topological insulators and their definition together with some of their properties will be presented in this work. The classification of materials from the properties of the spin valence operator provides a characterization which complements the existing list of topological invariants.","R.G.-H. gratefully acknowledges the computing time granted on the supercomputer Mogon at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz [53].

Politeness research has highlighted the importance of extralinguistic variables on speakers’ linguistic choices. Despite many studies that touch on these topics, questions about the comparative importance of contextual variables and the joint effect of them on speakers’ utterances remain unanswered. To examine these questions, a quantitative approach using a conditional inference tree was employed to investigate the influence of power, distance, and imposition on the use of verb forms in requests in Italian. Verb forms were selected as the dependent variable because they are essential for performing speech acts and they can be placed on a politeness continuum. Considering the importance and hierarchical relationship of the predictor variables of power, distance, and imposition, the results indicated that the three variables were predictors of verb form. While power was the main predictor, the effect of distance and imposition depended on whether the other variables were considered, showing a varying and complex effect of contextual variables. The findings enhance the understanding of Italian politeness, and represent the complex calculations that speakers make when selecting linguistic forms by considering interacting contextual variables.",,,Journal of Politeness Research,,,,2024-08-14,2024,2024-08-14,,0,0,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Staszkiewicz, Bruno; Czerwionka, Lori; Concu, Valentina","Staszkiewicz, Bruno (School of Languages and Cultures, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA); Czerwionka, Lori (School of Languages and Cultures, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA); Concu, Valentina (Department of Foreign Languages, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Staszkiewicz, Bruno (Purdue University West Lafayette)","Staszkiewicz, Bruno (Purdue University West Lafayette); Czerwionka, Lori (Purdue University West Lafayette); Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pr-2023-0009/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174723121,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

This work investigated the structural and electronic properties of bulk and a few layers of BiSb material. Interestingly, only the bulk and monolayer systems present semiconductor characteristics. From two monolayers onwards, a semi-metallic character is found. This semi-metallic behavior is due to valance and conduction bands crossing the Fermi level near the Γ point. These band crossings are related to topological surface states, which are achieved without inducing strain into the system, contrary to their bulk and monolayer counterparts. Defects, like deformations, vacancies, or doping, are expected not to affect the surface states. As a probe of concept, the biaxial strain was induced in BiSb surfaces, making no changes in the surface states. These robust surface states are desirable for constructing magnetic-topological junctions for new-generation solid-state storage applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Like most freight demand models applied in practice, we use an aggregate modeling approach. Zoning, infrastructure networks, and socioeconomic and nationwide agricultural data were adapted from the Colombian Strategic Freight Transportation model and the National Agricultural Survey. Data was stored, displayed, managed, and analyzed using a Geographic Information System. Three accessibility indicators entering the freight generation model are tested. The temporal accessibility index is the best-performing accessibility measure for the case study conducted in Colombia. The models exhibit that accessibility positively affects freight generation, proving a solid link between temporal accessibility and agricultural production. When using the models to predict the impact of new transport infrastructure projects, changes in agricultural production were not highly significant.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this vein, this paper aims to identify some of the general features of citizen participation on Twitter during the Spanish elections held on 24 May 2015, as well as to estimate the weight or importance of ideologically charged messages and the variables associated with the publication of this kind of messages. This is based on the social media mining of 24900 tweets gathered from the #24M and #Elecciones2015 hashtags. The study allows us to observe, among other things, the role taken on by the citizens, whose participation in this election focused on disclosing the events of this day, rather than on establishing the different ideological positions that indicated their partisan preferences. In spite of this, we were able to see how messages with a clearly defined ideological charge were particularly encouraged by users with a progressive ideological orientation or leftist tendencies, as well as the existing relationship between the publication of these messages and the party orientation of those who disclosed this type of messages.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Said-Hung, Elias; Prati, Ronaldo Cristiano; Cancino-Borbón, Andrea","Said-Hung, Elias (Universidad Internacional de la Rioja); Prati, Ronaldo Cristiano (); Cancino-Borbón, Andrea (Universidad del Norte)",,"Said-Hung, Elias (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Prati, Ronaldo Cristiano (); Cancino-Borbón, Andrea (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://palabraclave.unisabana.edu.co/index.php/palabraclave/article/download/6241/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173111810,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

It summarizes the key findings of over 15 years of study of EEs in such places and draws together insights gained from empirical work, which helps us to push forward the theorizing of EEs by incorporating the experiences of regional and national contexts usually overlooked in the mainstream literature. This chapter contextualizes EEs in CEEs as peripheral when considered on the international scale, and thus broadens the discussion to more general insights about peripheral EEs, which have thus far been largely overlooked in research, suggesting that insights from these contexts can fill in some blind spots around migrant and informal or necessity entrepreneurship in particular.",,,,Entrepreneurial Ecosystems,"Elisa Thomas, Kadígia Faccin, Bruno A.

Initially, a mathematical modeling of the kinematic and kinetic variables rising in linear, exponential, parabolic, sinusoidal, and s-curve ramp velocity profiles is proposed for different load conditions and saturation values of the velocity profiles, focusing on generic Cartesian manipulators moving a constant inertia load and not equipped with regenerative devices. Lastly, a summary table outlining the benefits and drawbacks of each velocity profile in relation to the relevant variables is given to the reader, along with a set of recommendations for selecting the best velocity profile in accordance with the load conditions and optimization goals. It was shown that, depending on the load conditions, the inappropriate choice of one type of speed profile can increase the required forces by up to 400%, the required maximum power by more than 88%, and the energy consumption by up to 77% with respect to the optimal speed profile.",,Open Access funding provided by Colombia Consortium,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2024-08-14,2024,2024-08-14,2024-09,134,3-4,2051-2065,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez; Ramírez, Heriberto Enrique Maury; Higuera, Leidy Milena Mora","Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez (Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ramírez, Heriberto Enrique Maury (Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Colombia); Higuera, Leidy Milena Mora (Industrial Engineering Department, Corporación Universitaria Reformada, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez (Universidad Simón Bolívar)","Olier, Camilo Andrés Gonzalez (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Ramírez, Heriberto Enrique Maury (Universidad del Norte); Higuera, Leidy Milena Mora (Corporación Universitaria Reformada)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00170-024-14141-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174738025,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

We propose a vector error correction model that allows an integrated and dynamic modelling of the offer-side of the spot market by considering bid prices, available energy, renewable energy production and the spot price. To validate the model, we performed statistical tests on the residuals of the model and back-testing. The results show that given a one standard deviation shock in renewable energy production from non-conventional sources, the spot price volatility increases from 12.7 % to 14.5 % in a 365-day horizon, which represents a relative increase of 14.2 %. Also, when evaluating different renewable energy integration scenarios and the official system expansion, we see that assuming 100 % fulfilment of the non-conventional sources integration plan, the volatility goes up to 31.2 % vs. 12.3 %. It is also worth noting that if the plan is fulfilled up to 25 % there is no significant increase in spot price volatility, which can be justified by the simultaneous expansion of conventional sources that compensate for the effects of non-conventional renewable sources.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1278,pub.1163973343,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121456,,,From machine learning to semi-empirical formulas for estimating compressive strength of Ultra-High Performance Concrete,"Although some machine learning (ML) models have successfully developed for ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), they do not provide insights and explicit relations between all input variables and its compressive strength. This paper will address these ambiguities and provide a tool to predict the compressive strength by explainable and interpretable equations and plots. Explicit semi-empirical formulas are derived from a multivariate polynomial regression (Lasso) and automated feature engineering and selection (Autofeat) using a 810 dataset of UHPC with 15 input variables, which are collected from literature. Coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.8223 is the same for the first-order degree (linear regression) of both models, however, the Autofeat achieves a better result than Lasso for the third-order degree with R 2 = 0.9616 vs. R 2 = 0.9503. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out via relative feature importance and partial dependence plots to explain and gain profound insights into the effects of some important input variables on the compressive strength of UHPC. Some details discussions related to these effects with previous studies are also presented. The proposed models not only show better performance with those from reference in terms of R 2 , especially for Autofeat model but also have explicit relations of compressive strength with 15 input variables. Hence, they can be used as a reliable tool in mixture design optimization of the UHPC.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Goals of this theoretical approach include unfolding and describing other worlds, understanding the differences between modern worldviews and past ontologies, and defining the ontologies materialized in rock images. This paper discusses the relationship(s) between rock art and ontology with reference to the idea of cosmopolitics and the political role of other-than-humans in social life. We suggest that rock art is grounded on historical modes of existence or, in other words, that rock images unfold particular fields of relations, affections, and political agencies through time and space. To illustrate this point, we focus on two Northern Chilean rock art examples: the El Medano hunter-gatherer-fisher rock paintings on the Pacific coast of the Atacama Desert; and carved Incan outcrops of the Atacama Desert. These examples allow us to discuss how rock art images produce historical cosmopolitics that disclose specific relationships between humans, other-than-humans, and politics. A discussion about the relationships between rock art and cosmopolitics is not only relevant to understand past ontologies, but it can also be a useful tool to think about the future, our current relationships with other-than-humans and ‘nature,’ and the need to create new models of development based on a new way of understanding the relationships between humans, landscape, and other-than-humans.","I would like to thank the editors for their invitation to participate in this volume and for their comments on the manuscript, as well as the two anonymous referees.

An analysis for Colombia,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in drastic changes in people’s living habits. The lockdown, social distancing measures, and the fear of contagion severely impacted the demand for public transportation services. Due to the decline in demand during the pandemic, the financial crisis of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in Colombia, similar to other Latin American countries, worsened. This article aims to analyze the pandemic’s impact on Colombia’s seven existing BRT systems by assessing users’ willingness to use the service in a post-pandemic scenario. Data come from an online survey (N = 1,486) in mid-2021, which was used to estimate a hybrid model that assesses future BRT usage intention. Results confirmed that the pandemic had a profound impact on mobility behavior, with a shift away from mass public transportation such as BRT or bus and a substantial increase in the use of single transportation modes, which include cars, motorcycles, cycling, and walking. Intention to continue using BRT service after the pandemic varies between cities and people’s socioeconomic characteristics (i.e. occupation, income, transportation expenditure, and private vehicle ownership). Willingness to use BRT is also influenced by latent variables, including perceptions of contagion risks, service quality before and during the pandemic, and perception of prevention measures implementation. When the virus takes a back seat, the BRT demand is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

METHODS: Controlled clinical trial, with 60 elderly participants from health care groups, allocated into four groups: Group of resistance exercises in open-air gyms – GT1 (n = 17); Group of aerobic and localized exercises - GT2 (n = 11); Group of resistance exercises at GT3 gym (n = 17); Control group: non-exercise practitioners - CG (n = 15). Anthropometric (BMI, % body fat, and waist circumference), cardiovascular (SBP, DBP, HR, and DP), metabolic (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemia), and strength variables were evaluated before and after 16 weeks of intervention. Descriptive statistics, Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, equal variance test, T-Student test, non-parametric Mann-Witney test, ANOVA One Way, multivariate data analysis using data mining and machine learning techniques, Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, Classical Clustering (Agglomerative Hierarchical Method); Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Z score, Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, Euclidian Similarity Index and, Cohen’s equations were applied. RESULTS: To observe effect size, morphofunctional variables for the GT1 group show a small effect for fat percentage, WHR, and ULS and a medium effect for LLS. For the GT2 group, there was a small effect for fat percentage, WHR, and ULS and a large effect for LLS. For the GT3 group, there was a small effect for the percentage of fat and HC, a medium effect for ULS, and a large effect for LLS. A small effect for glycemia in GT1, a medium effect for glycemia and triglycerides for GT2, a small effect for total cholesterol for GT3, and a large effect for glycemia in CG, with this effect being an increase in this analyte. For the cardiovascular variables, there is a small effect for SBP and HR in GT1, a small effect for DBP, HR, and DP, and a large effect for SBP in GT2, a small effect for SBP, DBP, and HR in GT3 and small effects for SBP and HR in CG. The correlation between BMI (P = 0.0007) and Body Fat% (P = 0.007) with ULS. The variables TG, LLS, and ULS were the ones that differed most in each type of stimulus chosen as an intervention in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that GT2 caused more significant percentage reductions in body mass and BMI. However, GT3 caused greater fat percentage reduction. The GT2 caused the greatest decrease in waist circumference, while the GT3 caused the largest decline in hip circumference. The three groups induced an increase in strength (ULS and LLS). However, in ascending order, GT1 caused the smallest increase, GT2 an intermediate increase, and GT3 the greatest increase in strength, with considerable effects in GT2 and GT3. Finally, GT2 caused a greater percentage reduction in systolic blood pressure (large effect) and double product (small effect) than the other groups. The three methods proved to be efficient, but with particularities that may reflect the choice of one over another due to health conditions, objectives to be achieved, or characteristics of the patient at the time of their choice by the prescriber.",,,Preprints.org,,,,2024-01-15,2024,2024-01-15,,,,202401.1143.v1,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Sampaio, Aristéia Nunes; Braga, Altemir Silva; de Andrade Bezerra, Jader; de Castro, Antônio Clodoaldo Melo; Gonçalves, Luis Carlos Oliveira; de Magalhães Neto, Aníbal Monteiro; Fidale, Thiago Montes; Bortolini, Miguel Júnior Sordi; Silva, Romeu Paulo Martins","Sampaio, Aristéia Nunes (); Braga, Altemir Silva (); de Andrade Bezerra, Jader (); de Castro, Antônio Clodoaldo Melo (); Gonçalves, Luis Carlos Oliveira (); de Magalhães Neto, Aníbal Monteiro (); Fidale, Thiago Montes (); Bortolini, Miguel Júnior Sordi (); Silva, Romeu Paulo Martins ()","Gonçalves, Luis Carlos Oliveira ()","Sampaio, Aristéia Nunes (); Braga, Altemir Silva (); de Andrade Bezerra, Jader (); de Castro, Antônio Clodoaldo Melo (); Gonçalves, Luis Carlos Oliveira (); de Magalhães Neto, Aníbal Monteiro (); Fidale, Thiago Montes (); Bortolini, Miguel Júnior Sordi (); Silva, Romeu Paulo Martins ()",0,0,,,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1143/v1/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167997719,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

These radical ions have potentially important effects on the solubility, transport and fractionation of metals and sulfur, with consequences for ore deposit formation and, more generally, for geochemical cycles of metals and volatiles. It is therefore essential to know the intrinsic isotopic properties of these important sulfur species in order to use sulfur isotopes for tracing different geological processes. Here, the theoretical equilibrium isotopic properties of the disulfur and trisulfur radical ions are computed and compared to the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfate ion (SO4 2−), using, for the first time, a first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) approach. The isotopic properties are calculated directly from molecular dynamics trajectories using the vibrational density of states and the atomic kinetic energy, and then compared to the more established method based on sampling of several snapshots. This comparison allowed us to validate the new modelling method and to assess its advantages and limitations. The predicted equilibrium isotope fractionation in terms of 34S/32S between S2 •− and S3 •− is small, i.e. <1‰, with a slight enrichment in the heavier isotope for S3 •−, over the temperature range 200–500 °C. Both radical ions are slightly depleted in the heavier isotope, by 1 to 2‰, relative to aqueous H2S. Our results help tuning sulfur isotope fractionation models used for tracing the origin and evolution of hydrothermal fluids. Our method opens large perspectives for using the rapidly growing body of MD simulation data in geosciences on structure and stability of aqueous complexes to assess in parallel element isotope fractionations from MD-generated trajectories.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Si and Zr incorporation was carried out using grafting (G) and sol–gel (SG) methods. The catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), N2 physisorption, Hg intrusion porosimetry (MIP), X-ray diffraction, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and then correlated with the kinetic parameters. The experimental results showed that Si- and Zr-modified catalysts promoted different degrees of activity and selectivity. The NMS/A-Zr­(G) catalyst displayed the highest HDS activity, followed by NMS/A-Zr­(SG), NMS/A, NMS/A-Si­(G), and NMS/A-Si­(SG) in descending order. The presence of Si and Zr in the catalysts and their incorporation methods were identified as the main reasons for this trend. More active catalysts exhibited an increased total acidity. Furthermore, Lewis sites were positively related to k DDS (CUS sites), while Brönsted sites were related to k HYD (BRIM sites). These modifications were found to enhance various characteristics of the catalysts, such as larger edge sites, Mo and NiMo coordination, and large pores.","E.P.P., N.S., and J.A.G.M. would like to express their sincere appreciation to the UA (Colombia), FAPERJ (Brazil), and UNAM (México) for supporting the research through the CB416-CII2022, E-26/201.516/2022, and UNAM-PAPIIT-IN112622, respectively.

A large number of studies have been conducted to understand such changes from a trip maker’s perspective, using different types of mobility data collected across the world. This study uses survey panel data on travel behaviour and activity participation collected between May 2020 and November 2020 in the United Kingdom, Australia, Colombia and South Africa using a consistent survey approach. We identify a role for three key underlying latent constructs, namely 1) concerns about COVID-19, 2) approval of government interventions and 3) scepticism towards COVID-19 measures. Using a hybrid choice model, we study the role of these constructs in explaining stated travel choices in two hypothetical post-pandemic scenarios. The model results show significantly different perceptions towards COVID-19 concerns and government handling of the COVID-19 pandemic (including restrictions) across countries. The model estimates show a clear influence for the latent constructs in explaining stated behaviour in the hypothetical post-pandemic scenarios across the four countries, where this is also impacted by lockdown stringency levels as well as socio-demographics.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Due to their life history traits and mortality attributed to pelagic longline fishing practices, this species is experiencing substantial population decline. Currently, C. longimanus is considered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as “vulnerable” throughout its range and “critically endangered” in the western north Atlantic. This study sequences and describes the complete mitochondrial genome of C. longimanus in detail.Methods and resultsThe mitochondrial genome of C. longimanus was assembled through next-generation sequencing and then analyzed using specialized bioinformatics tools. The circular, double-stranded AT-rich mitogenome of C. longimanus is 16,704 bp long and contains 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, 13 protein coding genes and a 1,065 bp long control region (CR). Out of the 22 tRNA genes, only one (tRNA-Ser1) lacked a typical ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structure. The prevalence of TTA (Leu), ATT (Ile) and CTA (Leu) codons in the PCGs likely contributes to the AT-rich nature of this mitogenome. In the CR, ten microsatellites were detected but no tandem repeats were found. Stem-and-loop secondary structures were common along the entire length of the CR.

For this, a theoretical study was carried out using computational simulations based on density functional theory to determine possible improvements in photocatalytic activity. for the capture and dissociation of carbon dioxide. Calculations were performed using density functional theory within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation, also the Hubbard correction together with ultrasmooth atomic pseudopotentials and a basic plane wave implemented in the Quantum-ESPRESSO package. The doping concentration level considered in this work was 6.25%, among the results, the semiconducting character of zinc oxide was evident from the density of states calculations, it was also found that by adding cerium impurities to zinc oxide, the values of the lengths and angles of the bonds vary a little, this may be due to the small difference in covalent radius that the zinc atom has with respect to the cerium atom, consequently, changes occurred in the electronic properties that consist in intermediate states in the energy bandgap located around the Fermi energy. This may suggest that the cerium-doped zinc oxide system can probably absorb visible light, which could lead to possible improvements in the photocatalytic properties of the material. Furthermore, we found that by adding carbon dioxide to the cerium-doped zinc oxide surface, the carbon dioxide is activated and this could suggest the dissociation or reduction of this contaminant.",Los autores agradecemos a la vicerrectoría de investigación y extensión de la universidad de Córdoba por haber financiado este trabajo.,,Emergent Materials,,,,2024-03-10,2024,2024-03-10,,,,1-9,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Doria, Angeles; Ponnefz Durango, Rafael E.; Alcalá Varilla, Luis A.","Doria, Angeles (Departamento de Física y Electrónica, Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 77-305, 230002, Montería, Colombia); Ponnefz Durango, Rafael E.

We show that for this structure, the dissipation produced by the frictional part is strong enough to produce an exponential decay of the solution no matter how small is its size, but the semigroup associated with the system is not exponentially stable when we apply a some localized K–V damping on the string, given by a suitable discontinuous function and certain condition under the length of the parts of the structure. However, when we impose hinged conditions on the beams on the interface points, the dissipation produced by a some localized K–V damping, given by a suitable continuous function, is strong enough to produce an exponential decay of the system solution. For the proof of these three results we use a frequency-domain method of semigroup theory, where in the proofs of exponential stability we also use a contradiction argument.","Declaration of competing interest We, the authors of this article, declare that we have no conflict of interest with the content of the article or any other related aspect.

This is an area of limited knowledge. I argue that aside from adhering to existing family firms, NGEs also develop new ventures independent of their family firms. For this purpose, a multi-case study was conducted based on 15 Colombian entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs were second and third-generation family firms, were involved within the FF or with their leaders, and demonstrated experience in exploiting business opportunities. The findings show that NGEs exploit business opportunities in their family firms, independently and simultaneously in both modes. NGEs that opt for the hierarchical mode experience cohesive family contexts and inclusive leadership focused on the family or the family firm. NGEs that opted for market mode by performing independent ventures were guided by leaders focused on entrepreneurship and who also promoted the formation of informal groups among NGEs. These results extend our comprehension of the influence of family firms in entrepreneurship and set the importance of fostering entrepreneurship among NGE to increase the opportunities to develop their interests without depending on the family firm.",,,Journal of Small Business & Entrepreneurship,,,,2024-09-13,2024,2024-09-13,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-29,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Orozco-Collazos, Luz Elena","Orozco-Collazos, Luz Elena (School of Management, Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia)","Orozco-Collazos, Luz Elena (Universidad de Los Andes)","Orozco-Collazos, Luz Elena (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/08276331.2024.2389730,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175733667,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

1066,pub.1172112626,10.1016/j.foreco.2024.121984,,,Structure and carbon stocks of accessible mangroves under different conservation status in the Colombian Caribbean,"Mangroves are under immense anthropogenic pressures globally which are further exacerbated by their accessibility to humans. To minimize human access hence pressures to the ecosystem, establishment of protected areas is often employed. However, the ecological effectiveness of protected areas, which influences their legal durability, is rarely assessed beyond curbing deforestation. Furthermore, little is known about whether protection could still provide a positive ecological impact if the sites are easily accessible, i.e., adjacent to urban areas, near roads, small in area and/or fragmented. To improve our understanding thereon, this study compares anthropogenic disturbance severity, forest structures and ecosystem carbon (C) stocks of protected and unprotected mangroves near Barranquilla, Colombia’s largest coastal city. The outcomes suggest that accessible, yet protected mangrove has a mean disturbance index of 5.3, lower than unprotected mangrove (mean 11). Protected mangrove also has higher mean (± SD) tree basal area (26.5 ± 15.6 m2 ha−1), mean densities of tree, sapling and seedling (899 ± 398, 5155 ± 7860, and 68,837 ± 73,899 individual ha−1, respectively) and biomass C stock (mean 89.5 ± 39 Mg ha−1) than those of accessible unprotected mangrove (mean basal area 19.3 ± 5 m2 ha−1; mean tree, sapling and seedling densities 823 ± 215, 749 ± 94, and 33,727 ± 44,882 individual ha−1, respectively; mean biomass C stock 60.2 ± 14.5 Mg ha−1). Results suggest that the current sediment C stocks, that is higher in unprotected than protected mangroves (396.8 ± 552.6 and 142.4 ± 205.7 Mg ha−1, respectively), are not primarily driven by conservation status, but by long-term processes that likely pre-date the protected status designation. Mangrove protection, however, could help maintain carbon stocks in soils and biomass and the potential for further soil carbon sequestration, and thus are pivotal in determining future trajectories of mangrove climate mitigation potential. This study shows that even imperfect protection offers ecological benefits to highly accessible ecosystems. Hence, focus should be placed on optimizing these benefits and minimizing their vulnerability to downgrading, downsizing and degazettement.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: K.

To achieve this behavioral change, it is crucial to understand the main factors that influence bicycle use. This study aims to understand the behavior of workers who do not commute by bicycle by integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and social identity into a Hybrid Modal Shift model (HMS) to define measures to motivate them to commute by bicycle. We designed a stated choice experiment comprised of three tangible attributes (i.e., bike lane types, trip-end facilities, and cash incentives). Indicators related to psychological factors of the TPB and social identity, and choices of whether to switch current modes of transportation to the bicycle, were observed through a face-to-face questionnaire addressed to workers who do not commute by bicycle in Bogota, Colombia (N=376). The HMS allowed us to understand the effects of tangible attributes and psychological constructs on the probability of shifting current transportation modes to commuting by bicycle to work. We also obtained the effect of each socioeconomic characteristic on the overall choice of shifting to bicycles. Then, by considering the heterogeneity captured through the psychological constructs, we designed measures based on social identity and some psychological factors of the TPB involving these groups of workers to motivate them to commute by bicycle.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Case Studies on Transport Policy,,,,2024-09,2024,,2024-09,,,101299,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Márquez, Luis; Cantillo, Victor; Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.","Márquez, Luis (Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia, Avenida Central del Norte 39-115, Tunja, Colombia); Cantillo, Victor (Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Paternina-Arboleda, Carlos D.

In vertebrates, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which catalyses the rate-limiting step in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) biosynthesis, is one of the best-known cytoophidium-forming enzymes. Formation of the cytoophidium has been proposed to alleviate the inhibition of IMPDH, thereby facilitating GTP production to support the rapid proliferation of certain cell types such as lymphocytes, cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, past studies lacked appropriate models to elucidate the significance of IMPDH cytoophidium under normal physiological conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that the presence of IMPDH cytoophidium in mouse PSCs correlates with their metabolic status rather than pluripotency. By introducing IMPDH2 Y12C point mutation through genome editing, we established mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines incapable of forming IMPDH polymers and the cytoophidium. Our data indicate an important role of IMPDH cytoophidium in sustaining a positive feedback loop that couples nucleotide biosynthesis with upstream metabolic pathways. Additionally, we find that IMPDH2 Y12C mutation leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased DNA damage in teratomas, as well as impaired embryo development following blastocoel injection. Further analysis shows that IMPDH cytoophidium assembly in mouse embryonic development begins after implantation and gradually increases throughout fetal development. These findings provide insights into the regulation of IMPDH polymerisation in embryogenesis and its significance in coordinating cell metabolism and development.","The authors would like to thank Joint Center for Instruments and Researches, College of Bioresources and Agriculture in National Taiwan University for the laser-scanning confocal microscopy facility and providing analysis for flow cytometry.

Originating from the bacterium Leptospira, it is transmitted through contact with the urine of reservoir animals, such as rodents. In Brazil, it is endemic, especially in the Northeast region, where poor sanitary conditions contribute to its dissemination. The objective of this study is to analyze the main determining factors for the increase in leptospirosis cases in the Northeast region of Brazil, with an emphasis on rainfall patterns and deficiencies in basic sanitation.
 Methodology: The methodology consisted of a qualitative exploratory-descriptive bibliographic review of articles published between 2014 and 2024 in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Inclusion criteria were relevance to the topic, while exclusion criteria involved duplicated articles or those that did not highlight the content of interest. The search was conducted in databases such as LILACS, SciELO, and PubMed, using specific descriptors. The analysis involved careful selection and exhaustive reading for the categorization of results.
 Results and Discussion: Leptospirosis impacts urban and poor areas, with over one million annual cases globally. Factors such as precipitation and disordered urbanization contribute to its spread, especially in tropical regions. Low-income populations are vulnerable due to the lack of basic sanitation. The unequal distribution reflects socio-economic disparities, with densely populated urban areas being more affected.
 Conclusion: Leptospirosis poses a challenge to public health, especially in regions with poor sanitary conditions. Effective control requires a comprehensive approach, including improvements in sanitation infrastructure, health education, and rodent control.",,,Asian Journal of Medicine and Health,,,,2024-06-03,2024,2024-06-03,,22,7,45-53,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Amorim, Brenda Vitória Machado; Cova, Gabriella Mascarenhas; Silva, Carlos Danilo Cardoso Matos; de Vasconcellos Neto, João Ronaldo Tavares","Amorim, Brenda Vitória Machado (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil); Cova, Gabriella Mascarenhas (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil); Silva, Carlos Danilo Cardoso Matos (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil); de Vasconcellos Neto, João Ronaldo Tavares (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil)",,"Amorim, Brenda Vitória Machado (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil); Cova, Gabriella Mascarenhas (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil); Silva, Carlos Danilo Cardoso Matos (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil); de Vasconcellos Neto, João Ronaldo Tavares (Unidade de Ensino Superior de Feira de Santana, Brazil)",0,0,,,https://journalajmah.com/index.php/AJMAH/article/download/1044/2071,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172480639,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

The use of a surrogate prey/host, as Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), easily obtained and maintain, could be an option to undertake experiments. The aim of this study was to test to what extent the eggs of E. kuehniella is a suitable surrogate host of T. absoluta eggs to test for feeding preference and intraguild interactions between Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) (Hemiptera: Miridae) and Trichogramma achaeae Nagaraja and Nagarkatti (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). Our results shows that E. kuehniella eggs is a suitable surrogate host to test for feeding preference and intraguild interactions between natural enemies, taking in consideration that i) under single diet, feeding on T. absoluta eggs is expected to be twice that on E. kuehniella, ii) whether offering T. absoluta or E. kuehniella under different ratios of parasitized vs unparasitized eggs, feeding preference was always toward non-parasitized eggs iii) conspecific experiments with increasing density of M. pygmaeus females, the results revel an overall decrease on feeding consumption of 38,7% of E. kuehniella compared with T. absoluta eggs but experiments with T. achaeae show an overall increase in parasitism rate of 78,2% of eggs toward E. kuehniella eggs iv) Heterospecific experiments with increasing density of both natural enemies, when using E. kuehniellaeggs we found an overall decrease on feeding consumption of 30% and an increase of parasitism rate of 65%.",,,Research Square,,,,2024-03-14,2024,2024-03-14,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Soares, António Onofre; Durão, Ana C.; Oliveira, Maria Luísa; Arruda, Patrícia; Borges, Isabel","Soares, António Onofre (University of the Azores); Durão, Ana C.

Study case of the Cesar River, Colombia","Past research has mapped the limitations of water quality data in developing countries. This contribution reports a detailed assessment of the status of water quality data of the Cesar River, one of the main tributaries of the Magdalena River, which is regarded as the largest river system in Colombia. Our assessment indicates that the data is limited (in terms of length of record and resolution spatial) and exhibits significant information gaps, and that it is collected through a network of very sparse ground stations with deficient density. Subnational permissible limits for the five main water quality parameters (i.e., pH, TP, TN, DO, TSS) determine that water has reached worrisome levels of pollution. The data limitations does not allow for establishing the influence of natural (e.g., soil erosion) or anthropogenic processes such as wastewater discharges and in-channel sand mining into water quality. Since Colombia is a member of the Pacific Alliance and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the associated supranational water quality regulatory frameworks are analyzed as they may guide the permissible limits and targets in the coming years. A freely accessible database of water quality observations between the years 2004–2020 of the Cesar River accompanies this contribution. We believe that it potentially constitutes a scientific input to plan for restoring the ecosystem services of the Cesar. We also believe this study depicts a representative case of the status of several rivers from the Latin American sphere and other developing countries.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

969,pub.1174105663,10.26439/ddee2024.n005.6473,,,La asociatividad de las mypes en el Perú: el dilema de la confianza explorado mediante un juego bayesiano,"The purpose of this article is to analyze the reasons behind the low associativity between micro and small enterprises (mypes) in Peru and its repercussions on productive efficiency, since they are related to high costs, less access to credit and other uncompetitive aspects. Over the years, cooperation has been encouraged as a way of coping with such problems; however, even after learning about the benefits, the average number of mypes that opt for the strategy is 9 %. To explain the data, “distrust” is considered as a factor. Since the variable cannot be quantified and the companies lack information about the other entity (if it will deceive them or not), a Bayesian game is proposed, whose solution suggests that there will be associativity if the synergy is greater than the expected loss in a difference greater than 1, which at first sight is not the case. But is that true or just people’s impression? If true, it would be contradicted by the fact that 70,2 % of the 9 % that did join indicated they obtained improvements in different areas. Although the positive results are evident, most do not want to take the risk.

Anschließend beleuchte ich ein sicherheitsrelevantes Ziel bzw. einen sicherheitsrelevanten Zustand im Rahmen der Entsorgung hochradioaktiver Abfälle in Deutschland sowie die Akteur:innen in jedem dieser beiden Fälle: Zuversicht angesichts der Lernfähigkeit des Verfahrens sowie Hoffnung auf das Fortbestehen des rechtsstaatlichen Rahmens. Nach einer vertiefenden Betrachtung der Begriffe Zuversicht und Hoffnung argumentiere ich für eine positive Funktion der Zuversicht und weise auf die ambivalente Rolle der Hoffnung hin: Forscher:innen und Mitglieder der verantwortlichen Institutionen sind angehalten, ihre Zuversicht zu zeigen dort, wo sie angesichts der Entwicklung des lernenden Verfahrens begründet besteht. Das Fortbestehen eines demokratischen Rechtsstaats für den gesamten Entsorgungsprozess implizit vorauszusetzen, ist aber grundsätzlich zu vermeiden.

magnetic systems, exhibiting even (d, g, or i-wave) spin-polarization order in
the band structure, setting them apart from conventional collinear ferromagnets
and antiferromagnets. Altermagnets offer advantages of spin polarized current
akin to ferromagnets, and THz functionalities similar to antifferomagnets,
while introducing new novel effects like spin-splitter currents. A key
challenge for future applications and functionalization of altermagnets, is to
demonstrate controlled transitioning to the altermagnetic phase from other
conventional phases in a single material. Here we prove a viable path towards
overcoming this challenge through a strain-induced transition from an
antiferromagnetic to an altermagnetic phase in ReO$_2$. Combining spin group
symmetry analysis and \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we demonstrate that
under compressive strain ReO$_2$ undergoes such transition, lifting the
Kramer's degeneracy of the band structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in the
non-relativistic regime. In addition, we show that this magnetic transition is
accompanied by a metal insulator transition, and calculate the distinct spin
polarized spectral functions of the two phases, which can be detected in angle
resolved photo-emission spectroscopy experiments.",,,arXiv,,,,2024-01-31,2024,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Chakraborty, Atasi; Hernández, Rafael González; šmejkal, Libor; Sinova, Jairo","Chakraborty, Atasi (); Hernández, Rafael González (); šmejkal, Libor (); Sinova, Jairo ()",,"Chakraborty, Atasi (); Hernández, Rafael González (); šmejkal, Libor (); Sinova, Jairo ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168482875,51 Physical Sciences; 5104 Condensed Matter Physics,

Here, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, including meristic, morphometric, and mtDNA analyses, to resolve the particularly intricate relationship among Urotrygon munda Gill, 1863, Urotrygon chilensis (Günther, 1872), and Urotrygon asterias (Jordan & Gilbert, 1883). The latter species is currently a synonym of U. munda but is also considered the U. chilensis ""northern morphotype."" These taxonomic entities have historically been confounded, mainly due to their phenotypical resemblance along their geographic distribution in the eastern Pacific. We assessed 78 specimens (43 ""northern"" and 30 ""southern morphotypes"" of U. chilensis, as well as 5 U. munda) using 19 external variables for taxonomic and morphometric analysis. Distinct meristic patterns, including pectoral and pelvic ceratotrichia, vertebrae number, and thorn distribution along the dorsal midline, were observed in the series-type specimens of the three taxonomic entities. Our multivariate morphometric analyses consistently differentiated the three groups as distinct taxonomic entities, with an overall classification accuracy of 66.7%. The meristic results also provided reliable information distinguishing the three entities. Based on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH2) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes, our phylogenetic analysis were consistent with the morphometric and meristic data, supporting these three entities as distinct species having their own evolutionary lineages. Our comprehensive approach confidently demonstrated that the northern U. chilensis morphotype matched and corresponded to the description of the Starry round ray, U. asterias, confirming its taxonomic resurrection as a valid species distinct from U. chilensis and U. munda. The geographic distribution of U. asterias spans from the tropical west coast of Mexico (including the Gulf of California) to Costa Rica, revealing that microevolutionary processes have well-defined population clades within this range. Furthermore, U. chilensis is unequivocally established as the sole Urotrygon species occurring south of the Guayaquil marine ecoregion. In addition, the public COI and NADH2 sequences available for Urotrygon hosted in the ad hoc online databases were found to be misidentified, emphasizing the need for rigorous taxonomic scrutiny in this group. Finally, our research underscores the significance of an integrative approach that combines morphometric, meristic, and molecular techniques with historical data to disentangle the complexities of closely related taxa.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are thankful for the time and help provided by the Ichthyological Curators and assistants Victor Cota (CICIMAR‐IPN, Mexico), Lucia Campos‐Dávila and Eduardo Balart (CIBNOR Unidad La Paz, BCS, México), Félipe Amezcua (ICMyL—UNAM Mexico), Carlos Luque (LCT‐IMARPE, Peru), Sandra Raredon, Abigail Reft, and Jeff Williams (USNM), Heather Prestridge and Kevin Conway (BRTC Texas A&amp;M University), James Maclaine (NHM London), and Irina Eidus and Ralf Thiel (ZMH‐Hamburg).

However, its transformation is a challenge, due to the physicochemical characteristics of GWs that affect the process time and product quality. This limits the application of this technology in developing countries such as Colombia. This article presents contributions on the advances in GW composting research, based on results of six years of studies carried out by the authors of this paper. Reflections are addressed on: i) the analysis of the physicochemical quality of the substrates, ii) the evaluation of strategies to improve the process and the quality of the product, and iii) the perspectives on the alternatives implemented so far. The results of the investigations show that the strategies at different scales have been effective in reducing process times (between 43 and 67 days), improving the conditions for sanitizing the material (temperature in thermophilic ranges for a longer time -6 additional days- compared to treatments without strategies) and compliance with product quality standards. The reflection proposes new perspectives to continue with the studies of improvement of GW composting, among which issues associated with the use of co-substrates, additives, and bacterial inoculum are addressed, as well as the evaluation of product quality and employment of optimization tools in GW composting. These studies help position GW composting as a suitable option for the management of the lignocellulosic fraction present in municipal solid waste (MSW).",,,Ingeniería y Competitividad,,,,2024-02-28,2024,2024-02-28,,26,1,40113143,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Parra-Orobio, Brayan A.; Soto-Paz, Jonathan; Oviedo-Ocaña, Edgar R.","Parra-Orobio, Brayan A.

becoming infected with a pathogen is a crucial step towards disease management.
We perform a novel epidemiological tomography for the estimation of landscape
propensity to disease infection, using GPS animal tracks in a manner analogous
to tomographic techniques in Positron Emission Tomography. Our study data
consists of individual tracks of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and
three exotic Cervidae species moving freely in a high-fenced game preserve over
given time periods. A serological test was performed on each individual to
measure antibody concentration of epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV)
at the beginning and at the end of each tracking period. EHDV is a vector-borne
viral disease indirectly transmitted between ruminant hosts by biting midges.
We model the data as a binomial linear inverse problem, where spatial coherence
is enforced with a total variation regularization. The smoothness of the
reconstructed propensity map is selected by the quantile universal threshold,
which can also test the null hypothesis that the propensity map is spatially
constant. We apply our method to simulated and real data, showing good

The physicochemical properties and biological activity of these preparations are often investigated in preclinical research, yet no guidelines for experimental research currently exist in this area. The present PrePoP guidelines aim to provide recommendations to promote high-quality, statistically sound, and reproducible preclinical research on potentised preparations.
METHODS: Input was gathered from researchers nominated by the relevant scientific societies using a simplified Delphi consensus approach covering the most relevant aspects of basic research methodology in the field including appropriate controls, sample preparation and handling, and statistics. After three rounds of feedback, a consensus was finally reached on the most important aspects and considerations for conducting high-quality research on potentised preparations.
RESULTS: We present a series of recommendations on a range of topics including experimental controls, system stability, blinding and randomisation, environmental influences, and procedures for the preparation of potentised samples and controls, and we address some specific challenges of this research field.
CONCLUSION: This expert consensus process resulted in a robust set of methodological guidelines for research on potentised preparations and provides a valuable framework that will inform and improve the quality of subsequent research in this emerging field.

The average age of the participants was 65.12 ± 11.617 years and 57.2% were female, who have suffered from diabetes for 13.4 years on average ± 8.088 and an average 158.84 mg/dL ± 61.913 fasting plasma glucose.ResultsThe correlation analyses revealed that a higher perception of QoL, the lower the perception that having diabetes affected QoL (p<0.01); the higher the TA, the lower the QoL (p<0.01); and the higher the TA, the lower the perception that having diabetes affected QoL (p<0.01). The participants with an uncontrolled T2DM exhibited a better QoL than those that manage their glucose levels (p = 0.015). The participants’ level of education had a positive effect on QoL (β = 0.163, IC 95%: 0.429─3.415, p = 0.012), whereas the DRQoL had a negative effect (β = -0.546, IC 95%: -0.127─-0.080, p = 0.001).ConclusionsIf the TA of patients with T2DM increases, the overall QoL as well as the DRQoL will improve.

This chapter presents an account of how our intergenerational university-community team pulled together during intersecting challenges of COVID, sociopolitical upheaval, and extreme environmental conditions to connect with and engage in meaningful experiences with our local community of youth and families. Our efforts involved major shifts from in-person to virtual explorations and collaborative projects (e.g., an anthology coauthored by youth) with an even greater emphasis on social activism and celebrating the experiential knowledge of youth that is often overlooked. Hence, this chapter offers readers a ‘spotlight tour’ of CBL programming during a tumultuous period. We share parallel tales of perseverance and transformation of three key CBL programs—LEAFY (Literacies for Environmental Awareness and Farming for Youth), Curie-osity Project, and CBL in the Schools (a partnership with Santa Barbara Unified School District) to show what possibilities abound when we give young students access to knowledge about key societal issues and a platform by which they can contribute to the transformations needed for a socially just and equitable society.",,,,University-Community Partnerships for Transformative Education,"Mara Welsh Mahmood, Marjorie Elaine, John Cano",,2024-08-14,2024,2024-08-14,2024,,,191-223,All OA; Hybrid,Chapter,"Arya, Diana J.; González, Estefanía Pihen; Christman, Devon M.; Ozgen, Dogukan; Cano, John; Muller, Alexandria; Shackley, Matthew J.; Meier, Valerie; Mottus, Rae","Arya, Diana J.

Case of Higher Education Institutions in Latin America,"English Abstract: This research seeks to analyze the factors that influenced the perception of academic anxiety manifested by teachers of higher education institutions in Latin America, during the first weeks of confinement due to Covid-19. This is an exploratory study using an online survey available from April 6 to 24, 2020. 251 teachers (n = 251, 1-α = 95% and e = 6.2) linked to higher education institutions responded from 6 Iberoamerican countries (Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Spain, Mexico and Puerto Rico). The main results point to a greater perception of anxiety among teachers from institutions with a face-to-face pre-confinement study modality and from public institutions, with a negative institutional perception, and perception of a greater risk of contagion by COVID-19. The need to rethink teacher training at a psychosocial level is reaffirmed, so that it helps emotional management and active coping with uncertain and demanding scenarios such as those experienced during the period studied.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Said-Hung, Elias; Marcano, Beatriz; Garzon-Clemente, Rebeca","Said-Hung, Elias (Universidad Internacional de la Rioja); Marcano, Beatriz (Universidad Internacional de la Rioja (UNIR)); Garzon-Clemente, Rebeca (Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas)",,"Said-Hung, Elias (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Marcano, Beatriz (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Garzon-Clemente, Rebeca (Autonomous University of Chiapas)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170431943,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

This study aimed at evaluating their simultaneous association while controlling for key confounding variables.Methods A cross-sectional study was carried-out with 2,918 secondary school students from seven charter schools located in low-resourced neighborhoods in Bogota (Colombia), 54.12% were female, and mean age was 13.81 years. The self-report instrument included demographic variables, well-being, mental health, risk behaviors and symptoms of psychopathology. Assessment of ACEs was done by a series of yes/no questions, prosocial behavior was evaluated with the corresponding subscale in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and depression was assessed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Associations were tested using the Spearman correlation coefficient, Z tests and Chi-square tests, and all primary outcome analyses were adjusted for potential confounding variables through multivariate logistic regression using depression as outcome.Results Mean exposure to ACEs was 3.15 events; those exposed to four or more obtained lower scores in well-being, satisfaction with life and family functioning, and higher scores in symptoms of psychopathology. For the prosocial behavior scores, 64.35% were classified as close to the average, 17.51% as slightly lowered, 11.91% as low, and 6.23% as very low; participants with higher levels of prosocial behavior showed lower scores in symptoms of psychopathology. ACEs and prosocial behavior were not simultaneously associated with depression, and prosocial behavior did not modify the association between ACEs and depressive symptoms (Odds Ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.66–2.93).Conclusions Novel studies should further elucidate the developmental pathways involving positive and negative mental health constructs to better understand the actual effectiveness of interventions that use these constructs in their design.",,,Research Square,,,,2024-03-19,2024,2024-03-19,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Alarcón, Andrés Camilo Cardozo; Arenas, Nathaly Moreno; Ávila, Kharen Alessandra Verjel; Maza, Elena María Trujillo; Rodríguez, Charlotte Greniez; Riaño, Olga Lucía Vargas; Acevedo, Daniel Enrique Suárez","Alarcón, Andrés Camilo Cardozo (Universidad de los Andes); Arenas, Nathaly Moreno (Universidad de los Andes); Ávila, Kharen Alessandra Verjel (Universidad de los Andes); Maza, Elena María Trujillo (Universidad de los Andes); Rodríguez, Charlotte Greniez (Alianza Educativa); Riaño, Olga Lucía Vargas (Alianza Educativa); Acevedo, Daniel Enrique Suárez (Universidad de los Andes)",,"Alarcón, Andrés Camilo Cardozo (Universidad de Los Andes); Arenas, Nathaly Moreno (Universidad de Los Andes); Ávila, Kharen Alessandra Verjel (Universidad de Los Andes); Maza, Elena María Trujillo (Universidad de Los Andes); Rodríguez, Charlotte Greniez (Alianza Educativa); Riaño, Olga Lucía Vargas (Alianza Educativa); Acevedo, Daniel Enrique Suárez (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4103840/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169904672,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The simulation—built-in Arena—considers age, seniority, and the probability of continuing in the institution as the main input random variables in the model. An annual interest rate of 7% and an average annual salary increase of 3% were considered. The scenario simulated consisted of the teacher and the university making contributions, the faculty 5% of his salary, and the university 5% of the teacher’s salary. Since the base salaries with which teachers join to university are variable, we considered a monthly salary of MXN 23 181.2, corresponding to full-time teachers with middle salaries. The results obtained by a simulation of 30 replicates showed that the confidence intervals for the average age at retirement were (55.0, 55.2) years, for the average seniority (22.1, 22.3) years, and for the average savings amount (329 795.2, 341 287.0) MXN.

Economic exchange is seen as any exchange of value. It is not limited to money exchanges. The theoretical framework used is that of Austrian economics which uniquely has applied subjective value to economic analysis in a way which has enriched the understanding of human liberty. The discussion here is expansive. Value exchanges in all social interactions. The question is to derive criteria which determine the ethical nature of these exchanges. It is shown that a basic praxeological model of exchange, derived from perfect market conditions, can be adapted to all exchanges. The expression of value in the exchange is a thymological event. As such it serves to guide the determination as to the ethnical nature of the exchange. This approach restores economics to its proper place, as subordinate to ethics. This is as it was through most of human history, economics as a relationship between people, mediated by the products of production and the market. After developing the theme of empathy needed for ethical conduct and a broad and nuanced definition of coercion, the analysis concludes that ethical exchanges are those which minimize coercion and maximize human freedom.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Stomper, Richard","Stomper, Richard (Illinois FOP Labor Council; Swiss Management Centre University (Switzerland); Universidad Central de Nicaragua)",,"Stomper, Richard (Illinois FOP Labor Council; Swiss Management Centre University (Switzerland); Universidad Central de Nicaragua; Illinois FOP Labor Council; Swiss Management Centre University (Switzerland); Universidad Central de Nicaragua; Central University of Nicaragua)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171233055,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",

Meter placement algorithms allow identifying the best type and location for new measurements, thus being a key tool in support of meter installation decisions and planning. Existing meter placement solutions aim at reducing the monitoring uncertainties below an arbitrary accuracy threshold, but typically they are not explicitly linked to some tangible benefits achievable by the grid operator via the measurement infrastructure upgrade. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting an overall meter placement strategy that takes into account how the monitoring uncertainties translate into costs for avoiding contingencies and then drives the meter placement process according to the economic benefit resulting from the reduction of those uncertainties. An exemplary implementation is presented to describe the underlying concepts and the role and functionalities of the different software components involved in the meter placement cost–benefit analysis. Simulations performed on a sample grid show the application of the proposed meter placement strategy in a realistic scenario and highlight how this may be used to determine not only type and location of the new meters but also the number of measurements that makes sense to install according to cost–benefit criteria.",,"This work was supported by the Interoperability Network for the Energy Transition (IntNET), through the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Program under Grant 101070086.",IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-04-11,2024-01-01,73,,1-12,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Pau, Marco; Ginocchi, Mirko; Pacheco, David; Ponci, Ferdinanda; Monti, Antonello","Pau, Marco (Department of Grid Planning and Operation, Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology, 34117, Kassel, Germany); Ginocchi, Mirko (Institute for Automation of Complex Power System, RWTH Aachen University, 52062, Aachen, Germany); Pacheco, David (Institute for Automation of Complex Power System, RWTH Aachen University, 52062, Aachen, Germany); Ponci, Ferdinanda (Institute for Automation of Complex Power System, RWTH Aachen University, 52062, Aachen, Germany); Monti, Antonello (Institute for Automation of Complex Power System, RWTH Aachen University, 52062, Aachen, Germany; Center for Digital Energy, Fraunhofer FIT, 52068, Aachen, Germany)","Ginocchi, Mirko (RWTH Aachen University)","Pau, Marco (Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology); Ginocchi, Mirko (RWTH Aachen University); Pacheco, David (RWTH Aachen University); Ponci, Ferdinanda (RWTH Aachen University); Monti, Antonello (RWTH Aachen University; Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology)",0,0,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/19/4407674/10497124.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170652884,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,

by considering the presence of spin-orbit interaction. We employ a multiorbital
Slater-Koster tight-binding approach to derive effective k.p-type Hamiltonians
that describes the dominant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects of the Rashba and
intrinsic origin at the high {\Gamma} and S high symmetry points in
phosphorene. In the absence of SOC effects a minimal admixture of pz and py
atomic orbitals suffices to reproduce the well known anisotropy of highest
valence and the lowest conduction bands at the {\Gamma}-point, consistent with
density functional theory (DFT) and k.p methods. In contrast, the inclusion of
the px and s atomic orbitals are rather crucial for an adequate description of
the SOC effects in phosphorene at low energies, particularly at the S-point. We
introduce useful analytical expressions for the Rashba and intrinsic SOC
parameters in terms of the relevant Slater-Koster integrals. In addition, we
report simple formulas for the interband dipole-strenghts, revealing the nature
of the strong anisotropic behavior of its lower bands. Our findings can be

'Multiple-use' marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented to accommodate SSFs (among other uses) within areas designated for conservation, creating opportunities and challenges for SSF governance. We analyzed eleven case studies from LAC to explore: (1) how different MPA institutional designs affect key aspects of SSF governance and (2) the links between these effects and the type of initiative that promoted MPA establishment (origin). Results indicate that the existence of an MPA benefited SSF governance in many ways, with more pronounced positive effects in MPAs with mixed to bottom-up origin supported by well-organized fishing groups. In addition, the presence of supportive MPA authorities that leveraged local capacities and initiatives and adopted flexible and collaborative governance systems made a difference in several cases.

Some qualitative studies have been conducted; however, it is currently little known about the meaning of the experience of exercising in people with HIV. This hermeneutic research used 21 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with patients with this condition. The analysis was based on a grounded Theory methodology, which is theoretically supported by symbolic interactionism. It was possible to advance in re-signifying HIV from a social stigma context. This process, through exercise and social, family and medical support, comes from the breaking of individual and collective perception paradigms. Particularly, exercise changes the perspective from a HIV-infected person on the verge of death to a healthy, active and functional individual with personal goals. Thus, by contributing to functionality and health recovery, exercise re-signifies life. Moreover, commitment to physical activity goals is influenced by inner tensions that can hinder or encourage this habit and demand further research. HIV infection shifts from being a death sentence to a healthy self-perception beyond the diagnosis.","We are very grateful to all participants and institutions Virrey Solis and RASA foundation, as well as to research groups GRINMADE and FILIS.","The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this work.",Qualitative Research in Sport Exercise and Health,,,,2024-03-29,2024,2024-03-29,2024-07-03,16,4,387-401,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rodriguez-Moreno, Yeimmy; Calderón-Cardona, Omar Antionio; Gallo-Villegas, Jaime Alberto; Yepes-Delgado, Carlos Enrique","Rodriguez-Moreno, Yeimmy (Intern/Resident Medicine Applied to Physical Activity and Sports, Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA), Medellín, Colombia); Calderón-Cardona, Omar Antionio (Intern/Resident Medicine Applied to Physical Activity and Sports, Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA), Medellín, Colombia); Gallo-Villegas, Jaime Alberto (School of Medicine, Universidad de Antioquia, Clinic and Research Center SICOR, Medellín, Colombia); Yepes-Delgado, Carlos Enrique (School of Medicine, Universidad de Antioquia, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellín, Colombia)","Rodriguez-Moreno, Yeimmy (University of Antioquia)","Rodriguez-Moreno, Yeimmy (University of Antioquia); Calderón-Cardona, Omar Antionio (University of Antioquia); Gallo-Villegas, Jaime Alberto (University of Antioquia); Yepes-Delgado, Carlos Enrique (Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe)",0,0,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2159676X.2024.2330346?needAccess=true,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170273910,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

He reacts –with manifest “fervor”– to the darkening of the mystery and the relegation of the Sacrament and Church in the speculative theology of the nineteenth century, which – according to him – forgets that religion is re-ligio and projects on St. Paul things of the nineteenth century: religious experience, Hegelianism and mystery religion. His choice of the Pauline letter to the Ephesians makes sense. In it – following St. Irenaeus and the Greek Fathers – he highlights: the Pauline perspective of the Mysterium Christi; the soteriological value of the recapitulation (άνακεφαλαίωσις); and sacramental (baptismal) regeneration that makes us children in the Son and, in Him, partakers of the divine nature. This is the perspec-tive of Casel’s Mysterientheologie. We already find the caselian thesis of the reproduction of the redemptive work (not only its effect) in sacramental grace. His theology of the sacramental and ecclesial mystery is made explicit in “The Supernatural Being...”.

734,pub.1167789861,10.1515/apeiron-2022-0100,,,The Megaric Possibility Paradox,"Abstract  In Metaphysics Theta 3 Aristotle attributes to the Megarics and unknown others a notorious modal thesis: (M) something can φ only if it is φ -ing. Aristotle does not tell us what motivated (M). Almost all scholars take Aristotle’s report to indicate that the Megarics defended (M) as a highly counterintuitive doctrine in modal metaphysics. But this reading faces several problems. First: what would motivate the Megarics to hold such a counterintuitive view? The existing literature tries, in various ways, to motivate (M) in a way neither trivial nor absurd. But, as we will argue, the main approaches end up attributing an unsustainable position to the Megarics. Second: most historical evidence for the Megaric lineage presents the group’s philosophical practice as dialectical or negative. So why think that the claim reported in Theta 3 presents a positive, and highly controversial, metaphysical claim? This paper addresses these problems by proposing a dialectical (or negative) reading of the Megarics in Theta 3. By ‘dialectical’ we here mean a mode of philosophizing that neither seeks to establish the truth or falsity of certain theses, nor takes a skeptical stance. There are different reasons why a philosopher might want to take up such a mode; in the case of the Megarics we argue that they might have wanted to put pressure on Aristotle’s idea of possibility and the ‘test’ for possibility that Aristotle mentions in several works. Reading, as we do, (M) as (part of) a paradox about possibility and actuality, we argue that the Megarics’ dialectical approach here aims to highlight a shortcoming of an intuitive conception of possibility, which underpins Aristotle’s idea of possibility and which features in his test for possibility.",,,Apeiron,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-01-10,2024-01-01,57,1,111-137,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Steinkrüger, Philipp; Duncombe, Matthew","Steinkrüger, Philipp (Department of Philosophy II, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany); Duncombe, Matthew (Department of Philosophy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK)","Steinkrüger, Philipp (Ruhr University Bochum)","Steinkrüger, Philipp (Ruhr University Bochum); Duncombe, Matthew (University of Nottingham)",0,0,,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/apeiron-2022-0100/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167789861,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields; 5003 Philosophy,

We introduce a notion of extended Grothendieck topology on any ∞-topos, and prove that the poset of extended Grothendieck topologies is isomorphic to that of topological localizations, hypercomplete localizations, Lawvere–Tierney topologies, and covering topologies (a variation on the notion of pretopology). It follows that these posets are small and have the structure of a frame. We revisit also the topological–cotopological factorization by introducing the notion of a cotopological morphism. And we revisit the notions of hypercompletion, hyperdescent, hypercoverings and hypersheaves associated to an extended Grothendieck topology. We also introduce the notion of forcing, which is a tool to compute with localizations of ∞-topoi. We use this in particular to show that the topological part of a left-exact localization of an ∞-topos is universally forcing the generators of this localization to be ∞-connected instead of inverting them.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Mathieu Anel reports financial support was provided by Air Force Office of Scientific Research through grant FA9550-20-1-0305.

We focus on the 1973 coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to power in Chile. The Pinochet dictatorship's aims of political control and fiscal conservatism led to a large reduction in the number of openings for new students across all universities. Individuals that reached college age shortly after the coup experienced a sharp decline in college enrollment, had worse labor market outcomes throughout the life cycle and struggled to climb up the socioeconomic ladder. This contraction of higher education disproportionately affected applicants from less affluent backgrounds and plausibly contributed to the increase in inequality observed under Pinochet. We further show that individuals exposed to reduced access to college registered to vote at higher rates for the 1988 plebiscite that triggered Chile's democratic transition and we provide suggestive evidence that they increasingly voted against Pinochet.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Bautista, María Angélica; González, Felipe; Martinez, Luis R.; Muñoz, Pablo; Muñoz, Francisco","Bautista, María Angélica (University of Chicago); González, Felipe (Queen Mary University of London); Martinez, Luis R.

Despite their importance for device performance, accurately predicting their excitonic effects typically requires computationally demanding many-body approaches. Here, we present a simplified model to describe the static macroscopic dielectric function, which depends only on the width of the quasi-one-dimensional system and its polarizability per unit length. We show that at certain interaction distances, the screened Coulomb potential is greater than its bare counterpart, which results from the enhanced repulsive electron-electron interactions. As a test case, we study 14 different nanoribbons, 12 of them armchair graphene nanoribbons of different families. Initially, we devised a simplified equation to estimate the exciton binding energy and extension that provides results comparable to those from the full Bethe-Salpeter equation, albeit for a specific nanoribbon family. Then, we used our proposed screening potential to solve the 1D Wannier-Mott equation, which turns out to be a broad approach that is able to predict binding energies that match quite well the ones obtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation, irrespective of the nanoribbon family.","The authors thank Dr. A.

The research was carried out through a pre-experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design in a sample of 102 students from the National University of the Peruvian Amazon. The techniques and instruments used in the research were the survey, the questionnaire, and direct observation with a data collection protocol. The most relevant results in the evaluation of the virtual expositions without the use of Jamboard were a low percentage of students who did a good job, while when using Jamboard as a strategy, this percentage increased considerably. The study led to the conclusion that the use of Jamboard as a tool to improve presentations in the university context is an indicator of quality in the execution of virtual presentations and contributes to their improvement.",,,Región Científica,,,,2024-01-15,2024,2024-01-15,,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dávila Panduro, Susy Karina; Dávila Arbaiza, Guillermo; Li Loo Kung, Carlos Antonio","Dávila Panduro, Susy Karina (Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana.

In this sense, we study the viability of reconstructing the background variables assuming a non-linear kinetic term given by K ( X , ϕ ) = X + g ( ϕ ) X 2 , with X the standard kinetic term associated to the scalar field ϕ and g ( ϕ ) an arbitrary coupling function. In order to achieve this reconstruction in the context of inflation, we assume the slow-roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index n s and the speed of sound c s as a function of the number of e − folds N . By assuming the simplest parametrizations for n s − 1 = − 2 / N and c s ∝ N − β with β a constant, we find the reconstruction of the effective potential V ( ϕ ) and the coupling function g ( ϕ ) in terms of the scalar field. Besides, we study the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, where we determine the temperature and number of e − folds during the reheating epoch in terms of the reconstructed variables and the observational parameters. In this way, the parameter-space related to the reconstructed inflationary model are constrained during the epochs of inflation and reheating by assuming the current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The former is a non-linear theory involving a massive spin-1 field, that can be extended incorporating operators of the Generalized Proca class, and when coupled to gravity it can be covariantized in a way that exhibits consistent and ghost-free cosmological solutions, without experiencing instabilities and superluminalities at the perturbative level. When applied at a cosmological framework it induces extra terms in the Friedmann equations, however due to the special non-linear construction the field is eliminated in favor of the Hubble function. Thus, the resulting effective dark energy sector is dynamical, however it contains the same number of free parameters with the ΛCDM concordance model. We use data from Supernovae Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) observations and we construct the corresponding likelihood-contours for the free parameters. Interestingly enough, application of various information criteria, such as AIC, BIC and DIC, shows that the scenario of massive Proca-Nuevo gravity, although having exactly the same number of free parameters with ΛCDM paradigm, it is more efficient in fitting the data. Finally, the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter shows statistical compatibility with the model-independent, data-driven reconstructed one.",,,Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,,,,2024-04-01,2024,2024-04-16,2024-04-01,2024,04,051,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Anagnostopoulos, Fotios K.; Saridakis, Emmanuel N.","Anagnostopoulos, Fotios K.

In order to validate the potential of phytoliths to reconstruct the vegetation history in the Atacama Desert, Chile, we analyzed the occurrence and morphotypes of phytoliths in different organs of 97 plant species from 36 families living in the Coastal Cordillera of the Atacama Desert. Phytolith extraction was conducted by a new protocol using microwave digestion, which is rapid, provides clean and well preserved phytoliths and can be employed on plant material as well as sediments. Phytoliths were found only in Poaceae and Bromeliaceae. Although this limited occurrence restricts their value for the reconstruction of past vegetation diversity, their identification to sub-family and species levels provides detailed information on the occurrence of grasses and monocot flowering plants. These taxa are sensitive to environmental factors, such as climatic conditions, i.e. temperature and water availability. Comparisons of the phytolith morphotypes isolated here with those described in the literature suggest that the characteristics of the phytoliths in the Atacama Desert may not only depend on species and plant organs, but may also be dependent on the specific regional environmental conditions.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

423,pub.1169279039,10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103714,,,Sustainable integration of desalinated seawater into regional water supply networks using a participatory modelling framework,"Water scarcity is a critical issue worldwide and has become a major constraint on socio-economic development. Seawater desalination is an appealing adaptation option in regions with access to the coast; however, it has sustainability challenges that require careful consideration. Two critical challenges are: how to manage the spectrum of potential adverse social and environmental impacts; and how to provide fair and sustainable water access benefits to the region as a whole. This paper presents a participatory modelling framework designed to support the participatory planning of sustainable integration of desalinated seawater into a regional water supply network in water-scarce regions. The framework is based on a modelling tool that facilitates collaborative understanding of the regional context and optimises and maps candidate water supply networks and the associated trade-offs between economic, environmental and social performance criteria. The framework aims to facilitate dialogue between all interested parties and contributes to a more informed, fair, consented, long-term and sustainable integration of desalinated seawater into regional water supply schemes. An application to the Atacama region in Chile illustrates the capabilities of the framework to communicate options under varying conditions of environmental protection. The case study also illustrates the role of stakeholders in the process of tool refinement as part of early-stage participatory planning.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

410,pub.1168286733,10.1051/0004-6361/202348100,,,The globular cluster VVV CL002 falling down to the hazardous Galactic centre,"Context. The Galactic centre is hazardous for stellar clusters because of the strong tidal force in action there. It is believed that many clusters were destroyed there and contributed stars to the crowded stellar field of the bulge and the nuclear stellar cluster. However, the development of a realistic model to predict the long-term evolution of the complex inner Galaxy has proven difficult, and observations of surviving clusters in the central region would provide crucial insights into destruction processes.   Aims. Among the known Galactic globular clusters, VVV CL002 is the closest to the centre, at 0.4 kpc, but has a very high transverse velocity of 400 km s −1 . The nature of this cluster and its impact on Galactic astronomy need to be addressed with spectroscopic follow up.   Methods. Here we report the first measurements of its radial velocity and chemical abundance based on near-infrared high-resolution spectroscopy.   Results. We find that this cluster has a counter-rotating orbit constrained within 1.0 kpc of the centre, and as close as 0.2 kpc at the perigalacticon, confirming that the cluster is not a passerby from the halo but a genuine survivor enduring the harsh conditions of the tidal forces of the Galactic mill. In addition, its metallicity and α abundance ([ α /Fe] ≃ +0.4 and [Fe/H] = −0.54) are similar to those of some globular clusters in the bulge. Recent studies suggest that stars with such α -enhanced stars were more common at 3–6 kpc from the centre around 10 Gyr ago.   Conclusions. We infer that VVV CL002 was formed outside but is currently falling down to the centre, showcasing a real-time event that must have occurred to many clusters a long time ago.","This paper is based on the WINERED data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescope located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

Furthermore, there are no sediment and soil reference guidelines. This study presents the analysis of newly-collected surface water and sediment data along three E-W transects of distinct regions of Chile in order to evaluate the relationship between As content and the regional geological units, crustal thickness, and climate. Analyzed samples indicate that average As values vary substantially from the south (0.37 µg/L in water and 9 mg/kg in sediments) to the north (2873 µg/L in water and 153 mg/kg in sediments), and there exists a correlation between high arsenic values, low precipitation, increased crustal thickness, and specific volcanic rocks such as Neogene volcanics of the Central Volcanic Zone. Regionally-based limits for As concentrations will therefore be recommended and discussed.","I acknowledge Brandon Schneider for his English improvement and Camila Lagomarsino, Cristóbal Quiroz and Brian Jones for the analysis of water and sediment samples of southern Chile.",,,Arsenic in the Environment: Bridging Science to Practice for Sustainable Development As2021,,,2024-01-09,2024,2024-01-09,,,,109-110,All OA; Hybrid,Chapter,"Tapia, J.","Tapia, J.

358,pub.1172236316,10.36311/2024.978-65-5954-458-5,,,Biblioteca infantil,"The first chapter, authored by Greice Ferreira da Silva and Sueli Bortolin, entitled The child, reading and the children's library, inaugurates the dialogue with its readers by guiding theoretical approaches about the child, the act of reading, the mediation of reading, but also seeking to highlight the repercussions of the mediating actions of children's libraries in the formulation of new reading possibilities in childhood. Within the scope of research, studies and undertakings related to reading mediation actions, the second chapter, entitled Plural mediations in the ambience of BIJML (São Paulo), authored by Ivete Pieruccini and Fernanda de Lima Passamai Perez begins to share with its readers , the knowledge built based on research into the Monteiro Lobato Children's Library in the City of São Paulo, created in connection with the cultural political project of the Municipal Department of Culture, under the leadership of modernist intellectuals, writers and literati, with emphasis on Mario de Andrade, Sérgio Milliet da Costa and Rubens Borba de Moraes. In the third chapter, this collection offers its readers an encounter with the results of a study carried out on the Monteiro Lobato Children's Library in the city of Salvador. In their analyses, the authors Raquel do Rosário Santos and Ana Claudia Medeiros de Sousa started from the assumption that there is an interrelationship between the mediation of information and cultural mediation that favors the process of appropriation of information by social subjects, situating reading as a social instance focused on this process of appropriation, which in turn contributes to the strengthening of identity and the development of social protagonism. The findings of Santos and Sousa's study confirm and articulate those presented in the fourth and final chapter of this work entitled Denise Tavares' protagonism revealed in the archival documentation and in the voices of the reading public of the Monteiro Lobato Children's Library, authored by Joseania Miranda Freitas. In his study, Freitas presents the concepts of childhood defended by Denise Tavares, articulating the revelations obtained in the analysis of rich documentation that is part of BIML's documentary collection, and librarian Denise's personal documents, to the testimonies of readers who were trained to read through BIML's mediating activities.",,,,,,,2024,2024,2024,2024,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,https://ebooks.marilia.unesp.br/index.php/lab_editorial/catalog/download/445/4221/8040,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172236316,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

Es un cierto saber común que el psicoanálisis no se ocupa de los fenómenos sociales, sin embargo, es muy importante verificar que en esa afirmación hay un cierto desconocimiento del verdadero recorrido realizado no sólo por Freud, sino también por Lacan y una gran cantidad de psicoanalistas de nuestro tiempo. Lo que es claro es que no podemos reducir la inquietud política del psicoanálisis en cada época, a la concepción de una posición militante que implique tomar partido de un lado o del otro. El propio Freud en una de la Nuevas Lecciones introductorias al psicoanálisis, en 1933, justamente el año en que Hitler accede al poder, escribe que el “niño formado por el psicoanálisis es suficientemente subversivo como para no tener que ubicarse ni del lado de la opresión ni del lado de la reacción”. Freud escribe: “No es asunto del psicoanalista decidir entre los partidos, como tampoco orientar su acto clínico hacia el sometimiento al régimen social existente. Más bien destaca que nuestro trato con el psicoanálisis es ya suficientemente revolucionario, para que tomáramos partido políticamente, sino para que pudiéramos rechazar el campo de la reacción o el de la opresión”.",,,,,,,2024,2024,2024,2024,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,https://repository.upb.edu.co/bitstream/20.500.11912/11468/1/incidencias%20politicas.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168855956,,

This work introduces a new method based on obtaining the gradient magnetic vortex echo (GMVE) using micromagnetic simulations following a magnetic resonance imaging protocol. The results show that it is possible to characterize the magnetic interaction of arrays of nanodisks, having equal diameter and vortex configuration, as a function of disk separation. This characterization was performed by creating an inhomogeneity in the system through the application of a magnetic field gradient perpendicular to the plane of the nanodisk array. The inhomogeneity allows refocusing the magnetization in a time-controlled way by inverting the sign of the gradient and obtaining the characteristic transverse relaxation time T2∗ from the GMVE that contains the information on the magnetic interaction.","The authors acknowledge financial support from Universidad Privada del Norte, Perú, under Project No. 20231006.",,Journal of Applied Physics,,,,2024-02-23,2024,2024-02-23,2024-02-28,135,8,083903,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Vigo-Cotrina, H.; Urcia-Romero, S.; Guimarães, A.

There are many products used in this photo-induced solidification process, and one of them is a mixture of organic compounds forming a resin, which is cured using ultraviolet light to achieve the desired final hardness. In addition, the combination of this resin with innovative materials has led to the creation of interesting elements with a wide variety of applications. For this reason, this work describes the implementation of lanthanide-based luminescent nanoparticles Y2WO6 doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ and admixed in a resin, for deposition on a metallic gear surface via painting and UV curing. The as-prepared luminescent gears start to generate heat due to the occurrence of mechanical friction when they start to work. Analyzing the ratio between the thermalized Er3+ emissions at 525 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 550 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) we could remotely detect small temperature variations that gears undergo through friction. This technique is especially useful in monitoring temperature in elements where measurements with thermographic cameras or with direct contact is inaccurate or is not possible. This work can open new horizons in monitoring of heat flow in various scientific and industrial processes, utilizing the benefits of non-invasive temperature detection via luminescence thermometry technique.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Aims Considering the evidence, we propose two hypotheses to be tested in this study: Of four dark tetrad traits, Machiavellianism will be the most strongly related to punitiveness (deterrence, incapacitation, desertion and moral balance); high scores in conservatism/right‐wing ideology will be positively related to deterrence, incapacitation, desert and moral balance attitudes. People with a liberal/left‐wing ideology will score higher in restorative justice and rehabilitation.   Materials and Methods The study sample was composed of 1552 participants from Spain and Latin America (Mexico, Colombia and Peru). Participants responded to an adaptation of penal attitudes scale, the Short Dark‐Tetrad Questionnaire and a political ideology scale.   Results The results indicated that among demographic characteristics, ideology was the best predictor of penal justice attitudes, whereas Machiavellianism surpassed other dark traits as a predictor.   Discussion No previous research examined how De Keiser et al. scale of attitudes towards criminal justice relates to dark personality and ideology. This research shows that dark personality predicts punitiveness and how Machiavellianism plays a relevant role. Future research could also combine Big‐Five ‘bright personality’ variables and since Dark Personality variables.   Conclusion Of the four dark personality traits, Machiavellianism is the strongest predictor of all punitiveness penal attitudes (deterrence, incapacitation, desertion and moral balance). Conservative/right‐wing ideology is related to punitive attitudes; however, rehabilitation and restorative justice were unrelated to ideology.","CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT None of the signers of this manuscript has a conflict of interest, or competing interests, either financial (direct or indirect) or of any other type.",Funding for open access charge: Universidade da Coruña/CISUG.,Legal and Criminological Psychology,,,,2024-08-08,2024,2024-08-08,,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Clemente, Miguel; Espinosa, Pablo; Cerezo, Ana; Aguilar‐Valera, J.

However, sustainable productivity by fish farmers is constrained by parasitic infections. Thus, an investigation was conducted on the prevalence of helminth parasites in some commercially important fish species of River Anambra, Nigeria. A total of 521 fishes belonging to 6 families (Claroteidae, Synodontidae, Mormyridae, Osteoglossidae, Bagridae, and Clariidae) and 20 species caught with hooks, nets, and local traps were examined using standard parasitological techniques. The overall prevalence was 23.80%. Fish samples belonging to 6 families had the following prevalence of infection: Bagridae (0.00%), Clariidae (2.11 %), Claroteidae (1.53%), Mormyridae (0.0%), Osteoglossidae (14.97%) and Synodontidae (5.18%). Helminth parasites recovered were: Weyonia species (4.65%), Weyonia youdeowii (15.97%), Weyonia synodontis (3.33%), Sandonella sandoni (37.41%), Polyonchobothrium clarias (17.98 %),  Plerocercoid larva (13.33%) and unidentified cestode (35.47%) (Cestoda); Emoleptalea species (4.65%) (Trematoda); Procamallanus laeviconchus (2.72%), Dujardinascaris species (1.36%), Spirocamallanus species (3.99%) (Nematoda); Neoechinorhynchus species (24.61%), Tenuisentis niloticus (34.62%) and unidentified acanthocephalan (6.25%) (Acanthocephala). Weyonia species, Weyonia youdeoweii, and W. synodontis were recovered from synodontids only. Acanthocephalan, cestodes, nematodes and trematodes were found in decreasing order of abundance.

The field equations are reformulated as a system of geodesic equations for the Eisenhart metric. In the case of an exponential potential, the Eisenhart metric is shown to be conformally flat. By applying basic geometric principles, a new set of dynamical variables is identified, allowing for the linearization of the field equations and the derivation of classical cosmological solutions. However, the quantization of the Eisenhart system reveals a distinct set of solutions for the wavefunction, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking at the quantum level.","Declaration of competing interest I declare no conflic of interest.

In this paper, an experience of applying both DS techniques and a ML algorithm, using historical data from the flotation process is described. These data were collected using a prototype of flotation equipment developed at the Universidad Catolica del Norte, in Antofagasta, Chile. To achieve the result an Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process was made. Also, for both, improving the understanding of domain dynamics and selecting the most relevant predictive variables in the flotation process, a Random Forest (FR) model was developed. The combination of these previous results made it possible to generate recommendations on the management of predictor variables to improve copper recovery in the context of the flotation equipment prototype. In this document, the methodological details are presented, and the process used to obtain the aforementioned results is described. As progress was made through 2 iterations, the quality of the results obtained with the predictive model, generated by RF, was improving. At the end of the process, an accuracy of 94,44% was achieved, with an accuracy in each of the classes greater than 90%.

This study is part of the growing interest in community mental health literacy.   Design/methodology/approach A sample of 192 Black African participants from municipalities (Ditsobotla and Mahikeng) between 18 and 65 years participated in this study. Participants viewed fictional (male and female) sufferers of schizophrenia vignettes and responded to the same questions regarding each vignette. They completed a questionnaire examining the capacity to recognise schizophrenia as well as the capacity to source appropriate help.   Findings For both vignettes, a substantial majority of participants indicated that older people believe that when a male is diagnosed with schizophrenia, the cause is traditional (spiritual). In contrast, more participants with lower education believed that medical reasons cause a female person’s diagnosis of schizophrenia.   Research limitations/implications Overall, the study highlights the complexity of beliefs about the causes of schizophrenia. It underscores the importance of considering cultural and educational factors in mental health research, practice and policy development.   Practical implications By uncovering the differences in perceptions between older individuals and those with lower education levels, the study sheds light on previously unexplored aspects of mental health literacy and cultural understanding of schizophrenia.   Social implications While previous research has examined cultural beliefs about mental illness, this study specifically focuses on how age and education intersect with these beliefs, particularly regarding gender differences in diagnosis.   Originality/value This unique approach contributes to the broader literature on mental health disparities. It has implications for tailored interventions and public health strategies aimed at addressing stigma and improving mental health outcomes in diverse populations.","Funding: The author(s) received no financial support for this article&#x27;s research, authorship and/or publication.

In the last decade, many new star clusters have been discovered in heavily obscured regions of the Milky Way bulge and disk.   Aims. Our primary long-term objective is to seek out additional star clusters in the poorly studied regions of the Milky Way, where detections pose significant challenges. The aim of this pursuit is to finalize the Milky Way’s globular and open cluster system census and to gain a comprehensive understanding of both the formation and evolution of these systems and our Galaxy as a whole.   Methods. We report the discovery of a new star cluster, named Garro 03. We investigated this new target using a combination of near-infrared and optical databases. We employed the VISTA Variables in the Via Láctea Survey and Two Micron All Sky Survey data in the near-infrared, and the Gaia Data Release 3 and the DECam Plane Survey datasets in the optical passband. We constructed density maps and vector proper motion diagrams in order to highlight our target. We performed a photometrical analysis in order to derive its main physical parameters.   Results. Garro 03 is located at equatorial coordinates RA = 14:01:29.3 and Dec = −65:30:57.0. From our photometric analysis we find that this cluster is not heavily affected by extinction with A  Ks  = 0.25 ± 0.04 mag and A  G  = 1.54 ± 0.02 mag. It is located at heliocentric distance of 14.1 ± 0.5 kpc, which places Garro 03 at 10.6 kpc from the Galactic centre and Z = −0.89 kpc below the Galactic plane. We also calculated the mean cluster proper motion of (μ α * ,μ  δ  )=(−4.57 ± 0.29, −1.36 ± 0.27) mas yr −1 . We derived an age of 3 Gyr and metallicity [Fe/H] = −0.5 ± 0.2 by the isochrone-fitting method, employing the PARSEC models. The total luminosity was derived in the K  s  and V bands, finding M  Ks  = −6.32 ± 1.10 mag and M  V  = −4.06 mag. Finally, the core and tidal radii were measured constructing the Garro 03 radial density profile and fitting the King model. We obtained r c = 3.07 ± 0.98 pc and r t = 19.36 ± 15.96 pc, respectively.   Conclusions. We photometrically confirm the cluster nature for Garro 03, located in the Galactic disk. It is a distant, low-luminosity, metal-rich star cluster of intermediate age. We also searched for possible signatures (streams or bridges) between Garro 03 and Garro 01, but we exclude a companionship with the present analysis. We need spectroscopic data to classify it as an old open cluster or a young globular cluster, and to understand its origin.","We gratefully acknowledge the use of data from the ESO Public Survey program IDs 179.B-2002 and 198.B-2004 taken with the VISTA telescope and data products from the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit.

This picture provides a conceptual model for a quantum nonequilibrium system, depicted as an ensemble of subsystems at different temperatures, randomly distributed with respect to a given mean value. We then assume the temperature displays stochastic fluctuations   T =   T   0   + δ T   with respect to its ensemble average value   T 0   , with zero mean    δ T  ¯  = 0  and standard deviation    δ  T 2   ¯  = Δ  . By means of the replica method, we obtain the average grand canonical potential, leading to the equation of state and the corresponding excess pressure caused by these fluctuations with respect to the equilibrium system at a uniform temperature. Our findings reveal an increase in pressure as the system’s ensemble average temperature   T 0   rises, consistently exceeding the pressure observed in an equilibrium state. We applied our general formalism to three paradigmatic physical systems; the relativistic Fermi gas, the ideal gas of photons, and a gas of non-Abelian gauge fields (gluons) in the noninteracting limit. Finally, we explore the implications for the deconfinement transition in the context of the simple bag model, where we show that the critical temperature decreases.

Specifically, we consider a homogeneous and isotropic universe in f Q , B , where Q is the non-metricity scalar, and B is the boundary term that relates the non-metricity and Ricci scalars. For the connection in the coincidence gauge, we find that the field equations are of fourth-order, and the fluid components introduced by the boundary are attributed to a scalar field. In the coincidence gauge, the cosmological field equations are equivalent to those of teleparallelism with a boundary term. Nevertheless, for the connection defined in the non-coincidence gauge, the geometrodynamical fluid consists of three scalar fields. We focus on the special case of f Q , B = Q + F B theory, and we determine a new analytic cosmological solution that can explain the late-time acceleration of the universe and provide a geometric mechanism for the unification of dark energy with dark matter.","Declaration of competing interest I declare no conflict of interest.

Eight hundred (800) Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were collected from various farms in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate. The fish were examined for encysted metacercariae (EMC) in different organs. Tissue specimens were collected and underwent histopathological analysis, expression of stress-related genes, and genetic characterization by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). P. vivax metacercariae were oval to round in shape and were collected from various organs including the muscle, skin, eyes, intestine, liver, kidney, and gills of infected O. niloticus. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS2 region revealed a 507-bp fragment, confirming parasite identity and matching within the same clade as other P. vivax isolates. Infected fish displayed abdominal hydropsy, skin darkening, and emaciation. P. vivax encysted metacercariae were detected during the study period in 620/800 fish, with an overall prevalence of 77.5%. The seasonal prevalence was 95% in summer, 85% in spring, 55% in autumn, and 75% in winter. The intensity of infection was 1–40 cysts per microscopic field. Histopathological examination of muscles revealed parasitic cysts embedded within muscle fibers, causing severe degeneration and necrosis. Upregulation of cytochrome P450 (cpy1a1), heat shock protein 70 (hsp-70), and tumor suppressor p53 (p53) was recorded in both liver and muscle samples of infected tilapia compared to controls. This indicates activation of detoxification, cellular stress, and apoptotic pathways in response to P. vivax infection. There is limited data available on the pathogenicity of P. vivax and its impacts on fish health; thus, this study provides key insights into the morphology, pathogenicity, and histopathological impacts of P. vivax in Nile tilapia.",,"Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).",Aquaculture International,,,,2024-02-29,2024,2024-02-29,2024-08,32,4,5107-5124,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Abdelkhalek, Shimaa; Attia, Marwa M.; Ibrahim, Marwa A.; Korany, Reda M.

One for the processing of copper sulfides and another for the processing of the copper oxides. There are similarities between the two, particularly in the preparation stage of the run of mine (ROM) such as the crushing. However, significant differences exist in how to concentrate the elements of interest. Flotation is the most used concentration process to separate copper sulfide minerals from other minerals using air bubbles. For oxides, after the dissolution of copper, the solvent extraction (SX) process is the preferred path using two immiscible liquids to separate the copper. A line of investigation for solvent extraction is the use of a bubble coated with solvent to extract the metal of interest from the aqueous solution, some devices have been built and tested for this purpose using different principles to generate a coated bubble swarm. However, those equipments have been tested on laboratory and have not been scaled up to an industry level. The Hollow Drop (HD) concept was born from the idea of building a device to generate coated bubbles in a continuous swarm that could be scalable to an industry level. In this paper two columns were built and operated: a proof-of-concept column and a scale-up attempt for the extraction of Cu(II) fom an aqueous solution of 2.5 g L−1 using ACORGA® M5640 (25% v/v) in the Kerosene. The results show that we could generate a bubble swarm and conduct the solvent extraction process at a 97% recovery using our proposed coated bubble generator. However, in our scaled prototype test only a 70% recovery was achieved, which shows that our column is working but the scaling-up needs more investigation regarding the dimensions and flows of the process.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Diego Alonso Poblete Moya reports administrative support, article publishing charges, equipment, drugs, or supplies, statistical analysis, travel, and writing assistance were provided by The University of Oulu.

Until now, it remains open whether organic molecules found in topsoils have their origin from in-situ biotic processes in the hyper-arid core, or whether and to which degree they stem from outside the desert and its border regions. In order to trace atmospheric organic matter input, we analyzed the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which almost exclusively derive from combustion processes and compared this to total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations. We sampled topsoil (0–15 cm depth) in one coastal (Paposo) and one inland aridity transect (Aroma) and compared them to atmospheric dust collected over two months in the hyper-arid core of the desert (Yungay). We found TOC and PAHs in all desert soil and dust samples. The sum of 18 analyzed PAHs ranged from 0.001 to 0.31 ng g−1 in the Paposo transect and from 0.14 to 0.78 ng g−1 in the Aroma transect, with moderate correlation (R2 = 0.68, p < 0.05) between TOC and PAHs. Measured PAH concentration in the dust was up to 5000 times higher and varied between 0.45 and 5.31 ng g−1. PAHs contributed with up to 0.25% to the TOC in dust and with 0.1% to the TOC in soils. This indicates that not all organic matter found in deserts is a trace for life defying extreme conditions, as it can also stem from sources outside or at the borders of the desert. We hence recommend verifying the origin of organic matter found in regions at the dry limit and highlight the overall presence of atmospheric pollutants on earth.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

238,pub.1170111330,10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2024.108063,,,The PiGas: A low-cost approach to volcanic gas sampling,"Instruments which are designed to measure multiple gases are widely used across several industries with a common focus on environmental gas sampling. Reliable instrumentation and gas sensors are therefore vital for the monitoring of air quality in cities and in more challenging scenarios, for example volcanic gas release. However, such instrumentation is commonly expensive and can be difficult to deploy, meaning that large instrument networks - needed to assess spatial air quality differences - is inhibitive. A bespoke do-it-yourself approach can therefore be beneficial. Here, we detail a new instrument, the PiGas, which is modelled on the successful “Multi-GAS” technique (Shinohara, 2005; Aiuppa et al. 2005) for the measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), and water vapour (H2O). Indeed, CO2 is a common gas of interest yet its measurement at high accuracy can be expensive. We demonstrate a cost reduction to <£500 by adapting parts used from non-air sampling specific industries and through use of a lower-cost and lower-power requirement CO2 sensor (the CozIR A-H). We demonstrate the versatility of the PiGas for monitoring indoor and outdoor air quality as a diffuse and pumped sensor. We also test the instrument in two extreme volcanic environments at the high altitude Alitar and Volcán Lastarria (Chile). Overall, the instrumentation shows potential for more widespread co-ordinated use to improve spatial sampling distributions in low concentration scenarios as a supplement to higher accuracy and higher precision instruments in volcanic environments.","Acknowledgements Thomas Wilkes acknowledges the support of a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship (ECF-2020-107).

The abundances of the α -elements are key for understanding the early chemical enrichment of the Galactic bulge. The elements of interest present lines in different wavelength regions, and some of them show lines only in part of the spectra. In the present work, the CNO trio, the a-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, and odd-Z Na and Al are examined as measured from optical and H-band lines.   Aims. The aim of this work is to carry out a detailed comparison of stellar parameters and abundances derived in the optical and near-infrared ( H -band). We also inspect the best available lines for a list of bulge stars previously analyzed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) team in the H-band and by our group in the optical. This work is mainly of interest to spectroscopists.   Methods. In the present work, we compared the stellar parameters and abundance results derived from APOGEE H -band spectra with optical analyses based on Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT/UVES) data for eight bulge stars.   Results. We point out the most suitable wavelength region for each of the studied elements, and highlight difficulties in the derivation of stellar parameters both in the optical and H -band. The near-infrared will allow observations of a large number of stars in the near future given new instruments soon to be available. The identification of spectral lines in this spectral region and the investigation of their reliability are ongoing efforts worldwide. New instruments will also allow simultaneous observation of H -band and optical.","P.S. acknowledges Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) post-doctoral fellowships 2020/13239-5 and 2022/14382-1.

However, thiswidespread use has given rise to the proliferation of fake news—publications that lack authenticity or areentirely false. In the state of the art, various approaches have been taken to address fake news, includinguser-centric, propagation-centric, interaction-centric, and textuality-centric perspectives. This articlecontributes to the latter by conducting empirical work that seeks to identify fake news and characterize theemotions associated to these fake news in a dataset comprising social media posts. Utilizing the datasetsGossipCop, PolitiFact, and CoronaFake, the objective is twofold: (1) train models for the identification offake news and (2) identify and characterize the emotions associated with fake news. This encompasseseverything from collecting tweets to characterizing emotions. The undertaken work concludes that, onaverage, the algorithms employed achieve an accuracy of 90.2% in identifying fake news.

In this study, three emblematic expressions about money uttered by three politicians were scrutinized, on the one hand, from six perspectives of discourse analysis: formalist, enunciative, materialist, ideological, social and rhetorical; and, on the other hand, from the design of axial coding, under five pre-categories: relations, conditioning, contextual links, mediations and prospective, via interviews with experts. The discourse analysis showed that the phrases ""For God's sake, for the money"", "" Money in abundance"" and ""The money arrives by itself"", with money at the center of their messages, not only delineated the actions of their authors, but also reflected the general Peruvian political class in a framework in which the citizenship judges political-money relations but ends up accepting and normalizing them. From the interviews to the experts, more than their analysis of each political phrase has delineated specific cases, the three expressions survive in the Peruvian collective memory, subjugating a complex and obscure relationship between politics and money. It is necessary for both politics and other social actors to promote strategies that support the improvement of the aforementioned relationship for the sake of democratic governance.",,,Discurso y Sociedad,,,,2024-07-09,2024,2024-07-09,,18,2,177-207,All OA; Green,Article,"Alarcón-Llontop, Luis-Rolando; Correa, Jorge Eder Clavijo; Moreno, Carlos Martín Gonzales","Alarcón-Llontop, Luis-Rolando (Universidad Privada del Norte); Correa, Jorge Eder Clavijo (Universidad Privada del Norte); Moreno, Carlos Martín Gonzales (Universidad Privada del Norte)",,"Alarcón-Llontop, Luis-Rolando (Private University of the North); Correa, Jorge Eder Clavijo (Private University of the North); Moreno, Carlos Martín Gonzales (Private University of the North)",0,0,,,https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/144868/1/Discurso%26Sociedad_2024_18_2_01.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173749143,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,

In 2014, Ecuador launched a clean-cooking program known as the Programa de Cocción Eficiente (PCE) aimed at replacing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-fired cookstoves and LPG-fired boilers with electric devices. Using an original dataset of monthly information (2015-2021) at the parish level, we study several important determinants of participation in this program that have not yet been addressed. We first model spatial spillovers and then investigate the impact of regional power quality and the effect of other subsidized programs related to electricity consumption. Our results show spillover effects for PCE participation with regard to cooking but not for the overall PCE participation rate. Higher participation is associated to better supply quality and with the use of other power subsidies. Policy recommendations include the need to perform detailed spatial analyses of the determinants of participation in these programs, instead of using surveys, and designing programs using a placed-based approach, in addition to evaluating cross-sectional effects between subsidies in advance in order to avoid unforeseen trade-offs and considering the regulatory framework for utilities to provide effective incentives to improve supply quality.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Obaco, Moises; Davi-Arderius, Daniel; Pontarollo, Nicola","Obaco, Moises (Universidad Católica Del Norte - Department of Economics); Davi-Arderius, Daniel (Copenhagen Business School - Copenhagen School of Energy Infrastructure (CSEI); University of Barcelona - Institut d'Economia de Barcelona (IEB)); Pontarollo, Nicola (University of Brescia - Department of Economics and Management)",,"Obaco, Moises (Catholic University of the North); Davi-Arderius, Daniel (University of Barcelona); Pontarollo, Nicola (University of Brescia - Department of Economics and Management)",0,0,,,https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/205142/1/IEB23-07_Obaco%2bDavi%2bPontarollo.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169309105,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society,13 Climate Action

A detailed analysis is conducted for three connections defined in the coincident and non-coincident gauges. Our findings reveal the existence of a unique one-to-one correspondence for equilibrium points in the two frames. Furthermore, we demonstrate that solutions describing accelerated universes remain invariant under the transformation that relates these conformally equivalent theories.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Alex Giacomini reports financial support was provided by National Fund For Scientific Technological and Technological Innovation Development.

In addition, antiparasitic protection of the TAE was evaluated at d 21 and d 28 through intestinal scoring and oocyst counts, as well as the blood antioxidant activity of the PE at d 45. Wood shavings as bedding material came from a commercial farm with a coccidia load sufficient to create a subclinical coccidiosis situation with minor macroscopic lesions, and a nutritional challenge was imposed using poor raw materials to cause intestinal dysbiosis. There were 9 dietary treatments (8 replicates/treatment and 15 broiler chickens/pen), a positive control (PC) supplemented with commercial coccidiostat (Na monensin), 4 increasing concentrations of TAE (30, 60, 90, and 120 ppm), and 4 increasing concentrations of PE (10, 20, 30, and 40 ppm). For the overall experiment the PC had greater average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (P < 0.001) than the mean of TAE treatments. Besides, the ADG, body weight, and ADFI increased linearly throughout the whole experiment as the TAE level of the feed increased. With respect to the anticoccidial activity, the 120 ppm TAE treatment showed greater concentration of E. acervuline DNA copies at 21 d than the 30 ppm TAE treatment (P < 0.05), the rest of the treatments being intermediate. Concerning the PE treatments, for the overall experiment, ADG was the greatest in the PC treatment (P < 0.001), and the ADFI was similar in the PC treatment to the mean of PE treatments. There was no effect of the PE on antioxidant activity. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, the inclusion of TAE does not reach the productive performance indicators achieved by a commercial coccidiostat in our intestinal challenge situations. Also, the inclusion of PE has a positive effect on productive performance on the overall period.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

211,pub.1170704058,10.1093/jopedu/qhae029,,,Decolonization in South African universities: storytelling as subversion and reclamation,"Abstract Underscoring recurrent calls for the decolonization of university curricula in South Africa are underexplored presumptions that by only disrupting theoretical content, universities might release themselves from a colonialist grasp, that continues to dominate and distort higher education discourse. While it might be the case that certain theories hold enormous authoritative, ‘truthful’ sway, as propagated through Western interpretations and norms, there are inherent problems in exclusively approaching the decolonization project as a content-based hurdle, removed from the subjectivities of students’ social, lived, and learning realities. The argument advanced in this article is that until the epistemic harm of colonialism and apartheid are afforded careful recognition and attention—as in focusing on the lived experiences, realities, and stories of individuals—the hard work of delegitimizing coloniality, and its implicit structures of hegemonies and binaries cannot unfold. In addressing these harms, I commence by describing some of the contexts of epistemic harm, promulgated through colonialism and apartheid. This is followed by a consideration of decolonization, both as theory and practice-within-context. Here, I also foreground the #Rhodesmustfall campaign, as a particular moment of painful clarity about why decolonization, as well as transformation, has faltered in higher education in South Africa. In the second half, I focus on the necessity of prioritizing storytelling as a deep manifestation of decolonization. Stories, I maintain, provide access into unknown lives, and can subvert the invisible, normative framings, which dictate how we live in this world. As a manifestation of decolonization, students’ stories hold profound implications for the recognition and affirmation of pluralist identities, histories, knowledge, values, and world-views.",,,Journal of Philosophy of Education,,,,2024-04-15,2024,2024-04-15,2024-07-29,58,2-3,189-208,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Davids, Nuraan","Davids, Nuraan (Department of Education Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, c/o Crozier & Ryneveld Streets, Stellenbosch University, 7600 Cape Town, South Africa)","Davids, Nuraan (Stellenbosch University)","Davids, Nuraan (Stellenbosch University)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/jope/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jopedu/qhae029/57237435/qhae029.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170704058,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

Identifying ways to redress the enduring legacy of colonialism are therefore of critical importance. Accordingly, this paper examines data from 7017 Māori, as well as 37,233 Pākehā, to examine the impact of regional-level Pākehā warmth towards Māori on Māori support for progressive collective action. Results reveal that Pākehā warmth towards Māori varies markedly across 257 regional wards (regional units created for New Zealand electoral purposes). Moreover, multilevel modelling demonstrates that Pākehā warmth towards Māori at the region-level correlates positively with Māori identity and political efficacy at the individual level which, in turn, both correlate positively with collective action support. Collectively, these results demonstrate the impact of the broader social climate on social change, while identifying a previously-unknown facilitator of collective action support (namely, a broader context of warmth towards structurally disadvantaged groups).",,,International Journal of Intercultural Relations,,,,2024-01,2024,,2024-01,98,,101918,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Houkamau, Carla; Bahamondes, Joaquín; Osborne, Danny; Sibley, Chris","Houkamau, Carla (The University of Auckland Business School, The University of Auckland, New Zealand); Bahamondes, Joaquín (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Osborne, Danny (Department of Psychology, The University of Auckland, New Zealand); Sibley, Chris (Department of Psychology, The University of Auckland, New Zealand)","Houkamau, Carla (University of Auckland)","Houkamau, Carla (University of Auckland); Bahamondes, Joaquín (Catholic University of the North); Osborne, Danny (University of Auckland); Sibley, Chris (University of Auckland)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2023.101918,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166321448,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

We address the expected variability of explosive eruptions at Tungurahua volcano by adopting a scenario-based strategy, where we consider three cases: small magnitude violent Strombolian to Vulcanian eruption (VEI 2), intermediate magnitude sub-Plinian eruption (VEI 3), and large magnitude sub-Plinian to Plinian eruption (VEI 4–5). PDCs are modeled using the branching energy cone model and the branching box model, considering reproducible calibration procedures based on the geological record of Tungurahua volcano. The use of different calibration procedures and reference PDC deposits allows us to define uncertainty ranges for the inundation probability of each scenario. Numerical results indicate that PDCs at Tungurahua volcano propagate preferentially toward W and NW, where a series of catchment ravines can be recognized. Two additional valleys of channelization are observed in the N and NE flanks of the volcano, which may affect the city of Baños. The mean inundation probability calculated for Baños is small (6 ± 3%) for PDCs similar to those emplaced during the VEI 2 eruptions of July 2006, February 2008, May 2010, July 2013, February 2014 and February 2016, and on the order of 13 ± 4% for a PDC similar to that produced during the sub-Plinian phase of the August 2006 eruption (VEI 3). The highest energy scenario (VEI 4–5), for which we present and implement a novel calibration procedure based on a few control points, produces inundation areas that nearly always include inhabited centers such as Baños, Puela and Cotaló, among others. This calibration method is well suited for eruptive scenarios that lack detailed field information, and could be replicated for poorly-known active volcanoes around the world.",,,Research Square,,,,2024-04-01,2024,2024-04-01,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Aravena, Alvaro; Tadini, Alessandro; Bevilacqua, Andrea; Samaniego, Pablo; Bernard, Benjamin; Hidalgo, Silvana; Pennec, Jean-Luc Le; Martínez, Pablo; García, Johnny; Roche, Olivier","Aravena, Alvaro (Universidad Católica del Maule: Universidad Catolica del Maule); Tadini, Alessandro (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia); Bevilacqua, Andrea (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia); Samaniego, Pablo (Université Clermont Auvergne: Universite Clermont Auvergne); Bernard, Benjamin (Escuela Politécnica Nacional: Escuela Politecnica Nacional); Hidalgo, Silvana (Escuela Politecnica Nacional); Pennec, Jean-Luc Le (Bretagne Occidentale University: Universite de Bretagne Occidentale); Martínez, Pablo (Universidad Católica del Norte: Universidad Catolica del Norte); García, Johnny (Escuela Politecnica Nacional); Roche, Olivier (Université Clermont Auvergne: Universite Clermont Auvergne)",,"Aravena, Alvaro (Catholic University of the Maule); Tadini, Alessandro (National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology); Bevilacqua, Andrea (National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology); Samaniego, Pablo (University of Clermont Auvergne); Bernard, Benjamin (Escuela Politécnica Nacional: Escuela Politecnica Nacional); Hidalgo, Silvana (National Polytechnic School); Pennec, Jean-Luc Le (University of Western Brittany); Martínez, Pablo (Catholic University of the North); García, Johnny (National Polytechnic School); Roche, Olivier (University of Clermont Auvergne)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4076583/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170334839,37 Earth Sciences; 3703 Geochemistry; 3705 Geology; 3706 Geophysics,
203,pub.1168998322,10.1051/0004-6361/202347797,,,Where do they come from?,"Globular clusters (GCs), as old as our Galaxy, constantly lose their members to the field as they cross through the Milky Way (MW). These escaped GC stars (or escapees) are thought to contribute significantly to the MW halo. If a star left the host GC a long time ago, chemical finger prints (e.g., N enrichment) may reveal its origin. In this work we aim to establish dynamical connections between N-rich field stars recently identified by LAMOST and the existing MW GCs. By constructing the full action distribution in combination with metallicity, we found 29 potential GC progenitors for 15 N-rich field stars. In particular, some of them may be related to MW accretion events. On the other hand, if a star has recently left its host GC via tidal evaporation, it still maintains the kinematic properties of the cluster. Here we identify extra-tidal candidates based on their spatial locations, proper motions (PMs), and their positions on color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We successfully identified more than 1600 extra-tidal candidates in the vicinity of six Gaia-Enceladus (GE)-related GCs: NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 6205, NGC 6341, NGC 6779, NGC 7089. The density map of the extra-tidal candidates is confirmed to be an efficient way to find extra-tidal structures. The two possible density peaks at opposite sides of the inner boundary is a good indicator for a long stellar stream. Among 95 extra-tidal candidates with spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicity, 54 of them are confirmed to be GC escaped stars as they share similar properties to host GCs. These extra-tidal candidates are ideal targets for follow-up spectroscopic observation as it greatly improves the scientific outcome.

202,pub.1168286689,10.1051/0004-6361/202347359,,,The nature of medium-period variables on the extreme horizontal branch,"A fraction of the extreme horizontal branch stars of globular clusters exhibit a periodic light variability that has been attributed to rotational modulation caused by surface spots. These spots are believed to be connected to inhomogeneous surface distribution of elements. However, the presence of such spots has not been tested against spectroscopic data. We analyzed the phase-resolved ESO X-shooter spectroscopy of three extreme horizontal branch stars that are members of the globular cluster ω Cen and also display periodic light variations. The aim of our study is to understand the nature of the light variability of these stars and to test whether the spots can reproduce the observed variability. Our spectroscopic analysis of these stars did not detect any phase-locked abundance variations that are able to reproduce the light variability. Instead, we revealed the phase variability of effective temperature and surface gravity. In particular, the stars show the highest temperature around the light maximum. This points to pulsations as a possible cause of the observed spectroscopic and photometric variations. However, such an interpretation is in a strong conflict with Ritter’s law, which relates the pulsational period to the mean stellar density. The location of the ω Cen variable extreme horizontal branch stars in HR diagram corresponds to an extension of PG 1716 stars toward lower temperatures or blue, low-gravity, large-amplitude pulsators toward lower luminosities, albeit with much longer periods. Other models of light variability, namely, related to temperature spots, should also be tested further. The estimated masses of these stars in the range of 0.2–0.3 M ⊙ are too low for helium-burning objects.","We thank Dr. Yazan Momany for valuable comments on the paper and Dr. Petr Kurfürst for the discussion.

193,pub.1174035868,10.1103/physrevd.110.024055,,,Revisiting string-inspired running-vacuum models under the lens of light primordial black holes,"Light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses MPBH<109 g can interestingly dominate the Universe’s energy budget and give rise to early matter-dominated (eMD) eras before big bang nucleosyntesis (BBN). During this eMD era, one is met with an abundant production of induced gravitational waves (GWs) serving as a portal to constrain the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we study this type of induced GWs within the context of string-inspired running-vaccuum models (StRVMs), which, when expanded around de Sitter backgrounds, include logarithmic corrections of the space-time curvature. In particular, we discuss in detail the effects of StRVMs on the source as well as on the propagation of these PBH-induced GWs. Remarkably, under the assumption that the logarithmic terms represent quantum gravity corrections in the PBH era, we show that GW overproduction can be avoided if one assumes a coefficient of these logarithmic corrections that is much larger than the square of the reduced Planck mass. The latter cannot characterize quantum gravity corrections, though, prompting the need for revision of the quantization of StRVMs in different than de Sitter backgrounds, such as those characterizing PBH-driven eMD eras. This nontrivial result suggests the importance of light PBHs as probes of new physics.","T. P. acknowledges the support of the INFN Sezione di Napoli initiativa specifica QGSKY. S. B., T. P., E. N.

191,pub.1174591068,10.1051/0004-6361/202449943,,,SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): A glimpse into Orion,"Context. The Orion Molecular Cloud complex, one of the nearest (D = 406 pc) and most extensively studied massive star-forming regions, is ideal for constraining the physics of stellar feedback, but its ~12 deg diameter on the sky requires a dedicated approach to mapping ionized gas structures within and around the nebula.   Aims. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) is a new optical integral field unit (IFU) that will map the ionized gas within the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, covering 4300 deg 2 of the sky with the new LVM Instrument (LMV-I).   Methods. We showcase optical emission line maps from LVM covering 12 deg 2 inside of the Orion belt region, with 195 000 individual spectra combined to produce images at 0.07 pc (35.3″) resolution. This is the largest IFU map made (to date) of the Milky Way, and contains well-known nebulae (the Horsehead Nebula, Flame Nebula, IC 434, and IC 432), as well as ionized interfaces with the neighboring dense Orion B molecular cloud.   Results. We resolve the ionization structure of each nebula, and map the increase in both the [S II ]/Hα and [N II ]/H α line ratios at the outskirts of nebulae and along the ionization front with Orion B. [O III ] line emission is only spatially resolved within the center of the Flame Nebula and IC 434, and our ~0.1 pc scale line ratio diagrams show how variations in these diagnostics are lost as we move from the resolved to the integrated view of each nebula. We detect ionized gas emission associated with the dusty bow wave driven ahead of the star σ Orionis, where the stellar wind interacts with the ambient interstellar medium. The Horsehead Nebula is seen as a dark occlusion of the bright surrounding photo-disassociation region. This small glimpse into Orion only hints at the rich science that will be enabled by the LVM.","We thank the referee for their careful reading of this work and thoughtful suggestions.

Cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), and molybdenum (Mo) are frequently selected as the primary metallic elements in lithium-ion batteries. The principal aim of this study was to develop a computational algorithm that integrates geostatistical methods and machine learning techniques to assess the resources of critical battery elements within a copper porphyry deposit. By employing a hierarchical/stepwise cosimulation methodology, the algorithm detailed in this research paper successfully represents both soft and hard boundaries in the simulation results. The methodology is evaluated using several global and local statistical studies. The findings indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional approach in estimating these five elements, specifically when utilizing a stepwise estimation strategy known as cascade modeling. The proposed algorithm is also validated against true values by using a jackknife method, and it is shown that the method is precise and unbiased in the prediction of critical battery elements.",The first and second authors are grateful to Nazarbayev University for funding this work via the Collaborative Research Program 2023-2025 under contract No. OPCRP2023013.

A large number of globular clusters in the Milky Way have been studied in recent years, especially in hidden regions such as those of the Galactic bulge.   Aims. The main goal of this work is to understand what we can learn if we include these new objects into the Milky Way globular cluster (GC) system that we know today. We compiled a catalog of 37 recently discovered globular clusters. Most of them are located in the Galactic bulge, but we also included some of the GCs for comparison.   Methods. We used a range of distributions for investigating the Galactic GC system based on the metallicity, luminosity function, and age. We considered three samples. We first treated the new GC sample separately from the known and well characterized GCs. Consequently, we merged these two samples, thereby upgrading the Milky Way GC system. Furthermore, we performed a comparison between our clusters sample and the field star population.   Results. We found a double-peaked distribution for the luminosity function, which shows an elongated faint end tail. Considering the “merged” sample, the luminosity function peaks at M  V  up = −7.00 ± 1.3 mag and at M  V  up = −4.1 ± 0.48 mag. The metallicity distributions also display a bimodality trend. In this case, we compare our new sample compilation with previously published ones, finding that the distributions are in good general agreement. We also constructed the metallicity distribution for the field star sample and, by comparing it with that of the GCs, we learned that a high percentage of field stars show [Fe/H] > 0; whereas we did not detect any GCs in the same metallicity range. To understand this inconsistency, we constructed the age–metallicity diagram for both samples, noting that the old and metal-poor population (age ≥ 8 Gyr and [Fe/H] ≤ −1.0) is represented by Gcs, while the young and metal-rich population (age < 8 Gyr and [Fe/H] > −1.0) corresponds to field stars.   Conclusions. From the analysis of the GC luminosity function and metallicity distribution, we can conclude that many GCs, probably those that are very faint, have survived strong dynamical processes that are typical of the bulge regions. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of them have been accreted during past merging events, especially the metal-poor component, whereas the metal-rich population may be related to the formation of the bulge and/or disk. Finally, the difference that we notice between the cluster and field star samples should be explored in the context of the evolutionary differences among these two stellar populations.","The authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for providing helpful comments and suggestions, which have improved the content of this paper.

Since direct measurement of cell temperature is not common, mathematical models are needed to make predictions. Numerous models have been documented, highlighting the challenge of applying a universal model to different climatic conditions. The main contribution of this study is the proposal of a metaheuristic algorithm to accurately compute the temperature of solar cells. This method is simple and effective in exploring numerous potential states of the reference parameters (i.e., irradiance and ambient temperature). Data collected over a 23-month period in two photovoltaic installations with an output power of 2.2 MW of multicrystalline silicon technology were used to develop the proposed method and validate it. The proposed model was compared with 19 previously reported models in the literature. Compared to the model recommended by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC Standard 61215-1), the mean square error, mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error were reduced by 4.9, 4.8, and 2.4 times, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated by MAE errors ranging from 0.56 ° C to 1.88 ° C , obtained by considering three different daily profiles of irradiance and ambient temperature. Therefore, the proposed method is recommended to more accurately calculate the temperature of the photovoltaic cell in tropical areas.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The sampled sedimentary section was recovered from the pit of the exotic copper deposit of El Tesoro, located approximately 2 and 4 km west of the Esperanza and Mirador porphyries, respectively. The sedimentary cover comprises four units, Tesoro II, Tesoro III, Arrieros and Recent gravels, deposited since the late Cenozoic in an arid continental environment dominated by alluvial fans. Except for the Tesoro III gravels, all other units contain exotic-Cu mineralisation. In order to interpret the geochemical footprint of the investigated zircons, the Porphyry Indicator Zircon (PIZ) concept (Pizarro et al., 2020) is used. A PIZ need to comply with each of the following geochemical values: Hf >8750 (ppm), Ce/Nd >1, Eu/Eu* >0.4, 10,000 × (Eu/Eu*)/Y > 1, (Ce/Nd)/Y > 0.01, Dy/Yb <0.3 and 0.1 < Th/U < 1. These zircons also have Ti <9 ppm and Ce/Ce* <100 and usually show euhedral morphologies characterised by prismatic forms of type {110}. The geochemical and petrographic characteristics of the PIZs collected in the gravels are similar to zircons from the nearby Mirador and Esperanza porphyries. The highest PIZ concentration coincides with the gravel horizons with exotic-Cu mineralisation. Therefore, the PIZs found in the sedimentary record are a potential tracer of adjacent copper porphyries and represent a promising exploration tool for this type of hidden ore deposits in challenging sediment-covered areas.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Hector Pizarro reports financial support was provided by National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) - Chile.

The evidence suggests that firms substitute dividends with repurchases to increase their payout flexibility in response to heightened climate risk. Operating volatility and financial constraints are two channels through which climate risk affects firms’ payout flexibility. Further analysis shows that the effect of climate risk on payout flexibility is more pronounced for firms that are more vulnerable to climate risk, and in countries where people are more concerned about climate risk and the national culture emphasizes uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation.",Declaration of competing interest None.,,Journal of Banking & Finance,,,,2024-09,2024,,2024-09,166,,107233,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Chang, Yuyuan; He, Wen; Mi, Lin","Chang, Yuyuan (Department of Financial Management, School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology, China); He, Wen (Department of Accounting, Monash Business School, Monash University, Australia); Mi, Lin (UQ Business School, University of Queensland, Australia)","Mi, Lin (University of Queensland)","Chang, Yuyuan (South China University of Technology); He, Wen (Monash University); Mi, Lin (University of Queensland)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2024.107233,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172502654,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",13 Climate Action

Therefore, the sustainable extraction of these materials is crucial. One of its important aspects is the analysis of the interaction between the actors as well as the actions undertaken by them. This study explores the characteristics of the network of links between social actors and the supporting and inhibitory actions related to sustainable development that the mining industry and its possible implications with collaboration and conflict between actors. Our methodological approach consisted in building two bipartite networks based on actor‐action interaction, identified thanks to the literature review of sustainability initiatives of mining companies. Applying network analysis, we examine the structural characteristics of the networks and the strength of links between social actors. The results highlighted that “Government,” “Local society,” and “Indigenous peoples” have a critical position in the network of “Supporting” and “Inhibitory” actions. They are those who could articulate with other social actors to create collaborative processes in the implementation of actions that contribute to sustainable development by the mining industry. However, from the analysis of the structure of the network of “Inhibitory” actions, these three actors are the ones who could be relevant in the dynamics of the development of conflicts with the mining industry. This study presents, from the dual perspective (“Supporting” and “Inhibitory” actions), the characteristics of the systems of relationships between social actors and their possible implications for the design, as well as implementation of sustainable strategies in the mining sector.",,,Sustainable Development,,,,2024-05-27,2024,2024-05-27,,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Fuentes, Marcelo; Negrete, Moira; Herrera‐León, Sebastián; Kraslawski, Andrzej","Fuentes, Marcelo (Departamento de Gestión de la Construcción, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; School of Engineering Science, LUT University, Lappeenranta, Finland); Negrete, Moira (Departamento de Gestión de la Construcción, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; School of Engineering Science, LUT University, Lappeenranta, Finland); Herrera‐León, Sebastián (School of Engineering Science, LUT University, Lappeenranta, Finland; Departamento de Ingeniería Química y de Medio Ambiente, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Kraslawski, Andrzej (School of Engineering Science, LUT University, Lappeenranta, Finland; Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland)","Fuentes, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North; Lappeenranta University of Technology)","Fuentes, Marcelo (Catholic University of the North; Lappeenranta University of Technology); Negrete, Moira (Catholic University of the North; Lappeenranta University of Technology); Herrera‐León, Sebastián (Lappeenranta University of Technology; Catholic University of the North); Kraslawski, Andrzej (Lappeenranta University of Technology; Systems Research Institute)",0,0,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/sd.3054,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172105568,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

La formación, ha sido objeto de un ingente número de estudios que la han abordado desde diferentes perspectivas, tomando como referencia los principales modelos teóricos; conductismo, cognitivismo y constructivismo, etc. Hoy en día, con la irrupción de las TIC y las Redes Sociales de Aprendizaje en contextos educativos, nos lleva a revisar paradigmas y asumir la presencia de nuevos paradigmas; social cognitivo, conexionista, conectivista, etc. que orientan hacia una forma de aprender de forma autónoma y autorregulada. El mundo de hoy se mueve a una velocidad vertiginosa y el estudiante tiene a su alcance una gran cantidad de recursos en red que le facilitan compatibilizar la formación con prácticamente cualquier actividad profesional o lúdica. En consecuencia, se cree necesario desplazar el estudio de los aspectos cognitivos del aprendizaje a los aspectos metacognitivos y, más concretamente, a las estrategias que están relacionadas con las competencias mencionadas, tales como la gestión del tiempo, el establecimiento de planes, la higiene en el estudio, la metodología empleada o la disciplina en el cumplimiento de los planes trazados, entre otras. Cognición y metacognición se complementan en perfecta simbiosis y se configuran como aliados del educando, siendo tan indivisibles como la cara y la cruz de una moneda o el haz y el envés de una hoja. En resumen, se considera que las estrategias para el estudio son tan importantes como el propio estudio en el EEES. Esta investigación pretende medir y evaluar el grado de importancia y cumplimiento de estas variables en estudiantes universitarios de Grado, en la modalidad de Enseñanza Presencial (EP) y Enseñanza a Distancia (EaD), también llamada Virtual, en la ULPGC.

This is a great opportunity, but there are great challenges involved in preventing this climate contribution from being greater than the potential impacts resulting from increased production. This study aims to identify the potential social and environmental impacts of decarbonization actions that can be integrated into the operational processes of copper and lithium mining. In addition, the list of identified impacts was also linked with the indicator framework currently used to assess sustainability in different contexts (social, environmental, and economic). The selection and analysis of the articles are based on the Systematic Analysis of Literature, which is based on the following steps: Identification, Screening, Eligibility, and Inclusion. The actions were broken down into 5 categories: a) Electrification, b) Change of fuel, c) Circular economy, d) Promotion of low-carbon energy generation, and e) Technological changes for energy efficiency. Then they were linked to each of the operating processes of copper and lithium mining (brine and spodumene). Finally, to learn about potential social and environmental impacts of the decarbonization actions in the copper and lithium mining industry, 2 sustainability indicator frameworks were added: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Of a total of 5 categories associated with decarbonization issues in energy-intensive industries, 56 actions were identified as the contribution that these industries can make to climate change. However, only 26 of these actions managed to be linked to copper and lithium mining. The document links the SDG and GRI indicators with the identified environmental and social impacts of decarbonization actions. It has been demonstrated that the mining industry, due to its operational characteristics, has direct socio-environmental impacts on the intervention sites and has been managed with different strategies (e.g., management, technology). This study also provides evidence that decarbonization of this industry as an end-user of low-carbon technologies will have socio-environmental implications in the supply chain of these technologies.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The Congress has focused on cutting edge and breakthrough research in physical, chemical, toxicological, medical, agricultural and other specific issues on arsenic across a broader environmental realm. The Biennial Congress and Exhibition “Arsenic in the Environment” was first organized in Mexico City (As2006) followed by As2008 in Valencia (Spain), As2010 in Tainan (Taiwan, Republic of China), As2012 in Cairns (Australia), As2014 in Buenos Aires (Argentina), As2016 in Stockholm (Sweden) and As2018 in Beijing (P.R. China). The 8th International Congress As2021 was held June 7–9, 2021 (first time digitally owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic, in Wageningen, The Netherlands) and with a title Arsenic in the Environment – Bridging Science to Practice for Sustainable Development. The Congress addressed the broader context of arsenic research aligned on the following themes: Theme 1: Arsenic in Natural Soil and Water Systems Theme 2: Arsenic in Agriculture and Food Production Theme 3: Health Impacts of Arsenic Theme 4: Technologies for Arsenic Removal from Water Theme 5: Sustainable Mitigation and Management for Sustainable Development Theme 1: Arsenic in Natural Soil and Water Systems Theme 2: Arsenic in Agriculture and Food Production Theme 3: Health Impacts of Arsenic Theme 4: Technologies for Arsenic Removal from Water Theme 5: Sustainable Mitigation and Management for Sustainable Development Arsenic in drinking water and food is a major health issue, affecting millions of people in many parts of the world. In recent years serious cases of arsenic exposure through different environmental matrices have been reported from, for example, Argentina, Bangladesh, Chile, China, Taiwan, Turkey, India, Mexico, UK, USA, Pakistan, Vietnam as well as other regions in the world. Arsenic can cause a number of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic adverse effects on human health and therefore human exposure to arsenic should be avoided. Notably, The Netherlands has been in the forefront of research on arsenic removal technology and developed a cutting edge innovation to remove arsenic to levels below the WHO drinking water guideline to as low as less than 1 μg/L. This has created an enabling environment to discuss on policy issues for defining the new drinking water guideline. The Congress has attracted professionals involved in different segments of interdisciplinary research on arsenic in an open forum, and strengthened relations between academia, research institutions, government and non-governmental agencies, industries, and civil society organizations to share an optimal ambience for exchange of knowledge.",,,,,,,2024-01-09,2024,2024-01-09,,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003317395,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167801498,41 Environmental Sciences; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,2 Zero Hunger

In this paper, we present the results of the first doping test ever performed in a kiloton-scale LArTPC. From February to May 2020, we carried out this special run in the single-phase DUNE Far Detector prototype (ProtoDUNE-SP) at CERN, featuring 720 t of total liquid argon mass with 410 t of fiducial mass. A 5.4 ppm nitrogen contamination was present during the xenon doping campaign. The goal of the run was to measure the light and charge response of the detector to the addition of xenon, up to a concentration of 18.8 ppm. The main purpose was to test the possibility for reduction of non-uniformities in light collection, caused by deployment of photon detectors only within the anode planes. Light collection was analysed as a function of the xenon concentration, by using the pre-existing photon detection system (PDS) of ProtoDUNE-SP and an additional smaller set-up installed specifically for this run. In this paper we first summarize our current understanding of the argon-xenon energy transfer process and the impact of the presence of nitrogen in argon with and without xenon dopant. We then describe the key elements of ProtoDUNE-SP and the injection method deployed. Two dedicated photon detectors were able to collect the light produced by xenon and the total light. The ratio of these components was measured to be about 0.65 as 18.8 ppm of xenon were injected. We performed studies of the collection efficiency as a function of the distance between tracks and light detectors, demonstrating enhanced uniformity of response for the anode-mounted PDS. We also show that xenon doping can substantially recover light losses due to contamination of the liquid argon by nitrogen.",,,Journal of Instrumentation,,,,2024-08-01,2024,2024-08-05,2024-08-01,19,08,p08005,All OA; Hybrid,Article,A.

All this makes it necessary for companies or those people who plan to create companies to take into account the need to incorporate into their businesses some of the types of logistics that are a trend today, since these allow the development, growth and advancement of companies. It is worth noting the importance that this should become a necessity in companies because thanks to these methods, companies have managed to advance over time and stay in the market, generating new employment opportunities.Some of the most relevant trends include: process automation which reduces the possibility of errors, monitoring that helps to have control and follow-up of either products or customers, the last mile which refers to the last moment in the which the merchandise reaches the hands of the customer, fast deliveries that, as its name indicates, allows faster delivery of products, green logistics that refers to both the products and the delivery method being eco-friendly, intelligence technology that provides technological tools to facilitate any task, drones and autonomous trucks that are responsible for making deliveries directly to customers, changes in payment methods as they are done through platforms more quickly and from anywhere in the world, and cloud storage that was the boom during the pandemic and thanks to which many companies managed to implement it.",,,Reflexiones contables (Cúcuta),,,,2024-06-11,2024,2024-06-11,,7,2,08-16,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Cely-Cely, Viviana Marcela; Carrillo-Estrada, Maryurie Dayana; Rolón-Rodríguez, Blanca Mery","Cely-Cely, Viviana Marcela (Fundación de Estudios Superiores Comfanorte, Cúcuta-Colombia); Carrillo-Estrada, Maryurie Dayana (Fundación de Estudios Superiores Comfanorte, Cúcuta-Colombia); Rolón-Rodríguez, Blanca Mery (Fundación de Estudios Superiores Comfanorte, Cúcuta-Colombia)",,"Cely-Cely, Viviana Marcela (Fundación de Estudios Superiores Comfanorte, Cúcuta-Colombia); Carrillo-Estrada, Maryurie Dayana (Fundación de Estudios Superiores Comfanorte, Cúcuta-Colombia); Rolón-Rodríguez, Blanca Mery (Fundación de Estudios Superiores Comfanorte, Cúcuta-Colombia)",0,0,,,https://revistas.ufps.edu.co/index.php/RC/article/download/4540/5761,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172914278,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

Technical Design Report,"DUNE is an international experiment dedicated to addressing some of the questions at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics, including the mystifying preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe. The dual-site experiment will employ an intense neutrino beam focused on a near and a far detector as it aims to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to make high-precision measurements of the PMNS matrix parameters, including the CP-violating phase. It will also stand ready to observe supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model. The DUNE far detector implements liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) technology, and combines the many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass necessary for rare event searches with the sub-centimeter spatial resolution required to image those events with high precision. The addition of a photon detection system enhances physics capabilities for all DUNE physics drivers and opens prospects for further physics explorations. Given its size, the far detector will be implemented as a set of modules, with LArTPC designs that differ from one another as newer technologies arise. In the vertical drift LArTPC design, a horizontal cathode bisects the detector, creating two stacked drift volumes in which ionization charges drift towards anodes at either the top or bottom. The anodes are composed of perforated PCB layers with conductive strips, enabling reconstruction in 3D. Light-trap-style photon detection modules are placed both on the cryostat's side walls and on the central cathode where they are optically powered. This Technical Design Report describes in detail the technical implementations of each subsystem of this LArTPC that, together with the other far detector modules and the near detector, will enable DUNE to achieve its physics goals.",,,Journal of Instrumentation,,,,2024-08-01,2024,2024-08-09,2024-08-01,19,08,t08004,All OA; Hybrid,Article,A.

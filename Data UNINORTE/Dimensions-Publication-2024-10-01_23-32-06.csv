Central to this is the need for precise global time series of plastic pollution with which we can assess whether implemented policies are effective, but at present we lack these data. To address this need, we used previously published and new data on floating ocean plastics (n = 11,777 stations) to create a global time-series that estimates the average counts and mass of small plastics in the ocean surface layer from 1979 to 2019. Today's global abundance is estimated at approximately 82-358 trillion plastic particles weighing 1.1-4.9 million tonnes. We observed no clear detectable trend until 1990, a fluctuating but stagnant trend from then until 2005, and a rapid increase until the present. This observed acceleration of plastic densities in the world's oceans, also reported for beaches around the globe, demands urgent international policy interventions.","We thank Ocean Missions for data from Iceland and Greenland and thank Ocean Research Project for data from across the Arctic.

However, with the exception of a few locations (Stromboli, Etna, Kīlauea), hitherto the majority of measurements have been made on discrete field campaigns, which provide only brief snapshots into a volcano’s activity. Here, we present the development of a new, low-cost, low-power SO2 camera for permanent deployment on volcanoes, facilitating long-term, quasi-continuous (daylight hours only) measurements. We then discuss preliminary datasets from Lascar and Kīlauea volcanoes, where instruments are now in continuous operation. Further proliferation of such instrumentation has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of the transient nature of volcanic activity, as well as aiding volcano monitoring/eruption forecasting.","We would like to thank two reviewers whose comments have greatly improved the manuscript.

Yet little is known about the extent to which soil contaminants differ between urban greenspaces and natural ecosystems. Here we show that urban greenspaces and adjacent natural areas (i.e., natural/semi-natural ecosystems) shared similar levels of multiple soil contaminants (metal(loid)s, pesticides, microplastics, and antibiotic resistance genes) across the globe. We reveal that human influence explained many forms of soil contamination worldwide. Socio-economic factors were integral to explaining the occurrence of soil contaminants worldwide. We further show that increased levels of multiple soil contaminants were linked with changes in microbial traits including genes associated with environmental stress resistance, nutrient cycling, and pathogenesis. Taken together, our work demonstrates that human-driven soil contamination in nearby natural areas mirrors that in urban greenspaces globally, and highlights that soil contaminants have the potential to cause dire consequences for ecosystem sustainability and human wellbeing.","We thank the researchers involved in the MUSGONET project for collection of field data.

176,pub.1160015270,10.3389/feart.2023.1197363,,,Physical and chemical characteristics of active sulfur flows observed at Lastarria volcano (northern Chile) in January 2019,"Molten sulfur is found in various subaerial volcanoes. However, limited records of the pools and flows of molten sulfur have been reported: therefore, questions remain regarding the physicochemical processes behind this phenomenon. A suite of new sulfur flows, some of which active, was identified at the Lastarria volcano (northern Chile) and studied using satellite imagery, in situ probing, and temperature and video recording. This finding provides a unique opportunity to better understand the emplacement mechanisms and mineral and chemical compositions of molten sulfur, in addition to gaining insight into its origin. Molten sulfur presented temperatures of 124–158°C, with the most prolonged sulfur flow reaching 12 m from the source. Photogrammetric tools permitted the identification of levees and channel structures, with an estimated average flow speed of 0.069 m/s. Field measurements yielded a total volume of 1.45 ± 0.29 m3 of sulfur (equivalent to ∼2.07 tons) mobilized during the January 2019 event for at least 408 min. Solidified sulfur was composed of native sulfur with minor galena and arsenic- and iodine-bearing minerals. Trace element analysis indicated substantial enrichment of Bi, Sb, Sn, Cd, as well as a very high concentration of As (>40.000 ppm). The January 2019 molten sulfur manifestations in Lastarria appear to be more enriched in As compared to the worldwide known volcanoes with molten sulfur records, such as the Shiretoko-Iozan and Poás volcanoes. Furthermore, their rheological properties suggest that the “time of activity” in events such as this could be underestimated as flows in Lastarria have moved significantly slower than previously thought. The origin of molten sulfur is ascribed to the favorable S-rich chemistry of fumarolic gases and changes in host rock permeability (fracture opening). Molten sulfur in Lastarria correlates with a peak in activity characterized by high emissions of SO2 and other acid species, such as HF and HCl, in addition to ground deformation. Consequently, molten sulfur was framed within a period of volcanic unrest in Lastarria, triggered by changes in the magmatic-hydrothermal system. The appearance of molten sulfur is related to physicochemical perturbations inside the volcanic system and is perhaps a precursor of eruptive activity, as observed in the Poás and Turrialba volcanoes.","We thank the “Unidad de Equipamiento Científico” (MAINI), hosted at Universidad Católica del Norte, for their valuable support during scanning electron microscopy analysis.

Worldwide, most cases are registered in the African Meningitis Belt (AMB). The role of particular socioepidemiological features is essential for understanding disease dynamics and optimizing policy-making.
Objective: To identify socioepidemiological macro-determinants that contribute to explaining the differences in BM incidence between AMB and the rest of Africa.
Methods: Country-level ecologic study based on the cumulative incidence estimates of the Global Burden of Disease study and reports of the MenAfriNet Consortium. Data about relevant socioepidemiological features were extracted from international sources. Multivariate regression models were implemented to define variables associated with the classification of African countries within the AMB and the incidence of BM worldwide.
Results: Cumulative incidences at the AMB sub-regions were 111.93 (west), 87.23 (central), 65.10 (east), and 42.47 (north) per 100,000 population. A pattern of common origin with continuous exposition and seasonality of cases was observed. Socio-epidemiological determinants contributing to differentiating the AMB from the rest of Africa were household occupancy (OR 3.17 CI 95% 1.09-9.22, p = 0.034) and malaria incidence (OR 1.01 CI 95% 1.00-1.02, p = 0.016). BM cumulative incidence worldwide was additionally associated with temperature and gross national income per capita.
Conclusion: Socioeconomic and climate conditions are macro-determinants associated with BM cumulative incidence. Multilevel designs are required to confirm these findings.",This study was approved as the capstone project for granting the degree of specialist in epidemiology to one of the authors (GP-M) and a preliminary analysis was presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in 2022.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in Colombia under real-life conditions among people aged 18 years and older, according to sex, age, confirmed history of COVID-19 and vaccination series, including the effects of boosters. This investigation was an observational, retrospective, population-based study based on the Colombian cohort ""Esperanza"". A total of 14,213,409 individuals aged 18 years and older were analyzed, who were matched in a 1:1 ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated. The study groups consisted of unvaccinated individuals, those with a complete series (CS) and individuals with a CS plus booster. The vaccinated individuals received either homologous or heterologous vaccinations with Ad26.COV2-S, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, CoronaVac and mRNA-1273 vaccines. Follow-up was conducted between February 2021 and June 2022. Cox proportional hazards models were used, adjusted for potential confounders, to estimate the effectiveness of different vaccination series. For adults aged 18 years and older, the overall effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalization was 82.7% (95% CI 82.1-83.2) for CS and 80.2% (95%CI 78.7-81.6) for CS + booster. The effectiveness in preventing death was 86.0% (95%CI 85.5-86.5) for CS and 83.1% (95%CI 81.5-84.5) for CS + booster. Effectiveness decreased with age. While all efficacies were high, CoronaVac offered significantly lower protection, although this improved with a booster. Continued mass vaccination is pivotal, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

In 2017, a nemertean worm, Carcinonemertes conanobrieni was described from ovigerous females of P. argus in Florida, USA. A year later, the presence of the same egg predator was recorded along the southern Caribbean coast (Colombia). The effect of this egg predator on the reproductive performance, including fecundity, embryo mortality, and reproductive output, of its host is unknown. This study tested whether C. conanobrieni affects embryo mortality, fecundity, and reproductive output in brooding females of P. argus.ResultsArtisan fishers caught 90 ovigerous lobsters near Pueblo Viejo, Magdalena, Colombia. Each ovigerous female was examined for the presence/absence of the egg predator. Lobster egg mortality (%), fecundity (nº eggs female−1), and reproductive output (%) were estimated. Prevalence of C. conanobrieni in the studied population was 87.78%. The mean intensity of C. conanobrieni (all life stages) in the population was 11.68 (± 1.98) egg predators per brood mass sample. Infected females brooding late-stage embryos exhibited lower fecundity, lower reproductive performance values, and higher embryo mortality compared to infected females brooding early-stage embryos. Embryo stage and worm infection level negatively impacted fecundity and reproductive output. Worm infection level and the number of adult nemertean worms also negatively affected embryo mortality.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate an adverse effect of C. conanobrieni on the reproductive performance of P. argus. The interactive impact of this egg predator, natural stressors, and anthropogenic stressors on individual P. argus reproductive performance could facilitate losses at large-scale fisheries levels.","We would like to thank the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) for awarding the permits for specimen collection.

Chile is the world’s leading marine seaweed biomass producer when it comes to the exploitation of natural kelp beds. This extraction pressure has persisted for decades and has resulted in a reduction in natural stocks along the benthic ecosystems of the Chilean coast. Over the last three decades, several strategies aimed at restoring seaweed stocks have been implemented (i.e., sexual and asexual reproduction, the use of spore-type propagules or fragments of thalli, and entire thallus transplants). Success rates have varied, but the biological feasibility of such strategies has been demonstrated for several species. However, technological improvements must be achieved to move from small-scale, pilot experiments to cost-effective restocking strategies that are easy to transfer to fisher communities and another end-user, scalable to marine field conditions, and socio-ecologically sustainable. Researchers in other geographic areas have explored similar pathways for developing kelp restocking strategies and have tackled the research gaps regarding its massification. This work summarizes the research activities carried out in recent decades in the search for sustainable strategies to restore algal stocks in Chile.",The authors would like to thank Renata Garretón for her contribution to the elaboration of Figures 1 and 8 of this work.,"This research was funded by the ANID Millennium Science Initiative Program ICN 2019_015, ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002, ANID/BASAL FB210006 and the CNRS International Research Network Diversity and Biotechnology of Marine Algae (contract number 00022).",Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,,9,,1062481,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oyarzo-Miranda, Carolina; Otaíza, Ricardo; Bellorín, Alexis; Vega, J.M.

This neglected disease mainly affects populations in developing or underdeveloped countries, causing nearly one million new cases per year. This article focuses on the cutaneous form of the disease. Common antileishmanial medications have several disadvantages, such as low efficiency, high toxicity, several adverse effects, resistant strains, long treatments, and high costs. As a result, first- and second-line treatments are insufficient. Therefore, there is a need for new antileishmanial agents and strategies, most of which utilize nanotechnology. While novel nano-drug delivery devices can transport antileishmanial drugs to target cells, reducing secondary toxic effects, several advances in nanotechnology and photonics pursue activation of leishmanicidal mechanisms once they reach their target. Here is a of recent nanotechnology approaches to the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of human cutaneous leishmaniasis, including promising techniques still in development.","Declaration of Competing Interest On behalf of all the co-authors of this manuscript, I declare that there are no conflict of interest regarding this review.

Such programs are indispensable because, as explained in the paper, in “panic buying” environments, supply chains are frequently unable to rapidly increase the amounts of critical supplies delivered to points of sales. Thus, reducing the demand is the only option to mitigate shortages. To reach this goal, this research assesses the potential of a novel FDM initiative that relies on Trusted Change Agents (TCAs) to convince individuals to limit their purchases of critical supplies, and outlines a comprehensive FDM program with initiatives spanning the entire disaster management cycle. The research: analyzes survey data to gain insight into the reasons people participate in “panic buying;” establishes that the term “panic buying” is a misnomer—as the instances of true “panic” are extremely rare—and suggests the term “Disaster Related Buying Behaviors” (DRBBs)” to better describe the phenomena; creates a data-driven taxonomy of objectives and motivating reasons for DRBBs; estimates a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to assess the strengths of the interconnections between reasons, themes, and objectives pursued by individuals who enact DRBBs; assesses the impacts of TCA appeals; identifies the initiatives needed, together with the timing and sequencing, to be conducted at the various stages of the disaster management cycle; identifies the stakeholders that ought to be involved in the executions of these initiatives; and puts these elements together to outline a comprehensive FDM program.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The functions attributed to bivalves depend on the life habits of a species (epi- or infauna) and their abundance and biomass. To properly quantify and assess these functions, detailed information the distribution, abundance and biomass at the ecosystem scale is critical. Amongst others, this requires an understanding on how environmental conditions shape special patterns in distribution. In this study we investigate this fundamental information on the Swedish west coast, an area where this information is lacking. A survey which was designed to representatively sample both epi- and infaunal bivalves from randomized locations in various habitat types was conducted. Specifically, abundance and biomass of all species were recorded in the intertidal (0-0.5 m) and the shallow subtidal zone (0.5-2 m). The sites were distributed over an offshore gradient and at two exposure levels. This sampling structure allowed to extrapolate the results to an ecosystem level though information on the areal extent of these habitats using GIS layers. It was found that even though there exist a great variability among sites, in general epifaunal bivalves outweigh infaunal bivalves approximately 3 to 1. In terms of abundance, the ratio is more or less reversed and infaunal species occur in greater numbers. Most bivalves were found at an intermediate level of exposure, but due to the areal extend of the sheltered inner-archipelago this was the most important habitat for bivalve abundance and biomass. It was also found that invasive epifaunal oyster Magallana gigas and the invasive infaunal clam Ensis leei both dominated their respective groups in terms of biomass. Though the survey was relatively small, these results serve as a valuable insight of the relative importance of epi- and infaunal bivalves in this region. This gives understanding on which species and habitats are particularly important for ecosystem functions and services related to bivalves. This also provide a starting baseline for attempts to quantify ecosystem services provided by certain species or groups of bivalves in the future.",,,Frontiers in Marine Science,,,,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,,10,,1105999,All OA; Gold,Article,"Greeve, Youk; Bergström, Per; Strand, Åsa; Lindegarth, Mats","Greeve, Youk (Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Strömstad, Sweden); Bergström, Per (Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Strömstad, Sweden); Strand, Åsa (IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Kristineberg Center, Fiskebäckskil, Sweden); Lindegarth, Mats (Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Strömstad, Sweden)","Greeve, Youk (University of Gothenburg)","Greeve, Youk (University of Gothenburg); Bergström, Per (University of Gothenburg); Strand, Åsa (IVL - Swedish Environmental Research Institute); Lindegarth, Mats (University of Gothenburg)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1105999/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154790400,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

Four hundred and sixteen adults responded to the online survey. A brief sociodemographic questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Scale, and a questionnaire on adverse childhood experiences were included. The analyses revealed that individuals who experienced one or more alienating behaviors exhibited higher levels of anxiety, depression, somatization, and overall psychological distress. Furthermore, even after controlling for the effect of other adverse childhood experiences, alienating behaviors had a significant impact on psychological distress in adulthood.

The usual mechanism of injury is falling over the hand with the elbow extended and the hand open. The management of these fractures encompasses a range of treatment options, and their goal is to recover the anatomy and achieve a stable contact area between them. There are some controversies on the management of these injuries mainly focused on those that present some degree of displacement. A review and analysis of the current treatment at our institution and a comparison with the guidelines suggested by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) for the treatment of these fractures in the pediatric population were performed. Materials and methods This was an observational, analytical, retrospective study of consecutive pediatric patients with displaced supracondylar humeral fracture treated at Hospital de Trauma ""Manuel Giagni"" in Asunción, Paraguay, from January 2016 to December 2021. Demographic and clinical data were assessed, and patients were clinically and radiologically followed for at least 12 months. The management of supracondylar humeral fractures at our hospital was compared with the guidelines suggested by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) by analyzing whether these guidelines were applied in each case. The mechanism of injury was divided into three groups, initial X-rays were measured, extension-type fractures were categorized into three groups, and the type of treatment was divided into two groups: non-operative and operative. Furthermore, trauma-related preoperative complications and postoperative complications were reported. Outpatient follow-up was performed for at least 12 months in all cases. Results Of the 843 patients analyzed, 71.5% were male, with a mean age of 5.6 years. It was observed that 57.5% of injuries were caused by falls on the same level. The most frequent type of injury was Gartland type III, accounting for 55% of the cases, and associated injuries were found in 4% of the cases. With regard to the type of treatment, 91.8% of patients were treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation. Complications on admission were found in 12% of the cases and late complications in 12% of the cases. Most patients (82%) had excellent Mayo Elbow Performance Score. Conclusion Supracondylar fractures were more frequent in males and in schoolchildren. Garland type III fractures were the most common type of injury. The treatment of choice was predominantly closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score was excellent in most patients. Our service, a referral center of a public hospital in a developing country, complies with the guidelines recommended by the AAOS.","The authors had no conflict of interest to declare, and there was no external funding either for investigation or for study publication.",,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2023-08-31,2023,2023-08-31,,15,8,e44430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro; Fretes, Alberto Navarro; Alonso, Rafael Aníbal Arréllaga; Villate, Maria Mercedes Medina","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, PRY); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, PRY; Pediatric Orthopedics, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Pediatrics Service, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Alonso, Rafael Aníbal Arréllaga (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Villate, Maria Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Universidad del Norte)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Universidad del Norte); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Universidad del Norte; Pediatric Orthopedics, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY; Pediatrics Service, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Alonso, Rafael Aníbal Arréllaga (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Asunción, PRY); Villate, Maria Mercedes Medina (Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital de Especialidades Quirúrgicas Ingavi del Instituto de Previsión Social (IPS), Asunción, PRY)",0,0,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/176638/20230831-2252-1qm87bg.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163749047,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Understanding how best to fill existing gaps and account for biases is necessary to improve our current information most effectively. Two current main approaches for obtaining and improving data include (1) curation of biological collections, and (2) fieldwork. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in improving biodiversity data remains little explored. We used the Flora de Bogotá project to study the magnitude of change in species richness, spatial coverage, and sample coverage of plant records based on curation versus fieldwork. The process of curation resulted in a decrease in species richness (synonym and error removal), but it significantly increased the number of records per species. Fieldwork contributed to a slight increase in species richness, via accumulation of new records. Additionally, curation led to increases in spatial coverage, species observed by locality, the number of plant records by species, and localities by species compared to fieldwork. Overall, curation was more efficient in producing new information compared to fieldwork, mainly because of the large number of records available in herbaria. We recommend intensive curatorial work as the first step in increasing biodiversity data quality and quantity, to identify bias and gaps at the regional scale that can then be targeted with fieldwork. The stepwise strategy would enable fieldwork to be planned more cost-effectively given the limited resources for biodiversity exploration and characterization.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The database was compiled through a global collaboration between a network of researchers, meteorological services and environmental organisations from 65 countries. GloREDa is the first open access database of rainfall erosivity (R-factor) based on hourly and sub-hourly rainfall records at a global scale. This database is now stored and accessible for download in the long-term European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) repository of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. This will ensure the further development of the database with insertions of new records, maintenance of the data and provision of a helpdesk. In addition to the annual erosivity data, this release also includes the mean monthly erosivity data for 94% of the GloREDa stations. Based on these mean monthly R-factor values, we predict the global monthly erosivity datasets at 1 km resolution using the ensemble machine learning approach (ML) as implemented in the mlr package for R. The produced monthly raster data (GeoTIFF format) may be useful for soil erosion prediction modelling, sediment distribution analysis, climate change predictions, flood, and natural disaster assessments and can be valuable inputs for Land and Earth Systems modelling.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, what thick description entails and how it should be carried out is often missing or insufficiently described. While expert qualitative researchers may be familiar with the concept, the wide variety of meanings and interpretations of thick description in the literature may make it difficult for novice qualitative researchers to understand this concept when reporting qualitative findings. The purpose of this paper is to propose the “MIRACLE” narrative framework for providing thick description in qualitative research. We developed this framework based on a critical review of theoretical literature about thick description and writing in qualitative research, as well as our personal experiences conducting, writing, and publishing qualitative studies.

Given the molecular diversity characteristic of each cellular phenotype, the possible cytopathic, tissue and clinical effects are difficult to predict, which determines the heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various cell types, focusing on the development of COVID-19, which in turn may lead, in some patients, to a persistence of symptoms after recovery from the disease, a condition known as long COVID. We describe the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-host interactions, including alterations in protein expression, intracellular signaling pathways, and immune responses. In particular, the article highlights the potential impact of these cytopathies on cellular function and clinical outcomes, such as immune dysregulation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and organ damage.

Information regarding population connectivity is crucial to evaluate its conservation status and local fishing impacts. In this study, we sampled 922 putative Bull Sharks from 19 locations in the first global assessment of population structure of this cosmopolitan species. Using a recently developed DNA-capture approach (DArTcap), samples were genotyped for 3400 nuclear markers. Additionally, full mitochondrial genomes of 384 Indo-Pacific samples were sequenced. Reproductive isolation was found between and across ocean basins (eastern Pacific, western Atlantic, eastern Atlantic, Indo-West Pacific) with distinct island populations in Japan and Fiji. Bull Sharks appear to maintain gene flow using shallow coastal waters as dispersal corridors, whereas large oceanic distances and historical land-bridges act as barriers. Females tend to return to the same area for reproduction, making them more susceptible to local threats and an important focus for management actions. Given these behaviors, the exploitation of Bull Sharks from insular populations, such as Japan and Fiji, may instigate local decline that cannot readily be replenished by immigration, which can in turn affect ecosystem dynamics and functions. These data also supported the development of a genetic panel to ascertain the population of origin, which will be useful in monitoring the trade of fisheries products and assessing population-level impacts of this harvest.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation Inc, the Ord River Research Offset grant through CSIRO, and the Marine Biodiversity Hub, a collaborative partnership supported through funding from the Australian Government&#x27;s National Environmental Science Program.

Some AESIs are not only associated with the vaccines, but with COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare these to historical rates in the general population.
Methods: A multi-national cohort study with data from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a common data model. This study's evidence was collected between Jan 1, 2017 and the conclusion of each database (which ranged from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 pre-specified prevalent AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios (SIR) were estimated to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic rates in each of the databases.
Findings: Substantial heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite trend. Similarly, differences were also observed across databases for same health outcome and age-sex strata. All studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related meta-analytic SIRs ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for pulmonary embolism.
Interpretation: Our findings suggest all AESIs are more common after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic events were particularly common, and over 10-fold more so. More research is needed to contextualise post-COVID-19 complications in the longer term.

For this purpose, a database was constructed with governmental information regarding municipalities that present tailings, and subsequently, identified their levels of multidimensional poverty. The results show: (i) the presence of tailings throughout the national territory, although their greater concentration is found in the country's center-north; (ii) that the majority of tailings at the national level is located in socially and economically disadvantaged municipalities; and (iii) that only 4 municipalities concentrate 321 of the 757 tailings, which represent 42,4% of the national total. This information allows us to conclude that the task of surveying and remediating mining tailings is a national governance challenge and that in order to address it, the context and the social injustice it causes must be considered.","Iván Ojeda-Pereira thanks the support of the Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management ANID/FONDAP/1511001 (CIGIDEN).

SDSS-V comprises three primary scientific programs or “Mappers”: the Milky Way Mapper (MWM), the Black Hole Mapper (BHM), and the Local Volume Mapper. This data release contains extensive targeting information for the two multiobject spectroscopy programs (MWM and BHM), including input catalogs and selection functions for their numerous scientific objectives. We describe the production of the targeting databases and their calibration and scientifically focused components. DR18 also includes ∼25,000 new SDSS spectra and supplemental information for X-ray sources identified by eROSITA in its eFEDS field. We present updates to some of the SDSS software pipelines and preview changes anticipated for DR19. We also describe three value-added catalogs (VACs) based on SDSS-IV data that have been published since DR17, and one VAC based on the SDSS-V data in the eFEDS field.","The documentation workshop for DR18 (“DocuLlama”) was held virtually in 2022 September, organized by Anne-Marie Weijmans and Gail Zasowski.

This article makes a conceptual and methodological contribution to this last debate. Part of the proposed reflection is meta-theoretical, allowing the identification of commonalities between the epistemological foundations of the DT and one evaluation school, in particular: pragmatic evaluation. In a second analytical moment, the text examines some epistemological limitations of pragmatism (as a research paradigm) to ground causal conclusions in social inquiry. This is not a trivial matter since the very essence of evaluation is, precisely, the identification of causal dynamics unleashed by social interventions. It is possible to amend some of these problems in a DT-based evaluation by adopting some epistemological principles from Critical Realism. A brief discussion of two applied evaluations of education interventions in Colombia led by the authors serves to illustrate some methodological implications of these last arguments.",,,Desafíos,,,,2023-02-28,2023,2023-02-28,,35,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Parra, Juan David; Vieira, Camilo","Parra, Juan David (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte); Vieira, Camilo (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte)",,"Parra, Juan David (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte); Vieira, Camilo (Instituto de Estudios en Educación, Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://revistas.urosario.edu.co/index.php/desafios/article/download/12199/11363,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155820880,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,
1188,pub.1158380271,10.5194/os-19-685-2023,,,Seasonal and El Niño–Southern Oscillation-related ocean variability in the Panama Bight,"Abstract. In the Panama Bight, two different seasonal surface circulation patterns
coincide with a strong mean sea level variation, as observed from 27 years
of absolute dynamic topography (ADT) and the use of self-organizing maps.
From January to April, a cyclonic gyre with a strong southwestward Panama
Jet Surface Current (PJSC) dominates the basin circulation, forced by the
Panama surface wind jet that also produces upwelling, reducing sea surface
temperature (SST), increasing sea surface salinity (SSS) and causing an ADT
decrease. From June to December, the Choco surface wind jet enhances SST,
precipitation and river runoff, which reduces SSS, causing an ADT rise, which in turn forces a weak circulation in the bight, vanishing the PJSC. Interannual
variability in the region is strongly affected by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO); however this
climatic variability does not modify the seasonal circulation patterns in
the Panama Bight. In contrast, the positive (negative) ENSO phase increases
(decreases) SST and ADT in the Panama Bight, with a mean annual difference
of 0.9 ∘C and 9.6 cm, respectively, between the two conditions,
while its effect on SSS is small. However, as the strong seasonal SST, SSS
and ADT ranges are up to 2.2 ∘C, 2.59 g kg−1 and 28.3 cm,
the seasonal signal dominates over interannual variations in the bight.","The present research was carried out in the framework of the AEI accreditation “Maria de Maeztu Centre of Excellence” given to IMEDEA (CSIC-UIB) (CEX2021-001198).

In fact, Testing, Tracing, and Isolation (TTI) in conjunction with disciplined social distancing and vaccination were expected to achieve negligible COVID-19 contagion levels; however, they proved to be insufficient, and their implementation has led to controversial social, economic and ethical challenges. This paper focuses on the development of simple indicators, based on the experience gained by COVID-19 data, which provide a sort of yellow light as to when an epidemic might expand, despite some short term decrements. We show that if case growth is not stopped during the 7 to 14 days after onset, the growth risk increases considerably, and warrants immediate attention. Our model examines not only the COVID contagion propagation speed, but also how it accelerates as a function of time. We identify trends that emerge under the various policies that were applied, as well as their differences among countries. The data for all countries was obtained from ourworldindata.org. Our main conclusion is that if the reduction spread is lost during one, or at most two weeks, urgent measures should be implemented to avoid scenarios in which the epidemic gains strong impetus.",,"Supported by ANID Chile through Fondecyt grants Nos. 11180557, 1191351, 1211902 and Center for the Development of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, CEDENNA AFB220001.

The presence of anti-parietal cell antibodies is indicative of reduced ability to absorb vitamin B12. Thus, this study reviewed the existing studies with the objective of assessing differences in the serum levels of vitamin B12 among patients with and without TD, the frequency of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with TD, and the presence of anti-parietal cell antibodies in patients with TD.
Methods: A meta-analysis of random-effects model was conducted to calculate pooled frequencies, mean differences (MD), and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We identified 64 studies that met our inclusion criteria (n = 28597).
Results: We found that patients with hypothyroidism had lower vitamin B12 levels than healthy participants (MD: -60.67 pg/mL; 95% CI: -107.31 to -14.03 pg/mL; p = 0.01). No significant differences in vitamin B12 levels were observed between healthy participants and patients with hyperthyroidism (p = 0.78), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) (p = 0.22), or subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) (p = 0.79). The frequencies of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, SH, and AITD were 27%, 6%, 27%, and 18%, respectively.
Conclusions: Patients with hypothyroidism had lower levels of vitamin B12 than healthy participants. No significant differences were observed between vitamin B12 levels and hyperthyroidism, AITD, or SH.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of these markers with metabolic syndrome (MetS).MethodsWe ran a systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science on March 15, 2023. No language or date restrictions were applied. The only synthesised effect measure reported was the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We utilised the random-effects model for the quantitative synthesis.ResultsWe analysed 50 studies (n = 150 519) with different definitions for MetS. Increased ApoB values were associated with MetS (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 2.44–3.22; p < 0.01, I2 = 99%). Decreased ApoA1 values were associated with MetS (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.38–0.47; p < 0.01, I2 = 99%). Increased values of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio were associated with MetS (OR = 4.97; 95% CI: 3.83–6.44; p < 0.01, I2 = 97%). Decreased values of Lp(a) were associated with MetS (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82–0.96; p < 0.01; I2 = 92%).ConclusionsIncreased values of ApoB and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio are associated with MetS, while decreased values of ApoA1 and Lp(a) are associated with MetS. These findings suggest that these lipid markers may serve as potential indicators for identifying subjects at risk of developing MetS.

Here, we evaluate the prospect of using climate velocities (CV) of the metabolic index (Φ) for assessing changes in habitat in the South East Pacific. Our approach is based on a species with mean ecophysiotype (i.e. model species) and the use of a global Earth System Model simulation (CESM-LE) under RCP 8.5 scenario. The SEP is chosen as a case study as it hosts an Oxygen Minimum Zone and seamounts systems sustaining local communities through artisanal fisheries. Our results indicate that CVΦ pattern is mainly constrained by the oxygen distribution and that its sign is affected by contrasting oxygen trends (including a re-oxygenation in the upper OMZ) and warming. We further show that CVΦ is weakly dependent on physiological traits composing Φ, which conveys to this metrics some value for inferring the projected mean displacement and potential changes in viability of metabolic habitat in a region where physiological data are scarce. Based on sensitivity experiments to physiological traits and natural variability, we propose a general method for inferring broad areas of climate change exposure regardless of species-specific Φ. We show in particular that for the model used here, the upper OMZ region can be considered a “safe” area for the species with ecophysiotype close to that of 71 species used to derive the model species. Limitations of the approach and perspectives of this work are also discussed.",We would like to thank Dr. K. von Schuckmann for early discussion on the results. We warmly thank Pr.

In this sense, the present study aimed to examine the association between love, jealousy, satisfaction, and violence in young couples through network analysis. A total of 834 young people and adults between 18 and 38 years of age (Mean = 20.97, SD = 2.39) participated; 646 women (77.50%) and 188 men (22.50%), who completed the Sternberg's love scale (STLS-R), Brief Jealousy Scale (BJS), Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS) and Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST-2). A partial unregularized network was estimated using the ggmModSelect function. The Bridge Strength index was calculated because the aim was to identify the bridge nodes between the variables under study. The results reveal that two nodes of the love variable, Commitment, and Intimacy, had a direct and moderate relationship with the Satisfaction node. The latter is the central node in the network. However, in the male group, the most intense associations are in Satisfaction-Intimacy, Violence-Passion, Jealousy-Commitment.

This article explains the co-production process of integrating Venezuelan migrants and refugees into the host society under decent work conditions. This is a qualitative, cross-sectional explanatory case study covering the second half of 2022. It shows that within the co-production effort, civil society organisations entail a role in creating collective mechanisms and spaces to enable communication and information, helping to identify existing problems and vulnerabilities, and finding alternatives to mitigate them. Additionally, in the process of integrating migrants' human capital under the decent work condition there is the relevance of migrant-based civil society organisations, due to the fact that they can enhance trust and the quality of the interaction and dialogue with the beneficiary public, identify their specific needs and potential solutions and, therefore, increase the quality and efficiency of the services provided.",,"This work was financially supported by the Universidad de Lima (Peru) through the Instituto de Investigación Científica research grant number PI.52.001.2022.

TransMiCable is the first cable car in Bogotá, Colombia, and the wider intervention includes renovated parks and playgrounds. We assessed the effects of TransMiCable and the wider intervention on physical activity.
METHODS: The Urban Transformations and Health natural experiment was a prospective quasi-experimental study conducted from Feb 1, 2018, to Dec 18, 2018 (baseline, pre-intervention) and from July 2, 2019, to March 15, 2020 (post-intervention follow-up) in the TransMiCable intervention area (Ciudad Bolívar settlement) and a control area without TransMiCable (San Cristóbal settlement). A multistage strategy was used to sample households in each area, with one adult (aged ≥18 years) per household invited to participate. Eligible participants had lived in the intervention or control areas for at least 2 years and were not planning to move within the next 2 years. Physical activity was assessed among participants in the intervention and control areas before and after the inauguration of TransMiCable in Ciudad Bolívar with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long form) and with wearable accelerometers. Complete cases (those with baseline and follow-up data) were included in analyses. Respondents were classed as being physically active if they met 2020 WHO guidelines (≥150 min per week of moderate activity, ≥75 min per week of vigorous activity, or equivalent combinations); and accelerometery data were classified with the Freedson cut-points for adults. Data were also gathered in zonal parks (area ≥10 000 m2) and neighbourhood parks (area <10 000 m2) in the intervention and control areas by direct observation with the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities, to assess levels of physical activity before and after the TransMiCable intervention. Multilevel regression models were used to assess changes in physical activity associated with the TransMiCable intervention.
FINDINGS: Physical activity questionnaires were completed by 2052 adult participants (1289 [62·8%] women and 763 [37·2%] men; mean age 43·5 years [SD 17·7]) before the inauguration of TransMiCable. After the inauguration, the follow-up (final) questionnaire sample comprised 825 adults in the intervention group and 854 in the control group, including 357 adults in the intervention group and 334 in the control group with valid accelerometery data. 334 (40·5%) of 825 participants in the intervention group reported levels of physical activity that met the 2020 WHO guidelines during walking for transport before the intervention, and 426 (51·6%) afterwards (change 11·1 percentage points [95% CI 6·4 to 15·9]). A similar change was observed in the control group (change 8·0 percentage points [3·4 to 12·5]; adjusted odds ratio [OR] for the time-by-group interaction, intervention vs control group: 1·1 [95% CI 0·8 to 1·5], p=0·38). Time spent doing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, measured with accelerometers, did not change in the intervention group after the inauguration of TransMiCable (change -0·8 min per day [-4·6 to 3·0]) and did not change compared with the control group (adjusted β for the time-by-group interaction: 1·4 min per day [95% CI -2·0 to 4·9], p=0·41). Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 52·1 min per day (SD 24·7) before and 59·4 min per day (35·2) after the inauguration of TransMiCable in new regular users who reported using TransMiCable during mandatory trips for work or education (n=32; change 7·3 min per day [-22·5 to 7·9]). After the intervention, an increase in the proportion of male individuals engaging in moderate or vigorous physical activity was observed in a renovated zonal park (adjusted OR for the time-by-group interaction, intervention vs control park: 2·7 [1·1 to 6·8], p=0·033). Female users of a renovated neighbourhood park were less likely to become engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity than female users of the control area neighbourhood park (adjusted OR for the time-by-group interaction: 0·4 [0·1 to 0·6], p=0·019).
INTERPRETATION: It is encouraging that walking for transport remained high in the TransMiCable intervention area when the use of private motorised transport had increased elsewhere in Bogotá. In low-income urban areas, where transport-related walking is a necessity, transport interventions should be focused on efforts to maintain participation in active travel while improving conditions under which it occurs.

Thus, our study aimed to assess the factors associated with not receiving the primary series and booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine among Venezuelan migrants in Peru.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data analysis of the 2022 Venezuelan Population Residing in Peru Survey. Our population included Venezuelan migrants and refugees over 18 years old living in Peru with complete information for the variables of interest. Two outcome variables were assessed: not receiving the primary series and not receiving the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Crude and adjusted prevalences were calculated with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 7,727 Venezuelan adults were included in our study, of whom 6,511 completed the primary series. The overall COVID-19 vaccination coverage of the primary series was 84.17%, whilst the coverage of the booster dose was 28.06%. Being younger, uninsured, illegally-staying, and having a low educational level were associated with both outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Several sociodemographic and migration-related variables were associated with both outcomes. Governmental policies prioritizing vaccination among Venezuelan migrants are needed to ensure broad coverage in this vulnerable group.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

This study aimed to develop and validate a tool for identifying PIMs in older adults within the primary care setting. The tool is composed of a list of criteria and was created based on consensus among experts from three Spanish-speaking countries, including two from Latin America.MethodsA literature review was conducted to identify existing tools, and prescription patterns were evaluated in a cohort of 36,111 older adults. An electronic Delphi method, consisting of two rounds, was used to reach a formal expert consensus. The panel included 18 experts from Spain, Colombia, and Argentina. The content validity index, validity of each content item, and Kappa Fleiss statistical measure were used to establish reliability.ResultsRound one did not yield a consensus, but a definitive consensus was reached in round two. The resulting tool consisted of a list of 5 general recommendations per disease, along with 33 criteria related to potential problems, recommendations, and alternative therapeutic options. The overall content validity of the tool was 0.87, with a Kappa value of 0.69 (95% CI 0.64—0.73; Substantial).ConclusionsThe developed criteria provide a novel list that allows for a comprehensive approach to pharmacotherapy in older adults, intending to reduce inappropriate medication use, ineffective treatments, prophylactic therapies, and treatments with an unfavorable risk–benefit ratio for the given condition. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of these criteria on health outcomes.","We would like to thank Paulo Cesar Sepulveda and Andres Beltran for supporting the translation.

Design: Federated pharmacoepidemiological evaluation in LEGEND-T2DM.
Setting: 10 US and seven non-US electronic health record and administrative claims databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network in eight countries from 2011 to the end of 2021.
Participants: 4.8 million patients (≥18 years) across US and non-US based databases with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received metformin monotherapy and had initiated second line treatments.
Exposure: The exposure used to evaluate each database was calendar year trends, with the years in the study that were specific to each cohort.
Main outcomes measures: The outcome was the incidence of second line antihyperglycaemic drug use (ie, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sulfonylureas) among individuals who were already receiving treatment with metformin. The relative drug class level uptake across cardiovascular risk groups was also evaluated.
Results: 4.6 million patients were identified in US databases, 61 382 from Spain, 32 442 from Germany, 25 173 from the UK, 13 270 from France, 5580 from Scotland, 4614 from Hong Kong, and 2322 from Australia. During 2011-21, the combined proportional initiation of the cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) increased across all data sources, with the combined initiation of these drugs as second line drugs in 2021 ranging from 35.2% to 68.2% in the US databases, 15.4% in France, 34.7% in Spain, 50.1% in Germany, and 54.8% in Scotland. From 2016 to 2021, in some US and non-US databases, uptake of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors increased more significantly among populations with no cardiovascular disease compared with patients with established cardiovascular disease. No data source provided evidence of a greater increase in the uptake of these two drug classes in populations with cardiovascular disease compared with no cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions: Despite the increase in overall uptake of cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs as second line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus, their uptake was lower in patients with cardiovascular disease than in people with no cardiovascular disease over the past decade. A strategy is needed to ensure that medication use is concordant with guideline recommendations to improve outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",,,BMJ Medicine,,,,2023-10-06,2023,2023-10-06,2023-10,2,1,e000651,All OA;

The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiological profile of the population affiliated to the SS in Colombia and to compare the main epidemiological features of the SS to the CS.MethodsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology, the search was carried out from 1993, with no other restriction. The information was synthesized into five categories according to the most important risk populations. We estimated combined incidences from epidemiological surveillance data, prevalence ratio, and other measures to estimate the difference between the studied groups. A 95% confidence interval was considered. A random effects model was used weighted by the inverse of the variance of the cumulative incidence calculated for each disease. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal tools.ResultsA total of 16,236 articles were identified; 14,972 were excluded after title and abstract screening, 725 articles were verified as full text, and finally 268 articles were included. The relative risk of non-communicable and communicable diseases was lower in the SS than in the CS (RR: 0.37 and 0.72, respectively, p-value < 0.05). However, the risk of presenting obstetric and maternal conditions in the SS versus the CS was RR 1.55 for frequent conditions during early childhood, and for other diseases it was RR 1.28 with a p-value of < 0.05. The use of health services was different by scheme, with less demand, access, and provision being found in health services in the SS.ConclusionsThis study allowed us to conclude that there are differences in the incidence, prevalence, and use of health services between health affiliation schemes (SS and CS) in Colombia, thereby assisting in decision-making for stakeholders.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration number CRD42021279234.",Not applicable.,"This study is funded by the Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público of Colombia and the Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud, through inter-administrative agreement No. 7008-2021.",International Journal for Equity in Health,,,"Female; Pregnancy; Humans; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Insurance, Health; Risk Factors; Incidence; Prevalence",2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,,22,1,28,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mora-Moreo, Laura; Estrada-Orozco, Kelly; Espinosa, Oscar; Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa","Mora-Moreo, Laura (Epidemiology, Evidence Synthesis and Technology Management, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, Colombia; Department of Health Services Research and Policy, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, England); Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; Health Technologies and Policies Assessment Group, Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogotá, Colombia; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Facultad de Medicina, Fundación Universitaria Sanitas, Bogotá, Colombia); Espinosa, Oscar (Directorate of Analytical, Economic and Actuarial Studies at Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; Economic Models and Quantitative Methods Research Group, Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia); Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa (Directorate of Qualitative Methods and Social Research, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Sanitas)","Mora-Moreo, Laura (Epidemiology, Evidence Synthesis and Technology Management, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, Colombia; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine); Estrada-Orozco, Kelly (Directorate of Evidence Synthesis and Management of Health Technologies, Institutode Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Sanitas); Espinosa, Oscar (Directorate of Analytical, Economic and Actuarial Studies at Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia; National University of Colombia); Melgarejo, Lorena Mesa (Directorate of Qualitative Methods and Social Research, Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud (IETS), Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)",6,6,,,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12939-022-01818-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155161601,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Inclusion of migrants in COVID-19 vaccination is not only ethically necessary from a right-to-health perspective but also technically indispensable for disease control. This study aimed to characterize the inclusion of international migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in COVID-19 vaccination policies in Latin American countries that have the greatest recent increase in the reception of migrants. We conducted a content analysis of public policy documents issued between March 11, 2020, and June 30, 2022 by the Ministries of Health of seven countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. Documents were located through Ministries of Health web pages, references in scientific literature, and the Pan American Health Organization's Information Platform on Health and Migration in the Americas. A content analysis was performed of the documents that were located, along six dimensions: migrants' right to vaccination, temporality of vaccination, administrative discretion, policies to facilitate access, language or cultural considerations, and normative, ethical or technical justifications provided. Eighty-six public policy documents were reviewed. Their contents showed that none of the countries explicitly excluded migrants from vaccination, nor did they explicitly define restrictions on this population. One barrier that was detected was to require identity documents in order to be vaccinated or to receive a vaccination certificate, which could be difficult for migrants to obtain. Few countries defined actions to facilitate or promote the vaccination of migrants. The documents that mentioned justifications for vaccinating migrants presented reasons that were mainly based on the recognition of the right to health, the principle of non-discrimination and equity. The countries studied generally had inclusive policies but were limited in terms of dealing with potential barriers to access. The lack of mechanisms to guarantee the right to health is a limitation that countries in the region should address.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Julián A.

Study design: Ecological study.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional ecological study based on secondary data analysis. Coverages of the first, second, and third doses of the vaccine against COVID-19 and the HDI were evaluated. The magnitude of the correlations was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with their corresponding bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Scatter plots were also constructed.
Results: A total of 196 provinces were included. There was a moderate correlation between the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and the HDI (r = 0.3807 [95% CI 0.2585-0.5030], p < 0.0001). The same direction was found for the second (r = 0.4064 [95% CI 0.2853-0.5276], p < 0.0001) and third dose (r = 0.4435 [95% CI 0.3201-0.5669], p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: A positive correlation was found between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the HDI, suggesting the presence of inequalities in access to vaccines. Individualised strategies are needed in lower HDI regions to tackle inequalities.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1284,pub.1154616401,10.3390/su15021740,,,A Review of Offshore Renewable Energy in South America: Current Status and Future Perspectives,"This paper addresses the current status and future research and development perspectives associated with technologies to harness offshore renewable energy, including offshore wind, waves, tides, ocean currents, and thermal and salinity gradient, in South America (SA). It focuses on five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay. At first, a comprehensive survey presents the number of scientific papers classified based on the resource to show the tendency and importance of such subjects in the academic community. Each country’s electricity matrix and grid connection are shown to understand the region’s renewable source participation situation. The potential of offshore renewable resources is addressed by considering the published technical papers in scientific journals. The main conflicts and synergies associated with ocean space utilization are presented by considering the exclusive economic zone of each country. The status of the regulatory frameworks to promote and development of offshore renewable energies is presented. Two sections are dedicated to presenting the active, decommissioned and planned projects, research groups and laboratory infrastructures to develop the technologies. The last section discusses the future perspectives on the development of this sector in SA. It is observed that SA, with more than 25,000 km of coastline, has a great potential for offshore renewable energy; however, so far, these resources have not been explored commercially. Larger investment in the sector, establishing an adequate legal framework and deploying full-scale demonstration projects at sea are necessary for the commercialization of such technologies in SA.","The authors acknowledge the support of the thematic network REMAR (Opportunities of integration in Ibero-American Electric Grids of the Marine Energies) from the Ibero-American Program of Science and Technology for the Development (CYTED).

Scleractinian corals are an example of this – they are key species in both shallow and deep ecosystems. However, what evolutionary processes resulted in current depth distribution of the marine fauna is a long-standing question. Various conflicting hypotheses have been proposed, but few formal tests have been conducted. Here, we use global spatial distribution data to test the bathymetric origin and colonization trends across the depth gradient in scleractinian corals. Using a phylogenetic approach, we infer the origin and historical trends in directionality and speed of colonization during the diversification in depth. We also examine how the emergence of photo-symbiosis and coloniality, scleractinian corals’ most conspicuous phenotypic innovations, have influenced this process. Our results strongly support an offshore-onshore pattern of evolution and varying dispersion capacities along depth associated with trait-defined lineages. These results highlight the relevance of the evolutionary processes occurring at different depths to explain the origin of extant marine biodiversity and the consequences of altering these processes by human impact, highlighting the need to include this overlooked evolutionary history in conservation plans.","This work was funded by the ANID doctoral fellowship 21170577 (ANC).

For this reason, this study summarizes the results of investigating the accessibility of services and recreational spaces under the parameters of a “15-minute city” for the elderly people in the city of Santiago de Chile. The investigation employed a multivariate geostatistical analysis with a quantitative approach and was developed on a census block scale to test some of the principles of the 15-min city along with the principles on active aging of the elderly. The results are surprising, show a good territorial coverage for the study area and open the possibility of Santiago becoming a 15-min city for older adults.

This article presents the first report of a cohort of Venezuelan migrant women entering Colombia through Cúcuta and its metropolitan area. The study aimed to describe the health status and access to healthcare services among Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia with irregular migration status, and to analyze changes in those conditions at a one-month follow-up.
METHODS: We carried out a longitudinal cohort study of Venezuelan migrant women, 18 to 45 years, who entered Colombia with an irregular migration status. Study participants were recruited in Cúcuta and its metropolitan area. At baseline, we administered a structured questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, migration history, health history, access to health services, sexual and reproductive health, practice of early detection of cervical cancer and breast cancer, food insecurity, and depressive symptoms. The women were again contacted by phone one month later, between March and July 2021, and a second questionnaire was applied.
RESULTS: A total of 2,298 women were included in the baseline measurement and 56.4% could be contacted again at the one-month follow-up. At the baseline, 23.0% of the participants reported a self-perceived health problem or condition in the past month and 29.5% in the past 6 months, and 14.5% evaluated their health as fair or poor. A significant increase was found in the percentage of women who reported a self-perceived health problem during the past month (from 23.1% to 31.4%; p<0.01); as well as in the share who reported moderate, severe, or extreme difficulty working or performing daily chores (from 5.5% to 11.0%; p = 0.03) and who rated their health as fair (from 13.0% to 31.2%; p<0.01). Meanwhile, the percentage of women with depressive symptoms decreased from 80.5% to 71.2% (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: This report presents initial information on the health status of Venezuelan migrant women in Colombia, and is a starting point for further longer longitudinal follow-ups to assess changes over time in health conditions.","We thank the health authorities of Cúcuta and Villa del Rosario, the local migrant organizations, and all the women who participated in this study.","This study was possible thanks to the generous support of the people of the United States through the Community Stabilization Activities (CSA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which funded this survey (https://www.usaid.gov/colombia).

Evidence from longitudinal neuroimaging suggest trajectories of white matter microstructure maturation are atypical in PAE. We aimed to further characterize longitudinal trajectories of developmental white matter microstructure change in children and adolescents with PAE compared to typically-developing Controls using diffusion-weighted Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI).
Materials and methods: Participants: Youth with PAE (n = 34) and typically-developing Controls (n = 31) ages 8-17 years at enrollment. Participants underwent formal evaluation of growth and facial dysmorphology. Participants also completed two study visits (17 months apart on average), both of which involved cognitive testing and an MRI scan (data collected on a Siemens Prisma 3 T scanner). Age-related changes in the orientation dispersion index (ODI) and the neurite density index (NDI) were examined across five corpus callosum (CC) regions defined by tractography.
Results: While linear trajectories suggested similar overall microstructural integrity in PAE and Controls, analyses of symmetrized percent change (SPC) indicated group differences in the timing and magnitude of age-related increases in ODI (indexing the bending and fanning of axons) in the central region of the CC, with PAE participants demonstrating atypically steep increases in dispersion with age compared to Controls. Participants with PAE also demonstrated greater increases in ODI in the mid posterior CC (trend-level group difference). In addition, SPC in ODI and NDI was differentially correlated with executive function performance for PAE participants and Controls, suggesting an atypical relationship between white matter microstructure maturation and cognitive function in PAE.
Discussion: Preliminary findings suggest subtle atypicality in the timing and magnitude of age-related white matter microstructure maturation in PAE compared to typically-developing Controls. These findings add to the existing literature on neurodevelopmental trajectories in PAE and suggest that advanced biophysical diffusion modeling (NODDI) may be sensitive to biologically-meaningful microstructural changes in the CC that are disrupted by PAE. Findings of atypical brain maturation-behavior relationships in PAE highlight the need for further study. Further longitudinal research aimed at characterizing white matter neurodevelopmental trajectories in PAE will be important.","All or part of this work was done in conjunction with the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), which is funded by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).

They can be unidimensional and multidimensional. This study provides a systematic literature review of EP in order to know the main definitions, metrics, indicators, constraints, advantages and disadvantages of the multidimensional approach. A methodology consisting of a succession of well-defined steps was presented where research questions were posed and answered through the identification, selection, data extraction and classification of bibliographic documents in a systematized manner that addressed Multidimensional EP in the period 2005-2023. The main findings indicate that in the world, studies on EP are concentrated to a major extent in Europe, as is collaboration in scientific writing. However, in recent years, studies on EP and its applications have been identified in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially with a multidimensional approach. Thus, both the conceptualizations and metrics of Multidimensional EP are diverse, heterogeneous and with a notable lack of consensus on them.",,,Revista INVI,,,,2023-11-16,2023,2023-11-16,,38,109,172-208,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fernández, Karen; Lezcano, Laine; González, Arturo","Fernández, Karen (Universidad Nacional de Asunción); Lezcano, Laine (Universidad Nacional de Asunción); González, Arturo (Universidad Nacional de Asunción)",,"Fernández, Karen (Universidad Nacional de Asunción); Lezcano, Laine (Universidad Nacional de Asunción); González, Arturo (Universidad Nacional de Asunción)",1,1,,,https://revistainvi.uchile.cl/index.php/INVI/article/download/70574/74691,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166068427,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Here we investigated the motives that underlie support for COVID-19 preventive behaviours in a sample of 12,758 individuals from 34 countries. We hypothesized that the associations of empathic prosocial concern and fear of disease with support towards preventive COVID-19 behaviours would be moderated by trust in the government. Results suggest that the association between fear of disease and support for COVID-19 preventive behaviours was strongest when trust in the government was weak (both at individual- and country-level). Conversely, the association with empathic prosocial concern was strongest when trust in the government was high, but this moderation was only found at individual-level scores of governmental trust. We discuss how motivations may be shaped by socio-cultural context, and outline how findings may contribute to a better understanding of collective action during global crises.","We would like to thank Valentina Romo, Jallene Jia En Chua, Melis Yetkin, Emren Burak Ömür, Miguel Landa Blanco, Christine Kraus, Raymond Langley, Youmna Haddad, Abida Sultana, Sadiya Alam Surma, Nishat Tamanna Omi, Asmaul Husna Chara, Monir Hossen, Mohima Akter, Nargees Akter, Khondoker Shahriar Islam, Md Johirul Islam, Joti Saha, Sk.Sabbir Islam Mahi, Tayeba Sultana Sonia, Md.

Methods: Qualitative study of 20 semi-structured interviews with women from Venezuela who are residents of Barranquilla and who carry out leadership activities in communities or who participate in or benefit from those activities. The interviews included opinions and experiences related to access to VIP, and to SRH in general, as well as suggestions for improving access for migrant women. The relationship between access to these services and the migration process was explored, as well as the role of social organizations.
Results: A lack of information on SRH-related rights was identified as the main access barrier to VIP. Other identified barriers were: attitude towards VIP, excessive steps involved in accessing medical care, difficulties in admission to the social security system, lack of training and care in SRH, and xenophobia in hospitals. The interviewees said they did not understand the legal framework in Colombia and did not know the channels for safe abortion care.
Conclusions: Despite the efforts of institutions and international cooperation, Venezuelan migrant women in Barranquilla are in a situation of vulnerability due to their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health, including voluntary interruption of pregnancy. Implementing strategies for comprehensive care for migrants will improve current health conditions and the effective enjoyment of SRH-related rights.",,"Este trabajo recibió financiamiento del Programa Especial de Investigación, Desarrollo y Capacitación para la Investigación en Reproducción Humana del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD, por su sigla en inglés), el Fondo de Población de las Naciones (UNFPA, por su sigla en inglés), el Fondo para la Infancia de las Naciones Unidas ((UNICEF), la Organización Mundial de la Salud (/OMS) y el Banco Mundial, y por el Programa Especial de Investigación y Capacitación en Enfermedades Tropicales de UNICEF-PNUD-Banco Mundial-OMS, ambos programas copatrocinados por la OMS.",BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2023-03-03,2023,2023-03-03,2023-03-03,47,,e49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Quintero, Luz Dary; Osorio, Habid Osorio; Bojorquez-Chapela, Ietza; Isaza, Laura; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo","Quintero, Luz Dary (Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Colombia, Departamento de Salud Pública.

The molecular mechanisms underlying FASD are incompletely characterized. Alternative splicing, including the insertion of microexons (exons of less than 30 nucleotides in length), is highly prevalent in the nervous system. However, whether ethanol exposure can have acute or chronic deleterious effects in this process is poorly understood. In this work, we used the bioinformatic tools VAST-TOOLS, rMATS, MAJIQ, and MicroExonator to predict alternative splicing events affected by ethanol from available RNA sequencing data. Experimental protocols of ethanol exposure included human cortical tissue development, human embryoid body differentiation, and mouse development. We found common genes with predicted differential alternative splicing using distinct bioinformatic tools in different experimental designs. Notably, Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis revealed that the alternative splicing of genes related to RNA processing and protein synthesis was commonly affected in the different ethanol exposure schemes. In addition, the inclusion of microexons was also affected by ethanol. This bioinformatic analysis provides a reliable list of candidate genes whose splicing is affected by ethanol during nervous system development. Furthermore, our results suggest that ethanol particularly modifies the alternative splicing of genes related to post-transcriptional regulation, which probably affects neuronal proteome complexity and brain function.",We thank Dr. Guillermo Parada and Dr. Manuel Irimia for critical discussions of the project.,"ANID Doctoral Fellowship number 21200775 (CFB) Fondo Postdoctorado Universidad Católica del Norte Nº 0003 (MOC) Grant FONDECYT 1191152 (MEA) PEW Biomed Innovation-2021-A-18047 (PH) Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) – Millennium Science Initiative Program NCN19_168, Grant FONDECYT 1231357, Fondequip EQM160063 (GR) Grant FONDECYT 1231685 (CO) UNAB DI-03-22/REG (FF).

To test this hypothesis, we explored the linkage between local scale extreme low pH events, genetic diversity, and variation in fecundity-related traits (body size, egg size, and egg production rate) in the broad-dispersal copepod Acartia tonsa. We assessed genetic and phenotypic characteristics of populations by contrasting extreme low pH environments (upwelling and temperate estuary) in the coastal Southeast Pacific, under natural and experimental conditions. These populations showed significant genetic differentiation with higher diversity in mitochondrial and nuclear loci (encoding mtCOI and 18S rRNA) in the estuarine population. Copepods from this population are exposed to more frequent extreme low pH events (< 7.7), and the adult females exhibit consistent phenotypic variation in body size, egg size, and egg production rate across different cohorts. Experimental acclimation to extreme low pH conditions revealed no significant differences in fecundity-related traits between A. tonsa populations. Although these results partially support our hypothesis, the experimental findings suggest other drivers might also influence phenotypic differences in the local environments.","We would like to thank Mr. Mauricio Vegas, Mr. Miguel Barrientos, Mr. Jose Martel, and Mr. Boris Aqueveque for their help during ﬁeld surveys and experiments.

A better understanding of the vaccine immune response may help to define vaccination strategies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objective: To investigate the long-term immunological response to CoronaVac vaccine and determinants of breakthrough COVID-19 infection.
Methods: A long-term, prospective cohort study involving vaccinated adult and elderly subjects was conducted to investigate the presence of anti-RBD-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric protein IgG. Antibody level dynamics and risk factors associated with breakthrough COVID-19 infection were investigated.
Results: In total, 3902 participants were included in this study. Vaccination with two doses of CoronaVac and a booster dose increased the levels of anti-RBD-specific IgG, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric IgG significantly. In adults, anti-nucleocapsid IgG and anti-spike trimeric IgG levels decreased significantly 7 months after the second dose. In adults and the elderly, the levels of anti-spike trimeric IgG and anti-RBD IgG decreased significantly 4 and 6 months after the booster dose, respectively. Previous exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-spike trimeric IgG titres was independently associated with a lower probability of post-vaccination infection.
Conclusions: A significant increase in antibody levels was found after two doses of CoronaVac and a booster dose. Antibody titres declined significantly 7 months post-vaccination in participants who did not receive a booster dose. Higher levels of antibodies and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with protection against breakthrough COVID-19.","Conflict of interest statement MCB, GJV, NNF, PMMG, GRM, BALF and RTC received research support from Instituto Butantan during the conduct of this study.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the progression of immunity (natural and acquired by vaccine) in a cohort from two Chilean cities.
METHODS: Individuals (n = 386) who participated in three phases of population-based serial prevalence studies were included (2020-2021 and 2022). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was measured in serum. Data including time of vaccination and type of vaccine received were analysed with descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 3.6% in the first round and increased to 96.9% in the second and 98.7% in the third. In the third round, 75% of individuals who had received the basal full scheme were seropositive at 180 days or more since their last dose; 98% of individuals who received one booster dose were seropositive at 180 days or more, and 100% participants who received two boosters were seropositive, regardless of time since their last dose. Participants receiving mRNA vaccines had higher seroprevalence rates over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The high vaccination coverage in Chile enabled the population to maintain high levels of antibodies. Vaccination boosters are essential to maintain immunity over time, which also depends on the type of vaccine administered.",The authors acknowledge the WHO for donating the tests to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies used in the second round.,"This research was funded by the Chilean National Research Agency, Grants code COVID-19-0589, FONIS SA21I0009 and FONDECYT 1201240.

This study explores the genomic intricacies of re-emergent A. salmonicida outbreaks in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Previous clinical cases have exhibited pathological characteristics, such as periorbital hemorrhages and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Genomic sequencing of three Chilean isolates (ASA04, ASA05, and CIBA_5017) and 25 previously described genomes determined the pan-genome, phylogenomics, insertion sequences, and restriction-modification systems. Unique gene families have contributed to an improved understanding of the psychrophilic and mesophilic clades, while phylogenomic analysis has been used to identify mesophilic and psychrophilic strains, thereby further differentiating between typical and atypical psychrophilic isolates. Diverse insertion sequences and restriction-modification patterns have highlighted genomic structural differences, and virulence factor predictions can emphasize exotoxin disparities, especially between psychrophilic and mesophilic strains. Thus, a novel plasmid was characterized which emphasized the role of plasmids in virulence and antibiotic resistance. The analysis of antibiotic resistance factors revealed resistance against various drug classes in Chilean strains. Overall, this study elucidates the genomic dynamics of re-emergent A. salmonicida and provides novel insights into their virulence, antibiotic resistance, and population structure.",FONDECYT DE INICIACION N° 11230401 (to J.P.P.).,"This research was funded by Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Aplicadas, grant number: clinical_genomic_Bacteria_100.",Microorganisms,,"Hirokazu Kimura, Denis Roy",,2023-12-29,2023,2023-12-29,,12,1,64,All OA;

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors in South American children (0-21 years) and identify knowledge gaps.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature via Virtual Health Library from 2000-2021 in any language. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted all data.
RESULTS: 179 studies of 2,181 screened were included representing 10 countries (n = 2,975,261). 12.2% of South American children experienced obesity, 21.9% elevated waist circumference, 3.0% elevated fasting glucose, 18.1% high triglycerides, 29.6% low HDL cholesterol, and 8.6% high blood pressure. Cardiometabolic risk factor definitions varied widely. Chile exhibited the highest prevalence of obesity/overweight, low HDL, and impaired fasting glucose. Ecuador exhibited the highest prevalence of elevated blood pressure. Rural setting (vs. urban or mixed) and indigenous origin protected against most cardiometabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: South American children experience high rates of obesity, overweight, and dyslipidemia. International consensus on cardiometabolic risk factor definitions for children will lead to improved diagnosis of cardiometabolic risk factors in this population, and future research should ensure inclusion of unreported countries and increased representation of indigenous populations.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Patricia Khashayar,Adult; Humans; Child; Overweight; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Risk Factors; Body Mass Index; Blood Glucose; Obesity; Hypertension; Waist Circumference; Dyslipidemias; Chile; Cardiovascular Diseases,2023-11-22,2023,2023-11-22,,18,11,e0293865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Singleton, Carolyn M.

This center is known for its privileged location, saving up to 30% of fuel in launches. Its operationalization is an offshoot of the Technological Safeguards Agreement, which is important for the Brazilian Space Program due to greater space sector investments and environmentally relevant projects. In 2003, a major fire at the Alcântara Space Center destroyed a rocket and killed 21 workers, halting Brazilian Space Program activities. Recently, our research group reported serious environmental consequences of this accident, i.e., extremely high amounts of Rubidium (Rb) in apex predatory sharks near the Alcântara Space Center. This element is used in fuels and in space propulsion systems and is potentially toxic, displaying bioaccumulating and biomagnifying capabilities. The observed concentrations are the highest ever detected in any living organism (up to 24.65 mg kg-1 dry weight). The launch base is located on the Brazilian Amazon Coast, and population recruitment impacts may compromise biota conservation and biodiversity. Local shark meat consumption is also worrying, as consumers may be exposed to Rb, whose effects in humans are unknown. We, therefore, indicate an urgent need for biomonitoring efforts in the area, as the Alcântara Space Center is about to operate at its maximum capacity.","Financial support to NW and JN through the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Maranhão (FAPEMA - BEPP-02106/18; BPD-04215/17; AQUIPESCA-06605/16) and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) through a Post-doctoral Fellowship.

Near-infrared photometry was obtained at the Cerro Armazones Observatory, and parallaxes were taken from the Gaia Early Data Release 3. Relations were determined for the 2MASS JHK s bands and the W JK Wesenheit index. We compare our results with other calibrations available in the literature and obtain very good agreement with the photometry of RR Lyraes from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) anchored using the distance to the Cloud, which is based on detached eclipsing binaries. We find that the dependence of absolute magnitudes on metallicity of 0.070 ± 0.042 (J band) to 0.087 ± 0.031 (W JK index) mag dex−1 for the population of fundamental pulsators (RRab) is in agreement with previously published phenomenological works. We perform a refined determination of distance to the LMC based on our new calibration and photometry from Szewczyk et al. We study the dependence of the fitted parameters of the fiducial relations and the LMC distance on the systematic parallax offset.","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement Nos. 695099 and 951549).

This paper presents a model for simulating the game of interests behind this cause in order to investigate ways of promoting the practice of open access. The model represents the following actors: Academics, Administrators, Funders, Publishers and Politicians. Five scenarios were developed to represent both realistic and ideal, interesting, situations. The model was developed using the SocLab platform—a formalization of the sociology of organizational action. It is based on previous descriptions of the game and expert knowledge. A structural analysis permits us to examine the properties of the sub-model behind each scenario. The results corroborate certain intuitions about the scenarios representing realistic cases, e.g., they indicate that publishers, being isolated in their interests, are subject to strong pressures from other actors, who have a circumstantial alliance. Administrators take an intermediate stance in all scenarios. The best scenarios for open access are those in which Politicians and Funders clearly support the cause by expressing mandates in that direction, backing academics. Surprisingly, the model shows that it is in the Publishers’ interest not to take an extremist position against open access.",,This research received no external funding.,Publications,,,,2023-08-04,2023,2023-08-04,,11,3,40,All OA; Gold,Article,"Terán, Oswaldo; Dávila, Jacinto","Terán, Oswaldo (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile;, oswaldo.teran@ucn.cl; Centro de Simulación y Modelos (CESIMO), Universidad de Los Andes, Mérida 5101, Venezuela); Dávila, Jacinto (Centro de Simulación y Modelos (CESIMO), Universidad de Los Andes, Mérida 5101, Venezuela)","Dávila, Jacinto (University of the Andes)","Terán, Oswaldo (Catholic University of the North; University of the Andes); Dávila, Jacinto (University of the Andes)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/11/3/40/pdf?version=1691128764,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163051241,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The advent of machine learning offers a promising avenue for predicting the survival of at-risk neonates. Further research is required to effectively deploy this approach within distinct clinical contexts. Objective: This study aimed to assess the applicability of machine learning models in predicting neonatal mortality, drawing from maternal and clinical characteristics of pregnant women within an intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods: Conducted as an observational cross-sectional study, the research enrolled pregnant women receiving care in a level III national hospital's ICU in Peru. Detailed data encompassing maternal diagnosis, maternal characteristics, obstetric characteristics, and newborn outcomes (survival or demise) were meticulously collected. Employing machine learning, predictive models were developed for neonatal mortality. Estimations of beta coefficients in the training dataset informed the model application to the validation dataset.
Results: A cohort of 280 pregnant women in the ICU were included in this study. The Gradient Boosting approach was selected following rigorous experimentation with diverse model types due to its superior F1-score, ROC curve performance, computational efficiency, and learning rate. The final model incorporated variables deemed pertinent to its efficacy, including gestational age, eclampsia, kidney infection, maternal age, previous placenta complications accompanied by hemorrhage, severe preeclampsia, number of prenatal checkups, and history of miscarriages. By incorporating optimized hyperparameter values, the model exhibited an impressive area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.95-1), along with a sensitivity of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.94-1) and specificity of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.93-1).
Conclusion: The findings underscore the utility of machine learning models, specifically Gradient Boosting, in foreseeing neonatal mortality among pregnant women admitted to the ICU, even when confronted with maternal morbidities. This insight can enhance clinical decision-making and ultimately reduce neonatal mortality rates.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2023-10-05,2023,2023-10-05,2023-10,9,10,e20693,All OA; Gold,Article,"Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos; Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia; Campaña-Acuña, Andres; Caballero-Alvarado, José","Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru; Centro de Innovación e Investigación Traslacional en Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru); Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Centro de Innovación e Investigación Traslacional en Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru); Campaña-Acuña, Andres (Centro de Innovación e Investigación Traslacional en Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru; Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal, Peru); Caballero-Alvarado, José (Hospital Regional Docente de Trujillo, Peru)","Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Private University of the North; Private University of the North)","Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Private University of the North; Private University of the North); Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Private University of the North); Campaña-Acuña, Andres (Private University of the North; Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal); Caballero-Alvarado, José (Hospital Regional Docente de Trujillo, Peru)",0,0,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S240584402307901X/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164723554,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

Therefore, early identification of arrival sites of AMD and its epibionts is crucial for the prioritization of preventive measures. As accumulation patterns along global coastlines are largely unstudied, we tested if existing oceanographic models and knowledge about upstream sources of litter and epibionts can be used as a simple and cost-efficient approach for predicting probable arrival sites of AMD-rafting biota in coastal zones.
Methods: Using the Southeast Pacific as a model system, we studied daily accumulation rates, composition, and minimum floating times of AMD with and without epibionts on seven sandy beaches, covering the oceanic environment (Rapa Nui/Easter Island) and three regions (south, centre, north) along the Chilean continental coast, over a minimum of 10 consecutive days, and we contrast our results with predictions from published models.
Results: Total AMD accumulation rates varied from 56 ± 36 (mean ± standard deviation) to 388 ± 433 items km-1 d-1 and differed strongly between regions, in accordance with local geomorphology and socioeconomic conditions (presence of larger cities and rivers upstream, main economic activities, etc.). Daily accumulation of items with pelagic epibionts (indicators of a pelagic trajectory) ranged from 46 ± 29 (Rapa Nui) to 0.0 items km-1 d-1 (northern continental region). Minimum floating times of rafts, as estimated from the size of pelagic epibionts, were longest in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre's (SPSG) centre region, followed by the high-latitude continental region under the influence of the onshore West Wind Drift, and decreased along the continental alongshore upwelling current, towards lower latitudes. Apart from pelagic rafters, a wide range of benthic epibionts, including invasive and cryptogenic species, was found on rafts at the continental beaches. Similarly, we present another record of local benthic corals Pocillopora sp., on Rapa Nui rafts.
Discussion: Our results agree with the predictions made by recent models based on the prevailing wind and surface current regimes, with high frequencies of long-distance rafting in the oceanic SPSG centre and very low frequencies along the continental coast. These findings confirm the suitability of such models in predicting arrival hotspots of AMD and rafting species. Moreover, storm surges as well as site-related factors seem to influence AMD arrival patterns along the Chilean continental coast and might cause the observed high variability between sampling sites and days. Our results highlight the possible importance of rafting as a vector of along-shore dispersal and range expansions along the SE Pacific continental coast and add to the discussion about its role in benthic species dispersal between South Pacific oceanic islands.","We are very grateful to the taxonomists who kindly helped with species identification: Jan Beermann (Amphipoda), James T.

OBJECTIVE: To compare hospitalization and mortality rates during the pandemic among chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients and the general population in Lima (Peru).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included an assessment of the database of chronic HD patients of the health service providers of the social health insurance benefit networks of Lima and Callao between 2019 and 2021. Hospitalization and mortality rates were obtained for every 1,000 individuals, and variations in the percentages of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated. These rates were compared with those of the general population data and standardized by age and sex.
RESULTS: An average of 3,937 chronic HD patients were evaluated each month. Of these, 4.8% had COVID-19 and 64.97% were mild cases. The hospitalization rates per 1,000 patients were 19.5, 29.28, and 36.7 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The mortality rates per 1,000 patients were 5.9, 9.74, and 11.49 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. When compared to the standardized general population, the peaks of both rates coincided with the plateaus of the waves during the pandemic. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 12 times higher in HD patients than in the general population, and the mortality rate for COVID-19 was twice as high.
CONCLUSION: HD patients had higher hospitalization and standardized mortality rates than the general population. Peaks in hospitalizations and mortality coincided with the plateaus of the first and second waves of the pandemic.",,,Brazilian Journal of Nephrology,,,Humans; Retrospective Studies; Peru; Pandemics; Renal Dialysis; COVID-19; Hospitalization,2023-12,2023,2023-12,2023,45,4,440-448,All OA; Gold,Article,"Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Segura, Moisés Apolaya; Bravo-Zúñiga, Jessica; Vásquez, Juan Lluncor; Taype-Rondán, Alvaro","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru., Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru; Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru., Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru); Segura, Moisés Apolaya (Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru., Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru; Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru., Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru); Bravo-Zúñiga, Jessica (Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, Departamento de Nefrología, Lima, Peru., Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, Departamento de Nefrología, Lima, Peru); Vásquez, Juan Lluncor (Centro Nacional de Salud Renal, EsSalud, Lima, Peru., Centro Nacional de Salud Renal, EsSalud, Lima, Peru); Taype-Rondán, Alvaro (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Unidad de Investigación Para la Generación y Síntesis de Evidencias en Salud, Lima, Peru., Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Unidad de Investigación Para la Generación y Síntesis de Evidencias en Salud, Lima, Peru)","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Private University of the North; Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru., Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru)","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Private University of the North; Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru., Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru); Segura, Moisés Apolaya (Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru., Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru; Universidad César Vallejo); Bravo-Zúñiga, Jessica (Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, Departamento de Nefrología, Lima, Peru., Hospital Nacional Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, Departamento de Nefrología, Lima, Peru); Vásquez, Juan Lluncor (EsSALUD); Taype-Rondán, Alvaro (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)",3,3,,,https://www.scielo.br/j/jbn/a/nqwbgCrdy9M6kW3wf5jxVWB/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158061491,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, there is only 1 national precedent that has validated the scores of this instrument in its 21-item version. Therefore, this study examined the bifactor structural equation method (SEM) and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) structure of a 12-item human immunodeficiency virus stigma scale in Peruvian adults.
METHODS: We evaluated 342 patients (57.6% female and 42.45% male) diagnosed with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) from a hospital located in East Lima, aged 18 to 45 years (M = 31.4, SD = 9.79). A SEM was used to test 2 measurement models, a 4-factor correlated oblique model and a bifactor model due to high interfactor relationships.
RESULTS: Acceptable fit indices were identified for the oblique model (χ2/df = 1.26, SRMR = 0.044, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.028 [0.000-0.047], CFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.994). In the same way, similar results were evident for the bifactor model (χ2/df = 1.14, SRMR = 0.039, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.020 [0.000-0.044], CFI = 0.998, TLI = 0.997), however, in the latter it showed a greater explanation for the unidimensional model (H = 0.87, PUC = 0.82, LCA = 0.70), which was also evidenced by the bifactor MIRT analysis.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the 12-item HIV Stigma Scale meets the psychometric properties of internal structure and unifactorial reliability.","We acknowledge the contribution of the participants and co-researchers.

Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the primary characteristics of studies on accessibility, coverage, patient preferences, and factors associated with patient satisfaction or acceptance of colposcopy in primary healthcare.
METHODS: A search strategy, based on MeSH, Emtree, and free terms, was run through 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science). EndNote 20.1 © and Rayyan QCRI © were used for screening. A preset datasheet was used for data extraction.
RESULTS: The systematic search retrieved 1127 references, and after removing duplicates, screening the titles and abstracts, and reviewing the full text, 7 studies were included. The interrater reliability was 77.73% (kappa statistic = 0.1842). Most studies estimated the proportion of women that sought for colposcopy after a previous screening test for human papilloma virus. One study identifies barriers to colposcopy examination in women at risk of developing cervical cancer. Three studies assessed the decentralization of colposcopy from a tertiary healthcare center to a primary care center. Pap smear was the most common first-line screening test, followed by liquid-based cytology sample and visual inspection with acetic acid.
CONCLUSION: Only a few countries have investigated the use of colposcopy in primary care. Thus, barriers and the care structure for this implementation to be successful in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality should be identified.",,"Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Primary Care & Community Health,,,Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Colposcopy; Vaginal Smears; Reproducibility of Results; Papanicolaou Test; Early Detection of Cancer; Primary Health Care; Mass Screening,2023-01,2023,2023-09-22,2023-01,14,,21501319231198942,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.; Hernandez-Bustamante, Enrique A.; Acuña-Chávez, Luis M.; Escudero-Gaytan, Claudia P.; Ulloque‑Badaracco, Juan R.; Alarcón-Braga, Esteban A.; Venegas, Gino; Herrera-Añazco, Percy","Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely between the 5th andthe 18th of April 2020 in the three South African provinces hardest hit by Covid-19, namely Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. In total, 60 qualitative key informant interviews and one focus group discussion were conducted. Study participants expressed concerns for elderly people and people with underlying health conditions because of their increased vulnerability to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). People living with HIV expressed an increased fear of infection following the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa. The sidelining of healthcare services and stock-outs of medication proved to be an added concern in particular for vulnerable and immunocompromised groups. Overall, the data suggest that the fear of infection is ubiquitous for people who live in unstable environments such as overcrowded townships and informal settlements. Given the increased fears of infection brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the mental health of vulnerable communities and those caring for them becomes an added burden for people living in unstable environments.","The authors thank the study participants.

A sociodemographic survey, the Mpox Fear Scale, was used. Conspiracy Beliefs about Mpox was assessed using three questions created specifically for this study. For inferential purposes, simple ordinal regressions (""crude models"") were performed between each factor and the outcome. ResultsRegarding their intention to be vaccinated against Mpox, more than 60% expressed clear approval. Being non-heterosexual, having greater emotional fear of Mpox, and perceiving some potential for this disease to become the next pandemic were related to greater intention to vaccinate. On the other hand, being older, having low perceived usefulness of COVID-19 vaccines, and having higher conspiracy beliefs about Mpox were associated with lower intention to vaccinate. ConclusionThe study provides initial information for future research seeking to better analyze Mpox vaccination intention.

Therefore, we comprehensively examined CSBD across 42 countries, genders, and sexual orientations, and validated the original (CSBD-19) and short (CSBD-7) versions of the Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder Scale to provide standardized, state-of-the-art screening tools for research and clinical practice.
Method: Using data from the International Sex Survey (N = 82,243; Mage = 32.39 years, SD = 12.52), we evaluated the psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 and CSBD-7 and compared CSBD across 42 countries, three genders, eight sexual orientations, and individuals with low vs. high risk of experiencing CSBD.
Results: A total of 4.8% of the participants were at high risk of experiencing CSBD. Country- and gender-based differences were observed, while no sexual-orientation-based differences were present in CSBD levels. Only 14% of individuals with CSBD have ever sought treatment for this disorder, with an additional 33% not having sought treatment because of various reasons. Both versions of the scale demonstrated excellent validity and reliability.
Discussion and conclusions: This study contributes to a better understanding of CSBD in underrepresented and underserved populations and facilitates its identification in diverse populations by providing freely accessible ICD-11-based screening tools in 26 languages. The findings may also serve as a crucial building block to stimulate research into evidence-based, culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies for CSBD that are currently missing from the literature.",,"BB was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the SCOUP Team – Sexuality and Couples – Fonds de recherche du Québec, Société et Culture and the by the Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, SSHRC).

We use data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), and Redshift space distortion (RSD) probes, in order to impose observational constraints on soft dark energy and soft dark matter. We examine three simple models, corresponding to the minimum extensions of ΛCDM scenario, namely we consider that at large scales the dark sectors have the EoS's of ΛCDM model (dust dark matter and cosmological constant respectively), while at intermediate scales either dark energy or dark matter or both, may have a different EoS according to constant “softness” parameters s d e and s d m . The observational confrontation shows that for almost all datasets the softness parameters deviate from their ΛCDM values, in a prominent way for soft dark energy and mildly for soft dark matter, and thus the data favor soft cosmology. Finally, performing a Bayesian evidence analysis we find that the examined models are certainly preferred over ΛCDM cosmology.","The authors thank the referee for important comments which led to the improvement of the quality of the manuscript.

We apply this formalism in the framework of f(T) gravity, considering three viable mono-parametric models. In particular, we investigate the induced modifications at the level of the gravitational-wave source, which is encoded in terms of the power spectrum of the PBH gravitational potential, as well as at the level of their propagation, described in terms of the Green function which quantifies the propagator of the tensor perturbations. We find that, within the observationally allowed range of the f(T) model-parameters, the obtained deviations from general relativity, both at the levels of source and propagation, are practically negligible. Hence, we conclude that realistic and viable f(T) theories can safely pass the primordial black hole constraints, which may offer an additional argument in their favor.",T.P. acknowledges financial support from the Foundation for Education and European Culture in Greece.

163,pub.1157687771,10.3390/fractalfract7050368,,,Exact Solutions and Cosmological Constraints in Fractional Cosmology,"This paper investigates exact solutions of cosmological interest in fractional cosmology. Given μ, the order of Caputo’s fractional derivative, and w, the matter equation of state, we present specific exact power-law solutions. We discuss the exact general solution of the Riccati Equation, where the solution for the scale factor is a combination of power laws. Using cosmological data, we estimate the free parameters. An analysis of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD), also known as cosmic chronometers, and a joint analysis with data from SNe Ia + OHD leads to best-fit values for the free parameters calculated at 1σ, 2σ and 3σ confidence levels (CLs). On the other hand, these best-fit values are used to calculate the age of the Universe, the current deceleration parameter (both at 3σ CL) and the current matter density parameter at 1σ CL. Finding a Universe roughly twice as old as the one of ΛCDM is a distinction of fractional cosmology. Focusing our analysis on these results, we can conclude that the region in which μ>2 is not ruled out by observations. This parameter region is relevant because fractional cosmology gives a power-law solution without matter, which is accelerated for μ>2. We present a fractional origin model that leads to an accelerated state without appealing to Λ or dark energy.","The authors are thankful for the support of Núcleo de Investigación Geometría Diferencial y Aplicaciones, Resolución VRIDT No. 096/2022.

Symptoms of anaemia include fatigue and weakness, among others, affecting health and quality of life. Anaemic pregnant women have an increased risk of premature delivery, a low-birthweight infant, and postpartum depression. They are also more likely to have anaemia in the postpartum period which can lead to an ongoing condition and affect subsequent pregnancies. In 2019 nearly 37% of pregnant women globally had anaemia, and estimates suggest that 50–80% of postpartum women in low- and middle-income countries have anaemia, but currently there is no standard measurement or classification for postpartum anaemia.MethodsA rapid landscape review was conducted to identify and characterize postpartum anaemia measurement searching references within three published systematic reviews of anaemia, including studies published between 2012 and 2021. We then conducted a new search for relevant literature from February 2021 to April 2022 in EMBASE and MEDLINE using a similar search strategy as used in the published reviews.ResultsIn total, we identified 53 relevant studies. The timing of haemoglobin measurement ranged from within the immediate postpartum period to over 6 weeks. The thresholds used to diagnose anaemia in postpartum women varied considerably, with < 120, < 110, < 100 and < 80 g/L the most frequently reported. Other laboratory results frequently reported included ferritin and transferrin receptor. Clinical outcomes reported in 32 out of 53 studies included postpartum depression, quality of life, and fatigue. Haemoglobin measurements were performed in a laboratory, although it is unclear from the studies if venous samples and automatic analysers were used in all cases.ConclusionsThis review demonstrates the need for improving postpartum anaemia measurement given the variability observed in published measures. With the high prevalence of anaemia, the relatively simple treatment for non-severe cases of iron deficiency anaemia, and its importance to public health with multi-generational effects, it is crucial to develop common measures for women in the postpartum period and promote rapid uptake and reporting.","The authors thank Vaibhav Patwardhan, Research Officer, Jhpiego India country office for assistance with formatting references.","This work received support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of the Mother and Newborn Information for Tracking Outcomes and Results (MoNITOR) Advisory Group.

The 1990 Caracas declaration proposed a shift towards decentralised community mental health services and interventions based on the recovery approach and emphasis on social determinants of mental health in the Americas. Colombia has adopted these approaches in its legal and practical framework in recent years, but implementation has been uneven. This systematic review aims to contribute to mental health services understanding in Colombia by examining the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of mental health services in Colombia. A search was conducted to explore available peer-reviewed studies on Colombian mental health services across five databases (Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Scielo and BVS) on quantitative and qualitative research papers published in the last ten years and without language restrictions. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to structure the analysis and identify barriers and facilitators during the implementation of mental health services. We adapted the CFIR to attend to gender, race and age informed by the Socio-Political Economy of Global Mental Health framework, given the importance of these factors to the Colombian health landscape. Finally, narrative synthesis was used to summarise the data. 1 530 records were identified, and 12 articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. 8 papers described substance use disorders services, 11 involved multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, and 7 were implemented at a local scale. The primary barriers to implementation were the lack of coordination, high workloads, and low funding. Facilitators included the use of protocols, and the involvement of communities, stakeholders, users, and external champions. Findings suggest the continued importance of community and recovery approaches and efforts to improve coordination between multi-sector actors involved in the mental health spaces (e.g., public, and private organisations, users and their families).",,"This paper was conducted in partial fulfilment of GA-AG MSc degree in Global Health and Development at UCL.

The aim of the study was to evaluate self-medication as a factor associated with the purchase of brand-name and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in older adults in Peru.
Methods: A secondary analysis was performed using an analytical cross-sectional design of data from a nationally representative survey from 2014 to 2016. The exposure variable was self-medication, defined as the purchase of medicines without a prescription. The dependent variables were purchases of brand-name and OTC drugs, both as a dichotomous response (yes/no). Information of sociodemographic variables, health insurance, and the types of drugs purchased by the participants was collected. Crude prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated and adjusted using generalized linear models of the Poisson family, considering the complex sample of the survey.
Results: In this study, 1,115 respondents were evaluated, with a mean age of 63.8 years and a male proportion of 48.2%. The prevalence of self-medication was 66.6%, while the proportions of purchases of brand-name and OTC drugs were 62.4% and 23.6%, respectively. The adjusted Poisson regression analysis revealed an association between self-medication and the purchase of brand-name drugs (adjusted PR [aPR]=1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.19). Likewise, self-medication was associated with the purchase of OTC medications (aPR=1.97; 95%CI: 1.55-2.51).
Conclusions: This study evidenced a high prevalence of self-medication in Peruvian older adults. Two-thirds of the surveyed people bought brand-name drugs, whereas one-quarter bought OTC drugs. Self-medication was associated with a greater likelihood of buying brand-name and OTC drugs.",Not applicable.,,Canadian Geriatrics Journal,,,,2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,26,1,187-199,All OA; Gold,Article,"Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Mougenot, Benoit; Benites-Meza, Jerry K.; Barturén-Alvarado, Luz C.; Zumarán-Nuñez, Carlos J.; Boyd-Gamarra, Maria A.; Runzer-Colmenares, Fernando M.; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru; Red Internacional en Salud Colectiva y Salud Intercultural, Mexico City, Mexico); Mougenot, Benoit (Facultad de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru; Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Benites-Meza, Jerry K.

Several studies have reported an association of vitamin B12, folic acid, or homocysteine (Hcy) levels with MetS. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the association of vitamin B12, folic acid, and Hcy levels with MetS.
Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science were searched up to February 13, 2023. Cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies were included. A random-effects model was performed using the DerSimonian and Laird method to estimate the between-study variance. Effect measures were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic.
Results: Sixty-six articles (n = 87,988 patients) were included. Higher vitamin B12 levels were inversely associated with MetS (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81-0.93; p < 0.01; I2 = 90%). Higher Hcy levels were associated with MetS (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.14-1.24; p < 0.01; I2 = 90%). Folate levels were not associated with MetS (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.66-1.03; p = 0.09; I2 = 90%).
Conclusion: Higher vitamin B12 levels were inversely associated with MetS, whereas higher Hcy levels were associated with MetS.

However, SNS are not without the access gap among elders. Assuming that the data are homogenous within the same population may not be precise in social science research. What is known about the heterogeneous nature of older people? Considering this issue and the lack of research to help reflect the heterogeneity of elderly users of technologies, this study aims to identify segments in the use of SNS by the elderly. Data were collected from older Chilean adults. Cluster analysis suggested different profiles of adult users regarding the Technology Readiness Index. We used a hybrid multigroup partial least squares-structural equation model, including the Pathmox algorithm, to identify segments in the structural model. Based on the technology readiness profiles and the generation, we identified three segments with different determinant effects to explain the intention to use SNS: independent elder, technological-apathetic elder, and technological-eager elder. The contributions from this study are triple. First, this study helps to better understand how the elderly adopt information technology. Second, this study complements the existing corpus of research on using the technology readiness index in the elderly population. Third, we used an innovative method to segment users in the acceptance technology model.",,"This work was funded by ANID/ FONDECYT Regular 1210130.

In particular, due to the spin of the baryonic and dark matter particles and its coupling to gravity, they probe an effective spin-dependent metric, which can be calculated semi-classically in the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon formalism. Hence, the usual field equations give rise to modified Friedmann equations, in which the extra terms can be identified as an effective dark-energy sector. Additionally, we obtain an effective interaction between the matter and dark-energy sectors. In the case where the spin-gravity coupling switches off, we recover standard ΛCDM cosmology. We perform a dynamical system analysis and we find a matter-dominated point that can describe the matter era, and a stable late-time solution corresponding to acceleration and dark-energy domination. For small values of the spin coupling parameter, deviations from ΛCDM concordance scenario are small, however for larger values they can be brought to the desired amount, leading to different dark-energy equation-of-state parameter behavior, as well as to different transition redshift from acceleration to deceleration. Finally, we confront the model predictions with Hubble function data.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Based on a large number of observations, mass has been suggested to be a key parameter affecting the presence and appearance of MPs in stellar clusters. To further investigate the existence of MPs in low-mass clusters and explore the mass threshold for the formation of MPs, we carried out a project studying the composition of the stellar population in several low-mass Galactic globular clusters. Here we present our study on the cluster Eridanus. With blue-UV low-resolution spectra obtained with the OSIRIS/Multi-object spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias, we computed the spectral indices of CH and CN for a sample of giant stars and derived their carbon and nitrogen abundances using model spectra. A significant dispersion in the initial surface abundance of nitrogen was found in the sample, indicating the existence of MPs in Eridanus. Inspecting the age–initial mass distribution of in situ clusters with MPs, we find a slight trend that initial mass increases with increasing age, and the lowest initial masses of logMinitial ∼ 4.98 and 5.26 are found at the young and old end, respectively, which might provide a rough reference for the mass threshold for clusters to form MPs. However, more observations of clusters with low initial masses are still necessary before any firm conclusion can be drawn.","Y.W. acknowledges the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 11803048 and the Special Research Assistant Foundation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Here we investigate the relationship between ENSO and the South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM) focusing on strong SPMM events that follows strong El Niño events. This type of events represents more than 60% of such events in the observational record and the historical simulations of the CESM Large ensemble (CESM-LE). It is first shown that such a relationship is rather stationary in both observations and the CESM-LE. Our analyses further reveal that strong SPMM events are associated with a coastal warming off northern central Chile peaking in Austral winter resulting from the propagation of waves forced at the equator during the development of El Niño events. The time delay between the ENSO peak (Boreal winter) and this coastal warming (Austral winter) can be understood in terms of the differential contribution of the equatorially-forced propagating baroclinic waves to the warming along the coast. In particular, the difference in phase speeds of the waves (the high-order mode the wave the slower) implies that they do not overlap along their propagation south of 20°S. This contributes to the persistence of warm coastal SST anomalies off Central Chile until the Austral summer following the concurrent El Niño event. This coastal warming is favorable to the development of strong SPMM events as the South Pacific Oscillation become active during that season. The analysis of the simulations of the Coupled Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5/6) indicates that very few models realistically simulate this ENSO/SPMM relationship and associated oceanic teleconnection.",,"BD received support from ANID (Concurso de Fortalecimiento al Desarrollo Cientifico de Centros Regionales 2020-R20F0008-CEAZA, Anillo Eclipse ACT210071, Núcleo Milenio UPWELL (NCN19_153) and COPAS COASTAL FB210021) and ANR (Grant ANR-18-CE01-0012).

The APOGEE instrument, a high-resolution 300-fiber H-band (1.55–1.71 μm) spectrograph, is also ideal to study other stellar populations in the Galaxy, among which are a number of star-forming regions and young open clusters. We present the results of the determination of six stellar properties (T eff, logg , [Fe/H], L/L ⊙, M/M ⊙, and age) for a sample that is composed of 3360 young stars, of subsolar to supersolar types, in 16 Galactic star formation and young open cluster regions. Those sources were selected by using a clustering method that removes most of the field contamination. Samples were also refined by removing targets affected by various systematic effects of the parameter determination. The final samples are presented in a comprehensive catalog that includes all six estimated parameters. This overview study also includes parameter spatial distribution maps for all regions and Hertzsprung–Russell ( logL/L⊙ vs. T eff) diagrams. This study serves as a guide for detailed studies on individual regions and paves the way for the future studies on the global properties of stars in the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution using more robust samples.","The authors want to acknowledge the help of an anonymous referee, whose comments and suggestions helped us to improve the content of our manuscript.

We observed a surprising reduction in the optical band gap from 2.20 to 1.18 eV with increasing calcination temperature from 400 to 500 °C. Raman and X-Ray diffraction measurements indicated slight changes in the lattice parameters induced by the growth process. However, density functional theory calculations of the Rietveld-refined and pristine structures revealed that the observed optical gap reduction could not be explained by structural changes alone. By introducing oxygen vacancies to the refined structures, we could reproduce the reduction of the band gap. Our calculations also showed that the inclusion of oxygen vacancies at the vanadyl position creates a spin-polarized interband state that reduces the electronic band gap and promotes a magnetic response due to unpaired electrons. This prediction was confirmed by our magnetometry measurements, which exhibited a ferromagnetic-like behavior. Our findings suggest that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in band gap reduction and the promotion of a ferromagnetic-like response in an otherwise paramagnetic material. This provides a promising route to engineer novel devices.","We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Physics Department and the Faculty of Science at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.

Consequently, this often leads to caregivers who are the patient's relatives, which adversely impacts the workforce along with severely diminishing the quality of life for all involved. It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop a fast, effective and reliable sensor to enable early-stage detection in an attempt to reverse disease progression. This research validates the detection of amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) using a Silicon Carbide (SiC) electrode, a fact that is unprecedented in the literature. Aβ42 is considered a reliable biomarker for AD detection, as reported in previous studies. To validate the detection with a SiC-based electrochemical sensor, a gold (Au) electrode-based electrochemical sensor was used as a control. The same cleaning, functionalization and Aβ1-28 antibody immobilization steps were used on both electrodes. Sensor validation was carried out by means of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) aiming to detect an 0.5 µg·mL-1 Aβ42 concentration in 0.1 M buffer solution as a proof of concept. A repeatable peak directly related to the presence of Aβ42 was observed, indicating that a fast SiC-based electrochemical sensor was constructed and may prove to be a useful approach for the early detection of AD.","Bianca I.

These types of studies, which have attracted growing attention in recent years, enhance the scope and rigor of the evaluation. While various frameworks that summarize the justifications for carrying out these types of studies and provide implementation guidance have been published in the last few years in the health sciences, we do not know whether such frameworks have been properly implemented in the social and educational sciences. This review examined the methodological features and reporting practices of mixed methods intervention studies aimed at increasing young people's interest in STEM.
Methods: A systematic search was carried out in APA PsycNET, ERIC, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science, and a hand search in 20 journals. We included peer-reviewed English-language articles that reported intervention studies with a quantitative component measuring outcomes specific to increasing secondary school students' interest in STEM fields, a qualitative component conducted before, during, or after the quantitative component, and evidence of integration of both components. Qualitative content analysis and ideal-type analysis were used to synthesize the findings.
Results: We found 34 studies; the majority published in the last ten years. Several patterns of mixed methods application were described in these studies, illustrating the unique insights that can be gained by employing this methodology. The reporting quality of the included studies was generally adequate, especially regarding the justification for using a mixed methods intervention design and the integration of the quantitative and qualitative components. Nonetheless, a few reporting issues were observed, such as a lack of detail in the presentation of the mixed methods design, an inadequate description of the qualitative sampling and analysis techniques, and the absence of joint displays for representing integration.
Discussion: Authors must pay attention to these issues to ensure that the insights obtained by the use of mixed methods research are effectively communicated.",The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dick Edelstein in editing the final manuscript.,"This study belonged to a research project led by MS and funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO), Spanish State Research Agency (AEI), and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) grant number (FEM2017-84589-R).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-01-05,2023,2023-01-05,,13,,956300,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fàbregues, Sergi; Sáinz, Milagros; Romano, María José; Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia; Younas, Ahtisham; López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad","Fàbregues, Sergi (Department of Psychology and Education, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Sáinz, Milagros (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Romano, María José (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain); Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Younas, Ahtisham (Faculty of Nursing, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s, IL, Canada); López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad (Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain)","Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Sáinz, Milagros (Open University of Catalonia)","Fàbregues, Sergi (Open University of Catalonia); Sáinz, Milagros (Open University of Catalonia); Romano, María José (Open University of Catalonia); Escalante-Barrios, Elsa Lucia (Universidad del Norte); Younas, Ahtisham (Memorial University of Newfoundland); López-Pérez, Beatriz-Soledad (Open University of Catalonia)",6,6,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.956300/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154252387,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

The available data suggest an increasing use of CAM over time and a higher prevalence in low- and middle-income countries. However, no reliable data are available from Latin America. Accordingly, we examined the prevalence of CAM use among cancer patients from six Colombian regions.MethodsWe conducted a survey on cancer patients attending comprehensive cancer centres in six capital cities from different regions. The survey was designed based on a literature review and information gathered through focus groups on CAM terminology in Colombia. Independent random samples of patients from two comprehensive cancer centres in every city were obtained. Patients 18 years and older with a histopathological diagnosis of cancer undergoing active treatment were eligible. The prevalence of CAM use is reported as a percentage with the corresponding confidence interval. CAM types are reported by region. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of CAM users and non-users were compared using Chi square and t tests.ResultsIn total, 3117 patients were recruited. The average age 59.6 years old, and 62.8% were female. The prevalence of CAM use was 51.7%, and compared to non-users, CAM users were younger, more frequently women, affiliated with the health insurance plan for low-income populations and non-Catholic. We found no differences regarding the clinical stage or treatment modality, but CAM users reported more treatment-related side effects. The most frequent types of CAM were herbal products, specific foods and vitamins, and individually, soursop was the most frequently used product. Relevant variability between regions was observed regarding the prevalence and type of CAM used (range: 36.6% to 66.7%). The most frequent reason for using CAM was symptom management (30.5%), followed by curative purposes (19.5%).ConclusionsThe prevalence of CAM use among cancer patients in Colombia is high in general, and variations between regions might be related to differences in cultural backgrounds and access to comprehensive cancer care. The most frequently used CAM products and practices have little scientific support, suggesting the need to enhance integrative oncology research in the country.","We thank the following institutions which made posible the field work and recruitment of patients: Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Clínica Universitaria Colombia, Hospital Internacional de Colombia, Organización Clínica Bonadona Prevenir, Clínica de la Misericordia, Oncólogos Asociados del Cauca, Oncólogos Asociados de Imbanaco, Hospital San Vicente Fundación Medellín, Clínica de Oncología Astorga, Unidad Oncológica Surcolombiana, Universidad Surcolombiana.","We had the support of the following Colombian institutions: Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation; the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism; and the ICETEX.

However, part of the carbon fixed returns to the atmosphere, and this is done through soil respiration. The present study seeks to quantify the total soil efflux (a subrogate of total soil respiration) that includes both autotrophic and heterotrophic soil efflux, emitted by a Panama's mangrove swamp, as well as to investigate what drivers are important. Firstly, 3 plots were established with predominant mangroves species, such as salty mangrove tree (Avicennia bicolor Standl.) and black mangrove tree (Avicennia germinans L.). Secondly, a forest inventory was carried out in one ha, resulting in 371 trees ha-1, where the salty mangrove tree prevailed with 219 individuals in front of the black mangrove tree, with 152 trees. In addition, tree level measurements were performed such as diameter at breast height (DBH), crown diameter and distance between trees. Third, using a Licor 6400XT infrared gas analyzer system and a meteorological tower, soil CO2 fluxes and air and soil temperature were measured respectively. Results showed a total of 33.61 t of CO2 ha-1 emitted by the soil of the mangrove in 3.5 months.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper Acknowledgment We thank to MSc.

A literature search was conducted across four databases (Psychology and Behavioral (EBSCO), Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed). The PRISMA guidelines were followed. The PEDro scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool were used to assess the quality of and risk of bias in the studies, respectively. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42022319239). The outcomes were muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, postural balance and gait speed. From 610 records initially found, 10 were finally included in the systematic review, involving 354 older people with a mean age of 67.3 years. Nine of them reported significant changes in at least one variable related to physical performance in the intervention compared to the control groups. The neuromuscular training caused significant improvements in postural balance, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength power of the upper and lower limbs and autonomy. The available evidence indicates that neuromuscular training has a positive effect on some variables of physical performance, especially in postural balance; however, the methodological quality and certainty of the evidence in the available literature are limited. Therefore, a greater number of high-quality studies are required to draw definitive conclusions.",,This research received no external funding.,Life,,,,2023-03-24,2023,2023-03-24,,13,4,869,All OA; Gold,Article,"Concha-Cisternas, Yeny; Castro-Piñero, José; Leiva-Ordóñez, Ana María; Valdés-Badilla, Pablo; Celis-Morales, Carlos; Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo","Concha-Cisternas, Yeny (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3460000, Chile); Castro-Piñero, José (GALENO Research Group, Department of Physical Education, Faculty of Education Sciences, University of Cádiz, 11519 Puerto Real, Spain;, jose.castro@uca.es; Instituto de Investigación e Innovación Biomédica de Cádiz (INiBICA), University of Cádiz, 11009 Cádiz, Spain); Leiva-Ordóñez, Ana María (Instituto de Anatomía, Histología y Patología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile;, aleiva@uach.cl); Valdés-Badilla, Pablo (Department of Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Education Sciences, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile;, valdesbadilla@gmail.com; Carrera de Entrenador Deportivo, Escuela de Educación, Universidad Viña del Mar, Viña del Mar 2520000, Chile); Celis-Morales, Carlos (School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, UK;, carlos.celis@glasgow.ac.uk; Human Performance Lab, Education, Physical Activity and Health Research Unit, University Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile); Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca 3460000, Chile;, eduardo.guzman@cloud.uautonoma.cl)","Concha-Cisternas, Yeny (Universidad Santo Tomás)","Concha-Cisternas, Yeny (Universidad Santo Tomás); Castro-Piñero, José (University of Cádiz; University of Cádiz); Leiva-Ordóñez, Ana María (Austral University of Chile); Valdés-Badilla, Pablo (Catholic University of the Maule; Viña del Mar University); Celis-Morales, Carlos (University of Glasgow; Catholic University of the Maule); Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)",7,7,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/13/4/869/pdf?version=1679632293,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156505347,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 3104 Evolutionary Biology; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing,

Furthermore, there have been limited studies on its measurement invariance across cross-cultural subgroups, genders, and sexual orientations.
AIMS: The present study aimed to examine the fit of different measurement models for the AUDIT and its measurement invariance across a wide range of subgroups by country, language, gender, and sexual orientation.
METHODS: Responses concerning past-year alcohol use from the participants of the cross-sectional International Sex Survey were considered (N = 62,943; Mage: 32.73; SD = 12.59). Confirmatory factor analysis, as well as measurement invariance tests were performed for 21 countries, 14 languages, three genders, and four sexual-orientation subgroups that met the minimum sample size requirement for inclusion in these analyses.
RESULTS: A two-factor model with factors describing 'alcohol use' (items 1-3) and 'alcohol problems' (items 4-10) showed the best model fit across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. For the former two, scalar and latent mean levels of invariance were reached considering different criteria. For gender and sexual orientation, a latent mean level of invariance was reached.
CONCLUSIONS: In line with the two-factor model, the calculation of separate alcohol-use and alcohol-problem scores is recommended when using the AUDIT. The high levels of measurement invariance achieved for the AUDIT support its use in cross-cultural research, capable also of meaningful comparisons among genders and sexual orientations.",,,Comprehensive Psychiatry,,,"Humans; Male; Female; Alcoholism; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Psychometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sexual Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results",2023-09-23,2023,2023-09-23,2023-11,127,,152427,All OA; Gold,Article,"Horváth, Zsolt; Nagy, Léna; Koós, Mónika; Kraus, Shane W; Demetrovics, Zsolt; Potenza, Marc N; Ballester-Arnal, Rafael; Batthyány, Dominik; Bergeron, Sophie; Billieux, Joël; Briken, Peer; Burkauskas, Julius; Cárdenas-López, Georgina; Carvalho, Joana; Castro-Calvo, Jesús; Chen, Lijun; Ciocca, Giacomo; Corazza, Ornella; Csako, Rita; Fernandez, David P; Fujiwara, Hironobu; Fernandez, Elaine F; Fuss, Johannes; Gabrhelík, Roman; Gewirtz-Meydan, Ateret; Gjoneska, Biljana; Gola, Mateusz; Grubbs, Joshua B; Hashim, Hashim T; Islam, Md Saiful; Ismail, Mustafa; Jiménez-Martínez, Martha C; Jurin, Tanja; Kalina, Ondrej; Klein, Verena; Költő, András; Lee, Sang-Kyu; Lewczuk, Karol; Lin, Chung-Ying; Lochner, Christine; López-Alvarado, Silvia; Lukavská, Kateřina; Mayta-Tristán, Percy; Miller, Dan J; Orosová, Oľga; Orosz, Gábor; Ponce, Fernando P; Quintana, Gonzalo R; Quintero Garzola, Gabriel C; Ramos-Diaz, Jano; Rigaud, Kévin; Rousseau, Ann; Scanavino, Marco De Tubino; Schulmeyer, Marion K; Sharan, Pratap; Shibata, Mami; Shoib, Sheikh; Sigre-Leirós, Vera; Sniewski, Luke; Spasovski, Ognen; Steibliene, Vesta; Stein, Dan J; Strizek, Julian; Tsai, Meng-Che; Ünsal, Berk C; Vaillancourt-Morel, Marie-Pier; Van Hout, Marie Claire; Bőthe, Beáta","Horváth, Zsolt (Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Centre of Excellence in Responsible Gaming, University of Gibraltar, Gibraltar, Gibraltar.

The results might help determine immunization strategies.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Unlike previous studies, we analyzed NAbs in a random sample of 110 IgG positive sera from individuals who participated in a population-based seroprevalence transversal study, carried out in May 2022 in two Chilean cities, a country with high vaccination coverage.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 98.2% of individuals had NAbs against Wuhan, 65.5% against Omicron, and 32.7% tested positive for Wuhan but not Omicron. Factors influencing protective immunity included a prior natural infection and the number of vaccines received. NAbs titers against the original virus were high, demonstrating vaccine effectiveness in the population. However, the level of antibodies decreased when measuring NAbs against Omicron, particularly among older individuals, indicating a decline in vaccine protection. Previous COVID-19 episodes acted as a natural booster, increasing NAbs titers against both virus strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Protective immunity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus is reduced when compared to Omicron variant. Updating vaccine to target emerging variants and continued monitoring of effectiveness at the population level are necessary.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

As with most applications, Web applications can acquire software flaws (known as bugs), whose symptoms are seen during the development stage and, even worse, in production. The use of debuggers is beneficial for detecting bugs. Unfortunately, most JavaScript debuggers (1) only support the ""step into/through"" feature in an execution program to detect a bug, and (2) do not allow developers to go back-in-time at the application execution to take actions to detect the bug accurately. For example, the second limitation does not allow developers to modify the value of a variable to fix a bug while the application is running or test if the same bug is triggered with other values of that variable. Using concepts such as continuations and static analysis, this article presents a usable debugger for JavaScript, named DeloreanJS, which enables developers to go back-in-time in different execution points and resume the execution of a Web application to improve the understanding of a bug, or even experiment with hypothetical scenarios around the bug. Using an online and available version, we illustrate the benefits of DeloreanJS through five examples of bugs in JavaScript. Although DeloreanJS is developed for JavaScript, a dynamic prototype-based object model with side effects (mutable variables), we discuss our proposal with the state-of-art/practice of debuggers in terms of features. For example, modern browsers like Mozilla Firefox include a debugger in their distribution that only support for the breakpoint feature. However DeloreanJS uses a graphical user interface that considers back-in-time features. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the usability of DeloreanJS and Mozilla Firefox's debugger using the system usability scale approach. We requested 30 undergraduate students from two computer science programs to solve five tasks. Among the findings, we highlight two results. First, we found that 100% (15) of participants recommended DeloreanJS, and only 53% (eight) recommended Firefox's debugger to complete the tasks. Second, whereas the average score for DeloreanJS is 71.6 (""Good""), the average score for Firefox's debugger is 55.8 (""Acceptable"").",,The authors received no funding for this work.,PeerJ Computer Science,,Muhammad Aleem,,2023-02-24,2023,2023-02-24,,9,,e1238,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leger, Paul; Ruiz, Felipe; Fukuda, Hiroaki; Cardozo, Nicolás","Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Elqui, Chile); Ruiz, Felipe (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Elqui, Chile); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan); Cardozo, Nicolás (Universidad de Los Andes, Bógota, Colombia)","Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)","Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Ruiz, Felipe (Catholic University of the North); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Cardozo, Nicolás (Universidad de Los Andes)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1238,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155738906,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

So3.2b, an Antarctic strain with bioactivity against Rhizoctonia solani","Introduction: Phytopathogenic fungi are a considerable concern for agriculture, as they can threaten the productivity of several crops worldwide. Meanwhile, natural microbial products are acknowledged to play an important role in modern agriculture as they comprehend a safer alternative to synthetic pesticides. Bacterial strains from underexplored environments are a promising source of bioactive metabolites.
Methods: We applied the OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds) cultivation approach, in vitro bioassays, and metabolo-genomics analyses to investigate the biochemical potential of Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b, a strain isolated from Antarctica. Crude extracts from OSMAC were analyzed through HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, molecular networking, and annotation. The antifungal potential of the extracts was confirmed against Rhizoctonia solani strains. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence was studied for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identification and phylogenetic comparison.
Results and Discussion: Molecular networking revealed that metabolite synthesis has growth media specificity, and it was reflected in bioassays results against R. solani. Bananamides, rhamnolipids, and butenolides-like molecules were annotated from the metabolome, and chemical novelty was also suggested by several unidentified compounds. Additionally, genome mining confirmed a wide variety of BGCs present in this strain, with low to no similarity with known molecules. An NRPS-encoding BGC was identified as responsible for producing the banamides-like molecules, while phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship with other rhizosphere bacteria. Therefore, by combining -omics approaches and in vitro bioassays, our study demonstrates that Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b has potential application to agriculture as a source of bioactive metabolites.",,"This research was funded by grants from the Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) - FONDECYT-1210563 and 11230475, the Instituto Antártico Chileno (INACH), INACH DG_01-19; Network for Extreme Environments Research (NEXER), NXR17-0003; Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica project 5402-1510-1035, CONICYT–PFCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2017-21170263 for KN-M, DR-V, and LB, by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001 (scholarship to NM, LO, and MJ), by São Paulo State Funding Agency, Brazil (FAPESP research grant 2019/17721-9 to Roberto Gomes de Souza Berlinck and scholarship 2022/01529-4 to NM) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq scholarship 142260/2020-4 to LO and 141501/2020-0 to MJ).",Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2023-05-04,2023,2023-05-04,,14,,1187321,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maimone, Naydja Moralles; Pozza, Mario Cezar; de Oliveira, Lucianne Ferreira Paes; Rojas-Villalta, Dorian; de Lira, Simone Possedente; Barrientos, Leticia; Núñez-Montero, Kattia","Maimone, Naydja Moralles (Luiz de Queiroz' Superior College of Agriculture, Department of Math, Chemistry, and Statistics, University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil); Pozza, Mario Cezar (Luiz de Queiroz' Superior College of Agriculture, Department of Math, Chemistry, and Statistics, University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil); de Oliveira, Lucianne Ferreira Paes (Luiz de Queiroz' Superior College of Agriculture, Department of Math, Chemistry, and Statistics, University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil); Rojas-Villalta, Dorian (Biotechnology Research Center, Department of Biology, Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Cartago, Costa Rica); de Lira, Simone Possedente (Luiz de Queiroz' Superior College of Agriculture, Department of Math, Chemistry, and Statistics, University of São Paulo, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil); Barrientos, Leticia (Extreme Environments Biotechnology Lab, Center of Excellence in Translational Medicine, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile); Núñez-Montero, Kattia (Facultad Ciencias de la Salud, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Temuco, Chile)","Barrientos, Leticia (University of La Frontera); Núñez-Montero, Kattia (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)","Maimone, Naydja Moralles (Universidade de São Paulo); Pozza, Mario Cezar (Universidade de São Paulo); de Oliveira, Lucianne Ferreira Paes (Universidade de São Paulo); Rojas-Villalta, Dorian (Costa Rica Institute of Technology); de Lira, Simone Possedente (Universidade de São Paulo); Barrientos, Leticia (University of La Frontera); Núñez-Montero, Kattia (Universidad Autónoma de Chile)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1187321/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157766191,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 3108 Plant Biology,2 Zero Hunger

Capitata rubra) Processed by Convective Drying at Different Temperatures","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and no efficient therapy able to cure or slow down PD is available. In this study, dehydrated red cabbage was evaluated as a novel source of bio-compounds with neuroprotective capacity. Convective drying was carried out at different temperatures. Total phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), anthocyanins (TAC), and glucosinolates (TGC) were determined using spectrophotometry, amino acid profile by LC-DAD and fatty acid profile by GC-FID. Phenolic characterization was determined by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity and neuroprotection assays were evaluated in SH-SY5Y human cells, observing the effect on preformed fibrils of α-synuclein. Drying kinetic confirmed a shorter processing time with temperature increase. A high concentration of bio-compounds was observed, especially at 90 °C, with TPC = 1544.04 ± 11.4 mg GAE/100 g, TFC = 690.87 ± 4.0 mg QE/100 g and TGC = 5244.9 ± 260.2 µmol SngE/100 g. TAC degraded with temperature. Glutamic acid and arginine were predominant. Fatty acid profiles were relatively stable and were found to be mostly C18:3n3. The neochlorogenic acid was predominant. The extracts had no cytotoxicity and showed a neuroprotective effect at 24 h testing, which can extend in some cases to 48 h.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are synthetic compounds that were intentionally produced in large quantities and have been distributed in the global environment, originating a threat due to their persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and toxicity. POPs reach the Antarctic continent through long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT). In these areas, low temperatures play a significant role in the environmental fate of POPs, retaining them for a long time due to cold trapping by diffusion and wet deposition, acting as a net sink for many POPs. However, in the current context of climate change, the remobilization of POPs that were trapped in water, ice, and soil for decades is happening. Therefore, continuous monitoring of POPs in polar air is necessary to assess whether there is a recent re-release of historical pollutants back to the environment. We reviewed the scientific literature on atmospheric levels of several POP families (polychlorinated biphenyls – PCBs, hexachlorobenzene – HCB, hexachlorocyclohexanes – HCHs, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane – DDT) from 1980 to 2021. We estimated the atmospheric half-life using characteristic decreasing times (TD). We observed that HCB levels in the Antarctic atmosphere were higher than the other target organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), but HCB also displayed higher fluctuations and did not show a significant decrease over time. Conversely, the atmospheric levels of HCHs, some DDTs, and PCBs have decreased significantly. The estimated atmospheric half-lives for POPs decreased in the following order: 4,4' DDE (13.5 years) > 4,4' DDD (12.8 years) > 4,4' DDT (7.4 years) > 2,4' DDE (6.4 years) > 2,4' DDT (6.3 years) > α-HCH (6 years) > HCB (6 years) > γ-HCH (4.2 years). For PCB congeners, they decreased in the following order: PCB 153 (7.6 years) > PCB 138 (6.5 years) > PCB 101 (4.7 years) > PCB 180 (4.6 years) > PCB 28 (4 years) > PCB 52 (3.7 years) > PCB 118 (3.6 years). For HCH isomers and PCBs, the Stockholm Convention (SC) ban on POPs did have an impact on decreasing their levels during the last decades. Nevertheless, their ubiquity in the Antarctic atmosphere shows the problematic issues related to highly persistent synthetic chemicals.","This study was funded by ANID/FONDECYT/Iniciación 11150548, ANID/FONDECYT/Regular 1161504, ANID/FONDECYT/Regular 1210946, ANID/PCI REDI170292, ANID-PIA-INACH-ACT192057, INACH REGULAR RT_12_17 (Cristóbal Galbán-Malagón).

When people who migrate come into contact with a new culture, they are immersed in a process called acculturation. In this process, people oscillate between maintaining their own culture or acquiring the culture and customs of the host country, resulting in the so-called acculturation strategies. According to Berry’s proposal, there are four main acculturation strategies: assimilation, integration, marginalization and separation. The few existing studies of Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country relate the use of the integration strategy (biculturalism) with lower cortisol levels. No studies have been found on the subject in Latino migrants in a Latino country.Methoda cross-sectional design was used to analyze the relationship between acculturation strategies and blood cortisol levels, based on the hypothesis that an integration strategy or biculturalism would be linked to lower cortisol levels. The study involved 314 Colombian migrants in Chile, who were evaluated with a scale of acculturation strategies according to the model proposed by Berry, in addition to providing blood samples to analyze cortisol levels.Resultsmigrants who show a preference for leave behind the culture of the country of origin have higher levels of cortisol ng/ml in blood. According to multiple comparisons the mean cortisol value was significantly different between integrated and assimilated subjects, with the mean cortisol of the integrated being significantly lower than that of the subjects typed as marginalized.ConclusionThe patterns of the relationship between biculturalism and cortisol found in Latino migrants in Anglo-Saxon countries are repeated in Latino migrants in a Latino country. It is necessary to explore the influence of other variables in this relationship, since it seems that the best adaptive strategy, and therefore the cortisol response, will vary according to the socio-cultural context of the host country.",We would like to thank everyone who participated in this study.,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo—ANID, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",BMC Psychology,,,Humans; Hydrocortisone; Acculturation; Chile; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Transients and Migrants,2023-03-31,2023,2023-03-31,,11,1,94,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Aragón, Diego; Landabur, Rodrigo; Henríquez, Diego; Cortés, Leonel","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Aragón, Diego (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Landabur, Rodrigo (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de Atacama, Copiapó, Chile); Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Cortés, Leonel (Departamento de Tecnología Médica, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Aragón, Diego (University of Tarapacá); Landabur, Rodrigo (University of Atacama); Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North); Cortés, Leonel (University of Antofagasta)",1,1,,,https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40359-023-01147-w,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156776523,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Functional diversity in these complexes depends on the type of RCOR included, which modulates the catalytic activity of the complex. Here, we studied the duplicative history of the RCOR and LSD gene families and analyzed the evolution of their interaction. We found that RCOR genes are the product of the two rounds of whole-genome duplications that occurred early in vertebrate evolution. In contrast, the origin of the LSD genes traces back before to the divergence of animals and plants. Using bioinformatics tools, we show that the RCOR and LSD1 interaction precedes the RCOR repertoire expansion that occurred in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Overall, we trace LSD1-RCOR complex evolution and propose that animal non-model species offer advantages in addressing questions about the molecular biology of this epigenetic complex.","This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico from Chile (FONDECYT 1210471) and Millennium Nucleus of Ion Channel Associated Diseases (MiNICAD), Iniciativa Científica Milenio, Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism from Chile to J.C.O., Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico from Chile (FONDECYT 1191152) to M.E.A. and Postdoctorado ANID 3230704 to M.O.-C.

Consequently, working in a digital context switched from being a phenomenon to be studied to the primary means of socializing and the primary workspace for researchers. This study explores four different methodologies to question how discursive interactions related to power and newsworthiness may be addressed in digital contexts. The multimodal approach was reviewed through the affordances of critical discourse analysis, issue ownership and salience, morphological discourse analysis, and protest event analysis. It starts by theoretically addressing concepts of multimodality and phenomenology by focusing on the implications of both perspectives. It examines publications and interactions in digital contexts in Ecuador from March 2017 to December 2020 within three political phenomena. The results of the analysis of these publications and interactions suggest that when analyzing political participation and newsworthiness, the virtual becomes a subjective space. Moreover, qualitative research is one of the primary ways to combine multimodality with other forms of discourse analysis. This paper concludes that perceptions, practices, and meanings assigned to social online representations can be better analyzed through multimodality, which tackles the intertwined characteristics of virtual discourses.",,This project received funding from the Research Department of Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador under project number PEP QINV0353-IINV522010100.,Societies,,,,2023-05-06,2023,2023-05-06,,13,5,119,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yepez-Reyes, Veronica; Cevallos, Patricio; Carrillo-Andrade, Andrea; Cruz-Silva, Jorge; López-Paredes, Marco; González-Quincha, Alejandra","Yepez-Reyes, Veronica (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); Cevallos, Patricio (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); Carrillo-Andrade, Andrea (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); Cruz-Silva, Jorge (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); López-Paredes, Marco (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador); González-Quincha, Alejandra (OdeCom, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito 171105, Ecuador)","Yepez-Reyes, Veronica (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); López-Paredes, Marco (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador)","Yepez-Reyes, Veronica (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); Cevallos, Patricio (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); Carrillo-Andrade, Andrea (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); Cruz-Silva, Jorge (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); López-Paredes, Marco (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador); González-Quincha, Alejandra (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/13/5/119/pdf?version=1683374968,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157874499,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

In this condition, researchers are turning to innovative options to combat this alarming situation. Combining herbal medicine with nanotechnology has created a new strategy to increase the effectiveness of phytochemical compounds in overcoming antimicrobial resistance. Pistacia atlantica is one of the promising herbs with medicinal benefits, but its poor solubility in biological fluids is challenging. In this regard, we seek to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of Pistacia atlantica extract-loaded nanovesicle. Cholesterol, Span 40, and Pluronic F127 modified nanoformulation was developed using an environmentally friendly improved heating technique, and it was evaluated for size distribution, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE%), release behavior, stability, and antimicrobial performance. By using DLS, spherical nanovesicles were identified with a size distribution of 50–150 nm and a zeta potential of −43 mV. The extract's encapsulation efficiency was 72.03%. The developed loaded nanovesicles demonstrated controlled extract release in the tested 96 h and storage stability of at least 12 months at 25 °C. Also, Comparing the two samples, the encapsulated extract had greater antibacterial activity against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida with MIC of 1320, 570, and 1100 µg/mL, respectively. Besides reducing the misuse of antibiotics by allowing for the controlled release of drugs made from natural sources, we expect the findings described here to help provide alternative plant-based formulations with greater stability and antibacterial activity.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Effective communication strategies are crucial for the success of such initiatives. The citizen science program Plastic Pirates investigated the plastic pollution of rivers and implemented a variety of communication strategies with participating schoolchildren, teachers, and youth groups (e.g., sport associations, scouts or educational vacation programs, representing approximately 6% of participating groups). These were continuously revised and adapted since its start in 2016. Without time-efficient communication and strategies to keep track of conversations, it would not have been possible to achieve the scientific and educational goals of the program, i.e., to help teachers increase the environmental awareness and scientific literacy of their schoolchildren, and to produce peer-reviewed articles based on the collected citizen science data. Communication within the Plastic Pirates program was divided into four distinct phases: 1) recruiting and motivating participants, 2) coordination and guidance of participants, 3) data reception and revision, and 4) sharing updates and results. Some of the obstacles that had to be overcome to achieve successful communication were e.g., time constraints to obtaining scientific data from the participants, the time lag between the active involvement of the participants and the actual data analysis and publication of results, and limited personnel resources available for communication efforts. Our recommendations for other citizen science practitioners include regular and transparent communication with the participants regarding their contribution, the use of adequate and various communication channels, shifting the workload from the participants to the coordinating team of a citizen science initiative, as well as offering feedback on the research findings to the citizen scientists, thereby disseminating the results of the program.","This article would not exist without the enthusiastic participation of schoolchildren, teachers, and other volunteers of the program, their contribution is the core of the success of the Plastic Pirates!

We demonstrate that the minimal discrete dark matter mechanism contains the ingredients for explaining this hierarchy. This scenario is characterized by adding new RH neutrinos and SU(2)-doublet scalars to the Standard Model as triplet representations of an A4 flavor symmetry. The A4 symmetry breaking, which occurs at the electroweak scale, leads to a residual ℤ2 symmetry responsible for the dark matter stability and dictates the neutrino phenomenology. Finally, we show that to reproduce the neutrino mixing angles correctly, it is necessary to violate CP in the scalar potential.","Work supported by the Chilean grant Fondecyt Iniciación No. 11201240 (Nu Physics); the Mexican grants CONACYT CB-2017-2018/A1-S-13051 and DGAPA-PAPIIT IN107621; and the Spanish grants PID2020-113775GB-I00 (AEI/10.13039/501100011033) and Prometeo CIPROM/2021/054 (Generalitat Valenciana).

This is within the framework of the multi-country project coordinated by UNFPA and WHO aimed at generating evidence on the role of facilitators in the delivery of CSE in non-school contexts. The research was carried out in four municipalities in northern Colombia, in rural and marginal urban contexts with conditions of vulnerability for the adolescent population, including a strong presence of migrant populations from Venezuela. A total of 150 male and female adolescents ages 10-17 participated in the formative research. Workshops such as patchwork quilt, body mapping and talking maps were used as methods to gather information. The groups were divided by sex and age (10-13 years old and 14-17 years old). Knowledge, attitudes and social norms regarding adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, and gender-based violence, were identified in adolescents (schooled and not schooled, but with minimal or no access to CSE). All of the above enabled us to establish a set of recommendations for the strengthening of the CSE strategy Tírala plena.","Special thanks to the team of Universidad del Norte that was part of the research, including Greys Jiménez, Moisés Carrillo and Gabriela Monsalvo.

However, micro-learning has become popular in e-Learning environments as a course design technique due to short attention spans, demand for small chunks of information, and time constraints. Hence, it has been selected for creating reading mobile applications provided to the nature of its learning approach. In order to describe the multiple iterations of design, development, and evaluation of this general framework, a methodology named Design-Based Research (DBR) is implemented. First, the article presents the abstract framework components and a cloud-based software architecture that allows a modular approach to creating such applications. The pathway developed through adapting the iPAC framework, which involves personalization, authenticity, and collaboration, is part of the methodology used to design the app under pedagogical and technological considerations. The process demanded the following phases: analysis and exploration, design and construction, evaluation and reflection, redesign and reconstruction, and final critical reflections. Four applied instruments also validate the framework implementation: The iPAC Rubric, an aphorisms checklist, a pre and post-test, a focus group, and a usability test taken by 28 students in a private university in Colombia. Findings indicated that Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology emerged as an appropriate tool to encounter the needs behind reading applications design due to its sequence of operations yields results successively closer to adequate usability standards and smooth implementation. They also reveal the positive impact of new types of texts on students' motivation and awareness toward other reading strategies and micro-learning. This impact indeed proved the proposed framework's effectiveness for designing micro-learning applications.",,"This work was supported by the Ministry of Sciences of Colombia (MinCiencias).

This systematic review updates the information on studies that have assessed gene expression profiles in critically ill septic patients with CAP. (2) Methods: We searched for studies that satisfied the following criteria: (a) expression profile in critically ill patients with sepsis due to CAP, (b) presence of a control group, and (c) adult patients. Over-representation analysis was performed with clusterProfiler using the Hallmark and Reactome collections. (3) Results: A total of 4312 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and sRNAs were included in the enrichment analysis. In the Hallmark collection, genes regulated by nuclear factor kappa B in response to tumor necrosis factor, genes upregulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 in response to interleukin 2 stimulation, genes upregulated in response to interferon-gamma, genes defining the inflammatory response, a subgroup of genes regulated by MYC-version 1 (v1), and genes upregulated during transplant rejection were significantly enriched in critically ill septic patients with CAP. Moreover, 88 pathways were identified in the Reactome database. (4) Conclusions: This study summarizes the reported DEGs in critically ill septic patients with CAP and investigates their functional implications.

We aimed to examine the differences in the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood at hospital admission between patients with CAP who died during hospitalization and those who survived. (2) Methods: This is a multicenter study of nonimmunosuppressed adult patients who required hospitalization for CAP. Whole blood samples were obtained within 24 h of admission for genome-expression-profile analysis. Gene expression profiling identified both differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets. (3) Results: A total of 198 samples from adult patients who required hospitalization for CAP were processed, of which 13 were from patients who died. Comparison of gene expression between patients who died and those who survived yielded 49 differentially expressed genes, 36 of which were upregulated and 13 downregulated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified four positively enriched gene sets in survivors, mainly associated with the interferon-alpha response, apoptosis, and sex hormone pathways. Similarly, GSEA identified seven positively enriched gene sets, associated with the oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and angiogenesis pathways, in the patients who died. Protein-protein-interaction-network analysis identified FOS, CDC42, SLC26A10, EIF4G2, CCND3, ASXL1, UBE2S, and AURKA as the main gene hubs.

This study examines the influence of social media on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 vaccination in Asia during the peri-pandemic period. Through a comprehensive analysis of available literature, we aim to elucidate the role of SMPs in shaping vaccination attitudes and behaviors. The findings highlight the detrimental impact of social media on vaccination efforts and provide insights into addressing vaccine hesitancy during this critical period. A narrative review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from inception to May 26, 2022. Only English-language articles involving human participants from Asian countries were included in this review. Out of the 228 articles identified through the database search, 14 articles were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy or negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in Asian countries was found to be high, ranging from 20% to 55% across countries. Notably, reliance on SMPs for vaccine-related information was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This trend coincided with the proliferation of misinformation and conspiracy theories that portrayed COVID-19 vaccines as harmful during the pandemic. Similar patterns were observed for other types of vaccines, including polio, measles mumps and rubella, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccines. The use of SMPs was also found to be associated with increased fear among caregivers in Asian countries, as well as a 3-4 times higher likelihood of delayed immunization. SMPs negatively impact vaccine intent in Asia due to misinformation and anti-vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. However, they can be a powerful tool for healthcare providers and policymakers to promote informed decision-making. Efforts should focus on leveraging SMPs to disseminate reliable information and combat hesitancy, fostering a well-informed and vaccinated population in Asia.",,,Journal of Korean Medical Science,,,Humans; Social Media; COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Vaccination; Immunization; Vaccines,2023,2023,2023,,38,40,e326,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodrigues, Flinta; Ziade, Nelly; Jatuworapruk, Kanon; Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V; Khursheed, Tayyeba; Gupta, Latika","Rodrigues, Flinta (Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra,); Ziade, Nelly (Rheumatology Department, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut,; Rheumatology Department, Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital, Beirut,); Jatuworapruk, Kanon (Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani,); Caballero-Uribe, Carlo V (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla,); Khursheed, Tayyeba (Department of Rheumatology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad,); Gupta, Latika (Department of Rheumatology, Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, Wolverhampton,; City Hospital, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham,; Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester,)","Gupta, Latika (The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust; Birmingham City Hospital; University of Manchester)","Rodrigues, Flinta (King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth G.S.

We herein aimed to assess delayed adverse events (DAEs) occurring >7 days after COVID-19 vaccination in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) versus other rheumatic autoimmune diseases (rAIDs), non-rheumatic AIDs (nrAIDs), and healthy controls (HCs).
METHODS: Self-reported data were captured within the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD)-2 online survey, which comprised >150 centres and responses from 106 countries, between February and June 2022. Logistic regression analysis adjusting for important confounders (age, sex, ethnicity) was used to compare groups.
RESULTS: Of 7203 eligible individuals, 882 (12.2%) patients had SLE, 3161 (43.9%) patients had rAIDs, 426 (5.9%) patients had nrAIDs, and 2734 (38.0%) were HCs. SLE patients had a median age of 39 years (IQR: 31-50); 93.7% were women. SLE patients reported, more frequently, major DAEs (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001) and hospitalisation (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.4-3.4; p < 0.001) compared to HCs, severe rashes (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3-4.2; p = 0.004) compared to people with rAIDS, and hospitalisation (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-4.9; p = 0.029) as well as several minor DAEs compared to people with nrAIDs. Differences were observed between vaccines in terms of frequency of major DAEs and hospitalisations, with the latter seen more frequently in patients receiving the Moderna vaccine. People with SLE with no autoimmune multimorbidity less frequently reported overall minor DAEs compared to SLE patients with comorbid nrAIDs (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-1.0; p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Hospitalisations post-vaccination were more frequent in SLE patients than in HCs. Monitoring of SLE patients following COVID-19 vaccination can help in identifying DAEs early, informing patients about expected DAEs, and supporting patients, especially those with autoimmune multimorbidity.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

We aimed to systematically review guidelines, and reports of practice and to analyze associations between timing of CC and mother-to-neonate SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early phases of the pandemic.
METHODS: Major databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to July 20, 2021.
INCLUSION: studies and guidelines describing CC practice in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy until 2 postnatal days, giving birth to live-born neonates.
EXCLUSION: no extractable data. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility and assessed study quality. Pooled prevalence rates were calculated.
RESULTS: Forty-eight studies (1476 neonates) and 40 guidelines were included. Delayed CC was recommended in 70.0% of the guidelines. Nevertheless, delayed CC was reported less often than early CC: 262/1476 (17.8%) vs 511/1476 (34.6%). Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were similar following delayed (1.2%) and early CC (1.3%). Most SARS-CoV-2 transmissions (93.3%) occurred in utero.
CONCLUSION: Delayed CC did not seem to increase mother-to-neonate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Due to its benefits, it should be encouraged even in births where the mother has a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Structural and numerical alterations in centrosomes are hallmarks of neoplastic cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. We show that a Centrosome Amplification 20 (CA20) gene signature is associated with high expression of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family member E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM69. TRIM69-ablation in cancer cells leads to centrosome scattering and chromosome segregation defects. We identify Serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (MST2) as a new direct binding partner of TRIM69. TRIM69 redistributes MST2 to the perinuclear cytoskeleton, promotes its association with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and stimulates MST2 phosphorylation at S15 (a known PLK1 phosphorylation site that is critical for centrosome disjunction). TRIM69 also promotes microtubule bundling and centrosome segregation that requires PRC1 and DYNEIN.

We aimed to analyze the ethnic disparities in the OOP payment and estimate the gaps related to observable risk factors in the OOP payment on medicines by ethnic conditions during 2014-2016 in Peru.
Study design: cross-sectional study.
Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis using the National Health User Satisfaction Survey. The outcome was the participants' OOP payment in self-reported medications. Ethnic minorities were considered participants who habitually spoke a language other than Spanish at home. Crude and adjusted linear regression models were performed, and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method was used to assess the OPP payment differential by ethnic minority condition, explained by their individual and sociodemographic characteristics.
Results: We analyzed 11,346 surveyed, the mean age was 40.78 years, and 57.67 % were women. There was lower OOP payment in medications among ethnic minorities in the adjusted analysis (Beta coefficient [β]: -0.11; 95 % confidence interval [95%CI]: -0.21 to -0.01; p = 0.043). In the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis, a gap of 0.19 USD in the OOP payment in medicines among ethnic minorities was found (p < 0.001), and the explained component by the variables measured in this research only represents 40.5 % of the gap (p = 0.001).
Conclusion: There was less OOP expenditure on medicines in ethnic minorities. However, the measured variables explain only 40.5 % of these gaps. Therefore, we recommend future research that measures other variables that explain aspects of OOP spending on medicines not identified in this research. Likewise, our findings can be used to establish policies with an intercultural approach that adapt health documents to native languages or are disseminated by trained people from their communities.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Public Health in Practice,,,,2023-10-28,2023,2023-10-28,2023-12,6,,100442,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benites-Meza, Jerry K.; Pinedo-Castillo, Liseth; Cabanillas-Lazo, Miguel; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Mougenot, Benoit; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Benites-Meza, Jerry K.

Here, we aimed to investigate whether arcuate fasciculus (AF) development is associated with pre-reading language skills in young children with PAE.
Methods: A total of 51 children with confirmed PAE (25 males; 5.6 ± 1.1 years) and 116 unexposed controls (57 males; 4.6 ± 1.2 years) underwent longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), for a total of 111 scans from participants with PAE and 381 scans in the unexposed control group. We delineated the left and right AF and extracted mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Pre-reading language ability was assessed using age-standardized phonological processing (PP) and speeded naming (SN) scores of the NEPSY-II. Linear mixed effects models were run to determine the relationship between diffusion metrics and age, group, sex, and age-by-group interactions, with subject modeled as a random factor. A secondary mixed effect model analysis assessed the influence of white matter microstructure and PAE on pre-reading language ability using diffusion metric-by-age-by-group interactions, with 51 age- and sex-matched unexposed controls.
Results: Phonological processing (PP) and SN scores were significantly lower in the PAE group (p < 0.001). In the right AF, there were significant age-by-group interactions for FA (p < 0.001) and MD (p = 0.0173). In the left AF, there was a nominally significant age-by-group interaction for MD that failed to survive correction (p = 0.0418). For the pre-reading analysis, a significant diffusion-by-age-by-group interaction was found for left FA (p = 0.0029) in predicting SN scores, and for the right FA (p = 0.00691) in predicting PP scores.
Discussion: Children with PAE showed altered developmental trajectories for the AF, compared with unexposed controls. Children with PAE, regardless of age, showed altered brain-language relationships that resembled those seen in younger typically developing children. Our findings support the contention that altered developmental trajectories in the AF may be associated with functional outcomes in young children with PAE.",We acknowledge the contributions of the APrON Study Team.

Constructing Virtual Reality (VR) narratives can then be understood as a process of inscribing text in space, and consuming them as a process of “reading” the space. Our research objective is to explore the meaning-making process afforded by spatial narratives—to test whether VR facilitates traditional ways of weaving complex, multiple narrative strands and provides new opportunities for leveraging space. We argue that, as opposed to the linear space of a printed book, a VR narrative space is similar to the physical space of a museum and can be analyzed on three distinct levels: (1) the architecture of the space itself, (2) the collection, and (3) the individual artifacts. To provide a deeper context for designing VR narratives, we designed and implemented a testbed called RealityMedia to explore digital remediations of traditional narrative devices and the spatial, immersive, and interactive affordances of VR. We conducted task-based user study using a VR headset and follow-up qualitative interviews with 20 participants. Our results highlight how the three semantic levels (space, collection, and artifacts) can work together to constitute meaningful narrative experiences in VR.",,,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,,,,2023-06-22,2023,2023-06-22,,4,,1155700,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jang, So-Youn; Park, Jisu; Engberg, Maria; MacIntyre, Blair; Bolter, Jay D.","Jang, So-Youn (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Park, Jisu (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Engberg, Maria (Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Malmö University, Malmö, Skåne, Sweden); MacIntyre, Blair (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States); Bolter, Jay D.

Gas chemical surveys and measurements of SO2 emission rates performed in the past (2006–2019) at Lastarria volcano in Northern Chile have revealed a persistent increment of magmatic sourced gas emissions since late November 2012, following a 13 years period of intense ground uplift. In this work, we provide new insights into the gas-chemical evolution of Lastarria’s fumarolic discharges obtained from direct sampling (2006–2019) and SO2 emission rates using UV camera and DOAS instruments (2018–2019) and link these to pre-existing information on ground deformation (1998–2016) in order to determine the origin of observed degassing and ground deformation processes. We revise the four mechanisms originally proposed as alternatives by Lopez et al. (Geosphere, 2018, 14 (3), 983–1007) to explain the changes observed in the fluid geochemistry and ground deformation between 2009 and 2012, in order to explain major changes in gas-geochemistry over an extended period between 1998 and 2019. We hypothesize that a continuous sequence of processes explains the evolution in the fluid geochemistry of fumarolic discharges. Two mechanisms are responsible of the changes in the gas composition during the studied period, corresponding to a 1) deep magma chamber (7–15 km depth) pressurized by volatile exsolution (1998–2020), which is responsible of the large-scale deformation; followed by 2) a crystallization-induced degassing (2001–2020) and pressurization of the hydrothermal system (2003-early November 2012), where the former process induced the changes in the gas composition from hydrothermal-dominated to magmatic-dominated, whereas the last produced the small-scale deformation at Lastarria volcano. The changes in the gas composition since late November 2012, which were strongly dominated by magmatic volatiles, produced two consecutive processes: 1) acidification (late November 2012–2020) and 2) depletion (2019–2020) of the hydrothermal system. In this work we have shown that a long-term surveillance of the chemistry of fluid discharges provides valuable insights into underlying magmatic/volcanic processes, and consequently, for forecasting future eruptions.",,"SL was funded by Beca Doctorado Nacional ANID-PCHA/ Doctorado Nacional/21160276 (Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo-ANID).

33,pub.1156259554,10.1007/978-3-031-24910-5,,,Professions and Proficiency,"This open access book takes an original view on the social production of knowledge in and across space. It explores how people build and transfer proficiency within and beyond the bounds of social groups. Social groups, such as professions, epistemic communities, or academic disciplines, collectively organize to help individuals gain understanding of and knowledge about specific subjects of expertise. Yet, at the same time, they frame legitimate ways of thinking and learning, and they sanction other ways of knowing that are collectively seen as false, inelegant, or inappropriate etc. Acknowledging the interdependency between proficiency and professions, the interdisciplinary contributions to this volume focus on three aspects. Part I looks into the social processes of professions and what actually makes qualifications, competence and proficiency. Part II elaborates on the dynamics that transform intangible knowledge by exploring, for instance, the legitimacy of scientists within society. Part III gives insights into how space influences the development of professional work, for instance, by reconstructing the historical formation of the psychology profession in Argentina. This volume provides a valuable read for scholars, students, and professionals in the fields of innovation, knowledge creation and governance.",,,Knowledge and Space,,"Johannes Glückler, Christopher Winch, Anna Mateja Punstein",,2023,2023,,2023,18,,,All OA; Gold,Edited Book,,,,,1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-24910-5,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156259554,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 44 Human Society,4 Quality Education

A previous study in a Southern region reported one of the highest prevalences of dementia in Latin America.
Objective: To investigate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment associated with low education, rurality, and demographic characteristics.
Methods: A cross-sectional study recruited a community-dwelling sample of 823 adults from rural and urban areas of two Southern provinces of Colombia from 2020-2022. Participants were assessed with a neuropsychological protocol validated in Colombia. To obtain general and region-specific prevalence rates, age, sex, schooling, and socioeconomic level were considered and controlled for.
Results: Most of the participants reported low education and socioeconomic level, the participation of women was higher. It was determined that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 53.6%, with 56.6% in the province of Caquetá followed by 51.9% in the province of Huila. The amnestic MCI represented 42.6%, the amnestic multi-domain was 39%, the non-amnestic 16.55%, and the non-amnestic multi-domain 1.81%. Our participants reported comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. We also observed a relationship between exposure to pesticides and MCI.
Conclusions: We observed one of the highest prevalences of MCI in Latin America reported to date. Variables such as age, gender, and education proved risk factors for MCI in the explored regions. Our findings are very much in line with recent studies that highlight the influence of non-canonical risk factors of dementia in underrepresented countries from Latin America.","We thank the older adults for their participation and willingness to carry out the research, the community clubs of Huila and Caquetá.","This work was supported by The Science, Technology, and Innovation Fund- Huila of the General System of Royalties through the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia [BPIN 2020000100011] Universidad Surcolombiana and Universidad de la Amazonia, and [CONADI - Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia in agreement with Universidad Surcolombiana] under Grant [INV2384].",Journal of Alzheimer's Disease Reports,,,,2023-12-29,2023,2023-12-29,,7,1,1455-1464,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bonilla-Santos, Jasmin; González-Hernández, Alfredis; Cala-Martínez, Dorian Yisela; Gómez-Morales, Duván Fernando; Calceto-Garavito, Laura Natalia; Forero-Aldana, Arnulfo Eduardo; González-Montealegre, Rodrigo Alberto; Cumaco, Yeing Alexandra Cardona; Rojas-Bernal, Luz Angela; Zabaleta-Orozco, Mario Alberto; Parra, Mario Alfredo","Bonilla-Santos, Jasmin (Department of Psychology, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Neiva, Colombia; Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); González-Hernández, Alfredis (Department of Psychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Cala-Martínez, Dorian Yisela (Department of Psychology, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Neiva, Colombia; Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Gómez-Morales, Duván Fernando (Department of Psychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Calceto-Garavito, Laura Natalia (Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Forero-Aldana, Arnulfo Eduardo (Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad de la Amazonía, Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia); González-Montealegre, Rodrigo Alberto (Neurocognition and Psychophysiology Laboratory, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Cumaco, Yeing Alexandra Cardona (Department of Psychology, Universidad de la Amazonía, Florencia, Caquetá, Colombia); Rojas-Bernal, Luz Angela (Instituto del cerebro, Hospital Universitario Mayor Méderi, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia; Clinical Neuropsychology, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia); Zabaleta-Orozco, Mario Alberto (Hernando Moncaleano University Hospital, Neiva, Colombia); Parra, Mario Alfredo (Department of Psychological Sciences and Health, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK)","González-Hernández, Alfredis (South Colombian University); Parra, Mario Alfredo (University of Strathclyde)","Bonilla-Santos, Jasmin (Cooperative University of Colombia; South Colombian University); González-Hernández, Alfredis (South Colombian University); Cala-Martínez, Dorian Yisela (Cooperative University of Colombia; South Colombian University); Gómez-Morales, Duván Fernando (South Colombian University); Calceto-Garavito, Laura Natalia (South Colombian University); Forero-Aldana, Arnulfo Eduardo (University of the Amazon); González-Montealegre, Rodrigo Alberto (South Colombian University); Cumaco, Yeing Alexandra Cardona (University of the Amazon); Rojas-Bernal, Luz Angela (Universidad del Rosario; South Colombian University); Zabaleta-Orozco, Mario Alberto (Hernando Moncaleano University Hospital, Neiva, Colombia); Parra, Mario Alfredo (University of Strathclyde)",0,0,,,https://content.iospress.com:443/download/journal-of-alzheimers-disease-reports/adr230041?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease-reports%2Fadr230041,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167519693,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

This paradigm allows the interpretation and study of phenomena from their own complexity. In public health, qualitative research has gained ground, as it allows the study of subjective aspects of the health-disease process.
Objective: To describe and analyze qualitative research on health issues published in Colombian journals between 2011 and 2021.
Materials and methods: A descriptive study on qualitative health research published in Colombian journals between 2011 and 2021 was carried out.
Results: Eighty-one articles were included. The journal with the highest number of publications was the Revista de Salud Pública (44.4%). The year with the highest
production corresponded to 2019 and the main design was the fundamental theory (17.3%). In 79% of the articles, women were the main author and nursing was the most frequent profession of undergraduate training. The most frequent topic was HIV/AIDS (12.3%), followed by cancer (11.1%). In 24.6% of the studies, a software was used for the analysis.
Conclusions: Qualitative research in public health has had a variable dynamic in scientific production between 2011 and 2021. Despite its benefits, the adoption of computer programs for qualitative analysis is rare. Nursing stands out as the area that concentrates the largest number of qualitative studies in public health with contributions on topics such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.",,Ninguna persona o entidad ha contribuido financieramente en el desarrollo de este artículo.,Biomédica,,,Humans; COVID-19; Retrospective Studies,2023-03-30,2023,2023-03-30,,43,1,69-82,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)","Rodríguez-Gómez, Rodolfo (Asesor metodológico en investigación en salud, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia)",2,1,,,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/6476/5194,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157585001,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, the literature needs more clarification on the determinants of ex ante determinants for community participation in ecotourism in coastal lagoon ecosystems. This paper aims to analyze community-based ecosystem management through participation in ecotourism. After a case study design, a survey-like method was used to identify the social willingness to engage in ecotourism and the benefits that the participants preferred as a result of participating. The results show that most respondents believe that ecotourism would promote environmental conservation in the area and also considered their participation essential to ensure the success of ecotourism. Therefore, this research emphasizes the importance of identifying local perceptions of ecotourism before its implementation, evaluates the willingness of locals to participate in this strategy to highlight community agency, and investigates how participation could be achieved. These results are useful for future research and studies on the willingness to take part in ecotourism studies and the understanding of the relationship between society and ecosystems.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest Acknowledgement We thank Universidad De la Costa (Barranquilla, Colombia) for support the project “Análisis de las Condiciones para el Desarrollo de un Programa de Ecoturismo Comunitario en la Ciénaga de Mallorquín Barrio La Playa Barranquilla- Atlántico”.

They aim to deny and justify men's sexual assault against women. This study evaluates the mediating effect of modern rape myths on the relationship between gender system justification and attribution of blame to both victim and perpetrator in a fictional case of sexual violence. A total of 375 individuals residing in Chile, 255 women and 120 men, 19-81 years (M = 37.6 SD = 13.06) participated in the study. Results from a Structural Equation Model show that gender system justification is directly related to the attribution of blame to the victim, showing an indirect relationship throughout the modern rape myth. However, gender system justification and attribution of blame to the aggressor are indirectly related, being mediated by modern rape myths. The study of the relationship between the acceptance of modern rape myths, gender-specific system justification, and victim and aggressor blame for rape is a contribution to understanding beliefs justifying sexual violence against women.",We would like to express special gratitude to all the participants for their generous contributions that made this work possible.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Male; Humans; Female; Rape; Crime Victims; Sex Offenses; Social Perception; Attitude,2023-01-17,2023,2023-01-17,,20,3,1663,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murray, Carol; Calderón, Carlos; Bahamondes, Joaquín","Murray, Carol (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Calderón, Carlos (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.); Bahamondes, Joaquín (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avenida Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.)","Murray, Carol (Catholic University of the North)","Murray, Carol (Catholic University of the North); Calderón, Carlos (Catholic University of the North); Bahamondes, Joaquín (Catholic University of the North)",6,6,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/3/1663/pdf?version=1673943216,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154615891,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4805 Legal Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 5 Gender Equality"

Upon complete characterization, the virus is shown to belong to the Drexlerviridae family and is a member of the Webervirus genus located within the (formerly) T1-like cluster of phages. Its double-stranded (dsDNA) genome is 47,844 bp long and is predicted to have 74 protein-coding sequences (CDS). After challenging a variety of K. pneumoniae strains with phage KL-2146, grown on the NDM-1 positive strain BAA-2146, polyvalence was shown for a single antibiotic-sensitive strain, K. pneumoniae 13,883, with a very low initial infection efficiency in liquid culture. However, after one or more cycles of infection in K. pneumoniae 13,883, nearly 100% infection efficiency was achieved, while infection efficiency toward its original host, K. pneumoniae BAA-2146, was decreased. This change in host specificity is reversible upon re-infection of the NDM-1 positive strain (BAA-2146) using phages grown on the NDM-1 negative strain (13883). In biofilm infectivity experiments, the polyvalent nature of KL-2146 was demonstrated with the killing of both the multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae BAA-2146 and drug-sensitive 13,883 in a multi-strain biofilm. The ability to infect an alternate, antibiotic-sensitive strain makes KL-2146 a useful model for studying phages infecting the NDM-1+ strain, K. pneumoniae BAA-2146.

These elements contribute to increased pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance through genes that are related to the formation of biofilms and resistance genes contained in plasmids, integrons, and transposons. One hundred and thirty-three Salmonella isolates from different stages of the production line, such as feed manufacturing, hatchery, broiler farm, poultry farm, and slaughterhouse, were identified, serotyped and sequenced. The most predominant serotype was Salmonella Infantis. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the diversity and spread of strains in the pipeline are serotype-independent, and that isolates belonging to the same serotype are very closely related genetically. On the other hand, Salmonella Infantis isolates carried the pESI IncFIB plasmid harboring a wide variety of resistance genes, all linked to mobile genetic elements, and among carriers of these plasmids, the antibiograms showed differences in resistance profiles and this linked to a variety in plasmid structure, similarly observed in the diversity of Salmonella Heidelberg isolates carrying the IncI1-Iα plasmid. Mobile genetic elements encoding resistance and virulence genes also contributed to the differences in gene content. Antibiotic resistance genotypes were matched closely by the resistance phenotypes, with high frequency of tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins resistance. In conclusion, the contamination in the poultry industry is described throughout the entire production line, with mobile genetic elements leading to multi-drug resistant bacteria, thus promoting survival when challenged with various antimicrobial compounds.","Genome sequencing was carried out by SeqCenter (https://www.seqcenter.com).

Where, the unstudied generalities about the design of gears have generated negative consequences in functionality and have generated catastrophic failures that have produced unexpected stoppages of mechanical processes, for which understanding their causes becomes essential. Considering, for the calculation of the abrasive wear of the tribological pairs in heavy machinery, it will depend on the degree of grinding or size of the abrasive particles, the hardness, the material of the base gear, the lubrication regime and the geometric conditions that determine the nature of tribological contact, as well as the time and speed of use of heavy machinery.

Environmental and genetic factors that interfere with the neurulation process promote neural tube defects (NTDs). Connexins (Cxs) are transmembrane proteins that form gap junctions (GJs) and hemichannels (HCs) in vertebrates, allowing cell-cell (GJ) or paracrine (HCs) communication through the release of ATP, glutamate, and NAD+; regulating processes such as cell migration and synaptic transmission. Changes in the state of phosphorylation and/or the intracellular redox potential activate the opening of HCs in different cell types. Cxs such as Cx43 and Cx32 have been associated with proliferation and migration at different stages of CNS development. Here, using molecular and cellular biology techniques (permeability), we demonstrate the expression and functionality of HCs-Cxs, including Cx46 and Cx32, which are associated with the release of ATP during the neurulation process in Xenopus laevis. Furthermore, applications of FGF2 and/or changes in intracellular redox potentials (DTT), well known HCs-Cxs modulators, transiently regulated the ATP release in our model. Importantly, the blockade of HCs-Cxs by carbenoxolone (CBX) and enoxolone (ENX) reduced ATP release with a concomitant formation of NTDs. We propose two possible and highly conserved binding sites (N and E) in Cx46 that may mediate the pharmacological effect of CBX and ENX on the formation of NTDs. In summary, our results highlight the importance of ATP release mediated by HCs-Cxs during neurulation.",,"ANID Fondecyt Regular N° 1231038 (P.A.C.); FONDECYT Inicio 11160562 (P.A.C.); VRID-UdeC 220.033.112-4 (P.A.C.); Fondecyt 11221211 (C.F.B.); Fondecyt 1211095 (G.M.-C.); Fondecyt 1200908 (JF); ANID Fondecyt Regular N° 1211473 (L.B.-G.); Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain (MiNuSPain, NCN19_038) (G.E.Y. and Claudio Coddou).

As a conclusion the research shows that the practics of arts in Bogotá are strongly hierarchical and its integration capacity depends on the social and cultural capital that migrants have, so democratizing the means for their production, as well as the spaces for art publication and the promotion of cooperation networks among migrants, is one of the most outstanding final recommendations.",,,Ciudad Paz-ando,,,,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,,16,1,72-87,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera, Cindy Marcela Sierra","Rivera, Cindy Marcela Sierra (Instituto para la Pedagogía, la Paz y el Conflicto Urbano de la Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas – IPAZUD)",,"Rivera, Cindy Marcela Sierra (District University of Bogotá)",0,0,,,https://revistas.udistrital.edu.co/index.php/cpaz/article/download/20623/19273,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160580783,"44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",

Our objective was to characterize the theses for obtaining a medical degree in Peru.
Methods: An observational and descriptive study evaluating the theses for obtaining a medical degree of 2019, evaluated in January 2022 from 22 universities that are full members of the Peruvian Association of Faculties of Medicine. Characteristics of the universities and theses were evaluated, including the evaluation of a institutional research ethics committee, the aligment with a national research priority, and publication status in a scientific journal. The absolute and relative frequencies of the study variables were described.
Results: A total of 1838 theses were evaluated. Most of the theses were written by a single student (66.16%). The most common study design was the descriptive cross-sectional type (42.33%). We found that 53.86% of the theses responded to a national research priority, the most common being ""maternal, perinatal and neonatal health"" (26.01%). Of the total, 56.75% did not indicate whether they had the approval of an institutional research ethics committee. Only 40 theses (2.19%) were published in a scientific journal (14 in indexed journals).
Conclusion: Two-thirds of the theses conducted by medical students in Peru are descriptive studies. Half respond to national research priorities. Four out of ten theses were approved by an institutional research ethics committee. The number of published theses is low. The results show shortcomings in university institutional policies that encourage ethical compliance and research development.",,,Medwave,,,"Infant, Newborn; Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru",2023-04-17,2023,2023-04-17,,23,03,e2630-e2630,All OA; Gold,Article,"Angulo-Fernandez, Kevyn Javier; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Soto-Ordoñez, Suly; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido","Angulo-Fernandez, Kevyn Javier (Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Perú.); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Perú.); Soto-Ordoñez, Suly (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en salud e Investigación, Lima, Perú.); Bendezu-Quispe, Guido (Centro de Investigación Epidemiológica en Salud Global, Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.)",,"Angulo-Fernandez, Kevyn Javier (Peruvian University of Applied Sciences); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Private University of the North); Soto-Ordoñez, Suly (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en salud e Investigación, Lima, Perú.); Bendezu-Quispe, Guido (Universidad Norbert Wiener)",2,2,,,https://www.medwave.cl/medios/investigacion/estudios/2630/medwave_2022_2630.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157327754,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In the open ocean, this is where marine organisms, ranging from plankton to mesopelagic fish up to megafauna, gather and where most fishing activities concentrate. Fronts are critical ecosystems so that understanding their spatio-temporal variability is essential not only for conservation goals but also to ensure sustainable fisheries. The Mozambique Channel (MC) is an ideal laboratory to study ocean front variability due to its energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, its high biodiversity and the currently debated conservation initiatives. Meanwhile, fronts detection relying solely on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cannot access aspects of the subsurface frontal activity that may be relevant for understanding ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we used the Belkin and O’Reilly Algorithm on remotely-sensed SST and hindcasts of a high-resolution nested ocean model to investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of temperature fronts at different depths in the MC. We find that the seasonally varying spatial patterns of frontal activity can be interpreted as resulting from main features of the mean circulation in the MC region. In particular, horizontally, temperature fronts are intense and frequent along continental shelves, in islands’ wakes, at the edge of eddies, and in the pathways of both North-East Madagascar Current (NEMC) and South-East Madagascar Current (SEMC). In austral summer, thermal fronts in the MC are mainly associated with the Angoche upwelling and seasonal variability of the Mozambique current. In austral winter, thermal fronts in the MC are more intense when the NEMC and the Seychelles-Chagos and South Madagascar upwelling cells intensify. Vertically, the intensity of temperature fronts peaks in the vicinity of the mean thermocline. Considering the marked seasonality of frontal activity evidenced here and the dynamical connections of the MC circulation with equatorial variability, our study calls for addressing longer timescales of variability to investigate how ocean ecosystem/front interactions will evolve with climate change.",This work was supported by the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography (MIO) and the French National Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD).

214,pub.1158864111,10.3390/met13061079,,,Cobalt and Manganese Extraction from Ocean Nodules by Co-Processing with Steel Metallurgical Slag,"Polymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules (due to their high content of this element), contain various valuable metals such as Cu, Ni and Co. These seabed minerals are a good alternative source of Co and Mn due to the decrease in the grade of mineral deposits on the earth’s surface. For the treatment of manganese nodules, acid-reducing leaching is apparently the most attractive, due to its low cost compared to other processes, short operational times, and it is more friendly to the environment. In this investigation, the extraction of Mn and Co from manganese nodules from two different locations was studied in acid media and by reusing a steel slag obtained from a steel smelting process. An ANOVA analysis was performed to determine the most appropriate Manganese Nodule/Fe(res) ratio and time to dissolve Co and Mn from the nodules. Effect of temperature on the process was evaluated, and then a residue analysis was carried out. Finally, it was discovered that the best results were obtained when working at 60 °C in a time of 15 min, obtaining extractions of approximately 98% Mn and 55% Co. Additionally, the formation of polluting elements was not observed, nor the precipitation of Mn and Co species in the studied residues.","Pedro Robles thanks project Fondecyt 1221702 for supporting this investigation and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso for the support provided.

191,pub.1160324492,10.3389/fmars.2023.1128527,,,Navigating transformations from artisanal fishers to entrepreneurial scallop farmers in Chile,"The expansion of neoliberalization of fisheries in developing countries has been largely driven by political economic decisions. Artisanal fisheries and aquaculture have not been exempt from these privatization measures, the implementation of deregulation measures in the fisheries sector, and commoditization strategies oriented mainly to exports. However, little research has been done about these issues jointly in South America. Therefore, the adoption of these measures and the adaptation and transformation of artisanal fishermen to entrepreneurs were studied in the scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) fishery/aquaculture in Tongoy Bay, Chile. We use qualitative research and an analysis of historical archives to describe a series of political-economic changes, stages, and processes involved in the transformation of the sector. The analysis focuses on conflicts, resistance practices, and value regimes between fishers and farmers to explore the different moral economies at play. Our results show that (a) changes in moral economies are neither automatic nor unidirectional; (b) the State, through its economic policy, technological development institutions, and technology transfer actions, does not directly generate expected results; (c) artisanal fishers who have become entrepreneurs understand and justify competitiveness (or lack of it) because some are more entrepreneurial than others; (d) despite the adoption of neoliberal guidelines, aspects of a more traditional moral economy remain, such as the role of family units in the configuration of enterprises; and, finally, (e) artisanal fishers have moved from a traditional moral economy based on collective and historical rights to a neoliberal moral economy based on the individual and his or her capacity for self-improvement, entrepreneurship, and efficient work management.","We thank Manuel Andrade from the Subsecretaria de Pesca y Acuicultura (SUBPESCA), and Luis Espinoza and Caroline Agullo from the Servicio Nacional de Pesca y Acuicultura (SERNAPESCA) for their advice and access to data.

176,pub.1160759383,10.3389/fmars.2023.1155227,,,Petrale sole transboundary connectivity and settlement success: a biophysical approach,"Connectivity between inferred spawning areas and potential settlement areas of the petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) was explored in the California Current System (CCS) using an individual-based model (IBM) coupled with the ROMS hydrodynamic model for the period 1988-2008. The IBM modeled pelagic early life stages, including egg and larval development, growth, natural mortality and settlement into benthos. Eggs were released within discrete spawning grounds identified from the winter fishery logbook data. Potential settlement areas were defined based on bathymetrical criteria and juvenile (2-year old) distribution from a groundfish bottom trawl survey. The influence of cross-shelf and alongshore advection on the transport and connectivity between spawning and benthic settlement areas was explored by identifying the location of juveniles (22 mm length) among the potential settlement areas. The most important spawning regions varied over time with between 4 and 19% of spawned individuals successfully settling, mostly ranging from off northern Washington to northern Oregon. The strong influence of northward alongshore transport resulted in transboundary transport of pelagic life stages from U.S. spawning grounds to inner shelf settlement areas in Canadian waters, with 33.9-70.4% (average 49.7 ± 9.6) of annual successful juveniles settling in Canada. Interannual variability in juvenile settlement success suggests that mesoscale (100-200 km) oceanographic structures play a major role defining pelagic juvenile transport trajectories. While, in some years, the presence of coastal cyclonic eddies can retain juveniles off Oregon, the strong northward transport supplies a large number of juveniles to Moresby and Vancouver island, clearly showing that petrale sole off the west coast of North America are a transboundary stock with important settlement areas off the coast of British Columbia, thus extension of this study into Canadian waters is particularly relevant.","We thank Vladlena Gertseva, Owen Hamel, and the two journal reviewers who provided comments that improved this manuscript.",This research was funded by the NOAA NMFS Fisheries and the Environment Program.

Paleoenvironmental records in this part of the semiarid Andes are key to estimating the effects of past climate changes on local communities helping to forecast the ecological and biological responses under the aridification trend projected during the 21st century. Here we present a 2400-year multiproxy paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on pollen, diatoms, chironomids, sedimentological and geochemical data (XRF and ICP-MS data) of Laguna El Calvario (29°S; 3994 m a.s.l), a small and shallow Andean lake. Four main hydrological phases were established based on changes in the lithogenic and geochemical results associated with allochthonous runoff input and the subsequent response of the biological proxies. Between 2400 and 1400 cal yrs BP, wetter than present conditions occurred based on the intense weathering of the lake basin and the dominance of upper Andean vegetation. A decrease in moisture along with sub-centennial discrete wet pulses and lake-level changes occurred until ~800 cal yrs BP followed long-term stable climate conditions between 1850 and 1950 AD as suggested by a drop in vegetation productivity and low lake levels. From 1950 AD to the present, a decline in moisture with a severe trend to drier conditions occurring in the last decades occurred as reflected by an upward vegetation belt displacement around Laguna El Calvario along with a turnover of diatom assemblages and high productivity in the water column.","We thank Andres Zamora for his assistance during the coring collection campaign, Leonardo D.

123,pub.1163670524,10.3847/1538-4357/ace9b8,,,A Tale of Two Disks: Mapping the Milky Way with the Final Data Release of APOGEE,"We present new maps of the Milky Way disk showing the distribution of metallicity ([Fe/H]), α-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]), and stellar age, using a sample of 66,496 red giant stars from the final data release (DR17) of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey. We measure radial and vertical gradients, quantify the distribution functions for age and metallicity, and explore chemical clock relations across the Milky Way for the low-α disk, high-α disk, and total population independently. The low-α disk exhibits a negative radial metallicity gradient of −0.06 ± 0.001 dex kpc−1, which flattens with distance from the midplane. The high-α disk shows a flat radial gradient in metallicity and age across nearly all locations of the disk. The age and metallicity distribution functions shift from negatively skewed in the inner Galaxy to positively skewed at large radius. Significant bimodality in the [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane and in the [Mg/Fe]–age relation persist across the entire disk. The age estimates have typical uncertainties of ∼0.15 in log(age) and may be subject to additional systematic errors, which impose limitations on conclusions drawn from this sample. Nevertheless, these results act as critical constraints on galactic evolution models, constraining which physical processes played a dominant role in the formation of the Milky Way disk. We discuss how radial migration predicts many of the observed trends near the solar neighborhood and in the outer disk, but an additional more dramatic evolution history, such as the multi-infall model or a merger event, is needed to explain the chemical and age bimodality elsewhere in the Galaxy.","We would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for providing useful feedback toward improving this manuscript.

While some products become outdated due to natural causes such as wear and tear or technological advancements, others are strategically designed with a predetermined shelf life to encourage rapid product turnover. Obsolescence is an essential issue in product design because of its impact on product life, efficiency, and sustainability. Although there are approaches to map and measure possible product obsolescence scenarios, it remains a challenge to quantify and diagnose a product's or component's obsolescence potential based on its design attributes. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the existing literature on obsolescence from a product design perspective. It covers its application in methodological design strategies, metrics for measuring obsolescence from early design stages, and identifying understudied research topics, challenges, and trends. On August 15, 2023, a total of 221 articles published between 1983 and 2023 on SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were selected and analyzed using a content-based research approach encompassing three main aspects: objectives and methodologies, strategies and design phases, and metrics for obsolescence analysis. As main findings, this literature review identified several methodological design approaches aimed at resisting and postponing obsolescence, mainly divided into designing long-life products and extending product life. Nevertheless, this study found no formal identification of product design attributes related to the different types of obsolescence, and obsolescence forecasting metrics have focused on defining whether the scenario happens but do not consider what type of obsolescence the product may exhibit. Consequently, it can be challenging to determine the most effective design strategy to reduce obsolescence. This study has limitations, including the potential for researcher bias to affect the systematization of the information.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Lesly Sierra-Fontalvo financial support was provided by Universidad del Norte.,"This research work was supported by Vicerrectoría de Investigación, Creación e Innovación, Universidad del Norte under contract UN-OJ-2022-57,010.",Heliyon,,,,2023-11-04,2023,2023-11-04,2023-11,9,11,e21856,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Mesa, Jaime A.","Sierra-Fontalvo, Lesly (GIMYP Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Mesa, Jaime A.

Case definitions for the three arboviral infections overlap.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out. A bivariate analysis was made using confirmed CHIKV infection as the outcome. Variables with significant statistical association were included in an agreement consensus. Agreed variables were analyzed in a multiple regression model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine a cut-off value and performance.
RESULTS: 295 patients with confirmed CHIKV infection were included. A screening tool was created using symmetric arthritis (4 points), fatigue (3 points), rash (2 points), and ankle joint pain (1 point). The ROC curve identified a cut-off value, and a score ≥ 5.5 was considered positive for identifying CHIKV patients with a sensibility of 64.4% and a specificity of 87.4%, positive predictive value of 85.5%, negative predictive value of 67.7%, area under the curve of 0.72, and an accuracy of 75%.
CONCLUSION: We developed a screening tool for CHIKV diagnosis using only clinical symptoms as well as proposed an algorithm to aid the primary care physician.",None.,"This work was supported by the Colombian Rheumatology Association (ACTA 169 10 July 2015), Universidad de La Sabana (MED-197-2015), and COLCIENCIAS doctoral scholarship (757-2016).",Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease,,,,2023-04-03,2023,2023-04-03,,8,4,213,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rueda, Juan C.; Peláez-Ballestas, Ingris; Angarita, Jose-Ignacio; Santos, Ana M.; Pinzon, Carlos; Saldarriaga, Eugenia-Lucia; Rueda, Jorge M.; Forero, Elias; Saaibi, Diego L.; Pavía, Paula X.; Mantilla, Marta Juliana; Rodríguez-Salas, Gustavo; Santacruz, Juan Camilo; Rueda, Igor; Cardiel, Mario H.; Londono, John","Rueda, Juan C.

For the determination and analysis of Irgafos P-168, DSC, HPLC-MS, and FTIR methodologies were used. Solid phase extraction (SPE) proved to be the best technique for extracting Irgafos from wastewater. HPLC-MS and SPE determined the repeatability, reproducibility, and linearity of the method and the SPE of the standards and samples. The relative standard deviations, errors, and correlation coefficients for the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration curves were less than 4.4% and 4.2% and greater than 0.99955, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), using the Fisher method with confidence in 95% of the data, did not reveal significant differences between the mentioned parameters. The removal of the antioxidant from the wastewater by SPE showed recovery percentages higher than 91.03%, and the chemical characterization of this antioxidant by FTIR spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, and MS showed it to be structurally the same as the Irgafos P-168 molecule. The recovered Irgafos was added to the polypropylene matrix, significantly improving its oxidation times. An OIT analysis, performed using DSC, showed that the recovered Irgafos-blended polypropylene (PP) demonstrated oxidative degradation at 8 min. With the addition of the Irgafos, the oxidation time was 13 min. This increases the polypropylene's useful life and minimizes the environmental impact of the wastewater.",,This research received no external funding.,Molecules,,Mohamad Nasir Mohamad Ibrahim,,2023-04-02,2023,2023-04-02,,28,7,3163,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Cano, Heidis; Reyes, Ana Fonseca","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia.; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Turbaco 130001, Colombia.; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 30300, Colombia.); Cano, Heidis (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia.); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Cano, Heidis (University of the Coast); Reyes, Ana Fonseca (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/7/3163/pdf?version=1680427127,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156943796,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 3405 Organic Chemistry,

The study aimed to generate evidence of the validity of the mental and physical health symptomatology scale in two samples of vulnerable groups: emerging university adults, who report high levels of mental health problems, and migrants, who report high levels of physical and mental health problems. Using non-probability sampling, in the first study, evidence of construct validity of the scale was reported in 652 emerging adults and, in the second, evidence of validity was provided from associations with the depression, stress and anxiety scale (DASS-21) among 283 migrants. The results indicate that in Study 1 the two-factor model had adequate indicators of fit and adequate reliability; only the mental health factor presented evidence of convergent validity. In Study 2, the mental health factor showed positive and large associations with the DASS-21, which decreased when the physical health symptoms factor was considered. These analyses provide evidence of validity for the scale, which is an easy-to-use instrument that allows for the assessment of health from an integral perspective.",The authors would like to thank all the participants who responded to the survey.,This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) through the program Fondecyt Iniciación Grant No. 11200984 and Grant No. 11181020.

In Latin American countries, Colombia is historically one of the most affected by epidemics of this flavivirus. The underreporting of signs and symptoms of probable cases of dengue, the lack of characterization of the serotypes of the infection, and the few detailed studies of postmortem necropsies of patients are among other conditions that have delayed progress in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease. This study presents the results of fragment sequencing assays on paraffin-embedded tissue samples from fatal DENV cases during the 2010 epidemic in Colombia.

The few studies that focused on Northern Nigeria mostly examined individual correlates, but largely ignored the community correlates. Also, the persistence of armed insurgencies in the region calls for more research attention. This study examines the utilization and the associated individual and community factors of insecticide-treated nets in Northern Nigeria.MethodsThe study adopted a cross-sectional design. Data were extracted from the 2021 Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS). A weighted sample size of 6873 women was analysed. The outcome variable was the utilization of insecticide-treated nets. The explanatory variables selected at the individual/household level were maternal age, maternal education, parity, religion, sex of head of household, household wealth, and household size. The variables selected at the community level were the type of place of residence, geo-political zone of residence, the proportion of children under five who slept under a bed net, the proportion of women aged 15–49 who heard malaria media messages, and the community literacy level. Two variables, namely, the number of mosquito bed nets in the household, and the number of rooms used for sleeping were included for statistical control. Three multilevel mixed-effect regression models were fitted.ResultsThe majority of childbearing women (71.8%) utilized insecticide-treated nets. Parity and household size were the significant individual/household characteristics associated with the utilization of insecticide-treated nets. The proportion of under-five children in the community who slept under mosquito bed nets, and the geopolitical zone of residence were significant community correlates of the use of insecticide-treated nets. In addition, the number of rooms for sleeping, and the number of mosquito bed nets in the households were significantly associated with the utilization of insecticide-treated nets.ConclusionParity, household size, number of sleeping rooms, number of treated bed nets, geo-political zone of residence, and proportion of under-five children sleeping under bed nets are important associated factors of the utilization of insecticide-treated nets in Northern Nigeria. Existing malaria preventive initiatives should be strengthened to target these characteristics.",The authors express gratitude to MEASURE DHS and National Malaria Elimination Programme (Nigeria) for granting permission to access the 2021 NMIS datasets.,Not applicable.,Malaria Journal,,,Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Insecticides; Malaria; Mosquito Control; Nigeria; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged,2023-06-16,2023,2023-06-16,,22,1,184,All OA; Gold,Article,"Solanke, Bola Lukman; Soladoye, Daniel Alabi; Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu; Abdurraheem, Anifat; Salau, Omowumi Romoke","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria); Soladoye, Daniel Alabi (Department of Demography and Social Statistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria); Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu (Department of Sociology, Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria); Abdurraheem, Anifat (Department of Sociology, Federal University, Dutsin-ma, Nigeria); Salau, Omowumi Romoke (Department of Clinical Nursing Services, UHD Trust, Royal Bournemouth Dorset, Bournemouth, UK)","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Obafemi Awolowo University)","Solanke, Bola Lukman (Obafemi Awolowo University); Soladoye, Daniel Alabi (Obafemi Awolowo University); Birsirka, Ibrahim Adamu (Bayero University Kano); Abdurraheem, Anifat (Federal University Dutsin-Ma); Salau, Omowumi Romoke (Department of Clinical Nursing Services, UHD Trust, Royal Bournemouth Dorset, Bournemouth, UK)",2,2,,,https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12936-023-04620-4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159886402,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,3 Good Health and Well Being

It is the causative agent of the primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Focused on our interest to develop promising lead structures for the development of antiparasitic agents, this study was aimed at identifying new anti-Naegleria marine natural products from a collection of chamigrane-type sesquiterpenes with structural variety in the levels of saturation, halogenation and oxygenation isolated from Laurencia dendroidea. (+)-Elatol (1) was the most active compound against Naegleria fowleri trophozoites with IC50 values of 1.08 μM against the ATCC 30808™ strain and 1.14 μM against the ATCC 30215™ strain. Furthermore, the activity of (+)-elatol (1) against the resistant stage of N. fowleri was also assessed, showing great cysticidal properties with a very similar IC50 value (1.14 µM) to the one obtained for the trophozoite stage. Moreover, at low concentrations (+)-elatol (1) showed no toxic effect towards murine macrophages and could induce the appearance of different cellular events related to the programmed cell death, such as an increase of the plasma membrane permeability, reactive oxygen species overproduction, mitochondrial malfunction or chromatin condensation. Its enantiomer (-)-elatol (2) was shown to be 34-fold less potent with an IC50 of 36.77 μM and 38.03 μM. An analysis of the structure-activity relationship suggests that dehalogenation leads to a significant decrease of activity. The lipophilic character of these compounds is an essential property to cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore they represent interesting chemical scaffolds to develop new drugs.",,"This work was funded by Project PID2019-109476RB-C21 (BIOALGRI) (Spanish Ministry of Science, Madrid, Spain), Proyecto Intramural Especial CSIC [Ref. 202280I032]; N.N. was funded by the Agustín de Betancourt Programme (Cabildo de Tenerife, TFinnova Programme supported by MEDI and FDCAN funds).

However, the underreporting of the disease is an unfortunate reality, with a clear trend towards a decrease in cases since 2019, when the guidelines for its confirmatory diagnosis changed with the requirement of two paired samples. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of leptospirosis. While the access to rapid diagnosis is available at practically all levels of care for dengue and malaria, leptospirosis-a doubly neglected disease-deserves recognition as a serious public health problem in Colombia. In this manner, it is proposed that molecular tests are a viable diagnostic alternative that can improve the targeted treatment of the patient and the timeliness of data and case reporting to SIVIGILA, and reduce the underreporting of the disease. Taking advantage of the strengthened technological infrastructure derived from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for molecular diagnosis in Colombia, with a network of 227 laboratories distributed throughout the national territory, with an installed capacity for PCR testing, it is proposed that molecular diagnosis can be used as an alternative for early diagnosis. This would allow case confirmation through the public health network in Colombia, and, together with the microagglutination (MAT) technique, the epidemiological surveillance of this disease in this country would be strengthened.",,"This study was supported by the Fogarty International Center and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number D43 TW010331.

Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with an interpretive hermeneutic approach, using semi-structured interviews developed in the Metropolitan Area of Aburrá Valley, Bogotá, and the Colombian coffee-growing region.
Results: Fifty-five interviews were conducted. Of the total number of people interviewed, 60% were cisgender men, 31% were cisgender women, and 9% were transgender women. The average age of the participants was 27 years. Sixty-nine percent were irregular migrants in Colombia. Only 11% were affiliated with the health system. It was observed that condom use is inconsistent among sex workers, depending on personal and social factors.
Conclusions: The factors that influence condom use in sex workers of Venezuelan origin in Colombia are determined by various factors, both personal and social. Personal factors relate to knowledge, support networks, and risk perception, while social factors are associated with substance use, stigma and discrimination, and the places where sex work is done. Social factors are the ones that most influence inconsistent condom use in cisgender men and transgender women.",,"Este trabajo ha sido financiado por el Programa Especial de Investigación, Desarrollo y Capacitación para la Investigación en Reproducción Humana (HRP) del PNUD-UNFPA-UNICEF-OMS-Banco Mundial, y por el Programa Especial de Investigación y Capacitación en Enfermedades Tropicales (TDR) de UNICEF-PNUD-Banco Mundial-OMS, ambos programas copatrocinados por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).",BULL PAN AM HEALTH ORGAN,,,,2023-03-03,2023,2023-03-03,2023-03-03,47,,e2,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo; Rojas, Soraya Villegas","Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios - UNIMINUTO, Bogotá, Colombia, Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios - UNIMINUTO, Bogotá, Colombia.); Rojas, Soraya Villegas (Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia)","Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios)","Pineda, Jair Eduardo Restrepo (Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios); Rojas, Soraya Villegas (Technological University of Pereira)",4,4,,,https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/10665.2/57086/1/v47e22023.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155280788,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Endoscopic management involving the topical application of 50 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and clipping systems has favorable results and a low incidence of complications. However, it has been reported that multiple applications are necessary to achieve adequate closure. Methods This therapeutic study describes a preliminary 5-step double endoscopic approach involving topical application of 50 % TCA and clips such as the OTS/OVESCO System. Results The rTEF was completely closed in three patients (n = 3); in 2/3 of patients, the OTS/OVESCO system was used. Postoperative esophagogram confirmed the obliteration of the defect, and no patient presented with complications during the 3-year follow-up, with complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. Conclusions This preliminary study suggests that the 5-step dual endoscopic approach for closure of the rTEF is effective for both symptom resolution and complete closure of the tracheoesophageal communication.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Pediatric Surgery Open,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,4,,100098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal; Pérez-Tirado, Amiel Alberto; Jaramillo-Guerra, Laura Vanessa; Felix-Burgos, Jovany Tarek","Abello-Munarriz, Cristóbal (Chief of Pediatric Surgery, Clínica General del Norte.

Measuring the life expectancy of Portuguese telecommunications companies using generalized log-gamma (GLG) distribution is a new research endeavor. Regarding the new theoretical contributions, original expressions for the moments and mode of the GLG distribution are presented. In this empirical study, data on the entrepreneurial fabric in the Information and Communication sector from 2004 to 2018, when some companies were born or died, were used. In addition to the GLG, three other statistical distributions with two parameters are analyzed: gamma, Weibull, and log-normal. Maximum likelihood parameters and confidence intervals for survival probabilities are estimated and compared. The Akaike information criterion is used to compare the performance of the four estimated models. The results show that GLG distribution is a promising solution to assess the resilience and longevity of a firm.","This work is partially financed by national funds through FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under the project UIDB/00006/2020.

The present research has a double objective: on the one hand, it seeks to validate the psychometric properties of the TPACK-ES scale in the Spanish context; and on the other hand, to analyse the perceptions of self-efficacy in the model of Primary and Secondary Education teachers in initial training. A total of 303 university students with a mean age of 23.12 ± 3.21 years, enrolled in a university in the north of Spain, agreed to participate in this study. The results obtained confirm the heptafactorial structure of the model, its internal consistency, structural stability and adaptation to optimal fit indices. Likewise, statistically significant differences are identified in the TK and TPK dimensions, in structuring variables of the model and in the PK (pedagogical knowledge), PCK (pedagogical knowledge of content), TPK (pedagogical technological knowledge) and TPACK dimensions, depending on the level of teacher training and the gender of the future teacher.

The development of genetic tools that can serve to monitor population's health non-intrusively and inform strategies for the recovery of these species is crucial. In this study, we formally evaluate whether whole mitochondrial genomes can be assembled from environmental DNA (eDNA) metagenomics scat samples. Mitogenomes of four different large vertebrates, the panda bear (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), the moon bear (Ursus thibetanus), the Java pangolin (Manis javanica), and the the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) were assembled and circularized using the pipeline GetOrganelle with a coverage ranging from 12x to 480x in 14 out of 18 different eDNA samples. Partial mitochondrial genomes were retrieved from three other eDNA samples. The complete mitochondrial genomes of the studied species were AT-rich and comprised 13 protein coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a putative D-loop/control region. Synteny observed in all assembled mitogenomes was identical to that reported for specimens of the same and other closely related species. This study demonstrates that it is possible to assemble accurate whole mitochondrial chromosomes from eDNA samples (scats) using forthright bench and bioinformatics workflows. The retrieval of mitochondrial genomes from eDNA samples represents a tool to support bioprospecting, bio-monitoring, and other non-intrusive conservation strategies in species considered 'vulnerable', 'endangered', and/or 'critically endangered' by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",Many thanks to Vincent P.

This research is framed within two fundamental aspects: the first one is linked to the proposal of new methods of biogenic synthesis of silver, cuprous oxide, and zinc oxide nanoparticles using organic extracts as reducing agents. The second one is the application of nanomaterials in the impregnation (functionalization) of textiles based on methods called ""in situ"" (within the synthesis), and ""post-synthesis"" (after the synthesis), with subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that stable, monodisperse nanoparticles with defined geometry can be obtained. Likewise, the ""in situ"" impregnation method emerges as the best way to adhere nanoparticles.

Students produce this genre in the university classroom for diverse academic and professional purposes. Despite its relevance, empirical rhetorical-discursive descriptions of the value of student writing are still scarce in Spanish. Thus, we describe the rhetorical-discursive organization of the laboratory report genre in this subdiscipline.
Methods: To fulfil this purpose, we followed a methodological design based on Swalesian Genre Analysis and used a corpus of ninety-eight texts. The sample was collected in a self-compiled form through consultation with teachers and students in the university classroom. The application of this method allowed us to determine the macro-moves, moves, and rhetorical steps of the genre, its communicative functions, and textual features.
Results: The resulting rhetorical model consisted of four macro-moves, twelve moves and seventeen steps. This model shows the highly dynamic and mesogeneric nature of this genre, the new functions of multimodal artefacts, and the genre's presence across the curriculum. To know about the teachers' and students' views on the process of training professional writers in engineering, the rhetorical model was complemented with an ethnographic phase (in the terms proposed by Swales: corroboration process with a couple of members of the community) before and after collecting the textual corpus.
Discussion: Finally, the implications for genre theory, Spanish language theory and pedagogy of the Spanish language and genre pedagogy are discussed.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

However, little is known about the role of such psychological variables in the lifestyle of Chilean university students. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between life satisfaction and the regulations of the motivation, and to compare such variables by physical activity level and sedentary behavior of university students. The sample comprised 95 Chilean university students (63.2% female), with a mean age of 20.92 ± 1.98 years. The instruments were the IPAQ, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire. Descriptive measures, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and Student’s t tests were used to analyze the data. The results revealed positive and significant correlations between life satisfaction and intrinsic (r = 0,44), integrated (r = 0,38), and identified (r = 0,41) regulation. Students with high levels of physical activity scored higher for intrinsic, integrated, and identified regulation. Those who reported low sedentary behavior showed higher identified regulation. Therefore, it is suggested that students’ motivational regulation may differ on some dimensions as those with higher levels of physical activity show more adaptive motivational regulation. Identified regulation also seems to play an important role in decreasing sedentary behavior.",,,Journal of Physical Education,,,,2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,,34,1,3426,All OA; Gold,Article,"Faúndez-Casanova, César; França, Diego Galdino; Menezes, Murillo Lago; Mellado, Víctor Contreras; Aniotz, Alejandro Flores; Cáceres-Salas, Camila; Castillo-Retamal, Marcelo; Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime","Faúndez-Casanova, César (Universidad Católica del Maule (UCM), Talca, Chile); França, Diego Galdino (Universidade Estadual de Maringá (UEM), Maringá-PR, Brasil); Menezes, Murillo Lago (Universidade Estadual de Maringá (UEM), Maringá-PR, Brasil); Mellado, Víctor Contreras (Universidad de Talca (UTalca), Talca, Chile); Aniotz, Alejandro Flores (Universidad de Talca (UTalca), Talca, Chile); Cáceres-Salas, Camila (Universidad de Talca (UTalca), Talca, Chile); Castillo-Retamal, Marcelo (Universidad Católica del Maule (UCM), Talca, Chile); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Universidad Católica del Maule (UCM), Talca, Chile)",,"Faúndez-Casanova, César (Catholic University of the Maule); França, Diego Galdino (State University of Maringá); Menezes, Murillo Lago (State University of Maringá); Mellado, Víctor Contreras (University of Talca); Aniotz, Alejandro Flores (University of Talca); Cáceres-Salas, Camila (University of Talca); Castillo-Retamal, Marcelo (Catholic University of the Maule); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Catholic University of the Maule)",1,1,,,https://periodicos.uem.br/ojs/index.php/RevEducFis/article/download/65184/751375156176,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163052421,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 42 Health Sciences,

A mixed method is used to approach the research: on the one hand, the application of a self-administered questionnaire, as a pilot study and development platform for qualitative research; on the other hand, ten group dynamics with national and international undergraduate and postgraduate university students from two Spanish universities, one public and one private. The results show that WhatsApp and Instagram are the main channels for communication and the shaping of digital identity, but their use changes depending on the needs, interlocutors, and services of the application. The representations linked to these applications for interpersonal communication are well differentiated and clear reasons are given for their preference and suitability to the interests of digital natives. Millennials and Centennials are linked to a digital culture of ""resident"" users (White and Le Cornu, 2011), although some differences are observed between both groups with regard to the uses they make of these applications.

Therefore, measuring SMEs' performance under the digital transformation (DT) through methods that encompass sustainability represents an essential tool for reducing poverty and gender inequality (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals). We aimed to describe and analyze the state-of-art performance evaluations of digital transformation in SMEs, mainly focusing on performance measurement. Also, we aimed to determine whether the tools encompass the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic). Through a systematic literature review (SLR), a search on Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus resulted in the acceptance of 74 peer-reviewed papers published until December 2021. Additionally, a bibliometrics investigation was executed. Although there was no time restriction, the oldest paper was published in 2016, indicating that DT is a new research topic with increasing interest. Italy, China, and Finland are the countries that have the most published on the theme. Based on the results, a conceptual framework is proposed. Also, two future research directions are presented and discussed, one for theoretical and another for practical research. Among the theoretical development, it is essential to work on a widely accepted SME definition. Among the practical research, nine directions are identified-e.g., applying big data, sectorial and regional prioritization, cross-temporal investigations etc. Researchers can follow the presented avenues and roads to guide their researchers toward the most relevant topics with the most urgent necessity of investigation.",Declaration of interest&#x27;s statement The authors declare no competing interests.,This research is funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (Fondecyt) Project 11230332.,Heliyon,,,,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,2023-03,9,3,e13908,All OA; Gold,Article,"Melo, Isotilia Costa; Queiroz, Geandra Alves; Alves, Paulo Nocera; de Sousa, Thales Botelho; Yushimito, Wilfredo F; Pereira, Jorge","Melo, Isotilia Costa (Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Coquimbo, Chile); Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais (UEMG), Engineering Department, Production Engineering, Passos, Brazil); Alves, Paulo Nocera (Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Coquimbo, Chile); de Sousa, Thales Botelho (Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of São Paulo (IFSP), Registro, Brazil); Yushimito, Wilfredo F (Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI), Viña del Mar, Chile); Pereira, Jorge (Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI), Viña del Mar, Chile; UPF Barcelona School of Management, Barcelona, Spain)","Melo, Isotilia Costa (Catholic University of the North)","Melo, Isotilia Costa (Catholic University of the North); Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Minas Gerais State University); Alves, Paulo Nocera (Catholic University of the North); de Sousa, Thales Botelho (Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of São Paulo (IFSP), Registro, Brazil); Yushimito, Wilfredo F (Adolfo Ibáñez University); Pereira, Jorge (Adolfo Ibáñez University; Pompeu Fabra University)",52,52,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023011155/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155604497,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",

A confirmatory factor analysis was performed and the alignment method was used to evaluate invariance. Additionally, a graded response model was used for the assessment of item characteristics.ResultsThe results indicate that there is approximate measurement invariance of the COVID-SCORE-10 among the participating countries. Furthermore, IRT results suggest that the COVID-SCORE-10 measures with good psychometric ability a broad spectrum of the construct assessed, especially around average levels. Comparison of COVID-SCORE-10 scores indicated that participants from Cuba, Uruguay and El Salvador had the most positive perceptions of government actions to address the pandemic. Thus, the underlying construct of perception of government actions was equivalent in all countries.ConclusionThe results show the importance of initially establishing the fundamental measurement properties and MI before inferring the cross-cultural universality of the construct to be measured.",None.,No funding was received to support the writing of this research paper.,Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica,,,,2023-11-08,2023,2023-11-08,,36,1,34,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Valencia, Pablo D.; Ventura-León, José; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Delgado-Campusano, Mariel; Yupanqui-Lorenzo, Daniel E.; Paredes-Angeles, Rubí; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Gallegos, Miguel; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Palacios, Diego Alejandro; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Lobos Rivera, Marlon Elías; Buschiazzo Figares, Andrés; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín Enrique; Calderón, Raymundo; Arias Gallegos, Walter L.; Petzold, Olimpia; Camargo, Andrés; Torales, Julio; Monge Blanco, J.

En este estudio, se analizaron macroscpicamente huesos temporales de 135 esqueletos humanos excavados en el yacimiento de Cerro Juan Daz, Panam (50- 1500 DC), para cuantificar la prevalencia de la lesin e identificar posibles cambios en su frecuencia durante periodos culturales especficos en esta aldea. Se encontr una alta prevalencia de la exostosis auditiva externa en individuos mayormente masculinos del periodo Temprano (antes del 800 DC) y la ausencia completa de la lesin en individuos del periodo Tardo (despus del 800 DC). Este declive agudo coincide con la reduccin de adornos de conchas marinas talladas encontrados en contextos arqueolgicos costeros del Golfo de Panam, sugiriendo que la prctica del buceo se redujo de manera considerable con el paso del tiempo y, posiblemente, representa una reduccin de la demanda de conchas marinas a nivel local y regional. Abstract: External auditory exostosis, an abnormal growth of the tympanic bone caused by exposure to cold water and wind, has been reported in pre-Hispanic individuals buried near the Gulf of Panama, where seasonal coastal upwelling creates ideal conditions for their development, even in a tropical climate. In this study, temporal bones from 135 human skeletons excavated from the archaeological site of Cerro Juan Daz, Panama (AD 50-1500) were analyzed macroscopically to quantify the prevalence of the lesion and identify possible changes in its frequency during specific cultural periods in this village. A high prevalence of external auditory exostoses was found in mostly male individuals from the Early period (before AD 800), whereas no lesions were found in individuals from the Late period (after AD 800). This sharp decline coincides chronologically with the reduction in carved seashell ornaments found in coastal archaeological contexts around the Gulf of Panama, suggesting that diving declined considerably over time, possibly due to a reduced demand for seashells at the local and regional level.",,,Chungara - Revista de Antropología Chilena,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,ahead,0-0,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aguilarte, Vanessa V.

In addition, virulence factors promoted multiple drug resistance through cell-to-cell communications by molecules within microbial communities, denominated Quorum Sensing (QS). The regulation of QS by small molecules appears as a therapeutic alternative through the use of synthetic analogs of agonists. The present work developed the construction of a series of derivatives of N-(2-(o-tolyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-4-yl) formamide (1a-h) via Povarov-type sequential reactions to deliver the tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) derivatives in moderate to good yields (24–78%). To evaluate the potential in molecular diversity of THQ-type autoinducers, a study of these agents as potential inhibitors of bacterial growth and virulence factors involved in QS systems on P. aeruginosa was carried out both as antibacterial evaluation on E. coli strain. THQs showed significant activity values for molecules with halogen substituents at the C-6 position (-F, -Cl, and I), revealing at a concentration of 75 µg/mL a percentage inhibition between 27 and 40%. Furthermore, autoinducers with halogen substitutes in phenotypic studies on P. aeruginosa showed good results. Also, they exhibited weak formation of both biofilm and low pyocyanin formation, which are indicators of virulence in P. aeruginosa. Overall, the results suggest that compound N-(6-fluor-2-(o-tolyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-4-yl)formamide (1a) stands out as the most representative within this series of THQ derivatives.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

During the monitoring activities of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in Campania region (Italy), the presence of typical trophozoites of Perkinsus sp. was observed in mussels from farms and natural banks. Simultaneously, following mussel mortality in the Spanish waters of Catalonia, histopathological studies revealed the presence of the same parasite. Although perkinsosis is an endemic disease in clams in Italy (with prevalence from 40 to 80%), there are no reports to date of its presence in Mediterranean mussels and of the effect on this species. For this study, histopathology, Ray’s Fluid Thioglycollate Medium (RFTM), and molecular diagnostics with conventional Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and qPCR were performed. In samples from Italy, histopathology in the mussel from one farm revealed a prevalence of 26% in February 2019, 40% in February 2020, 16% in November 2020, and 23% in April 2021. In a natural bank, Perkinsus was also detected in May 2020 but in lower prevalence. In Spain, in July 2020, the presence of the parasite was 20% in one site and 10% in a second site and related to animal mortality. In both areas, Perkinsus sp. elicited multiple inflammatory capsules of different size or infiltrates at the level of the digestive gland and gonad. Molecular diagnostics of the Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) showed a 97% similarity of P. olseni from Italy with samples from New Zealand, Australia, and Uruguay and in bivalves such as Pitar rostrata, Astrovenus sp., and Haliotis sp., whereas in Spain the identity was 99% samples from South Korean venerids such as Anadara granosa. Phylogenetic analysis group together P. olseni from Italian and Spanish mussels but place them distant from other P. olseni described in the clams from Europe (Italy, France, and Spain). Direct impact of transboundary animal diseases in aquaculture constitutes a serious consequence for export living animals and their products, as well for international trade. This compromises food security, also causing a high socioeconomic impact on aquaculture exporting nations. P. olseni is a generalist pathogen able to infect different bivalve species, possibly passing from clams to oysters and mussels. Recognized international organizations should take this into account in the view of possible cross-infection.

Spatiotemporal patterns of extreme NDVI anomalies, water extraction and drought severity in a large-scale mining area of Atacama, northern Chile","In the Andes, multiple human and climatic factors threaten the conservation of bofedales, a type of high altitude peat forming wetland widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical Andes. In northern Chile, climate change and water extraction for industrial activities are among the most significant threats to these relevant socio-hydrological systems hosting indigenous pastoral communities. In this study, we present an integrated analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies, drought severity and water rights granted to industry to provide insight on the conservation status of bofedales, historical drivers of their transformation, and current threats. Using Landsat satellite imagery from 1986 to 2018, we identify spatio-temporal NDVI changes of 442 bofedales in one of the leading copper producing regions of the world. The NDVI time series analysis over 32 growing seasons was used to detect extreme anomalies, i.e. values outside the 95 % of the reference frequency distribution, indicating periods of extreme changes in the productivity of these high Andes wetlands. To evaluate the relationship between bofedales NDVI extreme periods to drought and continued water extraction activities, we combine a climate-based multi-temporal-scale drought index (SPEI) with the geospatial latitudinal distribution of water rights granted for extractive industries in the study area. Over the time period of analysis, the total amount of granted water rights increased 465 % from 1,201 l/s recorded before 1985 to 5,584 l/s in 2018. In the areas where the highest amount of water rights are concentrated, i.e. between 21.3°S and 22.1°S, “green” bofedales (NDVI>=0.23) are practically absent. NDVI of the austral summer (JFM) was highly correlated with the severity of drought occurring during the three months of the growing season peak. While our findings show bofedal productivity is mostly influenced by precipitation and temperature of the wet season (JFM) during the study period, results also raise questions regarding possible bofedal loss occurring over the previous 80 years prior to the satellite record, wherein water extraction activities have significantly increased according to official records.","This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, ANID - FONDECYT - 1201527 and ANID – MILENIO – NCS2022_009.

We hypothesize that formation and content of these WDCs change with topography and age of natural soils. To highlight the processes involved, we investigated a mid-sized and gently (∼5°) sloping alluvial fan system of multi-phase evolution at 1480 m a.s.l. in the Paposo region of the hyper-arid Atacama Desert, which is considered typical for this part of the Coastal Cordillera. Sampling was done along a topographic transect in 11 pits, and assessed the distribution and composition of WDCs by means of asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4). The younger fan section (optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)-age of ∼13.6 ka) exhibited a pronounced surface roughness and steep slopes. Here, WDCs from the top soils (0–1 cm) free of plants contained nearly 54 ± 7% of medium-sized colloids (MCs, 210–300 nm) with a dominance of Si and Al. The elevated concentrations of fine colloids (FC, 24–210 nm) and particularly nanocolloids (NCs, 0.6–24 nm) was shown in levelled surface soils near shrubs with predominance of organic carbon (OC) and Ca. With higher collodial OC and Ca content in soils near shrubs, more WDC-P was formed concomitantly through increased OC-Ca-P associations. Larger variations in total WDC content were detected in the surface soils of the older fan section, which was dated to ∼56.4 ka. Here, the peaking NC had almost disappeared and thus MC dominated, probably reflecting re-aggregation and wind erosion over longer periods of time across a relatively smooth land surface. The WDCs and WDC-P peaked at 5–10 cm depth in the older fan section, as here a solid mineral/salt layer was present, while in the younger fan section the WDCs were more likely to be translocated from ‘permeable’ surface into deeper layers, likely reflecting leaching with occasional heavy rainfall. Overall, forms and distribution of WDCs depended on both topographic position and sediment age, thus making colloids as unique tracers of soil development processes during myriad or more years.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In addition, an efficient multi-start iterated local search (MS-ILS) algorithm, capable of solving the deterministic MRCPSP, is adapted to deal with the proposed stochastic version of the problem. For its deterministic version, the MRCPSP is an NP-hard optimization problem that has been widely studied. The problem deals with a trade-off between the amount of resources that each project activity requires and its duration. In the case of the proposed stochastic formulation, the execution times of the activities are uncertain. Benchmark instances of projects with 10, 20, 30, and 50 activities from well-known public libraries were adapted to create test instances. The adapted algorithm proved to be capable and efficient for solving the proposed stochastic problem.",,This research was funded by Universidad Panamericana (grant number UP-CI-2022-GDL-11-ING).,Mathematics,,,,2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,,11,2,337,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramos, Alfredo S.; Miranda-Gonzalez, Pablo A.; Nucamendi-Guillén, Samuel; Olivares-Benitez, Elias","Ramos, Alfredo S.

In this context, dynamical systems can be used along with an analysis the phase spaces for different values of the fractional order of the derivative and their different matter contents. The equilibrium points are classified, providing a range for the order of the fractional derivative in order to investigate whether the cosmological history can be reconstructed and a late-time accelerating power-law solution obtained for the scale factor. In this paper, we discuss the physical interpretation of the corresponding cosmological solutions with particular emphasis on the influence of the fractional order of the derivative in a theory of gravity that includes a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The presented results improve and extend those obtained previously, further demonstrating that fractional calculus can play a relevant role in cosmology.","The authors are thankful for the support of Núcleo de Investigación Geometría Diferencial y Aplicaciones, Resolución VRIDT No. 096/2022.

Physical-chemical characterization of the catalysts showed a significant change in morphological and optical properties of the TiO2 thin films after surface modification. We applied the kinetic and isothermal models to the methylene blue (MB) adsorption process on both catalysts. The pseudo-second order model was the best fitting model for the kinetic results; qe (mg/g) was 11.9 for TiO2 thin films and 14.6 for TiO2-AlPOM thin films, and k2 (g mg-1 min-1) was 16.3 × 10-2 for TiO2 thin films and 28.2 × 10-2 for TiO2-AlPOM thin films. Furthermore, the Freundlich model was suitable to describe the isothermal behavior of TiO2, KF (5.42 mg/g), and 1/n (0.312). The kinetics of photocatalytic degradation was fitted using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model; kap was 7 × 10-4 min-1 for TiO2 and 13 × 10-4 min-1 for TiO2-AlPOM. The comparative study showed that TiO2 thin films reach a 19.6% MB degradation under UV irradiation and 9.1% MB adsorption, while the TiO2-AlPOM thin films reach a 32.6% MB degradation and 12.2% MB adsorption on their surface. The surface modification improves the morphological, optical, and photocatalytic properties of the thin films. Finally, the DFT study supports all the previously shown results.","W.V. and C.D.-U. thank Universidad del Atlántico, Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism-Chile, grant Nuclei on Catalytic Processes towards Sustainable Chemistry (CSC) ANID-NCN2021_090.

Alternative routes can be provided by recent discoveries of a time-reversal symmetry breaking anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear magnets and altermagnets, but hitherto reported bulk materials are not polar. Here, the authors report the observation of a spontaneous AHE in doped AgCrSe2 , a layered polar semiconductor with an antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr spins in adjacent layers. The anomalous Hall resistivity 3  μ Ω  c m $\mu \Omega \, \textnormal {cm}$  is comparable to the largest observed in compensated magnetic systems to date, and is rapidly switched off when the angle of an applied magnetic field is rotated to ≈80° from the crystalline c-axis. The ionic gating experiments show that the anomalous Hall conductivity magnitude can be enhanced by modulating the p-type carrier density. They also present theoretical results that suggest the AHE is driven by Berry curvature due to noncollinear antiferromagnetic correlations among Cr spins, which are consistent with the previously suggested magnetic ordering in AgCrSe2 . The results open the possibility to study the interplay of magnetic and ferroelectric-like responses in this fascinating class of materials.","Acknowledgements The authors thank B. Doucot, P.D.C.

Although residential environments provide natural experimental conditions to observe these relationships, the complexity of measuring sensory perceptions and their subsequent interpretation constitutes a challenge. This study aims to identify the influence of socio-demographics and residential location characteristics on three latent variables: noise-Sensitivity, sound-Pleasantness, and visual-Liveability in a Latin American city. The methodology is replicable and relies on a digital survey that displays environments in 360-format video and uses sound immersion techniques; it was applied to a sample of household heads in Quito, Ecuador. Based on an efficient experimental design, we selected different residential environments according to acoustic-visual attributes and the proximity to residential, commercial, and recreational land uses. Structural Equation Models (SEM) were estimated using mediating variables. Our results reveal the influence of noise-Sensitivity on sound-Pleasantness and, indirectly, on visual-Liveability. Further analysis shows that the impact of sound and visual perception changes with different socio-demographics and residential location characteristics.","This research was accomplished thanks to collaboration of the Universidad Técnica del Norte and the co-funding project SOA.MCA.19.05- provided the Universidad de Las Américas in Ecuador and the Civil Engineering programme at Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia.

The treatment of invasive Candida infections is based on the use of fluconazole, but the emergence of resistant isolates has been an increasing concern which has led to the study of alternative drugs with antifungal activity. Sphingolipids have been considered a promising target due to their roles in fungal growth and virulence. Inhibitors of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway have been described to display antifungal properties, such as myriocin and aureobasidin A, which are active against resistant Candida isolates. In the present study, aureobasidin A did not display antibiofilm activity nor synergism with amphotericin B, but its combination with fluconazole was effective against Candida biofilms and protected the host in an in vivo infection model. Alterations in treated cells revealed increased oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and chitin content, as well as altered morphology, enhanced DNA leakage and a greater susceptibility to sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In addition, it seems to inhibit the efflux pump CaCdr2p. All these data contribute to elucidating the role of aureobasidin A on fungal cells, especially evidencing its promising use in clinical resistant isolates of Candida species.","The authors thank the Centro Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (CENABIO, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for the facilities and support in the use of SEM equipment.","This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnolÓgico (CNPq) Universal-Processo # 408981/2018-0 and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do estado do Rio de Janeiro-CNE (Faperj) Processo # E-26/202974/2017.

OD is a common problem in children with congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS). In this case series, we describe the clinical and acoustic alterations of swallowing in children exposed to the Zika virus during pregnancy in a cohort from Amazonas, Brazil. From July 2019 to January 2020, 22 children were evaluated, 6 with microcephaly and 16 without microcephaly. The mean age among the participants was 35 months (±4.6 months). All children with microcephaly had alterations in oral motricity, mainly in the lips and cheeks. Other alterations were in vocal quality, hard palate, and soft palate. Half of the children with microcephaly showed changes in cervical auscultation during breast milk swallowing. In children without microcephaly, the most frequently observed alteration was in lip motricity, but alterations in auscultation during the swallowing of breast milk were not observed. Regarding swallowing food of a liquid and pasty consistency, the most frequent alterations were incomplete verbal closure, increased oral transit time, inadequacy in capturing the spoon, anterior labial leakage, and increased oral transit time. Although these events are more frequent in microcephalic children, they can also be seen in non-microcephalic children, which points to the need for an indistinct evaluation of children exposed in utero to ZIKV.","We would like to thank the families who agreed to follow us on this path of acceptance, care, and construction of knowledge. We thank the Zika Project’s multidisciplinary team for working with us in monitoring the children.","This work was funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (FAPEAM): Universal Amazonas (#002/2018); the Ministry of Health of Brazil: Programa de Pesquisa para o SUS—PPSUS (#062.01018/2018)—and Departamento de Ciência e Tecnologia—(#51/2019); and Leônidas and Maria Deane Institute (ILMD/Fiocruz Amazônia), in partnership with the Nacional Council for Scientific and Technological Development—CNPq (#400911/2018-3n).

We studied the effects of nifurtimox administered by two different treatment regimens on the T. cruzi calcium-binding flagellar protein F29 in children diagnosed with Chagas disease measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (ELISA F29).
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, historically controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974), blood samples obtained from children diagnosed with Chagas disease and treated with nifurtimox for either 60 days or 30 days were analyzed using an ELISA with an F29 recombinant protein as the antigen, as well as conventional serological tests (recombinant ELISA and indirect hemagglutination assay). In an exploratory approach, serological response to nifurtimox treatment was evaluated for 4 years post-treatment. In both treatment groups, the number of patients with negative ELISA F29 values increased over the period of observation. The incidence rate of negative seroconversion using ELISA F29 was 22.94% (95% CI: 19.65%, 26.63%) in the 60-day treatment group and 21.64% (95% CI: 17.21%, 26.86%) in the 30-day treatment group. In the subpopulation of patients who tested seropositive for F29 before nifurtimox treatment, 88 patients (67.7%) in the 60-day regimen and 39 patients (59.1%) in the 30-day regimen were F29 seronegative at 4 years post-treatment. All patients who had a positive ELISA F29 test at baseline and seroconverted to negative measured by conventional serology reached seronegativity in ELISA F29 earlier than in conventional serology.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a serological response to treatment with nifurtimox measured by the ELISA F29 test in children diagnosed with Chagas disease. The F29-based ELISA can be considered a potential early marker of response to antitrypanosomal therapy for Chagas disease.

The objective of this research was to analyze the eating habits (EH), physical activity (PA), and sleep quality (SQ) of older adults in the rural parish of San José de Minas in Quito, Ecuador. Three validated questionnaires were used: the Pittsburgh PSQI for SQ, IPAQ for PA, and frequency of consumption for EH. The results revealed high consumption of refined flours and sugar (70% at least once a day), low intake of whole grains, fish, and olive oil, and considerable consumption of fruits and water. Fifty percent of respondents engage in moderate physical activity and 24% in low physical activity, while 90% of older adults have poor sleep quality. These results indicate a problem in the integral health of the population that does not allow older adults to have a good old age. Health campaigns should be developed to increase physical activity, encourage a better diet, and thus, improve the quality of sleep.","The authors would like to thank the Universidad Iberoamericana del Ecuador (UNIBE) and the Decentralized Autonomous Government (GAD) of the parish San José de Minas, for all the support in carrying out this study.

Our objective was to analyze the living conditions and the psychosocial sphere of older adult people living in extreme poverty in Requena del Tapiche in Peru. This was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. Sixty participants between 60 and 100 years of age of both sexes were included who gave their informed consent. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed, and the Gijón, family Apgar, Yesavage, and Pfeiffer scales were used. The sample was composed of 55% women and 45% men, with a mean age of 79.2 years (SD 6.67). More than half live alone or with their spouse. Fifty-seven percent sleep on the floor or on wood, and about 82% do not have safe water. Family dysfunction is found in 40%, and 98% are at social risk or with an established social problem and a precarious economic situation. More than 60% suffer from depressive symptoms, which are more frequent in women. We conclude that older adults perceive deficient family support, observing a deteriorated social situation. Most of them are at risk of social exclusion and loneliness, making them more vulnerable. They show sadness, with a high rate of depression. People with more cognitive impairment live alone, and those in social exclusion suffer a higher degree of depression. More cooperative projects and health promotion interventions developed in the peripheral neighborhoods of Requena del Tapiche are needed to improve the impact on the health of older adult people in extreme poverty.",,The publication costs of this work have been financed by the Catholic University of Valencia under grant 2023-275-001.,Healthcare,,,,2023-11-23,2023,2023-11-23,,11,23,3022,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murillo-Llorente, María Teresa; Coloma, Nerea Caballero; Tomás-Aguirre, Francisco; Tejeda-Adell, Manuel; Ventura, Ignacio; Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino","Murillo-Llorente, María Teresa (SONEV Research Group, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, mt.murillo@ucv.es); Coloma, Nerea Caballero (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Tomás-Aguirre, Francisco (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Tejeda-Adell, Manuel (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Ventura, Ignacio (School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, nerea.caballero@mail.ucv.es, (N.C.C.);, paco.tomas@ucv.es, (F.T.-A.);, manuel.tejeda@ucv.es, (M.T.-A.);, ignacio.ventura@ucv.es, (I.V.)); Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino (SONEV Research Group, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Catholic University of Valencia San Vicente Mártir, C/Quevedo nº 2, 46001 Valencia, Spain;, mt.murillo@ucv.es)","Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)","Murillo-Llorente, María Teresa (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Coloma, Nerea Caballero (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Tomás-Aguirre, Francisco (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Tejeda-Adell, Manuel (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Ventura, Ignacio (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr); Perez-Bermejo, Marcelino (Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/23/3022/pdf?version=1700718076,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166313275,42 Health Sciences,1 No Poverty; 3 Good Health and Well Being; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Family support has been shown to be protective against CD, yet the relationship between these in psychotic patients remains complex and not fully understood. This study investigated the association between a subdomain of family support, namely, family involvement (estimated through a proxy measure), cognitive functioning, and sex in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. The sample included 308 patients enrolled in the Program for Early Phases of Psychosis (PAFIP), divided into 4 groups based on their estimated family involvement (eFI) level and sex, and compared on various variables. Women presented lower rates of eFI than men (37.1% and 48.8%). Higher eFI was associated with better cognitive functioning, particularly in verbal memory. This association was stronger in women. The findings suggest that eFI may be an important factor in FEP patients' cognitive functioning. This highlights the importance of including families in treatment plans for psychotic patients to prevent CD. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay between family support, sex, and cognitive functioning in psychotic patients and develop effective interventions that target these factors.","The authors wish to thank the PAFIP and PAFIP-FAMILIAS research team, and especially all the patients and their relatives who participated in the studies.","The PAFIP-FAMILIAS project received funding from the Carlos III Health Institute (FIS PI17/00221).

Therefore, the objective of this paper was to characterize the development of virtual classes from the perspective of the professors of the Universidad del Norte subsidiary Itá, Paraguay, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding the type of research, it consisted of a non-experimental, mixed, descriptive, and cross-sectional one, in which the investigators employed techniques such as survey and observation. In terms of the study population, it consisted of 46 teachers. Furthermore, the results indicated that the use of technologies to develop educational activities produced didactic methodological variants for teachers and learning for students, both in the development of the topics and in the way of examining or verifying the acquisition of knowledge and achievement of objectives. When using different technological resources, the professors found difficulties such as the lack of previous preparation, poor connection or access to the Internet, and a longer time spent preparing classes. However, the virtual distance modality allowed progress in the educational field despite obstacles, resulting in a useful and convenient alternative in the learning process.

From the beginning, risk factors for the severity and mortality of the disease were considered, as the spread of the virus was related to the living conditions of each population.MethodsIn this ecological study we have evaluated the role of geography, precisely the altitude above sea level in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in Peru. Incidence and mortality data were taken from the open-access database of the government of Peru until March 2021. COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mortality were treated as cases/density population and 1000 x cases/inhabitants while altitude was treated as continuous and as a categorical variable divided in 7 categories. The relationship between COVID-19 cases or deaths for COVID-19 and altitude as continuous variable was determined using Spearman correlation test. Meanwhile when altitude was considered as a categorical variable, Poisson regression or negative binomial analyses were applied.ResultsA significant inverse correlation was found between COVID-19 cases by population density and altitude (r=-0.37 p < 0.001). By altitude categories, the lowest risk for infection was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.08; 95% CI 0.05,0.12). Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between altitude and COVID-19 mortality (r=-0.39 p < 0.001). Also, the lowest risk for mortality was observed between 3,000 and 3,500 m (IRR 0.12; 95%CI 0.08; 0.18). Similar results were found when analyses were adjusted for inhabitants and stratified by sex.ConclusionThis study reports an inverse relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mortality with respect to the altitude of residence, particularly, a u-shaped protection is shown, with a highest benefit between 3000 and 3500 m. The possibility of using hypoxia as an alternative treatment requires more complex studies that should allow knowing the physiological and environmental mechanisms of the protective role.",We want to thank Dr. Christopher Curtis for his revision and proofreading of the language.,"P.G-M received funding from CIBERobn CB12/03/30002 (Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition), Spain.

The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of these bacterial isolates play a critical role in guiding effective treatment strategies We aimed to determine the most common bacterial agents causing diabetic foot infections in a tertiary-care hospital in Peru.
Methods: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 181 patients diagnosed with diabetic foot infections and positive microbiological culture results. All the samples were analyzed with the Vitek 2 compact system and the cut-off points were defined with the CLSI M100 guide. The data were segregated based on mono-microbial or poly-microbial cultures, bacterial types, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles.
Results: A total of 32 bacterial species were identified, predominantly Gram-negative (63%). The most frequent bacterial agents isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (19.9%), Escherichia coli (12.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%), and Proteus vulgaris (6.6%). These bacteria commonly exhibited resistance to Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Cefuroxime. E. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance (19 antibiotics), while Gentamicin, Tobramycin, and Levofloxacin demonstrated the highest sensitivity against the most prevalent bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria also exhibited notable antibiotic-susceptibility to Meropenem, Piperacillin/tazobactam, and Amikacin. Regarding the presence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase, 54 isolates tested positive, with 35 (64.8%) and 14 (42.4%) of these being S. aureus and E. coli.
Conclusions: Bacterial agents causing diabetic foot infections pose a constant concern, particularly due to the increasing antibiotic resistance observed. This difficulty in treating the condition contributes to a higher risk of amputation and mortality. Further research on bacterial susceptibility is necessary to determine appropriate dosages for pharmacological treatment and to prevent the overuse of antibiotics.",,"The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Frontiers in Endocrinology,,,"Humans; Diabetic Foot; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru; Staphylococcus aureus; Escherichia coli; Levofloxacin; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Staphylococcal Infections; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Diabetes Mellitus",2023-12-05,2023,2023-12-05,,14,,1267699,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Chamana, Jackelina M.; Porras-Rivera, Daniela; Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A.; Salazar, Carmen R.; Contreras-Pulache, Hans","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Chamana, Jackelina M.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a program that has provided encouraging results for its treatment. However, scientific evidence about its efficacy is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to describe the scientific production on the components of the DBT program and its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of people with BPD. Method : A systematic review with relevant keywords was conducted based on studies available in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed until June 2023, including studies in English, research on therapeutic intervention, studies with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that included people with the diagnosis of BPD. Results: We found 18 RCTs, most of which supported the effectiveness of DBT for BPD. There were a total of 1,755 participants in these studies, most of whom were women. These studies looked for treating self-injurious behaviors, suicidal thoughts or ideations, number of visits to emergency services, and frequency of hospital admissions. Most studies revealed that both short-term DBT and standard DBT improved suicidality in BPD patients with small or moderate effect sizes, lasting up to 24 months after the treatment period. Furthermore, these studies showed that DBT can significantly improve general psychopathology and depressive symptoms in patients with BPD. Improvement of compliance, impulsivity, mood instability, as well as reduction in hospitalization rate are other findings observed in the trials following DBT. Conclusion: Although DBT shows efficacy in the treatment of BPD, heterogeneity in the methodologies employed is highlighted. Therefore, it is necessary to design studies from a homogeneous theoretical and methodological framework.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-12-08,2023,2023-12-08,2024-01,19,1,119-129,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernandez-Bustamante, Milton; Cjuno, Julio; Hernández, Ronald M.; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline C.","Hernandez-Bustamante, Milton (Universidad Peruana Unión, Lima, Peru.); Cjuno, Julio (Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego, Trujillo, Peru.); Hernández, Ronald M.

However, there are controversies regarding the role of fruit consumption in mitigating this disease. The objective of the present study was to analyze the association between fruit intake and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in a representative sample of Peruvians. This is an analytical cross-sectional study. Secondary data analysis was conducted using information from the Demographic and Health Survey of Peru (2019-2021). The outcome variables were BMI and WC. The exploratory variable was fruit intake, which was expressed in three different presentations: portion, salad, and juice. A generalized linear model of the Gaussian family and identity link function were performed to obtain the crude and adjusted beta coefficients. A total of 98,741 subjects were included in the study. Females comprised 54.4% of the sample. In the multivariate analysis, for each serving of fruit intake, the BMI decreased by 0.15 kg/m2 (β = -0.15; 95% CI -0.24 to -0.07), while the WC was reduced by 0.40 cm (β = -0.40; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.27). A negative association between fruit salad intake and WC was found (β = -0.28; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.01). No statistically significant association between fruit salad intake and BMI was found. In the case of fruit juice, for each glass of juice consumed, the BMI increased by 0.27 kg/m2 (β = 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.40), while the WC increased by 0.40 cm (β = 0.40; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60). Fruit intake per serving is negatively related to general body adiposity and central fat distribution, while fruit salad intake is negatively related to central distribution adiposity. However, the consumption of fruit in the form of juices is positively associated with a significant increase in BMI and WC.",,This research received no external funding.,Nutrients,,,"Female; Humans; Male; Adiposity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Peru; Fruit; Obesity; Body Mass Index; Waist Circumference; Obesity, Abdominal",2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1183,All OA; Gold,Article,"Valencia, Jamee Guerra; Ramos, Willy; Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana; Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel; Loayza-Castro, Joan A.; Zeñas-Trujillo, Gianella Zulema; Ponce, Norka Rocío Guillen; Zuzunaga-Montoya, Fiorella E.; Valladares-Garrido, Mario J.; Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan; De La Cruz-Vargas, Jhony A.","Valencia, Jamee Guerra (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Ramos, Willy (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 15001, Peru); Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas (INICIB), Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Loayza-Castro, Joan A.

This study aimed to analyze the geochemical and environmental changes detected in soil, water, and sediments around the La Sierre mine, and to determine if contamination persists over time. The concentrations of ten trace elements (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) were measured in 20 soil samples, 10 water samples, and 6 sediment samples, sampling at the most affected points. Soil and sediment samples were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and water samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). From the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), soil samples SOI-6, 7, and 20 presented high amounts ranging from 14489.86a±7 to 3031.72b ± 1 mg/kg of Co, Cu, Ni, and As, respectively. Water samples WAT-6, 8, and 10 presented high contents of As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn, being sample WAT-8 with high values of As, Co, Cu, Fe, and Ni with 48.1 ± 0.82, 368 ± 4, 68.3 ± 0.1, 97.5 ± 1.2, and 152 ± 2 μg/L, respectively, exceeding the regulation given by R.D 314/2016 (Water for human consumption). The sediment samples were compared with the IInterim Sediment Quality Guideline (ISQG) and Probable Effect Level (PEL) values given by the Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. When presenting a high ISQG value, but low PEL, they partially comply with the regulations, which happens with samples SED-1, 2, and 8 for As and SED-5, 6, and 7 for Pb. On the contrary, Cr and Cu do not comply with what is established in samples SED-8 and SED-1 and 8, respectively, whereas, in samples SED-2 and 5, Cu partially complies with the established regulations. The values found for the trace elements present in the abandoned traditional mining area with abundant epithermal deposits prevail over time in soil, water, and sediments.","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid for their assistance in sampling and data collection in the field, as well as for permitting the access to and use of their laboratories for the analysis and experimental part of this article.

In early 2020, the spread of the virus left its mark on every affected country, impacting mental health by limiting daily activities and causing fatalities amidst public health strategies to mitigate its impact. The influence of COVID-19 on the quality of life (QoL) may vary between countries, underscoring the need to examine its effects on individuals and families during the mandatory home quarantine. We aimed to assess the QoL of individuals and families during home isolation by COVID-19 lockdown.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2020. We included adult partners (≥18 years) of families from Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Japan, Peru, Russia, and Venezuela. Using the 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire we assess the impact of COVID-19 on their partner/family member's QoL.
Results: The survey was completed by 466 participants (mean age = 38.59 ± 13.75 years; females = 298) and 76% worked mostly as health professionals from South America (69.2%), Europe (18.4%), and Asia (12.4%). The WHOQOL-BREF mean score from 38.38 ± 11.55 (range = 22.8-43.4). The average quality of life in South America (41.9 ± 1.2) was significantly higher than that of European countries (30.9 ± 11.5) (p = 0.002). The social relations dimension was the only one with values close to 100 (mean = 83.3) in 6/7 evaluated countries, where only Spain had a low score (41 ± 33.12). Women had a slightly lower quality of life than men, but it was not significant (40.2 ± 8.8 vs. 41.5 ± 9.9, p = 0.354), while we found differences in the overall QoL between young and older, and by employment type (p < 0.05). According to family structure, we found differences on QoL between nuclear and siblings' families (p = 0.024).
Conclusion: Families from seven countries of three continents reported poor QoL during the first outbreak of COVID-19. The pandemic scenario has dramatically weakened the QoL in 3/4 dimensions, where social relationships have remained high. It is important to fully address the impact of this reduced QoL on families after several waves of infection and to provide comprehensive support in the post-COVID future.","The authors thank all participants and family members who participated in this study.

This bibliometric analysis of 196 articles in 37 journals, mostly written in Spanish, identified the main publications on communication that contributed to understanding migration. Results of this literature review show that those working in the media attribute the failures of their craft to the lack of training and ethical manuals, indicating that the quality of media products on migration tends to be poor, and that the literature on audiences documents the effects of the media and the perception of migration audiences. These findings suggest an academic bias on Latin American migration phenomena from intersectional perspectives, a lack of ethnographic approaches to media creation processes, that research on products is repetitive, and that although studies on European audiences are plentiful, those on migrant audiences are scarce.

The methodology is applied to four colonial shipwrecks located in Cartagena de Indias Bay (Colombia), two of them in the Inner Bay and two in the Bocachica sector. Five criteria are used and scored from 1 (indicating a low risk for the wreck) to 5 (high risk). The sum of the scores obtained at each criterion ranges from 5 to 25, and when the value obtained is higher than 15, management action is required. Five criteria were analyzed; (i) The historical criterion is based on the antiquity of the wreck. The ones investigated in this paper are associated with the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (A.D. 1741), having been submerged for ~280 years (all wrecks obtained a score of 3); (ii) The geographical criterion concerns the depth at which the wreck is located, which determines its accessibility. In Cartagena Bay, wrecks are situated at a water depth between 15.6 and 29.7 m (all wrecks were scored 4); (iii) The shipwreck condition criterion indicates the level of preservation, including organic and inorganic material, distinguishing among wooden hulls, ballast stones, and cannons. Obtained scores were 4 and 3 for the wrecks, respectively, located in the Inner Bay and in the Bocachica sector. (iv) The oceanographic criterion, linked to chemical and biological conditions of the water column, influences wreck conservation. All wrecks investigated scored 5. (v) The socioeconomic criterion indicates the multiple maritime and cultural activities presently taking place that might affect the wreck. In Cartagena Bay, all wrecks were scored 4. According to the total score obtained (20—Inner Bay and 19—Bocachica sector), guidelines for shipwreck conservation of cultural heritage in Cartagena Bay are proposed.","The authors especially thank the former ex-director of DIMAR, Vice Admiral José Joaquín Amézquita García, and the former ex-director of the Center for Oceanographic and Hydrographic Research, CN German Escobar.

FASD are the most common environmentally induced birth defect and are highly variable. The genetics of an individual influence the severity of their FASD phenotype. However, the genes that sensitize an individual to ethanol-induced birth defects are largely unknown. The ethanol-sensitive mouse substrain, C57/B6J, carries several known mutations including one in Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt). Nnt is a mitochondrial transhydrogenase thought to have an important role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS has been implicated in ethanol teratogenesis. To directly test the role of Nnt in ethanol teratogenesis, we generated zebrafish nnt mutants via CRISPR/Cas9. Zebrafish embryos were dosed with varying concentrations of ethanol across different timepoints and assessed for craniofacial malformations. We utilized a ROS assay to determine if this could be a contributing factor of these malformations. We found that exposed and unexposed mutants had higher levels of ROS compared to their wildtype counterparts. When treated with ethanol, nnt mutants experienced elevated apoptosis in the brain and neural crest, a defect that was rescued by administration of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). NAC treatment also rescued most craniofacial malformations. Altogether this research demonstrates that ethanol-induced oxidative stress leads to craniofacial and neural defects due to apoptosis in nnt mutants. This research further supports the growing body of evidence implicating oxidative stress in ethanol teratogenesis. These findings suggest that antioxidants can be used as a potential therapeutic in the treatment of FASD.","We would like to thank Mary Swartz (lab manager) and Angela Martinez, Cadianna Garcia, Kathryn Thompson, and Nika Sarraf (fish facility technicians) for their support of this research.

The strains were identified as Vibrio chagasii using phenotypic characterization and whole genome sequence analysis. Both strains exhibited the phenotypic properties associated with virulence, gelatin hydrolysis and β-hemolysis, whereas only VPAP36 produced phospholipase and only VPAP40 produced caseinase. The whole genome analysis showed that the strains harbored genes encoding for the virulence factors, the EPS type II secretion system, and Quorum Sensing (auto-inductor 1 and auto-inductor 2), whereas genes encoding a metalloproteinase and a capsular polysaccharide were detected only in the VPAP40 genome. When challenge bioassays using healthy 11-day-old scallop larvae were performed, the V. chagasii VPAP36 and VPAP40 strains exhibited significant (p < 0.05) differences in their larval lethal activity, producing, after 48 h, larval mortalities of 65.51 ± 4.40% and 28.56 ± 5.35%, respectively.

Extensive research has shown that people with different attachment orientations exhibit divergencies in how they perform emotion regulation strategies.
Methods: 44 adults performed an experimental emotion regulation task in which they were instructed to attend, reappraise, or suppress their emotions while viewing negative and neutral images taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Afterward, participants rated valence, arousal, and emotional dominance elicited by the images. Additionally, attachment orientations were measured using the ECR-12 questionnaire.
Results: Results showed a relationship between attachment avoidance and the level of arousal during the reappraisal condition; specifically, the higher attachment avoidance levels, the greater the emotional intensity during the implementation of cognitive reappraisal strategy. Such results suggest an association between failing in downregulate intense emotions using cognitive reappraisal when there are higher levels of attachment avoidance. Consistently, we also found that lower dominance during reappraisal was associated with more levels of avoidance.
Conclusion: These results indicate that people with higher levels of attachment avoidance experience difficulties when using the cognitive reappraisal strategy to reduce the emotional impact produced by negative emotional stimuli. Our findings reinforce the idea that avoidant people experience high physiological activation when experience emotions.",We want to thank Professor Tomás Ossandón for his feedback and all the members of his lab Neurodynamics of Cognition at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

This study assessed skinfold thicknesses' predictive capacity for overall and abdominal obesity in Peruvian adults aged 30 or older over 5 years. Data from the PERU MIGRANT 5-year cohort study were analyzed, defining obesity using BMI and waist circumference. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Adults aged ≥ 30 (n = 988) completed the study at baseline, with 47% male. A total of 682 participants were included for overall and abdominal obesity analysis. The 5-year prevalence values for overall and abdominal obesity were 26.7% and 26.6%, respectively. Subscapular skinfold (SS) best predicted overall obesity in men (AUC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.75-0.88) and women (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.88). Regarding abdominal obesity, SS exhibited the highest AUC in men (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77-0.89), while SS and the sum of trunk skinfolds showed the highest AUC in women. In secondary analysis excluding participants with type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) at baseline, SS significantly predicted DM2 development in men (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58-0.83) and bicipital skinfold (BS) did in women (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.84). The findings highlight SS significance as an indicator of overall and abdominal obesity in both sexes among Peruvian adults.

In an attempt to mitigate this emerging infectious disease and provide candidates for marker-assisted selective breeding, we tested here the existence of a genetic component of Argopecten purpuratus scallop resistance to the pathogen Vibrio bivalvicida. Through a dual RNA-seq approach we analyzed the basal transcriptome and the transcriptional response to infection in two resistant and two susceptible families as well as the pathogen transcriptomic response to host colonization. The results highlighted a genetic basis in the resistance of scallop larvae to the pathogen. The Vibrio response was characterized by a general metabolic adaptation to the host environment, along with several predicted virulence factors overexpressed in infected scallop larvae with no difference between resistant and susceptible host phenotypes. On the host side, several biological processes were enriched in uninfected resistant larvae. Within these enriched categories, immune-related processes were overexpressed, while morphogenesis, biomineral tissue development, and angiogenesis were under expressed. Particularly, genes involved in immune recognition and antimicrobial response, such as lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBPs), lysozyme, and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) were overexpressed in uninfected resistant larvae. As expected, immune-related biological processes were enriched in Vibrio-infected larvae, but they were more numerous in resistant larvae. Overexpressed immune genes in response to infection included several Toll-like receptors, TNF and NF-κB immune signaling genes, and the antimicrobial peptide Big defensin ApBD1. Results strongly suggest that both a front-loading of immune genes and an enhanced antimicrobial response to infection contribute to the resistance, while pathogen infective strategy does not discriminate between host phenotypes. Overall, early expression of host immune genes appears as a strong determinant of the disease outcome that could be used in marker-assisted selective breeding.",We gratefully acknowledge Claudia Ojeda for technical assistance and Daniel Aguilera from Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos from UCN for scallop procurement and maintenance.,"This study was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development, FONDECYT #1200129 to PS, RR, RF, and KB.

In this scenario, it is necessary to consider the impact of technologies on different older generational cohorts to understand the future of a data-driven digital society fully. This research aims to explain the acceptance of social networking sites, a particular consumer technology, in the post-pandemic elderly population. Data were obtained from 1555 older adults in Chile based on a consumer technology acceptance model. The respondents were grouped according to their technological predisposition and their generation into three groups. Applying a multigroup analysis based on structural equation modelling reveals significant differences in the explanatory variables of the intention and use of this technology between the groups. And more remarkably, the effort expectancy is not statistically significant as a variable to explain this acceptance globally in either of the three groups. There are two principal contributions of this study. First, it shows why adults adopt consumer technology after the pandemic. Second, it validates a classification of elderly adults who use consumption technologies that are useful in understanding the heterogeneity of this phenomenon.",The authors recognise the support provided by students and interviewers in collecting information in the field.,This research was funded by ANID/FONDECYT Regular 1210130.,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-01-21,2023,2023-01-21,,13,2,87,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramírez-Correa, Patricio; Grandón, Elizabeth Eliana; Ramírez-Santana, Muriel; Arenas-Gaitán, Jorge; Rondán-Cataluña, F.

ABSTRACT Occupational diseases remain an unresolved issue in the national medical literature. The most common form of pneumoconiosis is silicosis, which is brought on by inhaling crystalline silica and depending on the susceptibility of the person, the extent of their exposure, and the concentration of the mineral in the air, silicosis can result in different clinical forms. The most prevalent type, chronic silicosis, is linked to a variety of jobs, including well digging and quarry work.

Among the studies focusing on self-evaluated empathy, four relied on the Jefferson Scale of Empathy for medical professionals (JSE-HP). However, assessments from patients employing Jefferson Scale of Patient's Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE) and Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) scale suggested high levels of empathy We found that both professionals and patients perceived that empathic care was provided, often at a medium or regular level. Surgery residents presented lower levels of empathy compared to obstetrics-gynecology and pediatrics physicians.
Conclusion: Empathy is crucial in determining the quality of care and patient satisfaction during healthcare services provided by HCWs. Therefore, it is important to support professionals so that the various stressful situations they encounter in their work and daily life do not negatively influence the approach they provide to patients.",,,Frontiers in Psychiatry,,,,2023-11-24,2023,2023-11-24,,14,,1249620,All OA; Gold,Article,"Moya-Salazar, Jeel; Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A; Porras-Guillermo, Jorge; Cañari, Betsy; Jaime-Quispe, Alexis; Zuñiga, Nahomi; Moya-Salazar, María Jesús; Contreras-Pulache, Hans","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Faculties of Health Science, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A (School of Biomedical Engieneering, Faculties of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima, Peru); Porras-Guillermo, Jorge (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru); Cañari, Betsy (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Jaime-Quispe, Alexis (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Zuñiga, Nahomi (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Moya-Salazar, María Jesús (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Contreras-Pulache, Hans (Digital Transformation Center, Universidad Norbert Wiener, Lima, Peru)","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Private University of the North)","Moya-Salazar, Jeel (Private University of the North); Goicochea-Palomino, Eliane A (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Porras-Guillermo, Jorge (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Cañari, Betsy (Universidad Norbert Wiener; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Jaime-Quispe, Alexis (Universidad Norbert Wiener; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Zuñiga, Nahomi (Universidad Norbert Wiener; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Moya-Salazar, María Jesús (Universidad Norbert Wiener; Neuroscience Unit, Nesh Hubs, Lima, Peru); Contreras-Pulache, Hans (Universidad Norbert Wiener)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1249620/pdf?isPublishedV2=False,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166298135,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This takes place by not only reducing their own carbon footprint but also by educating future leaders and contributing valuable research and expertise to the global effort to combat climate change. However, there is a need for studies that identify the nature of their engagement on the topic, and the extent to which they are contributing towards addressing the many problems associated with climate change. Against this background, this paper describes a study that consisted of a review of the literature and the use of case studies, which outline the importance of university engagement in climate change and describe its main features. The study identified the fact that even though climate change is a matter of great relevance to universities, its coverage in university programmes is not as wide as one could expect. Based on the findings, the paper also lists the challenges associated with the inclusion of climate change in university programmes. Finally, it describes some of the measures which may be deployed in order to maximise the contribution of higher education towards handling the challenges associated with a changing climate.",This study is part of the “100 papers to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals” initiative.,"This work was funded by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, TÉLUQ University.",Scientific Reports,,,,2023-11-03,2023,2023-11-03,,13,1,19030,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal Filho, Walter; Weissenberger, Sebastian; Luetz, Johannes M.; Sierra, Javier; Simon Rampasso, Izabela; Sharifi, Ayyoob; Anholon, Rosley; Eustachio, Joao Henrique Paulinho Pires; Kovaleva, Marina","Leal Filho, Walter (Department of Natural Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Chester Street, M1 5GD, Manchester, UK; European School of Sustainability Science and Research, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany); Weissenberger, Sebastian (TÉLUQ University, Quebec City, Canada); Luetz, Johannes M.

This shared emotional experience gives rise, in turn, to more intense emotions, this being one of the explanatory models of the positive psychological effects of collective participation. Through a quasi-longitudinal design of three measurement-times (N = 273, 65.9% women; age: 18-70, M = 39.43, SD = 11.64), the most massive social mobilization that is celebrated in favor of the Basque language in the Basque Country (Korrika) was analyzed. Repeated measures and sequential mediation analyzes supported the model. The effect of participation on social integration was mediated by the increase in emotions of enjoyment through PES; the effect on social acceptance, social contribution, and social actualization was mediated by increased kama muta through PES; the effect on collective empowerment was mediated by the increase in self-transcendent emotions through PES; and the effect on remembered well-being was partially mediated by PES. Finally, it was also verified for the first time that the effect of participation on social integration, social acceptance and social actualization was maintained through PES (but not through emotions) for at least 6-7 weeks after the event ended.

Outcomes, including changes in insulin sensitivity, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat, were analyzed.
Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted. This review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the number CRD42021281899. Clinical trials involving individuals who are overweight and obese and comparing HIIT with MICT effects on insulin sensitivity, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference were included. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched using controlled vocabulary and free-text terms related to HIIT, obesity, and overweight. The search included studies published until September 2022. The Rob2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The results were presented through meta-analyses that provided summary estimators and confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the effect of the risk of bias on the outcomes. This research did not receive any specific funding.
Results: Of the 2534 articles, 30 met the eligibility criteria. The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 16 weeks. The observed effects for each outcome were as follows: insulin sensitivity (p = 0.02), weight (p = 0.58), BMI (p = 0.53), waist circumference (p = 0.87), body fat percentage (p = 0.07), body fat mass in kilograms (p = 0.39). The level of evidence obtained was moderate except for waist circumference, which was rated as low. Limitations included heterogeneity in training protocols, measurements, and study duration. Additionally, a risk of bias was identified in these studies.
Conclusion: HIIT and MICT did not significantly differ in their effects on weight, BMI, waist circumference, or body fat mass in adults with overweight and obesity. However, a moderate beneficial effect of HIIT was observed on insulin sensitivity. Therefore, further evidence is required to confirm these findings.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2023-09-23,2023,2023-09-23,2023-10,9,10,e20402,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia; Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos; Caballero-Alvarado, José; Canelo-Aybar, Carlos","Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad César Vallejo, Peru); Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru); Caballero-Alvarado, José (Facultad de Medicina Humana, Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego, Peru); Canelo-Aybar, Carlos (Iberoamerican Cochrane Centre, Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Spain)","Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Universidad César Vallejo)","Sanca-Valeriano, Silvia (Universidad César Vallejo); Espinola-Sánchez, Marcos (Private University of the North); Caballero-Alvarado, José (Antenor Orrego Private University); Canelo-Aybar, Carlos (Hospital de Sant Pau)",5,5,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023076107/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164286776,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

An online questionnaire was administered to 1699 LGBTQ+ young adults from six countries (Brazil, Chile, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK). A cluster analysis was conducted, and four profiles of psychological adjustment were identified: unchallenged, resilient, distressed, and at-risk. The at-risk cluster scored lowest in social support (particularly from family). The profiles of participants who experienced the highest levels of pandemic adversity (at-risk and resilient) comprised mostly South American participants, those under lockdown at the time of survey completion, those who self-identified as transgender and non-binary, and those with a plurisexual sexual orientation.

In the course of this, two not yet reported halophilic strains designated ATCHAT and ATCH28T were isolated from hypersaline, alkaline surface waters of Salar de Llamará and Laguna Lejía, respectively. The alkaline environment limits iron bioavailability, suggesting that native organisms produce abundant siderophores to sequester iron.
Methods: Both strains were characterized by polyphasic approach. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed their affiliation with the genus Halomonas. ATCHAT showed close similarity to Halomonas salicampi and Halomonas vilamensis, while ATCH28T was related closest to Halomonas ventosae and Halomonas salina. The ability of both strains to secrete siderophores was initially assessed using the chromeazurol S (CAS) liquid assay and subsequently further investigated through genomic analysis and NMR. Furthermore, the effect of various media components on the siderophore secretion by strain ATCH28T was explored.
Results: The CAS assay confirmed the ability of both strains to produce iron-binding compounds. Genomic analysis of strain ATCHAT revealed the presence of a not yet reported NRPS-dependant gene cluster responsible for the secretion of siderophore. However, as only small amounts of siderophore were secreted, further investigations did not lie within the scope of this study. Via NMR and genomic analysis, strain ATCH28T has been determined to produce desferrioxamine E (DFOE). Although this siderophore is common in various terrestrial microorganisms, it has not yet been reported to occur within Halomonas, making strain ATCH28T the first member of the genus to produce a non-amphiphilic siderophore. By means of media optimization, the produced quantity of DFOE could be increased to more than 1000 µM.
Discussion: Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics clearly differentiated both strains from other members of the genus Halomonas. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) values and DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that the strains represented two novel species. Therefore, both species should be added as new representatives of the genus Halomonas, for which the designations Halomonas llamarensis sp. nov. (type strain ATCHAT = DSM 114476 = LMG 32709) and Halomonas gemina sp. nov. (type strain ATCH28T = DSM 114418 = LMG 32708) are proposed.",,"This study was conducted as part of the SIDEREC project, supported by the ERA-MIN 2 call (German grant number 033RU01 0A and Chilean grant number Nº51-ANID).",Frontiers in Microbiology,,,,2023-06-12,2023,2023-06-12,,14,,1194916,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hintersatz, Christian; Singh, Shalini; Rojas, Luis Antonio; Kretzschmar, Jerome; Wei, Sean Ting-Shyang; Khambhati, Khushal; Kutschke, Sabine; Lehmann, Falk; Singh, Vijai; Jain, Rohan; Pollmann, Katrin","Hintersatz, Christian (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Singh, Shalini (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Rojas, Luis Antonio (Department of Chemistry, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Kretzschmar, Jerome (Department of Actinide Thermodynamics, Institute of Resource Ecology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Wei, Sean Ting-Shyang (Department of Biogeochemistry, Institute of Resource Ecology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Khambhati, Khushal (Department of Biosciences, School of Science, Indrashil University, Mehsana, India); Kutschke, Sabine (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Lehmann, Falk (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Singh, Vijai (Department of Biosciences, School of Science, Indrashil University, Mehsana, India); Jain, Rohan (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany); Pollmann, Katrin (Department of Biotechnology, Helmholtz Institute Freiberg for Resource Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany)","Jain, Rohan (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf)","Hintersatz, Christian (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Singh, Shalini (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Rojas, Luis Antonio (Catholic University of the North); Kretzschmar, Jerome (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Wei, Sean Ting-Shyang (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Khambhati, Khushal (Indrashil University); Kutschke, Sabine (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Lehmann, Falk (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Singh, Vijai (Indrashil University); Jain, Rohan (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf); Pollmann, Katrin (Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf)",3,3,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1194916/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159721051,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics; 3107 Microbiology,

Our aim was to characterize the temporal response of hyperarid soil AD microbial communities to ex situ simulated rainfall (5% g water/g dry soil for 4 weeks) without nutrient amendment. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments with surface soils from two previously well-characterized AD hyperarid locations near Yungay at 1242 and 1609 masl (YUN1242 and YUN1609) with distinct microbial community compositions and average soil relative humidity levels of 21 and 17%, respectively. The bacterial and archaeal response to soil wetting was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene qPCR, and amplicon sequencing. Initial YUN1242 bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were significantly higher than for YUN1609. Over the next 4 weeks, qPCR results showed significant increases in viable bacterial abundance, whereas archaeal abundance decreased. Both communities were dominated by 10 prokaryotic phyla (Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexota, Gemmatimonadota, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, Nitrospirota, Cyanobacteriota, and Crenarchaeota) but there were significant site differences in the relative abundances of Gemmatimonadota and Chloroflexota, and specific actinobacterial orders. The response to simulated rainfall was distinct for the two communities. The actinobacterial taxa in the YUN1242 community showed rapid changes while the same taxa in the YUN1609 community remained relatively stable until day 30. Analysis of inferred function of the YUN1242 microbiome response implied an increase in the relative abundance of known spore-forming taxa with the capacity for mixotrophy at the expense of more oligotrophic taxa, whereas the YUN1609 community retained a stable profile of oligotrophic, facultative chemolithoautotrophic and mixotrophic taxa. These results indicate that bacterial communities in extreme hyperarid soils have the capacity for growth in response to simulated rainfall; however, historic variations in long-term hyperaridity exposure produce communities with distinct putative metabolic capacities.","We thank Daniel Laubitz of the Microbiome Core at the Steele Children’s Research Center, University of Arizona for adaptations of the amplicon sequencing library preparation protocol to maximize the sequencing potential of the low DNA samples from the Atacama Desert.","This research was partially supported by funding from BHP Minerals Americas Project 32002137 (2016-2020), and by the ANID Fondecyt Project N° 1231507.

Abstract  Introduction The structural and/or functional changes or impairments presented by people with disabilities can limit or compromise their interaction, for the performance or fulfillment of personal or social activities, making them then vulnerable people. For evaluation, the occupational therapist must assess several factors that can be considered as a risk of increased vulnerability such as: age, gender, educational level, economic conditions, occupation, physical or mental condition, and presence of comorbidities among others.  Objective To evaluate the level of independence in the performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in individuals belonging to a community of vulnerable people.  Method The Lawton and Brody Index was applied to adults and older adults who had or reported some type of disability, collecting a series of data that were processed and analyzed in the Microsoft Excel 2020® calculation template.  Results 74.2% showed a high level of dependence to develop IADLs, with a predominance in adults. 70.7% had a disability card or certificate, with a moderate negative correlation between the percentage of severity and the level of independence. Rheumatoid arthritis was the disease most frequently associated with loss of independence.  Conclusion It is possible to detect early the level of dependence and the presence of disability, through the application of the Lawton and Brody Index, determining functional limitations to perform IADLs in a community of vulnerable people.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks pose the main threat to public health and the fishing industry in the Patagonian fjords. This study aims to increase understanding of the individual and spatial variability of PSP toxicity in the foot of Concholepas concholepas, Chile’s most valuable commercial benthic invertebrate species, extracted from the Guaitecas Archipelago in Chilean Patagonia. The objective is to determine the effect of pigment removal and freezing during the detoxification process. A total of 150 specimens (≥90 mm length) were collected from this area. The live specimens were transferred to a processing plant, where they were measured and gutted, the foot was divided into two equal parts, and pigment was manually removed from one of these parts. The PSP toxicity of each foot (edible tissue) was determined by mouse bioassay (MBA) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and postcolumn oxidation (HPLC-FLD PCOX). The individual toxicity per loco, as the species is known locally, varied from <30 to 146 μg STX diHCL eq 100 g−1 (CV = 43.83%) and from 5.96 to 216.3 μg STX diHCL eq 100 g−1 (CV = 34.63%), using MBA and HPLC, respectively. A generalized linear model showed a negative relation between individual weight and toxicity. The toxicological profile showed a dominance of STX (>95%), neoSTX and GTX2. The removal of pigment produced a reduction in PSP toxicity of up to 90% and could represent a good detoxification tool moving forward. The freezing process in the muscle with pigment did not produce a clear pattern. There is a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of PSP toxicity via PCOX but not MBA. Furthermore, the study discusses possible management and commercialization implications of the findings regarding small-scale fisheries.",We thank Pacific Farmer Company for providing us with the use of their facilities for the experimental trials.,"This research was funded by the Undersecretariat of Public Health of the Ministry of Health.

These values allow for a clear understanding of the smelted product's expected quality, catering for any required chemical upgrading of the raw material or modification in the furnace's set-point if the calcine has undesired characteristics. Offline tests for calcines' chemical composition can take several days, potentially delaying the whole operation. A data-driven approach to chemical composition classification using on-line data is proposed by combining clustering classification through a mixed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model, data processing and standardization process, with a Machine Learning classification algorithm, i.e. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). This allows for an online prediction of calcines' chemical composition based on the furnace's current operating conditions. The proposed method's accuracy scored mean values between 82.1% and 85.9%, which is encouraging in comparison with other proposed methods.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Jorge Sofrony reports financial support was provided by Cerro Matoso S.A.

These conditions are expected to result in the adaptive evolution of protein coding genes encoded in mitochondrial genomes that are vital for the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In this study, we formally tested for signatures of adaptive evolution on mitochondrial protein coding genes in Tapirus pinchaque and other odd-toed ungulates inhabiting high-elevation environments.ResultsThe AT-rich mitochondrial genome of T. pinchaque is 16,750 bp long. A phylomitogenomic analysis supports the monophyly of the genus Tapirus and families in the Perissodactyla. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions demonstrated that all mitochondrial genes undergo purifying selection in T. pinchaque and other odd ungulates living at high elevations. Over this negative background selection, Branch Models suggested that cox3 and nad6 might be undergoing stronger purifying selection than other mitochondrial protein coding genes. Furthermore, Site Models suggested that one and four sites in nad2 and nad5, respectively, could be experiencing positive selection. However, these results were supported by Likelihood Ratio Tests but not Bayesian Empirical Bayes posterior probabilities. Additional analyses (in DataMonkey) indicated a relaxation of selection strength in nad6, evidence of episodic diversifying selection in cob, and revealed episodic positive/diversifying selection signatures for two sites in nad1, and one site each in nad2 and nad4.ConclusionThe mitochondrial genome of T. pinchaque is an important genomic resource for conservation of this species and this study contributes to the understanding of adaptive evolution of mitochondrial protein coding genes in odd-toed ungulates inhabiting high-altitude environments.",J.A.B thanks Dr. Vincent P.

However, in some territories, excessive ambition, fear imposed by force, and power over laws have proliferated. In the case of Colombia, war as an industry empowers different sides that are either endorsed or rendered invisible in the narratives of traditional mass media. Media content has always favored war journalism and neglected two vital approaches: peace journalism (PP) and university journalism. This study’s relevance lies in its use of big data, automated lexicometry, and statistical discourse analysis to understand how university journalism built a peace journalism agenda, taking the narrative of the Peace Agreement in Colombia as a framework of observation, with a clear result in the importance of equity, diversity, and equality in a peaceful transition scenario in Colombia. The study reveals that university journalism has a diverse narrative approach, focusing on presenting the social problems and inequities, the lack of political capacities within communities, the need for a transitional approach toward peace, and the pursuit of truth. The study used mixed research techniques where students narrated their individual perspectives that informed a collective view by integrating the voices of those who suffer the conflict daily. Simultaneously, they showed how academia, from its training function, develops exercises that may compromise the integrity of the axiological values of communication and journalism. The main implication of our study suggests the need to strengthen pedagogical processes of peace in the curriculum and training that enable the next generation of journalists in the country to potentially shift their discourse toward peace journalism and divergent solutions, as opposed to those proposed by traditional media. In conclusion, including youth opinions that were supported by experts on the process introduced an element of community empowerment and recognition of victims within the context and social structure of the Colombian conflict.",,"This article has been funded by the Universidad del Rosario in the frame of the project: “Lexicodata: Data Sciences and lexicometry in communication and digital marketing.

666,pub.1155392183,10.3389/feart.2023.1111530,,,Adaptation timescales of estuarine systems to human interventions,"Many estuaries and tidal basins are strongly influenced by various human interventions (land reclamations, infrastructure development, channel deepening, dredging and disposal of sediments). Such interventions lead to a range of hydrodynamic and morphological responses (a changing channel depth, tidal amplitude and/or suspended sediment concentration). The response time of a system to interventions is determined by the processes driving this change, the size of the system, and the magnitude of the intervention. A quantitative understanding of the response time to an intervention therefore provides important insight into the processes driving the response. In this paper we develop and apply a methodology to estimate the response timescales of human interventions using available morphological and hydraulic data. Fitting an exponential decay function to data with sufficient temporal resolution yields an adaptation timescale (and equilibrium value) of the tidal range and deposited sediment volumes. The method has been applied in the Dutch Wadden Sea, where two large basins were reclaimed and where long-term and detailed bathymetric maps are available. Exponential fitting the morphological data revealed that closure of a very large part of a tidal basin in the Wadden Sea initially led to internal redistribution and import of coarse and fine sediments, and was followed by a phase of extensive redistribution while only fine-grained sediments are imported. Closure of a smaller part of a smaller basin led to shorter response timescales, and these response timescales are also more sensitive to rising mean sea levels or high waters. The method has also been applied to tidal water level observations in the Scheldt and Ems estuaries. Exponential fits to tidal data reveal that adaptation timescales are shortest at the landward limit of dredging. The adaptation time increases in the landward direction because of retrogressive erosion (Scheldt) or lowering of the hydraulic roughness (Ems). The seaward increase in adaptation time is related to the seaward widening of both systems.","We are grateful for the Dutch Ministry of Public Works, the Hydrological Information Centre of Flanders Hydraulics Research, and the Niedersächsische Landesbetrieb für Wasserwirtschaft, Küsten-und Naturschutz (NLWKN) for providing data.

Additionally, the increasing pressure exerted by the withdrawals of human activities, such as agriculture and metal mining, promotes conditions of hydric scarcity. Despite this intensive use of the watersheds and the sustained and increasing aridity, it has not been explored whether an artificial sedimentary record can trace these changes in the agricultural valleys of the region. To unravel and evaluate the recent environmental/climatic variability, the effects of the mega-drought that has pertained since 2010, extractivist pressures on a Mediterranean valley in central Chile, and sediment records were obtained from an irrigation dam and studied through a multi-proxy analysis. The dam was built and has been in operation since 1975 and is located in the Aconcagua River Valley, Valparaíso, Chile. Magnetic properties, carbon content, mineral composition, and metal content were analyzed from sediments of a 120 cm long core. Changes in vegetation cover from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed through NDVI filters. Horizons associated with drier conditions were observed in the upper zone of the core, which corresponded from the year 2001 to the present, assuming a constant sedimentation rate of 2.72 cm·yr−1. Additionally, the characteristic alternation of dry–wet conditions was observed in the deep horizon of the dam sediments. The concentrations of Cu, Pb, Al, and As have increased over the years, while the concentration of Mo has decreased. Some of these elements are associated with copper mining, existing in the valley. Analysis of Landsat images from the year 2000 to the present has identified a significant decrease in vegetation cover associated with dry/wet periods, which may be related to cycles of El Niño/La Niña events. Although not all the proxies analyzed were sensitive enough to detect changes at the desired resolution, since the dam is very recent, the results shed light on the effects of the interaction between industrial activities and the decrease of water availability in multiple-use watersheds, suggesting variations in metals concentrations and changes in water availability, probably promoted by anthropic activities, climatic events, and increasing aridity in the Aconcagua River Valley.","We would like to thank the ANID-FONDECYT 1200423 and ANID-FODECYT Postdoctorado 3210291 projects for their support.

This article analyses the formalisation of the sector in Chile by the National Mining Company –better known as ENAMI, the acronym of its Spanish name. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews and informationfrom secondary sources, the authors explain that ENAMI not only regulates the sector, which is essential for its legalisation. The organisation also connects local networks of small-scale mining to international markets because it buys, processes and sells the mining output. ENAMI develops the sector, providing credits, geological studies,training programmes and other forms of support. It stabilises the prices of minerals, increasing the resilience against external shocks. Thus, ENAMI has an essential impact on territorial development. However, this model suffers from certain shortcomings. ENAMI needs a much higher annual budget. It has not managed to increase the competitiveness of small-scale mining. The authors discuss different ideas regarding a reform of ENAMI. The organisation could continue to support all small-scale mining companies, keeping them afloat. Alternatively, thefocus could shift to increasing competitiveness, which would be a fundamental change of the current model because it implies that firms that do not become more productive will cease to exist.",,,Investigaciones Geográficas,,,,2023-12-22,2023,2023-12-22,,,66,1-13,All OA; Gold,Article,"Scholvin, Sören; Atienza, Miguel","Scholvin, Sören (Universidad Católica del Norte); Atienza, Miguel (Universidad Católica del Norte)",,"Scholvin, Sören (Catholic University of the North); Atienza, Miguel (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,https://investigacionesgeograficas.uchile.cl/index.php/IG/article/download/70689/75190,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167282323,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

SH31 Isolated from Poly-Extreme Salar de Huasco in the Chilean Altiplano: A Study on Rare-Earth Element Tolerance,"Rare-earth elements (REEs) are crucial metals with limited global availability due to their indispensable role in various high-tech industries. As the demand for rare-earth elements continues to rise, there is a pressing need to develop sustainable methods for their recovery from secondary sources. Focusing on Exiguobacterium sp. SH31, this research investigates the impact of La, Eu, Gd, and Sm on its physiological performance and biosorption capacity. Tolerance was assessed at pHpzc from 7 to 8 with up to 1 mM rare-earth element concentrations. This study visualized the production of extracellular polymeric substances using Congo red assays and quantified them with ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterized the functional groups involved in metal interactions. The SH31 strain displayed significant rare-earth element tolerance, confirmed extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production under all conditions, and increased production in the presence of Sm. Spectroscopy analysis revealed changes in wavelengths associated with OH and R-COO-, suggesting rare-earth element interactions. SH31 demonstrated efficient metal adsorption, with removal rates exceeding 75% at pHpzc 7 and over 95% at pHpzc 7.5 and 8. The calculated Qmax value for rare-earth element biosorption was approximately 23 mg/g, and Langmuir isotherm models effectively described metal sorption equilibria. Genomic exploration identified genes related to extracellular polymeric substance formation, providing insights into underlying mechanisms.

213,pub.1163527288,10.3389/feart.2023.1148299,,,Marine invertebrates as proxies for early kelp use along the western coast of South America,"Coastal societies have lived at the seaward edge of the Atacama Desert since at least 12,000 years ago. Kelp forest ecosystems provide evidence for important subsistence activity along the entire Chilean coast through fishing and gathering. Despite their importance, especially in hyperarid contexts with limited plant abundance, there is scarce evidence of kelp in archaeological contexts, hampering the study of kelp use in the past. In the present study, we use the presence of small marine invertebrates, inhabitants of stipes and holdfasts of macroalgae, as proxies that indicate past kelp presence. We analyze samples of three species of snails (Tegula atra, Tegula tridentata, and Diloma nigerrima) and one limpet (Scurria scurra) from nine archaeological sites dated between 7,000 and 500 cal years before present located around the area of Taltal (25°Lat S). Modern samples of these species were collected to reconstruct the size of fragmented archaeological shells and subsequently estimate the size of harvested kelps. Through this approach, we estimated the size and relative abundance of kelp used by coastal groups that inhabited the southern part of the Atacama Desert for around 6,500 years. Our results are a contribution to the scarce information on the presence and use of kelp in the prehistory of the Americas and contribute to comparative perspectives with other areas of the world where the use of kelp by humans in the past has already been explored.","The authors thank Projects FONDECYT 11200953, 1181300, 1151203, and 1110196; Millennium Nucleus UPWELL NCN19_153, and all their teams.

193,pub.1160617627,10.3390/catal13071085,,,An Efficient Investigation and Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Decolorization of Wastewater by Using Zeolite Catalyst in Electro-Fenton Reaction,"The shortage of water resources has caused extensive research to be conducted in this field to develop effective, rapid, and affordable wastewater treatment methods. For the treatment of wastewater, modern oxidation techniques are desirable due to their excellent performance and simplicity of implementation. In this project, wet impregnation and the hydrothermal technique were applied to synthesize a modified catalyst. Different analysis methods were used to determine its characteristics, including XRD, BET, FT-IR, NH3−TPD, and FE-SEM. The catalyst features a spherical shape, large surface area, high crystallinity, and uniform active phase dispersion. In order to eliminate the methylene blue dye as a modeling effluent, the catalyst’s performance was examined in a heterogeneous quasi-electro-Fenton (EF) reaction. The impact of various performance characteristics, such as catalyst concentration in the reaction medium, solution pH, and current intensity between the two electrodes, was elucidated. According to the results, the best operational circumstances included a pH level of 2, a catalyst concentration of 0.15 g/L, and a current of 150 mA, resulting in the greatest elimination efficiency of 101%. The catalyst’s performance was stable during three consecutive tests. A pseudo-first-order model for the elimination reaction’s kinetics was developed, which showed acceptable agreement with the experimental results. This study’s findings help clarify how well the heterogeneous zeolite catalyst functions in the pseudo-EF reaction. The results revealed the method’s potential to be implemented in wastewater treatment. An artificial neural network model is utilized to predict the removal percentage. The hyperparameter tuning is used to find the best model, and the model achieved an MAE of 1.26% and the R2 was 0.99.","This work was supported by King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia.

183,pub.1162786951,10.3389/fevo.2023.1123288,,,A melting-pot for Pterodroma petrels on Rapa Nui: ecological divergence and reproductive isolation in a contact zone,"Speciation is thought to depend on general ecological segregation rather than on strict allopatry in species with planetary-scale foraging ranges, such as Pterodroma petrels. Separation in both breeding islands and foraging grounds are generally considered to be the conditions for prezygotic isolation. However, it is unclear how both can be maintained in a context of ongoing distributional range shifts due to global change, with range contractions and expansions caused by changing land use in breeding territories and oceanographic conditions impacting productivity areas. In this context, we expect that wherever the fragile balance of allopatric segregation breaks down, gene flow may be re-established across the borders of what is currently considered separated species. In these “melting pot” areas, fine-scale ecological differentiation is likely the only force opposing panmixia in otherwise highly similar organisms. In this study, we focus on six Polynesian Pterodroma species currently found on Motu Nui, a protected islet offshore of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), four of which have likely extended their breeding range to that island recently. To understand the fine-scale interaction between these closely-related species in their new contact zone, we used an integrative approach combining ecological and genetic methods, including morphometric, bioacoustics, stable isotope niche reconstruction, breeding site characterisation, phenology traits, and both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. We found that significant amounts of gene flow occur across what is currently considered species boundaries, sometimes questioning the relevance of the accepted species classification. Interestingly, our results indicate that multivariate ecological distance between individuals in a group of closely related species (P. alba, P. atrata, P. heraldica, and P. neglecta) is a relevant predictor of gene flow intensity, while more distant species such as P. ultima and P. nigripennis seem to maintain reproductive isolation. Thus, the case of Pterodroma petrels supports the idea that incomplete allopatric speciation processes may be halted or even reversed on a secondary contact zone. Beyond their direct taxonomical relevance, our results underline the importance of considering fine ecological structures for biodiversity mapping and conservation policies.","We are particularly thankful to seabird expert Peter Harrison for his assistance in confirming species identifications and reviewing the text.

With the definition of the Agenda 2030 and the role of cities in achieving sustainable development goals, much work has been devoted to the definition of evaluation frameworks and indicators to assess policies and plans and support decision-making in the transition to sustainable urban environments. Therefore, there is currently a wide range of indicator frameworks for the sustainability assessment of human settlements. However, considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban sustainability paradigm, the need to reassess the relevance of existing assessment frameworks in the post-pandemic context has been highlighted. Thus, this article aims to illustrate a selection of indicators to evaluate urban sustainability in developing countries’ post-pandemic contexts, using Colombia as a case study. This work comprises the characterization of the post-pandemic relevance of a set of sustainability indicators through the participation of stakeholders associated with the development process of social housing in urban environments in Colombia. Within a Delphi process, the initial indicators were taken from local and international sustainability frameworks validated before the pandemic. Further, a final selection was made through the evaluation of a survey from a sample of 45 stakeholders, and different participatory mechanisms with experts. These results acknowledged the relevance of factors, such as atmospheric conditions, risk management, the performance of public transport systems, and the availability and accessibility to key services, in the achievement of urban sustainability. These results will support the sustainability assessment of the development of post-pandemic recovery policies in Colombia and serve as a reference for other contexts in developing countries.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2023-02-03,2023,2023-02-03,,15,3,2830,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo; Torabi Moghadam, Sara; Lombardi, Patrizia","Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, Politecnico di Torino, 10125 Torino, Italy); Torabi Moghadam, Sara (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, Politecnico di Torino, 10125 Torino, Italy); Lombardi, Patrizia (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, Politecnico di Torino, 10125 Torino, Italy)","Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo (Polytechnic University of Turin)","Escorcia Hernández, Jhon Ricardo (Polytechnic University of Turin); Torabi Moghadam, Sara (Polytechnic University of Turin); Lombardi, Patrizia (Polytechnic University of Turin)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/3/2830/pdf?version=1675840618,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155172873,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
162,pub.1157884938,10.3389/fenvs.2023.1137496,,,Soil and groundwater contamination by crude oil spillage: A review and implications for remediation projects in Nigeria,"Management of soil and groundwater resources has been recognized as essential to meeting the sustainable development goals of Agenda 2063 of the African Union. As Africa’s fastest growing population with over 200 million people, Nigeria is responsible for leading the continent’s environmental sustainability goal. Nigeria has seen a sizable number of crude oil spillages that have contaminated its soils and groundwater resources, and several of these contaminated sites are to be cleaned up yet. There needs to be more scientific data to design an effective cleanup and to manage the soil and groundwater resources effectively. So far, the only extensive crude oil-contaminated site remediation project documented is on Ogoniland in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. However, this project resulted in less effective, albeit temporary, cleanup solutions. This review presents a state-of-the-art synthesis of research on soil and groundwater contamination by crude oil. It includes sections on processes, measurements, predictions, and management, as well as an analysis of the state and challenges in Nigeria. In-depth field, laboratory, and computer models for crude oil contamination investigation have been developed with over 60 years of significant research. However, studies and case projects in Nigeria have relied on point sampling to determine the concentration of crude oil contaminants in soil and groundwater. This method offers limited information on the solute concentration and hydraulic distribution, which regulates pollutant mobility within the subsurface. The absence of baseline and high-resolution subsurface characterization data has also resulted in a need for more process-based knowledge to direct the development of site-specific remediation strategies. As a result, it is challenging to design a conceptual model that is detailed enough to help with predictions of the flow dynamics of crude oil contaminants in the unsaturated and saturated zones. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further multidisciplinary research through site evaluation and monitoring to provide reliable information that can be used to develop appropriate model-based remediation solutions.",The authors wish to thank the African Union for providing financial support (scholarship) through the Pan African University Initiative.,This review paper was funded in part by the African Union.,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,,,2023-05-09,2023,2023-05-09,,11,,1137496,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adeniran, Margaret A.; Oladunjoye, Michael A.; Doro, Kennedy O.","Adeniran, Margaret A.

Pandora is the primary event reconstruction software used at ProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment far detector. ProtoDUNE-SP, located at CERN, is exposed to a charged-particle test beam. This paper gives an overview of the Pandora reconstruction algorithms and how they have been tailored for use at ProtoDUNE-SP. In complex events with numerous cosmic-ray and beam background particles, the simulated reconstruction and identification efficiency for triggered test-beam particles is above 80% for the majority of particle type and beam momentum combinations. Specifically, simulated 1 GeV/c charged pions and protons are correctly reconstructed and identified with efficiencies of 86.1±0.6$$\pm 0.6$$% and 84.1±0.6$$\pm 0.6$$%, respectively.

In addition, a search for new energy-saving opportunities was performed. The results showed that interactions between the temperature of the air inlet, the humidity of the air inlet, and the fan speed level are significant in the mini-split energy performance under Caribbean climate conditions. Hence, working on an oriented energy savings control strategy is necessary. Therefore, this study recommends developing a fan speed control scheme, generating energy savings of around 10% in the air conditioning unit.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Although refractory ascites are not a common complication, they can have a significant impact on patients' prognosis and quality of life. This condition can be caused by multiple mechanisms, both intrahepatic and extrahepatic, and one of them is the splenic artery steal syndrome. In this article, we present the case of a patient with advanced cirrhosis who developed refractory ascites following liver transplantation. Despite management with diuretics and paracentesis, the ascites did not respond to conventional treatment. The diagnosis of splenic artery steal syndrome was confirmed through angiography, and subsequent embolization of the splenic artery resulted in symptom resolution.",We would like to express our gratitude to the Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation at Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe.

In Colombia, the use of illicit substances has increased up to 10.3%, while the consumption alcohol and tobacco has increased to 84% and 12%, respectively. It is well-known that identifying drug consumption patterns in the general population is essential in reducing overall drug consumption. However, existing approaches do not incorporate Machine Learning and/or Deep Data Mining methods in combination with spatial techniques. To enhance our understanding of mental health issues related to PAS and assist in the development of national policies, here we present a novel Deep Neural Network-based Clustering-oriented Embedding Algorithm that incorporates an autoencoder and spatial techniques. The primary goal of our model is to identify general and spatial patterns of drug consumption and abuse, while also extracting relevant features from the input data and identifying clusters during the learning process. As a test case, we used the largest publicly available database of legal and illegal PAS consumption comprising 49,600 Colombian households. We estimated and geographically represented the prevalence of consumption and/or abuse of both PAS and non-PAS, while achieving statistically significant goodness-of-fit values. Our results indicate that region, sex, housing type, socioeconomic status, age, and variables related to household finances contribute to explaining the patterns of consumption and/or abuse of PAS. Additionally, we identified three distinct patterns of PAS consumption and/or abuse. At the spatial level, these patterns indicate concentrations of drug consumption in specific regions of the country, which are closely related to specific geographic locations and the prevailing social and environmental contexts. These findings can provide valuable insights to facilitate decision-making and develop national policies targeting specific groups given their cultural, geographic, and social conditions.",,,PLOS ONE,,Vinícius Silva Belo,"Humans; Colombia; Neural Networks, Computer; Algorithms; Alcohol Drinking; Central Nervous System Agents; Cluster Analysis",2023-08-18,2023,2023-08-18,,18,8,e0290098,All OA; Gold,Article,"Palomino, Kevin; Berdugo, Carmen R; Vélez, Jorge I","Palomino, Kevin (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Berdugo, Carmen R (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Vélez, Jorge I (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.)",,"Palomino, Kevin (Universidad del Norte); Berdugo, Carmen R (Universidad del Norte); Vélez, Jorge I (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290098&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163387315,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study aims to compare the distribution of empathy levels, about functionality or dysfunction, and the three styles, which can be derived from family functioning in the families of Argentine medical students. Previously providing evidence of the validity of the family functioning measure. As well as provide evidence of the validity of the measure of family functioning.
METHODS: Ex post facto design: 306 Argentine medical students who had already taken the Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Spanish Edition (JSE-S) and the abbreviated Spanish Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-20). A gender-weighted linear regression analysis was made, establishing an ANOVA and multiple comparisons via DMS to determine the effect of functional and dysfunctional families' balanced, intermediate and extreme functioning styles concerning empathy.
RESULTS: Students who presented dysfunction in familial cohesion and adaptability showed measures of empathy greater than those classified as functional. Differences of cohesion were statistically significant in compassionate care, perspective taking and general empathy. These components were significantly higher in students from families classified as extreme than balanced ones. Students classified within families with either extreme or dysfunctional styles showed greater levels of empathy than more adaptive and functional ones, except in the 'walking in patient's shoes' component where differences were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual resilience as an intervening variable in the presence of empathy is discussed.
IMPLICATIONS: The study of empathy, its associated variables, and the conditions of its development remains a central theme in relation to students and professionals of the health sciences.

Juan de Acosta, Atlántico, a city located on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is home to the world's second-largest HD pedigree. Here, we include 291 descendants of this pedigree with at least one family member with HD. Blood samples were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted. We quantified the HTT CAG expansion using an amplicon sequencing protocol. The genetic heterogeneity was measured as the ratio of the mosaicism allele's read peak and the slippage ratio of the allele's read peak from our sequence data. The statistical and bioinformatic analyses were performed with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. We found that the average HTT CAG repeat length in all participants was 21.91 (SD = 8.92). Of the 291 participants, 33 (11.3%, 18 females) had a positive molecular diagnosis for HD. Most affected individuals were adults, and the most common primary and secondary alleles were 17/7 (CAG/CCG) and 17/10 (CAG/CCG), respectively. The mosaicism increased with age in the participants with HD, while the slippage analyses revealed differences by the HD allele type only for the secondary allele. The slippage tended to increase with the HTT CAG repeat length in the participants with HD, but the increase was not statistically significant. This study analyzed the genetic and molecular features of 291 participants, including 33 with HD. We found that the mosaicism increased with age in the participants with HD, particularly for the secondary allele. The most common haplotype was 17/7_17/10. The slippage for the secondary allele varied by the HD allele type, but there was no significant difference in the slippage by sex. Our findings offer valuable insights into HD and could have implications for future research and clinical management.","We express our highest appreciation to all individuals who voluntarily participated in this study.

According to the SIMCE test carried out in 2015, 45% of 8th year students in Chile were overweight. Moreover, international studies have shown that being overweight is associated with the development of chronic illnesses, negatively affecting cognitive mechanisms and processes. Nevertheless, there is little to no evidence that analyzes the relationship between physical fitness and executive functions in students, at a national level. The aim was to analyze the relationship between cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and motor fitness, and performance in an executive functions test, in students from a public school in the south of Chile. A qualitative, descriptive -correlational, non-experimental, and cross-sectional approach was used. In total, 100 students between 9 and 12 and 11 months of age from a public school in the south of Chile completed the physical fitness assessments through the ALPHA fitness test, and 81 students completed the executive function assessments through the ENFEN test. It was evidenced that students who achieved a longer duration of time and a later stage in the Course Navette test, more centimeters in the standing broad jump (SBJ) test, and a shorter duration in the 4 × 10 shuttle run obtained a better score in the gray trail test. Additionally, students who presented a stronger dominant handgrip scored higher in the colored trail tests. We conclude that students who show a higher level of physical fitness also present a better development of executive functions such as working memory and inhibitory control. In addition, these results suggest physical condition is a factor to consider for better cognitive and school performance.","The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the support of all the educational communities involved in this study: school administrators, teachers, students, parents, and legal guardians.",This research received no external funding.,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-02-20,2023,2023-02-20,,13,2,191,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús; Salazar, Franco; Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge; Parra-Rizo, María Antonia; Zapata-Lamana, Rafael; Diaz-Vargas, Caterin; Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime; Cigarroa, Igor","Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús (Departamento de Matemáticas y Estadística, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081008, Colombia); Salazar, Franco (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Faculty of Health Sciences, Valencian International University (VIU), 46002 Valencia, Spain; Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Social and Health Sciences, Campus of Elche, Miguel Hernandez University (UMH), 03202 Elche, Spain); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Diaz-Vargas, Caterin (Escuela de Educación, Universidad de Concepción, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Centro de Investigación de Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile; Laboratorio de Rendimiento Humano, Grupo de Estudios en Educación, Actividad Física y Salud (GEEAFyS), Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile); Cigarroa, Igor (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Los Ángeles 4440000, Chile)","Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Santo Tomás)","Alonso-Cabrera, Jesús (Universidad del Norte); Salazar, Franco (Universidad Santo Tomás); Benavides-Ulloa, Jorge (Universidad Santo Tomás); Parra-Rizo, María Antonia (Valencian International University; Miguel Hernandez University); Zapata-Lamana, Rafael (University of Concepción); Diaz-Vargas, Caterin (University of Concepción); Vásquez-Gómez, Jaime (Catholic University of the Maule; Catholic University of the Maule); Cigarroa, Igor (Universidad Santo Tomás)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/13/2/191/pdf?version=1676961087,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155620923,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

About 40% of the patients with PPGL have a hereditary predisposition. Here we present a case-series of 19 unrelated Colombian patients with a clinical diagnosis of PPGL tumors that underwent germline genetic testing as part of the Hereditary Cancer Program developed at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Colombia (INC-C), the largest reference cancer center in the country. Ten of 19 patients (52.63%) were identified as carriers of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variant in a known susceptibility gene. The majority of the P/LP variants were in the SDHB gene (9/10): one corresponded to a nonsense variant c.268C>T (p.Arg90*) and eight cases were found to be carriers of a recurrent CNV consisting of a large deletion of one copy of exon 1, explaining 42% (8/19) of all the affected cases. Only one additional case was found to be a carrier of a missense mutation in the VHL gene: c.355T>C (p.Phe119Leu). Our study highlights the major role of SDHB in Colombian patients with a clinical diagnosis of PGL/PCC tumors and supports the recommendation of including the analysis of large deletions/duplications of the SDHB gene as part of the genetic counselling to improve the detection rate of hereditary cases and their clinical care.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the INC-C and its staff for their contribution with data from the Hereditary Cancer Program Registry.,"MS (C19990300218—Program for the Creation of a National Network of Hereditary Cancer in Colombia, INC-C); MS (C19990300210—Institutional Program for the Identification and Management of Families with Suspected Hereditary Cancer, INC-C).",Frontiers in Genetics,,,,2023-01-04,2023,2023-01-04,,13,,999329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Manotas, María Carolina; Rivera, Ana Lucía; Gómez, Ana Milena; Abisambra, Patricia; Guevara, Gonzalo; Medina, Vilma; Tapiero, Sandra; Huertas, Antonio; Riaño-Moreno, Julián; Mejía, Juan Carlos; Gonzalez-Clavijo, Angélica María; Tapiero-García, Mireya; Cuéllar-Cuéllar, Andrés Arturo; Fierro-Maya, Luis Felipe; Sanabria-Salas, María Carolina","Manotas, María Carolina (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Rivera, Ana Lucía (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Gómez, Ana Milena (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Abisambra, Patricia (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Guevara, Gonzalo (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Medina, Vilma (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Tapiero, Sandra (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Huertas, Antonio (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Riaño-Moreno, Julián (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Mejía, Juan Carlos (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Gonzalez-Clavijo, Angélica María (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Tapiero-García, Mireya (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Cuéllar-Cuéllar, Andrés Arturo (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Fierro-Maya, Luis Felipe (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia); Sanabria-Salas, María Carolina (Medical Subdirection, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia; Subdirection of Research, Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Bogotá, Colombia)","Sanabria-Salas, María Carolina (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología; Instituto Nacional de Cancerología)","Manotas, María Carolina (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Rivera, Ana Lucía (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Gómez, Ana Milena (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Abisambra, Patricia (Universidad del Norte); Guevara, Gonzalo (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Medina, Vilma (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Tapiero, Sandra (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Huertas, Antonio (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Riaño-Moreno, Julián (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Mejía, Juan Carlos (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Gonzalez-Clavijo, Angélica María (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Tapiero-García, Mireya (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Cuéllar-Cuéllar, Andrés Arturo (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Fierro-Maya, Luis Felipe (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología); Sanabria-Salas, María Carolina (Instituto Nacional de Cancerología; Instituto Nacional de Cancerología)",5,5,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.999329/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154224812,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

Early diagnosis, comorbidity prevention, and control are cornerstones for a quality life and for improving life expectancy. In Colombian Caribbean, where there is a genetically admixed population, CF is an orphan disease affecting children and adults, and it remains a challenging issue to be addressed carefully. This work describes the genetic, clinical, and paraclinical profiles of CF patients from Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.
Methods: Thirty-six patients were included in the study. The subjects were identified and evaluated through the Regional Program for CF patients. CFTR gene mutations, anthropometric parameters, microbiological infections, and pulmonary function were analyzed. Data on demographic parameters, pharmacological treatments, and comorbidities were reported. Frequency and percentages were established for the categorical variables and mean or median for the quantitative variables. In addition, comparisons were made by sex.
Results: The average age of the patients was 11.9 ± 5.3 years and the median age at diagnosis was 14 months. 55.5% were women and 44.5% were men. The mean values for weight, height, and body mass index were 35 ± 17.6 kg, 139.9 ± 28 cm, and 16.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2, respectively. The clinical manifestations that occurred more frequently were steatorrhea (65.4%) and recurrent pneumonia (46.2%). Chronic airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 71.4% of the cases and the p.F508del mutation was found in 47.2% of the subjects.
Conclusion: The current profile of CF patients from the Colombian Caribbean showed some concerning features, such as nutritional status; however, progress in early diagnosis and clinical follow-up could contribute to improve the general conditions of patients. It is necessary to continue efforts to increase the life expectancy and quality of life of the patients.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In the search for new potential drug candidates that can be used as treatments or adjuvants in the control of infections by these pathogenic yeasts, the objective of this research was to evaluate the action of isoespintanol (ISO) against the formation of fungal biofilms, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and its effect on the integrity of the cell wall. We report the ability of ISO to inhibit the formation of biofilms by up to 89.35%, in all cases higher than the values expressed by amphotericin B (AFB). Flow cytometric experiments using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) showed the ability of ISO to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells. Likewise, experiments using calcofluor white (CFW) and analyzed by flow cytometry showed the ability of ISO to affect the integrity of the cell wall by stimulating chitin synthesis; these changes in the integrity of the wall were also observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These mechanisms are involved in the antifungal action of this monoterpene.","To Homero San Juan, Specialized Diagnostic Center, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla.

We present the case of a 41-year-old man with a history of Hansen's disease with sensory and motor symptoms. Electrodiagnostic studies and ultrasound showed asymmetric lesions of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Because this is the main complication of this pathology, electrodiagnosis is clearly valuable for its diagnosis, demonstrating axonal and myelin involvement, as well as signs of denervation and reinnervation. Ultrasound is valuable in the detection, diagnosis, and assessment of the extent of mononeuritis multiplex due to Hansen's disease. It aids in identifying significant inflammatory deterioration, as indicated by increased blood flow in the nerves and enlargement of the nerves. This technique allows for the exploration of nerves such as the ulnar nerve and branches of the brachial plexus.

When the work environment negatively influences individuals, it may trigger emotional disturbances, behavioral problems, chronic stress conditions, and illnesses such as burnout syndrome (BS). Recently, studies on BS have increased and placed a special focus on health care professionals. The prevalence of BS among health professionals is associated with their chronic exposure to human hardship and long working hours without proper rest. These factors have contributed to greater stress and high physical and emotional exhaustion levels.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and map studies using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scale to identify burnout syndrome in health professionals working in public health services.
METHODS: This scoping review was developed based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers Manual and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). A total of 6 databases were searched to identify relevant studies: Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE or PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Gray literature was consulted on ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Google Scholar, Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations. Additionally, the reference lists were searched to retrieve studies not previously selected. The steps followed in this study were proposed by Arskey and O'Malley and Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien: identification of research questions, identification of potential studies, study selection, data extraction and imputation, data analyses and interpretation, and consultation with stakeholders. The detailed methodology was published in a protocol.
RESULTS: A total of 55 articles were identified after screening for eligibility criteria, published between 1999 and 2021 in 32 countries. Most reports were published in Brazil, Spain, and China. A total of 22 versions of the MBI were identified, presenting different items, scores, and cutoff points. The included studies had recommendations and implications for clinical practice. The consultation with stakeholders allowed knowledge translation for those interested in BS.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies mostly included physicians (34/55, 61.8%) and nurses (24/55, 43.6%), and the original version of MBI was predominantly used. Divergences in BS classification were highlighted, which may be related to MBI cross-cultural adaptations and applications in other countries. This study contributes to the advancement of research regarding burnout syndrome as an occupational illness since it has harmful consequences for workers, health care services, and the quality of care provided to the population.","The authors would like to thank Wánderson Cássio Oliveira Araújo for their support in developing the search strategy and Probatus Academic Services for providing scientific language translation, revision, and editing.",,JMIR Mental Health,,"John Torous, Gunther Eysenbach",,2023-07-21,2023,2023-07-21,,10,,e44195,All OA; Gold,Article,"Soares, Juliana Pontes; Lopes, Rayssa Horácio; de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz; Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira; Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins; de Castro, Janete Lima","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); Lopes, Rayssa Horácio (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Vitória, Brazil); Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira (Technical School of Health of Cajazeiras, Federal University of Campina Grande, Cajazeiras, Brazil); Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins (School of Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil); de Castro, Janete Lima (Postgraduate Program in Collective Health, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil)","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte)","Soares, Juliana Pontes (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); Lopes, Rayssa Horácio (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); de Souza Mendonça, Paula Beatriz (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo); Silva, Cícera Renata Diniz Vieira (Federal University of Campina Grande); Rodrigues, Cláudia Cristiane Filgueira Martins (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte); de Castro, Janete Lima (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte)",14,14,,,https://mental.jmir.org/2023/1/e44195/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154125645,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 658 adults with prediabetes treated for 1 year with metformin, linagliptin, their combination or placebo. Endpoints are small fiber peripheral neuropathy (SFPN) risk estimated by foot electrochemical skin conductance (FESC < 70 μSiemens) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RESULTS: Compared to the placebo, the proportion of SFPN was reduced by 25.1% (95% CI:16.3-33.9) with metformin alone, by 17.3% (95% CI 7.4-27.2) with linagliptin alone, and by 19.5% (95% CI 10.1-29.0) with the combination linagliptin/metformin (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). eGFR remained +3.3 mL/min (95% CI: 0.38-6.22) higher with the combination linagliptin/metformin than with the placebo (p = 0.03). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased more with metformin monotherapy -0.3 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.48; 0.12, p = 0.0009) and with the combination metformin/linagliptin -0.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.37; -0.03) than with the placebo (p = 0.0219). Body weight (BW) decreased by -2.0 kg (95% CI: -5.65; -1.65, p = 0.0006) with metformin monotherapy, and by -1.9 kg (95% CI: -3.02; -0.97) with the combination metformin/linagliptin as compared to the placebo (p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: in people with prediabetes, a 1 year treatment with metformin and linagliptin, combined or in monotherapy, was associated with a lower risk of SFPN, and with a lower decrease in eGFR, than treatment with placebo.","Members of the e-PREDICE Consortium: Steering Committee: Jaakko Tuomilehto, Rafael Gabriel, Jaana Lindström, Jesús Egido, Andrea Natali, José Carlos Pastor, Michael Brainin, Marcus Lind, Luis Silva, Peter Schwartz, Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Analytical cross-sectional observational study at the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño San Borja in 2019. The sample consisted of children older than one month and younger than 18 years who were admitted to emergency diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. We used Poisson regression to assess association.
RESULTS.: We evaluated 166 patients diagnosed with pneumonia, 94 (56.6%) were male and the median age was 24 months (IQR: 11 - 48). Most patients had a mild modified PIRO score of 136 (81.9%); 31 (18.7%) patients had complicated pneumonia and 24 (14.5%) were admitted to intensive care. The higher the age, the lower the prevalence of admission to ICU (PR=0.99, 95%CI: 0.98-0.99). The severity assessed with the modified PIRO score (PR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.46-7.93) and the presence of complicated pneumonia (PR: 5.88, 95%CI: 2.46-14.06) were associated with admission to intensive care.
CONCLUSIONS.: The prevalence of admission to intensive care in children with community-acquired pneumonia was 14.5%. Younger patients with pneumonia, with greater severity assessed with the modified PIRO score and with complicated pneumonia have a higher prevalence of admission to intensive care.",,Funding.: Self-funded.

The present study aimed to determine the influence of the anthropometric profile and physical activity level (PAL) on the postural balance of overweight and obese children. The sample included 387 schoolchildren (216 boys and 171 girls). The variables of the anthropometric profile studied were body mass, biped height, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), summation of folds, body composition, and somatotype. PAL was measured using the PAQ-C questionnaire. Static and dynamic postural balance were measured through an open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) posturographic test and the SEBTm, respectively. For static balance, the significant models were for mediolateral velocity (R2 = 0.42 in OA; R2 = 0.24 in OC), anteroposterior velocity (R2 = 0.21 in OA; R2 = 0.27 in OC), and mean velocity (R2 = 0.27 in OA; R2 = 0.46 in OC), where the predictors of low performance were younger age, male sex, overweight/obese nutritional status, greater thickness of skin folds, less tendency to mesomorphy, and greater fat mass. On the other hand, for dynamic postural balance, the significant models were observed in the previous direction (R2 = 0.39), posteromedial (R2 = 0.57), and posterolateral (R2 = 0.56), where the variables that predict a low performance were low PAL, overweight/obese nutritional status, and high WHR. Overweight and obese children presented a deficit in static and dynamic postural balance, enhanced by variables such as gender, age, PAL, and anthropometric characteristics related to adiposity.",,This research was financed by the internal funds of the Academic Vice-Rector for Research and Postgraduate Studies of the Universidad Santo Tomás (Chile) (project number 113200024).,Behavioral Sciences,,,,2023-01-14,2023,2023-01-14,,13,1,73,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo; Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo; Núñez-Espinosa, Cristián; Valdés-Badilla, Pablo; Monsalves-Álvarez, Matías; Delgado-Floody, Pedro; Herrera-Valenzuela, Tomás","Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3480094, Chile; Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca 3480094, Chile); Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo (Escuela de Kinesiología, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Talca 3480094, Chile); Núñez-Espinosa, Cristián (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile; Centro Asistencial Docente y de Investigación, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile); Valdés-Badilla, Pablo (Departamento de Ciencias de la Actividad Física, Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca 3480094, Chile; Carrera de Entrenador Deportivo, Escuela de Educación.

Pretraining foundation models using self-supervised learning on electronic health records (EHR) may be effective in acquiring informative global patterns that can improve the robustness of task-specific models. The objective was to evaluate the utility of EHR foundation models in improving the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of clinical prediction models. Transformer- and gated recurrent unit-based foundation models were pretrained on EHR of up to 1.8 M patients (382 M coded events) collected within pre-determined year groups (e.g., 2009–2012) and were subsequently used to construct patient representations for patients admitted to inpatient units. These representations were used to train logistic regression models to predict hospital mortality, long length of stay, 30-day readmission, and ICU admission. We compared our EHR foundation models with baseline logistic regression models learned on count-based representations (count-LR) in ID and OOD year groups. Performance was measured using area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve, and absolute calibration error. Both transformer and recurrent-based foundation models generally showed better ID and OOD discrimination relative to count-LR and often exhibited less decay in tasks where there is observable degradation of discrimination performance (average AUROC decay of 3% for transformer-based foundation model vs. 7% for count-LR after 5–9 years). In addition, the performance and robustness of transformer-based foundation models continued to improve as pretraining set size increased. These results suggest that pretraining EHR foundation models at scale is a useful approach for developing clinical prediction models that perform well in the presence of temporal distribution shift.",,No external funding was received for the study.,Scientific Reports,,,Humans; Electric Power Supplies; Electronic Health Records; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization,2023-03-07,2023,2023-03-07,,13,1,3767,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guo, Lin Lawrence; Steinberg, Ethan; Fleming, Scott Lanyon; Posada, Jose; Lemmon, Joshua; Pfohl, Stephen R.; Shah, Nigam; Fries, Jason; Sung, Lillian","Guo, Lin Lawrence (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Steinberg, Ethan (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA); Fleming, Scott Lanyon (Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA); Posada, Jose (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Lemmon, Joshua (Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada); Pfohl, Stephen R.

The quantitative component consisted of an analytical ecological design, where proportions, ratios, measures of central tendency and rates ratios, rate difference, Gini and concentration indices were calculated to measure inequalities. The qualitative component had a phenomenological and interpretive approach. One hundred thirty-one women died in Choco between 2010-2018. The Maternal Mortality Ratio was 224/100.000 live births. The Gini coefficient was 0.35, indicating inequality in the distribution of the number of MM with respect to live births. The health service offers have been concentrated in the private sector in urban areas (77%). The exercise of midwifery has played an important role in maternal and perinatal care processes, especially in territories where the State has been absent. Nevertheless, it occurs in complex circumstances such as the armed conflict, lack of transportation routes, and income deficits, affecting the timelines and care quality for these vulnerable groups. MM in Chocó has been a consequence of deficiencies in the health system and weaknesses in its infrastructure (absence of a high level of maternal-perinatal care). This is in addition to the territory's geographical characteristics, which increase vulnerability and health risks for women and their newborns. In Colombia, as well as in other countries, many maternal and newborn deaths are preventable because their causes are due to social injustices.","Special thanks are due to Manuela Mosquera, Director of Asoredipar Chocó, and Yalile Ricard and Silvia Quiroz of the Technological University of Chocó for their willingness and support for the materialization of this article.","This article was co-funded by the project “Exchange and transfer of formal, traditional and community knowledge for the improvement of maternal and perinatal health with a differential and intercultural approach”, derived from Contract 714–2018 made with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Colombia.

We evaluated tofacitinib efficacy and safety in the 52-week maintenance study, OCTAVE Sustain, by baseline Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) following 8-week induction.MethodsThe proportion of patients achieving efficacy endpoints at Week 24 or 52 of OCTAVE Sustain was evaluated by baseline MES following 8-week induction. Using logistic regression, the difference in treatment effect (tofacitinib vs. placebo) between baseline MES (0 vs. 1) for each endpoint was assessed. Adverse events were evaluated.ResultsAt Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain, a numerically higher proportion of tofacitinib-treated patients achieved remission with OCTAVE Sustain baseline MES of 0 versus 1 (61.9% vs. 36.5% for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily [BID] and 75.0% vs. 54.2% for tofacitinib 10 mg BID). Similar trends were observed for endoscopic remission and endoscopic improvement. Logistic regression analyses showed a larger treatment effect at Week 52 in patients with baseline MES of 0 versus 1 for clinical response (p = 0.0306) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (other endpoints all p > 0.05); differences were not significant for any endpoint in the 10 mg BID group (all p > 0.05). Infection adverse events were less frequent among patients with baseline MES 0 versus 1.ConclusionsMES may be important in predicting long-term efficacy outcomes for tofacitinib maintenance treatment. Aiming for endoscopic remission during induction with tofacitinib 10 mg BID may allow successful maintenance with tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Safety was consistent with the known tofacitinib safety profile.Trial registration NCT01458574.","The authors would like to thank the patients, investigators, and study teams who were involved in the tofacitinib UC program.

The diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus supposes an impact for the patient, since it requires a modification in the lifestyle, which demands a great capacity for adaptation and modification of habits. The aim of the study was to determine whether personality factors and health status influence resilience and coping strategies in a sample of healthy and diabetic subjects.
Methodology: The sample included a total of 401 subjects (201 patients with Diabetes and 200 without pathology). The instruments applied for data collection were: Sociodemographic data questionnaire, the Resilience Scale, the Coping Strategies Questionnaire and The ""Big Five"" factor taxonomy. The data collection period was approximately 2 years (between February 2018 and January 2020).
Results: Certain personality factors, such as Emotional Stability, Integrity, Conscientiousness and Extraversion, were positively related to Resilience. Additionally, Emotional Stability, Integrity, and Extraversion were positively associated with Rational Coping. On the other hand, emotional stability, agreeableness and extraversion were negatively related to emotional coping. In relation to health status, the absence of pathology is related to the use of rational strategies more than to the diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, the participants in this study present different psychological patterns depending on personality and health status.
Conclusions: The present study shows that the subjects of the sample present different psychological patterns depending on Personality and health status.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,"Humans; Healthy Volunteers; Adaptation, Psychological; Diabetes Mellitus; Health Status; Personality",2023-03-02,2023,2023-03-02,,11,,1074613,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera-Picón, Cristina; Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal; Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz; Juárez-Vela, Raúl; Martinez-Tofe, Jesús; Sánchez-González, Juan Luis; Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel","Rivera-Picón, Cristina (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz (Faculty of Health Sciences, Nursing, Pontifical University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Juárez-Vela, Raúl (Nursing Department, Faculty of Health Sciences, Research Group GRUPAC, University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain); Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (Nursing Department, Faculty of Health Sciences, Research Group GRUPAC, University of La Rioja, Logroño, Spain); Sánchez-González, Juan Luis (Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain); Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel (Faculty of Nursing and Physiotherapy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; Department of Nursing, Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córboda, Córdona, Spain)","Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (University of La Rioja)","Rivera-Picón, Cristina (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Benavente-Cuesta, María Hinojal (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Quevedo-Aguado, María Paz (Pontifical University of Salamanca); Juárez-Vela, Raúl (University of La Rioja); Martinez-Tofe, Jesús (University of La Rioja); Sánchez-González, Juan Luis (University of Salamanca); Rodríguez-Muñoz, Pedro Manuel (University of Salamanca; Department of Nursing, Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córboda, Córdona, Spain)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1074613/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155874160,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study evaluated the capacity of the peptidoglycan obtained from the CRL1505 strain (PG-Lr1505) to modulate the immuno-coagulative response triggered by the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern poly(I:C) in the respiratory tract. Adult BALB/c mice were nasally treated with PG-Lr1505 for two days. Treated and untreated control mice were then nasally challenged with poly(I:C). Mice received three doses of poly(I:C) with a 24 h rest period between each administration. The immuno-coagulative response was studied after the last administration of poly(I:C). The challenge with poly(I:C) significantly increased blood and respiratory pro-inflammatory mediators, decreased prothrombin activity (PT), and increased von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels in plasma. Furthermore, tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and thrombomodulin (TM) expressions were increased in the lungs. PG-Lr1505-treated mice showed significant modulation of hemostatic parameters in plasma (PT in %, Control = 71.3 ± 3.8, PG-Lr1505 = 94.0 ± 4.0, p < 0.01) and lungs. Moreover, PG-Lr1505-treated mice demonstrated reduced TF in F4/80 cells from lungs, higher pro-inflammatory mediators, and increased IL-10 compared to poly(I:C) control mice (IL-10 in pg/mL, Control = 379.1 ± 12.1, PG-Lr1505 = 483.9 ± 11.3, p < 0.0001). These changes induced by PG-Lr1505 correlated with a significant reduction in lung tissue damage. Complementary in vitro studies using Raw 264.7 cells confirmed the beneficial effect of PG-Lr1505 on poly(I:C)-induced inflammation, since increased IL-10 expression, as well as reduced damage, production of inflammatory mediators, and hemostatic parameter expressions were observed. In addition, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) activation in lungs and Raw 264.7 cells was observed after TLR3 stimulation, which was differentially modulated by PG-Lr1505. The peptidoglycan from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 is able to regulate inflammation, the procoagulant state, and PAR1 activation in mice and macrophages in the context of the activation of TLR3 signaling pathways, contributing to a beneficial modulation of inflammation-hemostasis crosstalk.",,"This study was supported by the grants ANPCyT-FONCyT PICT-2021-I-A-00705 to J.V. and Fundación Alberto J.

(2) Methods: Data from the third wave of the Children's Worlds Project was used, which was collected by administering self-report measures to representative samples in each country. The sample was composed of 4008 early adolescents from Brazil (22.1%, n = 886), Chile (22.8%, n = 913) and Spain (55.1%, n = 2209). The mean age of the sample was 10.17 years (SD = 0.57), and 51.7% were girls. (3) Results: In terms of subjective happiness, moderate to high means were observed, with higher scores in boys and the Spanish sample. The results showed some differences in leisure time activities among children from Brazil, Chile and Spain. Furthermore, the results highlighted the importance of relaxation time with the family to promote happiness in pre-adolescence across genders and countries. Additionally, playing outdoors and doing homework were also found to be protective factors for subjective happiness. (4) Conclusions: In Brazil, Chile and Spain the most consistent result was the positive effect of spending time relaxing with the family on subjective happiness.","The data used in this publication come from the third wave of Children’s Worlds project: An international survey of children’s lives and well-being (www.isciweb.org, accessed on 1 April 2023).

The review shows significant gaps in academic publications, particularly because health was mostly a secondary theme examined in the studies. The few studies about governmental interventions (e.g., policies and programs) suggest that these have not been effective. Regarding public engagement, no studies examined social media engagement with health and climate change, and only one examined news coverage. Finally, most articles focused primarily on individual countries, with few comparative or regional analyses of South America. Strategic action addressing climate change and its effects on public health needs to be based on empirical evidence.",Declaration of interests We declare no competing interests.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors associated with knowledge of pharmacological management of pregnant women in dental students of a Peruvian university located in the capital and province.MethodsThis analytical, cross-sectional, prospective and observational study assessed 312 Peruvian dental students from third to fifth year of study between February and April 2022. A validated questionnaire of 10 closed questions was used to measure knowledge about pharmacological management in pregnant women. A logit model was used to assess the influence of the variables: gender, age, year of study, marital status, place of origin and area of residence. A significance of p < 0.05 was considered.ResultsThe 25.96, 55.13 and 18.91% of the dental students showed poor, fair and good knowledge about pharmacological management in pregnant women; respectively. In addition, it was observed that students under 24 years of age and those from the capital were significantly (p < 0.05) 44% less likely to have poor knowledge of pharmacological management in pregnant women compared to those aged 24 years or older (OR = 0.56; CI: 0.34–0.92) and those from the province (OR = 0.56; CI: 0.32–0.98); respectively. Finally, those in their third and fourth year of study were significantly three times more likely to have poor knowledge (OR = 3.17; CI: 1.68–5.97 and OR = 3.88; CI: 2.07–7.31; respectively) compared to fifth year dental students.ConclusionThe knowledge of dental students about pharmacological management in pregnant women was predominantly of fair level. In addition, it was observed that being under 24 years of age and being from the capital city were protective factors against poor knowledge, while being a third- and fourth-year student was a risk factor. Finally, gender, marital status and area of residence were not influential factors in the level of knowledge.","We thank the Social Responsibility team of the San Juan Bautista Private University, Academic Program of Stomatology, Lima and Ica, Peru, for their constant support in the preparation of this manuscript.",Self-financed.,BMC Medical Education,,,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Adult; Pregnant Women; Logistic Models; Students, Dental; Peru; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice",2023-02-04,2023,2023-02-04,,23,1,89,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores-Montalvo, Elizabeth; Córdova-Limaylla, Nancy; Ladera-Castañeda, Marysela; López-Gurreonero, Carlos; Echavarría-Gálvez, Alí; Cornejo-Pinto, Alberto; Cervantes-Ganoza, Luis; Cayo-Rojas, César","Flores-Montalvo, Elizabeth (Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, School of Stomatology, Av.

In light of this and based on a survey, this research seeks to examine how and why work-related stress impacts the life satisfaction level of university junior faculty members. The results indicate that the three subdivisions of university faculty members' work-related stress, namely, research stress, teaching stress, and administrative stress, are all negatively related to their life satisfaction level. In addition, emotional burnout has been confirmed to function as the psychological mechanism for the aforementioned main effects. The research contributes to the literature mainly by offering a new insight in which the three subdivisions of work-related stress are regarded as independent variables affecting the life satisfaction level of university junior faculty members.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-02-01,2023,2023-02-01,,14,,1111434,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xu, Yin; Wang, Yike","Xu, Yin (School of Foreign Languages, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China); Wang, Yike (School of Management, Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, Shanghai, China)","Wang, Yike (Shanghai University of International Business and Economics)","Xu, Yin (Renmin University of China); Wang, Yike (Shanghai University of International Business and Economics)",11,11,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1111434/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155026717,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of CRDPT in detecting HDP.
Methods: This is a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the effectiveness of CRDPT in the detection of HDP. The study was conducted in line with the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. The PICOS framework was used to search for relevant articles using Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. The articles were screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria and analysed using the Review Manager 5.4 software.
Results: A title, abstract and full article screening was conducted on 18,153 potential articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening yielded five articles for meta-analysis. The total number of normotensive pregnant women (n = 3,380) in the included studies was five times higher than the total number of women with pre-eclampsia (n = 535). A difference between the HDP and normotensive group was noted. This is indicated by a significantly decreased in the effectiveness of CRDPT in detecting HDP as compared to normotensive group [Risk Ratio (RR) = 6.32 (2.17, 18.43) p < 0.00001]. The included studies had a high nature of heterogeneity (I 2 = 98%, p < 0.00001) partially due to different study designs included in the analysis and different regions where studies were conducted given that none of these studies were conducted in African countries where HDP is prominent.
Conclusions: According to results generated from 5 studies in this meta-analysis, it was found that CRDPT might not be effective in the detection of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Moreover, more research, especially in African women where hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are prevalent, are re-quired to ascertain these findings.

Objectives: To determine sociodemographic, labor, sanitary, and environmental conditions that influence the prevalence of food poisoning in informal workers in downtown Medellín, Colombia.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a workers' survey as the primary source. A total of 686 workers aged ≥18 years who had been working for ≥ 5 years were surveyed. An assisted survey was initially applied as a pilot test for training purposes and to obtain informed consent.
Results: We identified several associations and explanatory factors of food poisoning using chi-square tests and prevalence ratios, with unadjusted and adjusted 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). A higher prevalence of food poisoning (p < 0.05) was observed in workers with lower frequency of waste collection (PR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.04-4.19), who left cooked food (PR = 6.40; 95%CI = 2.34-17.8), beverages or chopped fruits uncovered at their workplace (PR = 3.92; 95%CI = 1.40-10.48), with inadequate waste management (PR = 4.84; 95%CI = 2.12-11.06), exposure to polluted water (PR = 3.00; 95%CI = 1.20-7.50) and acceptable water supply (PR = 5.40; 95%CI = 1.60-17.8). The factors that explained higher rates of food poisoning were not having a waste collection service (PRadjusted = 5.58; 95%CI = 3.38-13.10), inadequate waste management (PRadjusted = 6.61; 95%CI = 1.25-34.84), and having sanitary services next to worker's stall (PRadjusted = 14.44; 95%CI = 1.26-165.11).
Conclusions: The conditions that are associated with and explain the higher prevalence of food poisoning in this working population can be addressed with health promotion and disease prevention interventions.","We thank informal street vendors in downtown Medellín who participated in this research.

Escherichia coli is a commensal bacterium of the gut microbiota in humans and animals; however, some strains cause infections and are resistant to antibiotics. One of the most common ways of acquiring pathogenic E. coli strains is through food. This review analyzes multidrug-resistant E. coli isolated from food, emphasizing Latin America and Mexico, and the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) responsible for spreading antibiotic resistance determinants among bacteria in different environments and hosts. We conducted a systematic search of the literature published from 2015 to 2022 in open access databases and electronic repositories. The prevalence of 11 E. coli pathotypes was described, with diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes being the most frequently associated with foodborne illness in different Latin American countries, highlighting the presence of different antibiotic resistance genes mostly carried by IncF-type plasmids or class 1 integrons. Although the global incidence of foodborne illness is high, there have been few studies in Mexico and Latin America, which highlights the need to generate updated epidemiological data from the ""One Health"" approach, which allows monitoring of the multidrug-resistance phenomenon in E. coli from a common perspective in the interaction of human, veterinary, and environmental health.",The authors would like to thank Pepper St. Clair and Sage Chavez from the Department of Biology and Chemistry at California State University Monterey Bay for native English editing.,"This work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías (CONAHCYT) [Grant: CB-2017-2018/A1-S-22136].

Quickly identifying corrosion damage to the stiffness of a steel structure is a challenge in coastal environments since corrosion progresses rapidly, and traditional methods of inspection and diagnosis are time-consuming and costly. This is an important issue; therefore, characterization of the corrosion level represents a key element in making decisions regarding maintenance or structural integrity. This work estimates the relationship between the corrosion level in steel structures and their dynamic parameters using ambient vibration records. It comprises the characterization of the dynamic behavior and corrosion state of three full-scale pedestrian bridges with similar geometry, material, and structural configuration characteristics but with significant differences in the degree of deterioration. The structures were instrumented with piezoelectric sensors connected to a portable data acquisition system; the recorded information was analyzed with optimization algorithms in Python based on the power spectral density (PSD) of the vibrations of each bridge. The parameters obtained related to the degree of corrosion determine the incidence of the level of deterioration in the structural behavior, thus involving changes in its stiffness and mass.","The authors thank the Sistema General de Regalías (SGR), the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología, e Innovación (CTeI) and the Universidad del Norte, whose through the call No. 1 of the CTeI of the Biennial Plan of Convocations in the framework of the bicentennial excellence scholarship program have supported this project; also thank to those who contributed to this research.","This research was funded by the following entities in Colombia: Sistema General de Regalías (SGR), the Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (CTeI) and the Universidad del Norte, through the call No. 1: “Convocatoria del fondo de ciencia, tecnología e innovación del sistema general de regalías para la conformación de una lista de proyectos elegibles para ser viabilizados, priorizados y aprobados por el OCAD en el marco del programa de becas de excelencia doctoral del bicentenario”.",Infrastructures,,,,2023-03-13,2023,2023-03-13,,8,3,52,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barrios, Susana; Guzmán, Andrés; Ortiz, Albert","Barrios, Susana (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Guzmán, Andrés (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Ortiz, Albert (School of Civil and Geomatics Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia)","Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte)","Barrios, Susana (Universidad del Norte); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Ortiz, Albert (University of Valle)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2412-3811/8/3/52/pdf?version=1678701818,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156169160,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

This is why the Quality of Work Life (QoWL) study has gained relevance in recent years. For this reason, various scales have been developed to evaluate this organizational variable constantly. However, to date, there is no evidence in the scientific literature of a Spanish version that evaluates the validity and reliability of these scales in a Peruvian context. Thus, this study aimed to translate into Spanish and adapt and analyze the validity and reliability of a scale to assess the quality of work life in Peruvian teachers based on Walton's model. For this purpose, 457 regular basic education teachers from a private educational network located in the three regions of Peru were surveyed. The analyses used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with the AMOS 24 statistical software.

Embracing a healthy way of living is vital in lessening the impact of illnesses and extending one's lifespan. This research delves into the link between the health and eHealth literacy levels of individuals accessing primary healthcare services and investigates how this relates to adopting a health-conscious lifestyle.
METHODS: The approach involves a cross-sectional examination carried out at a healthcare facility in the Madrid region of Spain, focusing on adult patients who are in need of primary care nursing services. Health and eHealth literacy and a healthy lifestyle were measured using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ), and the ""PA100"" questionnaire, respectively.
RESULTS: Only some of the dimensions of the HLQ and eHLQ were significantly related to a healthy lifestyle, predominantly with a very low or low relationship. Dimension three of the HLQ and dimension five of the eHLQ acquired more importance and were positioned as positive predictors of a healthy lifestyle.

This study aimed to examine the variables associated with suicide risk and determine their predictive capacity. The specific objectives were: (1) to analyze the relationship between suicide risk and model variables and (2) to design an artificial neural network (ANN) with predictive capacity for suicide risk. The sample comprised 337 youths aged 18-33 years. An ex post facto design was used. The results showed that emotional attention, followed by problem solving and perfectionism, were variables that contributed the most to the ANN's predictive capacity. The ANN achieved a hit rate of 85.7%, which is much higher than chance, and with only 14.3% of incorrect cases. This study extracted relevant information on suicide risk and the related risk and protective factors via artificial intelligence.

This study aimed to predict the potential mechanism of LMQXM for ADHD using network pharmacology and molecular docking, which were then validated using animal experiments. Methods: Network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to predict the core targets and potential pathways of LMQXMQ for ADHD, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the potential significance of dopamine (DA) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. To verify the hypothesis, we conducted an animal experiment. In the animal experiment, the young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were randomly divided into the model group (SHR), the methylphenidate hydrochloride group (MPH, 4.22 mg/kg), and 3 LMQXM groups (low-dose (LD) group, 5.28 ml/kg; medium-dose (MD) group, 10.56 ml/kg; and high-dose (HD) group, 21.12 ml/kg), and administered by gavage for 4 weeks; the WKY rats were set as the control group. The open field test and Morris water maze test were used to evaluate the behavioral performance of rats, high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze DA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of rats, ELISA was used to detect cAMP concentrations in the PFC and striatum, and immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to analyze positive cell expression and mRNA expression for indicators related to DA and cAMP pathways. Results: The results showed that beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, rhynchophylline, baicalein, and formononetin might be key components of LMQXM for ADHD and that these components bind well to the core targets, DA receptors (DRD1 and DRD2). Furthermore, LMQXM might act through the DA and cAMP signaling pathways. In the animal experiment, we found that MPH and LMQXM-MD controlled hyperactivity and improved learning and memory in SHRs, while LMQXM-HD only controlled hyperactivity in SHRs; meanwhile, MPH and LMQXM-MD upregulated DA and cAMP levels, mean optical density (MOD) of cAMP, and MOD and mRNA expression of DRD1 and PKA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of SHRs, while LMQXM-LD and LMQXM-HD upregulated DA and cAMP levels in the striatum, MOD of cAMP in the PFC, and mRNA expression of PKA in the PFC. However, we did not find a significant regulatory effect of LMQXM on DRD2. Conclusion: To sum up, this study demonstrated that LMQXM may increase DA levels mainly by activating the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway through DRD1, thereby controlling the behavioral disorders of SHRs, which is most effective at moderate doses, and this may be a key mechanism for LMQXM in the treatment of ADHD.",The authors would like to thank all the reviewers who participated in the review and ZJ and ZX’s strong support for ADHD research.,This study was funded by the Shanghai “13th Five-Year Plan” Clinical Key Specialty TCM Pediatrics Project (shslczdzk04102) and the Shanghai Three-Year Action Plan to Further Accelerate the Development of Chinese Medicine Inheritance and Innovation (2021-2023) Project (ZY (2021-2023)-0206-01).,Frontiers in Pharmacology,,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,14,,1144907,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Xuejun; Xiao, Zhen; Pu, Wenyan; Jiang, Zhiyan; Wang, Shumin; Zhang, Yixing","Li, Xuejun (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Xiao, Zhen (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Pu, Wenyan (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Jiang, Zhiyan (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Wang, Shumin (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China); Zhang, Yixing (Pediatrics, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Longhua Clinical Medical College, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China)","Xiao, Zhen (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Jiang, Zhiyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)","Li, Xuejun (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Xiao, Zhen (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Pu, Wenyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Jiang, Zhiyan (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Wang, Shumin (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Zhang, Yixing (Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1144907/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156286333,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

A total of 2,149 workers in Baja California, Mexico's industrial and education-government sectors, were administered an online inventory version. Preliminary analyses were performed, as well as a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) based on two models proposed by the standard itself: an eight-factor model (8-FM) and a four-factor model (4-FM). Likewise, based on the results and with the recommendations of the specialists, a threefactor model (3-FM) was proposed. In addition, nested model sequencing methods were subsequently applied to validate the invariance between the origin of the activity. The dimensionality of 3-FM was found to have adequate fit values according to a-priori established criteria. It is concluded that the IIAPRF does not have the reliability and validity parameters necessary to support interpretations, uses and consequences based on the theoretical structure established by NOM-035-STPS-2018 and that, although the 3-FM presents better reliability and validity indices, it is not invariant in terms of the origin of the activity.

The aim of this study was to determine the internal structure (dimensionality, measurement invariance and reliability) and association with other variables.
Methods: A total of 470 patients with chronic disease from a Family Medicine Unit at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS, with a mean age of 51.51 years were included. Participants responded to the Questionnaire of Sociodemographic Variables (Q-SV), SF-36 Health-Related Quality of Life Scale-version 1.1, and MOS-SSS.
Results: Non-parametric (Mokken scaling analysis) and parametric (confirmatory factor analysis) analyses indicated unidimensionality, and three-factor model was not representative. A new 8-item version (MOS-S) was developed, where measurement invariance, equivalence with the long version, reliability, and relationship with the SF-36 were satisfactory.
Conclusion: The MOS-SSS scale is unidimensional, and the shortened version yields valid and reliable scores for measuring social support in patients with chronic disease at the primary health care.","We would like to thank M NB, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS, Unidad de Medicina Familiar 31, Ciudad de México, Mexico.","This work presents some results of the research project HIM/2015/017/SSA.1207 “Effects of mindfulness training on psychological distress and quality of life of the family caregiver,” Main researcher: FT-T, Ph.D. The present research was funded with federal funds for health research and was approved by the Commissions of Research, Ethics and Biosafety [Comisiones de Investigación, Ética y Bioseguridad], Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez, National Institute of Health.

OBJETIVE: To evaluate whether there is an association between social support, concern about COVID-19 infection and knowledge about tuberculosis, and non-adherence to antituberculosis treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODOS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on patients under antituberculosis treatment, from January to March, 2022, in centers located in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis in Lima. We used the Morisky Green-Levine questionnaire to assess adherence to treatment as the dependent variable; the independent variables were evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey for perceived social support and concern about COVID-19 infection, and the Battle Test to assess patients’ knowledge about their disease. We used Poisson regression with robust variance to evaluate the association between the independent variables and the dependent one.
RESULTS: Out of 101 participants (73.3% male with an average age of 35.1 ± 16 years), 51.5% were non-adherent to antituberculosis treatment. Medium or high level of concern about getting COVID-19 was associated with a higher prevalence of non-adherence to treatment (odds ratio: 1.68; 95 % confidence interval: 1.09-2.57) (adjusted for considered confounding variables).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence is a frequent condition among patients living in an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis in Lima, especially among those with a higher concern for COVID-19 infection.","Agradecemos al personal de las instituciones en estudio por su colaboración en la realización de esta investigación.

METHOD: research with a qualitative approach, based on the Grounded Theory, conducted with 11 professors of the nursing course of a public university in the central region of Brazil in 2020 and 2021. Online semi-structured interviews were analyzed partially in the light of the Constructivist Grounded Theory.
RESULTS: factors that lead lecturer to experience violence are characterized by institutional culture, gender, professor's perception of violence, and the triggers that drive students to commit violence. Social status and inequalities lead to positions of domination and, consequently, create a fertile ground for violence.

Case report,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Omental torsion as a cause of acute abdominal pain is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively given the non-specific clinical picture.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of an adult male who went to the emergency room due to abdominal pain, presented clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute appendicitis but was diagnosed intraoperatively with omental torsion and associated necrosis, which was successfully treated by laparoscopic omentectomy.
DISCUSSION: It is a rare entity with a low incidence. The symptoms of the cases reported in the literature are usually confused with other abdominal pathologies such as appendicitis or cholecystitis, so preoperative diagnosis continues to be a challenge. The treatment of choice is the laparoscopic approach, since it allows confirming the diagnosis, evaluating the severity of the ischemia, and ruling out other surgical pathologies.
CONCLUSION: It is important to consider omental torsion as another differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, which can be satisfactorily resolved via laparoscopy, thus avoiding the development of complications associated with its natural evolution.","Thanks to the Hospital General Tercer Milenio and the staff that make up the honorable General Surgery service, for their time, dedication and effort in teaching.

The 4a and 4b structures crystallized in monoclinic and triclinic systems with space groups P21/n and P1̄, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed at the DFT/B3LYP level for the optimized geometries. The results were in excellent agreement with the experimental data (spectroscopic and XRD). This investigation encompasses molecular modeling studies including Hirshfeld surface analysis, energy framework calculations, and frontier molecular orbital analysis. Intermolecular interactions within the crystal structures of the compounds were explored through Hirshfeld surface analysis, which revealed the notable presence of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This insight provides valuable information on the structural stability and potential solubility characteristics of these compounds. The research was extended to docking analysis with eight distinct kinases (BRAF, HER2, CSF1R, MEK2, PDGFRA, JAK, AKT1, and AKT2). The results of this analysis demonstrate that both 4a and 4b interact effectively with the kinase-binding sites through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Compound 4a had the best affinity for proteins; this is related to the fact that the compound is not rigid and has a small size, allowing it to sit well at any binding site. This study contributes to the advancement of kinase inhibitor research and offers potential avenues for the development of new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.","The authors acknowledge the Research Group of the Laboratory of Organic Synthesis and Biological Activity of the University of Talca.

1932,pub.1163334968,10.1038/s41699-023-00416-x,,,Room temperature multiferroicity in a transition metal dichalcogenide,"The coexistence of multiple ferroic orders, i.e., multiferroicity, is a scarce property to be found in materials. Historically, this state has been found mainly in 3-dimensional complex oxides, but so far, this state has still been elusive for the most widely studied and characterized family of 2-dimensional compounds, the transition metal dichalcogenides. In this study, we report the experimental realization of multiferroic states in this family of materials, at room temperature, in bulk single crystals of Te-doped WSe2. We observe the coexistence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, evidenced in the presence of magnetization and piezoresponse force microscopy hysteresis loops. These findings open the possibility of widening the use and study of van der Waals-based multifunctional devices for nanoelectronics and spintronics applications.","The authors thank A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliometric study was carried out with the publications indexed in the Scopus database up to 22 September 2022. A search strategy was developed using Boolean operators ""AND"" and ""OR,"" in addition to the MeSH term ""monkeypox virus"" (MPXV) in the subarea of dentistry. The bibliometric indicators were measured objectively with the SciVal program.
RESULTS: Of the publications identified, 40% were indexed in first-quartile journals. India and Brazil are the countries with two published papers, while India has more views than the rest. Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India are the institutions with the highest number of citations with respect to the world average (FWCI: 2.74). The International Dental Journal has a publication on monkeypox in the field of dentistry. India is the country with the most authors (06) who have published about the study. Samaranayake Lakshman Perera is the most productive and high-impact author.
CONCLUSION: In the area of dentistry, scientific production on monkeypox is still scarce; however, the publications identified are mainly in high-impact indexed journals (Q1 and Q2). It is necessary to prioritize this disease as a line of research, in addition to articulating efforts between dental teams from different institutions.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: It is necessary to demonstrate the characteristics of scientific publications on monkeypox in dentistry worldwide in order to have a panoramic view of the dynamics of scientific articles in this area.","The authors wish to thank Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru.",Source of support: Nil Conflict of interest: None,The Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice,,,Humans; Mpox (monkeypox); Bibliometrics; Brazil; Dentistry; India,2023-02-07,2023,2023-02-07,2023-02-07,23,9,861-865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mayta–Tovalino, Frank; Barja–Ore, John; Alvitez–Temoche, Daniel; Mendoza, Roman; Mauricio–Vilchez, Cesar; Munive–Degregori, Arnaldo; Mauricio, Franco","Mayta–Tovalino, Frank (Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Barja–Ore, John (Research Direction, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Alvitez–Temoche, Daniel (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Mendoza, Roman (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Mauricio–Vilchez, Cesar (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Munive–Degregori, Arnaldo (Academic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru); Mauricio, Franco (Postgraduate Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru)","Mayta–Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola)","Mayta–Tovalino, Frank (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola); Barja–Ore, John (Private University of the North); Alvitez–Temoche, Daniel (Federico Villarreal National University); Mendoza, Roman (Federico Villarreal National University); Mauricio–Vilchez, Cesar (Federico Villarreal National University); Munive–Degregori, Arnaldo (National University of San Marcos); Mauricio, Franco (Federico Villarreal National University)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3406,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155213688,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,
1838,pub.1162853424,10.3390/w15152725,,,Hydrokinetic Energy and Transient Accelerations of Marine Currents in Colombian Nearshore Waters,"The transient acceleration of ocean currents, or internal waves, is hard to detect, because it does not have climate variability or regular manifestation in the sea. This fluctuation affects not only short-term oceanographic processes but also the hydrokinetic generation of power and the structural health of ocean technologies. Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that generate internal waves require long-term data on the kinetic and viscous–turbulent parameters of the water column measured over long intervals. In this sense, this study analyzed current profiles in nearshore waters (8.9 m depths) measured over six months in the Colombian Caribbean Sea and found internal waves due to the manifestation of transient acceleration propagating in two of the three layers of the water column. The analyzed time series of currents and turbulent kinetic profiles evidenced that transient waves occurred during changes in the surface winds. The applied methodology in this research allowed, for the first time in the study area, the detection of transient accelerations (±0.25 m/s2) that modified the hydrokinetic energy of the water column over short-term periods (6–24 h).","First author acknowledges IDEHA, Universidad del Norte and Universidad del Valle for supporting the research.","This research was funded by Universidad del Norte, grant number [2013–2017 (2013–2017)], and Universidad del Valle and “The APC was funded by Universidad del Valle through the research project C.I 1214”.",Water,,,,2023-07-28,2023,2023-07-28,,15,15,2725,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel; Eras, Juan José Cabello; Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía; Guzmán, Andrés; Vélez, José Luis García","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (Natural and Environmental Resources Engineering School (EIDENAR), Faculty of Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia;, jose.l.garcia@correounivalle.edu.co; INCIMAR Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia); Eras, Juan José Cabello (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Córdoba, Carrera 6 No. 77-305, Montería 230002, Colombia;, juancabelloe@correo.unicordoba.edu.co); Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía (Dirección General Marítima, Bogotá 111711, Colombia;, acaicedo@dimar.mil.co); Guzmán, Andrés (Research Group for Structures and Geotechnics (GIEG), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via Puerto Colombia, Bloque K, 8-33K, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia;, faguzman@uninorte.edu.co); Vélez, José Luis García (Natural and Environmental Resources Engineering School (EIDENAR), Faculty of Engineering, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia;, jose.l.garcia@correounivalle.edu.co; INCIMAR Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology, Universidad del Valle, Cali 760042, Colombia)","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (University of Valle; University of Valle)","Rueda-Bayona, Juan Gabriel (University of Valle; University of Valle); Eras, Juan José Cabello (University of Córdoba); Caicedo-Laurido, Ana Lucía (Dirección General Marítima); Guzmán, Andrés (Universidad del Norte); Vélez, José Luis García (University of Valle; University of Valle)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/15/2725/pdf?version=1690531357,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162853424,37 Earth Sciences; 3708 Oceanography; 40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,14 Life Below Water
1800,pub.1157764430,10.3389/ftox.2023.1196245,37215384,PMC10192685,Development of a bioprinter-based method for incorporating metabolic competence into high-throughput in vitro assays,"The acceptance and use of in vitro data for hazard identification, prioritization, and risk evaluation is partly limited by uncertainties associated with xenobiotic metabolism. The lack of biotransformation capabilities of many in vitro systems may under- or overestimate the hazard of compounds that are metabolized to more or less active metabolites in vivo. One approach to retrofitting existing bioassays with metabolic competence is the lid-based Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) method, which adds hepatic metabolism to conventional high-throughput screening platforms. Here, limitations of the lid-based AIME method were addressed by incorporating bioprinting, which involved depositing S9-encapsulated microspheres into standard 384-well plates with requisite cofactors for phase I and II hepatic metabolism. Objectives of this study included: 1) compare the lid-based and AIME bioprinting methods by assessing the enzymatic activity of a common cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, 2) use biochemical assays with the bioprinting method to characterize additional measures of phase I and II metabolic activity, and 3) evaluate the bioprinting method by screening 25 chemicals of known metabolism-dependent bioactivity in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor transactivation (ERTA) assay. A comparison of the two methods revealed comparable precision and dynamic range. Activity of additional CYP enzymes and glucuronidation was observed using the AIME bioprinting method. The ERTA experiment identified 19/21 ER-active test chemicals, 14 of which were concordant with expected biotransformation effects (73.7%). Additional refinement of the AIME bioprinting method has the potential to expand high-throughput screening capabilities in a robust, accessible manner to incorporate in vitro metabolic competence.","The authors thank Todd Zurlinden, Madison Feshuk, and Jason Brown for assistance with running the ToxCast Data Analysis Pipeline, as well as Steven Simmons, Joshua Harrill, John Cowden, and Sid Hunter for technical review and critical reading of the manuscript.",This work was funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.,Frontiers in Toxicology,,,,2023-05-04,2023,2023-05-04,,5,,1196245,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hopperstad, Kristen; Deisenroth, Chad","Hopperstad, Kristen (Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, United States); Deisenroth, Chad (Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, United States)","Deisenroth, Chad (Environmental Protection Agency)","Hopperstad, Kristen (Environmental Protection Agency); Deisenroth, Chad (Environmental Protection Agency)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1196245/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157764430,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 41 Environmental Sciences,

This article presents a novel model for evaluating the emissions from the production of metakaolin (MK) as a supplementary cementitious material used in ternary blended cements (e.g., 35% metakaolin, 15% limestone, and 50% portland cement) and an accompanying decisions-support tool (MKC-Tool). Applications with a case study in California showed 36%–39% reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ternary blends with MK compared to portland cement. Compared to commercially available blended cements, the ternary blend showed the lowest global warming potential. All the cements containing fly ash showed higher GHG intensities than the ternary blend (16%–42% higher GHG emissions). The development of cements made with portland cement, metakaolin, and limestone at an industrial scale will have the potential to contribute 5%–50% to the global reduction of GHG emissions from the cement industry.","Daniela M.

Our findings reveal a distinct nonlinear relationship between the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and the concentration of vanadium (x) in the VxAl1−xN alloys. An analysis of the electronic band structures and densities of states reveals a metallic behavior in the VxAl1−xN alloys, primarily driven by the V-d states near the Fermi energy. These results shed light on the electronic properties of the alloys, contributing to a deeper understanding of their potential for various applications. Furthermore, we calculate various optical properties, including the real and imaginary dielectric functions, refractive index, energy loss spectrum, and reflectivity.

This study aimed to quantify nutrient accumulation in the fruits, grains, and husks of Robusta coffee genotypes cultivated in the Brazilian Amazon and estimate genetic diversity. The experiment was conducted in Alta Floresta D'Oeste-Rondônia, Brazil. To assess nutrient accumulation, fresh fruits were collected. These were dried, processed, separated into grains and husks, and subjected to chemical analysis. Nutrient accumulation in fruits, grains, and husks, as well as the grain/husk ratio, underwent analysis of variance through the F-test (p < 0.01. For each evaluated trait, the experimental coefficient of 337 variation (CVe), genetic coefficient of variation (CVg), and genotypic determination coefficient (H2) were also estimated. Variability was observed among Robusta coffee genotypes, with VP06, AS4, and AS10 being the most dissimilar.

The decoding of brain movement commands in BCIs relies on signal feature extraction and classification. Herein, the BNCI Horizon 2020 dataset is employed, which consists of electroencephalographic signals from ten participants with subacute and chronic cervical spinal cord injuries. These participants perform or attempt five distinct types of arm and hand movements. To extract signal features, a novel technique is introduced that estimates movement‐related cortical potentials and incorporates them into the processing pipeline. Moreover, a time‐frequency domain representation of the dataset is used as input for the classifier. Given the promising outcomes demonstrated by deep learning models in BCI classification, a pretrained ConvNet AlexNet is adopted to decode the motor tasks. The proposed method exhibits a remarkable average accuracy of 76.0% across all five categories, representing a significant advancement over existing state‐of‐the‐art techniques. Additionally, an in‐depth analysis of the convolutional layers in the model is conducted to gain comprehensive insights into the classification process. By examining the ConvNet filters and activations, the method contributes to a deeper understanding of the electrophysiology that underlies attempted movement.",Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Dirección de Gestión y Desarrollo Académico from the Universidad del Norte through their Ph.D. scholarship program.

Fronts thus form dynamical and ephemeral ecosystems where numerous species meet across all trophic levels. Fronts are also targeted by fisheries. Capturing ocean fronts and studying their long-term variability in relation with climate change is thus key for marine resource management and spatial planning. The Mediterranean Sea and the Southwest Indian Ocean are natural laboratories to study front-marine life interactions due to their energetic flow at sub-to-mesoscales, high biodiversity (including endemic and endangered species) and numerous conservation initiatives. Based on remotely-sensed Sea Surface Temperature and Height, we compute thermal fronts (2003–2020) and attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (1994–2020), in both regions over several decades. We advocate for the combined use of both thermal fronts and attracting Lagrangian coherent structures to study front-marine life interactions. The resulting front dataset differs from other alternatives by its high spatio-temporal resolution, long time coverage, and relevant thresholds defined for ecological provinces.","This work was supported by the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography (MIO) and the French National Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD).

Among them, the bacteria Bartonella spp. and Anaplasma spp. are related to this zoonotic dynamic.ObjectiveThe primary goal of the present study was to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria in kidney and liver tissues of Didelphis marsupialis; spleen, liver, and skin of Pecari tajacu; spleen, liver, and skin of Chelonoidis denticulata.MethodologyA PCR using universal and specific primers for 16 S rRNA, of Bartonella spp. with subsequent genetic sequencing were used.ResultsThe results in this study indicate that Bartonella vinsonni was detected in the liver tissue of Didelphis marsupialis using both universal primers and those specific for Bartonella sp. Anaplasma platys was detected at the liver and spleen level using universal primers. Additionally, Bartonella spp. was found at the liver, spleen, and skin level in Pecari tajacu using the specific primers. Finally, using the universal and specific primers at the skin level, Bartonella spp. was evident in Chelonoidis denticulata.ConclusionsThe presence of the DNA of the Bartonella vinsonii was detected at the liver tissue in Didelphis marsupialis. DNA of the Anaplasma platys and Bartonella spp. were identified at the spleen and liver level. This study also identified that DNA Bartonella spp. was detected in Pecari tajacu skin.

This article reviews neural correlates of dyslexia from both electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Method : In this brief review, we provide electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence from electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in dyslexia to understand functional and structural brain changes in this condition. Results: In both electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, the most frequently reported functional impairments in dyslexia include aberrant activation of the left hemisphere occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), temporo-parietal cortex (TPC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and cerebellar areas. EEG studies have mostly highlighted the important role of lower frequency bands in dyslexia, especially theta waves. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have suggested that dyslexia is related to functional and structural impairments in the left hemisphere regions associated with reading and language, including reduced grey matter volume in the left TPC, decreased white matter connectivity between reading networks, and hypo-activation of the left OTC and TPC. In addition, neural evidence from pre-reading children and infants at risk for dyslexia show that there are abnormalities in the dyslexic brain before learning to read begins. Conclusion: Advances in comprehending the neural correlates of dyslexia could bring closer translation from basic to clinical neuroscience and effective rehabilitation for individuals who struggle to read. However, neuroscience still has great potential for clinical translation that requires further research.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-10,18,4,503-509,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald; García, Ulises Córdova; Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy; Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline; Saavedra-López, Miguel","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.); García, Ulises Córdova (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez (Universidad César Vallejo, Lima, Perú.); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Saavedra-López, Miguel (Universidad Continental, Cusco, Perú.)","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Hernández-Vásquez, Ronald (Universidad Norbert Wiener); García, Ulises Córdova (Universidad César Vallejo); Barreto, Ana Maritza Boy (Universidad César Vallejo); Rojas, Milagritos Leonor Rodriguez (Universidad César Vallejo); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline (Private University of the North); Saavedra-López, Miguel (Universidad Continental)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13638,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164390370,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Método: La estrategia de búsqueda se realizó en bases de datos y artículos científicos entre 1980-2022, en inglés, portugués y español, que relacionaran el concepto lactancia materna hasta los 2 años de edad. Los términos utilizados fueron “lactancia materna”, “lactancia materna exclusiva”, “lactancia artificial”, “análisis de concepto”. Adicionalmente se buscaron los términos “lactancia materna exclusiva” y “crecimiento craneofacial”. Se incluyeron estudios de revisión, revisiones sistemáticas, estudios observacionales prospectivos y de corte transversal. Resultados: Se identificaron 4 atributos para confirmar el concepto LM exclusiva para el CCF: adaptación fisiológica de la succión, succión nutricia, función motora oral y succión efectiva. Se describen definiciones, antecedentes, consecuencias, referentes empíricos. Caso modelo y casos contrario. Conclusión: La metodología utilizada sirvió para construir el análisis de concepto lactancia materna exclusiva para el CCF y aportar argumentos teóricos para la práctica clínica y consejería en lactancia relacionados con los beneficios de la función de succión para el desarrollo motor oral y crecimiento craneofacial.",,,Salud Uninorte,,,,2023-11-27,2023,2023-11-27,2023-11-27,39,03,1096-1119,All OA; Gold,Article,"González Bejarano, Laila Yaned; Hernández Molina, Luz Mery; Villamizar Carvajal, Beatriz","González Bejarano, Laila Yaned (); Hernández Molina, Luz Mery (); Villamizar Carvajal, Beatriz ()",,"González Bejarano, Laila Yaned (); Hernández Molina, Luz Mery (); Villamizar Carvajal, Beatriz ()",0,0,,,https://rcientificas.uninorte.edu.co/index.php/salud/article/download/15033/214421446964/214421469750,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166412550,,

The European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) was designed to address many of the challenges that exist for the development and implementation of NAMs in modern chemical risk assessment. PARC's proximity to national and European regulatory agencies is envisioned to ensure that all the research and innovation projects that are initiated within PARC agree with actual regulatory needs. One of the main aims of PARC is to develop innovative methodologies that will directly aid chemical hazard identification, risk assessment, and regulation/policy. This will facilitate the development of NAMs for use in risk assessment, as well as the transition from an endpoint-based animal testing strategy to a more mechanistic-based NAMs testing strategy, as foreseen by the Tox21 and the EU Chemical's Strategy for Sustainability. This work falls under work package 5 (WP5) of the PARC initiative. There are three different tasks within WP5, and this paper is a general overview of the five main projects in the Task 5.2 'Innovative Tools and methods for Toxicity Testing,' with a focus on Human Health. This task will bridge essential regulatory data gaps pertaining to the assessment of toxicological prioritized endpoints such as non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption (mainly thyroid), metabolic disruption, and (developmental and adult) neurotoxicity, thereby leveraging OECD's and PARC's AOP frameworks. This is intended to provide regulatory risk assessors and industry stakeholders with relevant, affordable and reliable assessment tools that will ultimately contribute to the application of next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) in Europe and worldwide.",The authors thank all the Task 5.2 partners for their work on this Task.,This work was carried out in the framework of the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) and has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101057014.

However, the impact of these types of interventions in intermediate levels of proficiency has yet to be conclusive when measured using speech rate as a dependent variable, e.g., word correct per minute. We studied how a listener's comprehension and intelligibility might change when read aloud protocols are used to enhance fluency. To do so, we used a data set that did not present increasing rates in speech rate after 11 weeks of practice (as reported in Rodríguez-Fuentes et al., 2023). We asked a group of independent raters to rank each participant's three (first, middle, and last) performances to assess if they could find differences in the performances over time. Seventy-nine percent of the raters perceived that the third performances were the best of each set they were provided, and that the second performances were better than the first. There was a consistent positive progression in perceived fluency. Also, a qualitative analysis of students' reflections showed significant gains from using read aloud protocols (RAPs) and increased awareness of key areas of fluency development, such as intonation, speech flow (vs. word-by-word reading), and self-confidence, among others.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",Ampersand,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,11,,100133,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodríguez-Fuentes, Rodrigo A.; Calle-Díaz, Luzkarime","Rodríguez-Fuentes, Rodrigo A.

Intron 22 inversion (Inv22) is found in about 45% of patients with severe hemophilia A. Here, we reported a male without obvious hemophilia A phenotype but bearing an inherited segmental variant duplication encompassing F8 as well as Inv22. The duplication was approximately 0.16 Mb and involved from exon 1 to intron 22 of F8. This partial duplication and Inv22 in F8 was first found in the abortion tissue of his older sister with recurrent miscarriage. The genetic testing of his family revealed that his phenotypically normal older sister and mother also had this heterozygous Inv22 and a 0.16 Mb partial duplication of F8, while his father was genotypically normal. The integrity of the F8 gene transcript was verified by sequencing of the adjacent exons at the inversion breakpoint, which explained why this male had no phenotype for hemophilia A. Interestingly, although he had no significant hemophilia A phenotype, the expression of C1QA in his mother, sister, and the male subject was only about half of that in his father and normal population.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of 33,567 data from the COVID-19 Notification System of the National Epidemiology Center, Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC-Peru), from the years 2020-2022. The variables were age, sex, belonging to the Andean or Amazonian ethnic group, number and type of symptoms and risk conditions, abnormal findings in chest X-rays, year of data collection for hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Poisson family generalized linear regression models with logarithmic linkage and robust variance were used to establish differences in mortality between ethnic groups. Crude and adjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: 33,567 participants with an average age of 33.6 years were included, 44.4 % were men and 70.2 % belonged to the Amazonian ethnic group. Most of those affected by COVID-19 presented 2 symptoms (38.8 %), 4.8 % presented some risk condition, 1451 (4.3 %) were hospitalized, and 433 (1.3 %) died. The adjusted analysis showed that the Andean group, compared to the Amazonian, tended to have a higher probability of death, and this association was statistically significant, RR =7.6, 95 % CI (5.5-10.5).

In 2017, part of the installed instrumentation was upgraded, incorporating new CC5MPX automatic photographic cameras from Campbell Scientific to acquire three daily photographs at 5Mpx in resolution, 2592 × 1984 pixels in size, and JPEG format. The photographs are taken during the central hours of the day (14, 15, and 16 h GMT) to ensure maximum brightness, even during the Antarctic winter. Powered by batteries and solar panels, two cameras were installed at each site with a panoramic view, devoid of vegetation except for small patches of moss. At each study point, the cameras are oriented in different directions, providing diverse angles of the study area, and allowing observation of various fields of view in the environment. The result is a dataset of images acquired in the 2017-2022 period, organized by site, year, and month, capturing environmental conditions and spatial distribution of the snow cover. This dataset, besides documenting the snow cover, allows assessment of meteorological conditions, prevailing wind directions in the area during snow events, even in more distant areas from the study point due to the configured field of view. In the case of the images from Livingston Island, it also enables the study of the Limnopolar Lake's fluctuating water level during spring and summer. For the images from Deception Island, it provides insight into the presence of pack ice in Foster Port, relevant for volcanic activity and the safety of numerous vessels entering the caldera of the active volcano.","Acknowledgments The author thanks chiefs and crews of the Spanish Antarctic Stations “Juan Carlos I “, in Livingston Island, and “Gabriel de Castilla”, in Deception Island, for their support during field works and help on the instrument&#x27;s maintenance, as well as “Las Palmas”, “Hespérides” and “Sarmiento de Gamboa” Spanish Research Vessels to support the logistical operations along the 2000–2022 period.

The aim of the study is to determine the variation in the levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology in children and adolescents in the North of Chile.
METHODS: A Repeated cross-sectional design (RCS) was used. The sample consisted of a total of 475 students aged 12 to 18 years (high school) from educational establishments in the city of Arica. To evaluate the changes in the mental health of students associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the same mental health measures applied to students were compared in two waves (2018-2021).
RESULTS: An increase in the symptomatology levels of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and problems with the family, while a decrease in problems with school and peers was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that there is an increase in mental health problems associated with the periods of time in which the COVID-19 pandemic transformed the social relation spaces and classrooms of secondary school students. The observed changes point to future challenges, which include that it may be important to improve the coordination and integration of mental health professionals in educational centers and schools.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID), grant ANID PIA CIE 160007.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,"Pierre Alexis Geoffroy, Antonio Gonzalez-Perez",,2023-02-17,2023,2023-02-17,,12,4,1601,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Atencio-Quevedo, Diego; Ponce-Correa, Felipe; Mena-Chamorro, Patricio; Urzúa, Alfonso; Flores, Jerome","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Antofagasta 1520, Arica 1000000, Chile); Atencio-Quevedo, Diego (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de la Frontera, Temuco 4811230, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270460, Chile); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile; Centro de Justicia Educacional (CJE), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 8940855, Chile)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Atencio-Quevedo, Diego (University of Tarapacá); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (University of Tarapacá); Mena-Chamorro, Patricio (University of La Frontera); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Flores, Jerome (University of Tarapacá; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/4/1601/pdf?version=1676612726,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155508413,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Nevertheless, not all people with obesity develop depression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms among people aged 15 or older with obesity from the National Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES in Spanish 2019-2021).
METHODS: Cross-sectional analytical study. The outcome of interest was the presence of depressive symptoms, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios were estimated using GLM Poisson distribution with robust variance estimates.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depression symptoms was 6.97%. In the multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association was found between depressive symptoms and female sex (PRa: 2.59; 95% CI 1.95-3.43); mountain region (PRa: 1.51; 95% CI 1.18-1.92); wealth index poor (PRa: 1.37; 95% CI 1.05-1.79, medium (PRa: 1.49; 95% CI 1.11-2.02), and rich (PRa: 1.65; 95% CI 1.21-2.26); daily tobacco use (PRa: 2.05, 95% CI 1.09-3.87); physical disability (PRa: 1.96, 95% CI 1.07-3.57); and a history of arterial hypertension (PRa: 2.05; 95% CI 1.63-2.55).
CONCLUSION: There are several sociodemographic factors (such as being female and living in the Andean region) and individual factors (daily use of tobacco and history of hypertension) associated with depressive symptoms in Peruvian inhabitants aged 15 or older with obesity. In this study, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Humans; Female; Male; Depression; Peru; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pandemics; COVID-19; Obesity; Hypertension; Surveys and Questionnaires; Prevalence,2023-01-18,2023,2023-01-18,,20,3,1816,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan; Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel; Ramos, Willy; Rojas, Rubén Espinoza; Valencia, Jamee Guerra; Loayza-Castro, Joan A.; Zuzunaga-Montoya, Fiorella E.; Zeñas-Trujillo, Gianella Zulema; Cruz-Ausejo, Liliana; De La Cruz-Vargas, Jhony A.","Vera-Ponce, Víctor Juan (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Torres-Malca, Jenny Raquel (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Lima 15046, Peru); Ramos, Willy (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 15001, Peru); Rojas, Rubén Espinoza (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru); Valencia, Jamee Guerra (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Lima 15039, Peru; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15314, Peru); Loayza-Castro, Joan A.

The broad spectrum of myocardial injury in cardiovascular diseases can range from theasymptomatic elevation of cardiac troponin levels to the development of fulminant myocarditis and/or circulatory shock, which can leave significant sequelae. Despite the fact that there is no clear strategy to treat cardiac events that occur during COVID-19 infection and taking into account that treatment is mainly aimed at relieving patients’ symptoms as they arise, the objective of this work was to find out and collect current evidence on this subject, so that readers can be offered a reference guide in Spanish that contributes to the development of their health profession. The methodology used was a literature search in databases including Medline, Scopus and ScienceDirect within a time window between 2019 and 2022. The main results revealed that the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in post-COVID-19 syndrome include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system since SARS-CoV-2 tropism is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This causes an alteration of the neurohumoral response of the cardiovascular, renal and digestive systems,generating deficits in the signaling pathways and causing direct damage to the heart, lungs and other organs. Post-COVID-19 syndrome, in general, is defined as the occurrence or persistence of symptoms three or four weeks after the acute phase of the disease. This could then be considered as a time window of risk and strict follow-up to assess in apersonalized way the risk among the different groups of patients, especially those with a past history of cardiovascular disease. The main results revealed disorders such as heart failure, arrhythmias, pericarditis and myocarditis, which require early detection and occur days or even weeks after the acute phase of COVID-19.",,,HORIZONTE - Revista de Estudos de Teologia e Ciências da Religião,,,,2023-01-31,2023,2023-01-31,2023-01-31,23,1,e2125-e2125,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jaimes, Yelson Alejandro Picón; Lovelo, German Josue Garcia; Fritz, Jessica Valentina Ellis; Castro, Antonio Luis Castro; Navarro, Jesus Miguel Villa; Bossa, Daniela Andrea Soto; Ortega, Sebastián Danilo Rojas; Saa, Tatiana Álvarez; Sierra, Michael Gregorio Ortega","Jaimes, Yelson Alejandro Picón (Universitat Ramon Llull, Facultat de Ciències de la Salut.

1282,pub.1155367079,10.3390/app13042352,,,Effect of Finite Element Method (FEM) Mesh Size on the Estimation of Concrete Stress–Strain Parameters,"In this research, two components were developed jointly: On the one hand, an experimental plan was created to obtain specific variables of the concrete and serve as a reference for the second model, a numerical and computational type created to address the variability in parameters, such as the elasticity and flow of coarse aggregate and mortar. The experimental work reproduced a specific gradation with a 1” nominal maximum size TMN on spheroidal-shaped particles. To address the diversity of limestone in the national territory, rocks were extracted from five calcareous areas of the country, which were transformed through different activities from lamination and turning with different bits to being carved into spheres until the reference gradation formed. The next stage consisted of determining the mechanical and stress–strain properties of both the mortar and coarse aggregate. In the case of mortar, the compressive stress was obtained from 50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm cubes and the modulus of elasticity from 100 mm × 200 mm cylinders; for the coarse aggregate, the compressive stress was obtained through tests on cylinders of the calcareous rock used to form the spherical aggregate particles. The materials were mixed according to a previous proportioning for f′c = 28 MPa and cast in cylinders of 100 mm × 200 mm. Finally, the compressive stress and the modulus of elasticity in these specimens were determined. Separately, a computational model was created to reproduce the experimental model with the same type of materials and load conditions and thereby estimate the compressive stress and modulus of elasticity of the tested material. This model was developed based on finite elements simulating concrete under a two-phase model, in which the coarse aggregate phase was arranged with spheroidal particles that were assembled with the mortar paste, thus finally reproducing a concrete cylinder of 100 mm × 200 mm. Material properties, taken from experimental work, were assigned to these materials. Initially, work was carried out in the elastic range, obtaining, as a result, the modulus of elasticity Ec, and then the specimen was brought to failure, obtaining, as a result, the maximum compressive stress f′c. To attend to the influence of the effect of the mesh size for modeling on the numerical results of both parameters, several simulations were carried out in which mesh sizes of 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, and 2.5 mm were established for the mortar and the coarse aggregate, respectively, for carrying out the modeling. The results in the computational model showed that the compressive stress turned out to be more sensitive than the modulus of elasticity to the variation in the size of the mesh. For the first, the differences between the 4 mm mesh and the 2.5 mm mesh reached 3%, but for the second, the difference only reached 1% between the results for the same meshes. When the results between the experimental and computational models were compared, we found that the experimental values had the best closeness with results in the 2.5 mm mesh.",,This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-02-11,2023,2023-02-11,,13,4,2352,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bracamonte, Alex José; Mercado-Puche, Vicente; Martínez-Arguelles, Gilberto; Pumarejo, Luis Fuentes; Ortiz, Albert R.; Herazo, Luis Carlos Sandoval","Bracamonte, Alex José (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Sucre, Sincelejo 700001, Colombia); Mercado-Puche, Vicente (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Martínez-Arguelles, Gilberto (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Pumarejo, Luis Fuentes (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Ortiz, Albert R.

Insufficient awareness of stance, cultural attitudes about it, and poor teaching have been identified as underlying sources of stance-related difficulties. Focusing on stance may thus be a pivotal reading-to-write lens to improve English academic literacy. However, few studies have investigated pre-service teachers’ language awareness and ideologies about different stance markers. The goal of this paper is to describe the stance-focused conceptions and ideologies of a group of sixteen Mexican undergraduate pre-service teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) who are also EFL learners. We used phenomenographic interviews and analysis to achieve this goal. We found three types of conceptions: stylistic, critical, and metaideological. The less sophisticated stylistic conceptions are most prevalent. Only two participants showed metaideological conceptions. Two language ideologies were found: an ideology of linguistic objectivity that dismisses all stance markers and another that values affect markers but dismisses first-person ones. These results imply that pre-service teachers should be made aware of the argumentative and epistemic functions of stance markers and diverse language ideologies about them that circulate across national and disciplinary contexts. In this way, they may deploy stance more effectively in their own literacy practices and become more effective EAP teachers.",,,Indonesian Journal of Applied Linguistics,,,,2023-01-31,2023,2023-01-31,,12,3,706-718,All OA; Gold,Article,"Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian; Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval; Faz, Gerardo Bañalez","Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Faz, Gerardo Bañalez (Universidad Andrés Bello)",,"Perales-Escudero, Moises Damian (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Cruz, Rosa Isela Sandoval (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Quintana Roo); Faz, Gerardo Bañalez (Andrés Bello National University)",1,1,,,https://ejournal.upi.edu/index.php/IJAL/article/download/45552/22043,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156232376,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

This systematic review synthesizes and critically analyzes the existing literature on mental disorders in the rural Andean population in Latin America.
Methods: A systematic review with narrative synthesis was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. We searched nine databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scielo, LILACS, and Latindex), five public prepublication servers (SocArXiv, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SportRXiv, and Preprints), ALICIA, and Google Scholar for articles that included the analysis of mental health problems using data collected from the rural Andean population in Latin America. These were eligible for inclusion. Articles that included Non-Latin American populations (including European or African migrants) and studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (since the declaration of national lockdown) were excluded.
Results: A total of 23,761 articles were retrieved, 14 of which met the inclusion requirements. Most were cross-sectional (n = 12) and related to anxiety (n = 9), depression (n = 8), and stress (n = 5). The mental health analysis of 5,976 rural dwellers from four countries in Latin America also included gray literature studies (n = 7) that allowed the quantification of mental health problems in adults (n = 7) and adolescents/children (n = 4). Only one study was multinational, and the quality of publications varied. Despite the high frequency of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among rural Latin American populations during COVID-19, published research is very limited. This review found preliminary evidence that the frequency of anxiety (45%), depression (27.6%), and stress (33.1%) in the rural population was associated with pandemic restrictions across countries. Measures of other psychiatric problems, such as distress or suicidal ideation, cannot be estimated.
Conclusion: Regional-wide studies investigating changes in the frequency of symptoms of mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are warranted to inform culturally adapted prevention strategies. This study is limited to a narrative synthesis and may be subject to publication bias.

Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on the secondary data analysis of the 2021 Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Our sample included Peruvian children aged 6-59 months with complete data for the variables of interest. Anemia was defined as having a hemoglobin level of less than 11 g/dL, adjusted by altitude. Erreygers Concentration Index (ECI) and concentration curves were computed to estimate the socio-economic inequality in anemia among Peruvian children. Moreover, ECI was decomposed to figure out the contributing factors to the inequality of anemia and the residual variation.
Results: Nationwide, the prevalence of anemia in Peruvian children was 29.47%. We found a pro-poor inequality regarding anemia at the national level (ECI = -0.1848). The determinants included in the model explained 81.85% of the overall socio-economic inequality in anemia. The largest contribution to inequality was from household- and community-related factors. Having a higher mother's education level (26.26%) and being from the highlands (24.91%) were the major significant contributors to the overall health inequality.
Conclusion: Almost one-third of Peruvian children have anemia. A pro-poor inequality of anemia in Peruvian children was found. Public policies ought to address the major contributing factors of anemia inequality.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,Humans; Child; Socioeconomic Factors; Peru; Health Status Disparities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Anemia,2023-03-31,2023,2023-03-31,,11,,1068083,All OA; Gold,Article,"Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali; Mendez-Guerra, Carolina; Robles-Valcarcel, Pamela; Iberico-Bellomo, Luis; Alva, Kenedy; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Centro de Excelencia en Investigaciones Económicas y Sociales en Salud, Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, Lima, Peru); Mendez-Guerra, Carolina (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Robles-Valcarcel, Pamela (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Iberico-Bellomo, Luis (Facultad de Economía y Finanzas, Universidad del Pacifico, Lima, Peru); Alva, Kenedy (Escuela de Negocios y Administración de Empresas, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, España); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru; Red Peruana de Salud Colectiva, Lima, Peru); Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.

In this work, we first attempted to describe different algorithms to estimate neural complexity in a simple manner understandable for psychiatrists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. Then, we reviewed the findings of the brain complexity analysis in psychiatric disorders and their clinical implications. Method : A non-systematic comprehensive literature search was conducted for original studies on the complexity analysis of neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalogram, magnetoencephalogram, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near infrared spectroscopy. The search encompassed online scientific databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: Complexity measures mainly include entropy-based methods, the correlation dimension, fractal dimension, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and the Lyapunov exponent. There are important differences in the physical notions between these measures. Our literature review shows that dementia, autism, and adult ADHD exhibit less complexity in their neurophysiologic signals than healthy controls. However, children with ADHD, drug-naïve young schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms, and patients with mood disorders (i.e., depression and bipolar disorder) exhibit higher complexity in their neurophysiologic signals compared to healthy controls. In addition, contradictory findings still exist in some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia regarding brain complexity, which can be due to technical issues, large heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders, and interference of typical factors. Conclusion: In summary, complexity analysis may present a new dimension to understanding psychiatric disorders. While complexity analysis is still far from having practical applications in routine clinical settings, complexity science can play an important role in comprehending the system dynamics of psychiatric disorders.",The authors thank the institutions where they work for encouraging the development of research.,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,,,,2023-09-18,2023,2023-09-18,2023-10,18,4,493-502,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Ronald Miguel; Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia; Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel; Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos; Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza; Monteza, Walter Campos","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Privada Norbert Wiener, Lima, Perú.); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú.); Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Continental, Huancayo, Perú.); Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Perú.); Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo, Chiclayo, Perú.); Monteza, Walter Campos (Universidad de San Martin de Porres, Lima, Perú.)","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Norbert Wiener)","Hernández, Ronald Miguel (Universidad Norbert Wiener); Ponce-Meza, Jacqueline Cynthia (Private University of the North); Saavedra-López, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Continental); Ugaz, Walter Antonio Campos (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruíz Gallo); Chanduvi, Roxana Monteza (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo); Monteza, Walter Campos (Universidad de San Martín de Porres)",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v18i4.13637,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164390369,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

Thus, it is understood that the sustainable development goals 2015–2030 (SDGs) need to be substantially operationalized in these institutions. Based on this idea, the QualEnv (quality and environment) consortium of universities stands out for having as its main objective the increase in contribution to sustainable development (SD) by universities through the implementation of systematic environmental practices and quality processes in line with the SDGs. The objective of this article is to present how the QualEnv consortium of HEIs adopts the SDGs and demonstrates their contribution to SD. For this purpose, a qualitative analysis was performed based on documentary research, a systematic review of the literature, and notes collected from participant observations. The results show that the adoption of the SDGs in the QualEnv consortium was enhanced by the contribution of the social relations within the partnership, which promoted the exchange of experiences and synergy between participants that promoted improvements in the necessary strategies. Along with the highlighted actions and concentration of different axes with dispersed interventions, a potential for central cohesion and focus on evolution in each SDG was noted. The adoption of the same indicators involves the unification of the actions planned for the SD and the common objective of involving communities more consistently, which impacts mainly SDG 04. This article discusses the practical implications in HEIs and the need to integrate the SDGs into their activities, as it demonstrates how universities belonging to the QualEnv consortium have been creating their own strategies to achieve the 2030 agenda and adopt the SDGs.","The authors would like to acknowledge support from the European Commission, Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, Erasmus+, in the context of the Qualenv Project: Change the Climate: Assuring the Quality of Environmental Strategies in Latin-American Higher Education—Project 609863-EPP-1-2019-1-PT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.

While Impatiens is an impressively prolific genus, with over 1,000 species and more being discovered each year, its sister genus, Hydrocera, has one solitary species, H. triflora. The two genera also differ in geographic distribution and habitat type (Impatiens species are widely distributed in much of the Old World and N. America, while H. triflora is confined to wetlands specific to S. India, Sri Lanka, and SE Asia). Other contrasting features include plant habit, habitat, floral architecture, mode of seed dispersal, and a host of other traits. The family Balsaminaceae is therefore an excellent model for studying speciation and character evolution as well as understanding the proximal and evolutionary forces that have driven the two genera to adopt such contrasting evolutionary paths. Various species of the Impatiens genus are also commercially important in the ornamental flower industry and as sources of phytochemicals that are of medicinal and other commercial value.

Our aim was to compare the subjective well-being, life satisfaction, mental status, and social support of representative samples of adults living in segregated settlements (colonies) and identifying as Roma with those of the general population in Hungary.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with random samples of 417 individuals from the general Hungarian adult population (55.6% female, mean age = 43.89 ± 12.61 years) and 394 adults living in segregated settlements (colonies) (73.9% female, mean age = 42.37 ± 12.39 years). Demographic questions were used as well as the WHO Well-Being Index (WBI-5), the single item Life Satisfaction Scale, the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3).
Results: Residents of colonies reported significantly lower levels of subjective well-being and life satisfaction than the general population. The proportion of individuals at high risk for mental morbidity was more than twice as high among colony dwellers (16.4%) as in non-colony dwellers (7.6%). Similar unfavorable differences were seen at the expense of self-identified Roma compared to self-identified Hungarians but no difference was found in terms of social support either by type of residence or ethnicity. 32.2% of colony-dwellers self-identified themselves as Hungarian. Mental health assessed by principal component was directly determined by settlement type of permanent residence, age, educational attainment, employment, financial status, and social support but not ethnic identity.
Conclusion: The study based on representative data shows that residents of segregated settlements are in worse mental health than those not living in colonies; that housing segregation is not limited to Roma people, and that housing conditions and financial status are major social determinants of mental health for which data must be collected to avoid using self-reported Roma identity as a proxy measure of socioeconomic deprivation.",,"The project was co-financed by the European Union under European Regional Development Fund (GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00005), as well as by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA11010 and TK2016-78).

This systematic review evaluates the association between SIII values with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in testicular cancer. We searched observational studies in five databases. The quantitative synthesis was performed using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The only measure of the effect was the hazard ratio (HR). A sensitivity analysis was performed according to the risk of bias in the studies. There were 833 participants in a total of 6 cohorts. We found that high SIII values were associated with worse OS (HR = 3.28; 95% CI 1.3-8.9; p < 0.001; I2 = 78) and PFS (HR = 3.9; 95% CI 2.53-6.02; p < 0.001; I2 = 0). No indication of small study effects was found in the association between SIII values and OS (p = 0.5301). High SIII values were associated with worse OS and PFS.

The present study in a coastal destination with cultural characteristics aims to (i) establish the dimensions of perceived value, (ii) determine the relationship between perceived value and satisfaction, and (iii) identify the relationship between perceived value and loyalty in variables such as return, recommendation, and word of mouth in a cultural coastal destination. This quantitative research used a sample of 384 valid questionnaires collected in Huanchaco, Peru, a city next to the Pacific Ocean, being a coastal destination with cultural potential. Factor analysis and multiple regression were applied for data analysis. The results show three dimensions of value perceived by tourists in coastal destinations: emotional and social value, economic value, and functional value. Of these, emotional and social value is the most salient predictor of tourist satisfaction and loyalty. These results will serve as management guides for cultural coastal destination managers and contribute to the academic literature.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Hironori Kato,Travel; Peru; Personal Satisfaction; Tourism; Emotions,2023-08-01,2023,2023-08-01,,18,8,e0286923,All OA; Gold,Article,"Regalado-Pezúa, Otto; Carvache-Franco, Mauricio; Carvache-Franco, Orly; Carvache-Franco, Wilmer","Regalado-Pezúa, Otto (ESAN Graduate School of Business, Universidad ESAN, Lima, Peru); Carvache-Franco, Mauricio (Universidad Espíritu Santo, Samborondón, Ecuador); Carvache-Franco, Orly (Facultad de Economía y Empresa, Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador); Carvache-Franco, Wilmer (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Humanísticas, Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral, ESPOL, Guayaquil, Ecuador)","Carvache-Franco, Wilmer (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral)","Regalado-Pezúa, Otto (Esan University); Carvache-Franco, Mauricio (Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo); Carvache-Franco, Orly (Catholic University of Santiago de Guayaquil); Carvache-Franco, Wilmer (Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral)",1,1,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286923&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162924311,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",

Mutations in IMPDH1 have been linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa subtype 10 (adRP-10), a genetic eye disorder. Some of these mutations such as the Asp226Asn (D226N) lead to the assembly of large filamentous structures termed cytoophidia. D226N also gives IMPDH1 resistance to feedback inhibition by GDP/GTP. This study aims to emulate the adRP-10 condition with a long-term expression of IMPDH1-D226N in vitro and explore cytoophidium assembly and cell survival. We also assessed whether the introduction of an additional mutation (Y12C) to disrupt the cytoophidium has an attenuating effect on the toxicity caused by the D226N mutation. Results: Expression of IMPDH1-D226N in HEp-2 cells resulted in cytoophidium assembly in ∼70% of the cells, but the presence of the Y12C mutation disrupted the filaments. Long-term cell survival was significantly affected by the presence of the D226N mutation, with a decrease of ∼40% in the cells expressing IMPDH1-D226N when compared to IMPDH1-WT; however, survival was significantly recovered in IMPDH1-Y12C/D226N, with only a ∼10% decrease when compared to IMPDH1-WT. On the other hand, the IMPDH1 expression level in the D226N-positive cells was <30% of that of the IMPDH1-WT-positive cells and only slightly higher in the Y12C/D226N, suggesting that although cell survival in Y12C/D226N was recovered, higher expression levels of the mutated IMPDH1 were not tolerated by the cells in the long term. Conclusion: The IMPDH1-D226N effect on photoreceptor cell survival may be the result of a sum of problems: nucleotide unbalance plus a toxic long-life cytoophidium, supported by the observation that by introducing Y12C in IMPDH1 the cytoophidium was disrupted and cell survival significantly recovered, but not the sensibility to GDP/GTP regulation since higher expression levels of IMPDH1-D226N were not tolerated.","The authors acknowledge Erwin de la Fuente Ortega from the “Unidad de Microscopia Confocal” de la Universidad Catolica del Norte.

Clarke plant to treat wounds, pain, and malaria. Aim of the study: The crude extract and solvent fractions of C. latifolia Hochst. ex C.B. Clarke leaves were examined in the present investigation to determine their ability to have an antiinflammatory effect and provide an antinociceptive effect in animal models. Materials and methods: The leaves of C. latifolia were extracted with 80% methanol, and the CL crude extract was further fractionated with chloroform, pure methanol, and distilled water. The carrageenan-induced paw edema model was used to test the extracts' ability to reduce inflammation. The hotplate model and the acetic acid-induced writhing test on rodents were used to test the extracts' potential antinociceptive effect to reduce pain. Results: Inflammation was decreased by 64.59% with CL crude extract (400 mg/kg); 56.34% (400 mg/kg) of methanol fraction, 64.59% of aqueous fraction (400 mg/kg), and 38.27% of chloroform fraction in the carrageenan-induced inflammatory model. All extracts demonstrated a considerable lengthening of the nociception reaction time in the hot plate test, with a maximum antinociceptive effect of 78.98% (crude extract) and 71.65% (solvent fractions). At a dosage of 400 mg/kg, the natural C. latifolia crude extract and aqueous fraction demonstrated considerable antinociceptive effects against acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the writhing test (48.83% and 45.37than%, respectively).

METHODS: Quantitative approach, with an ecological, descriptive correlational, and cross-sectional design. The population was from the geographical region of Peru, where a total of 26,956 cases of leishmaniasis were registered by the Peruvian Ministry of Health from 2017 to 2021. Spearman's Rho statistic was used to analyze the variables that are most associated with the cases of leishmaniasis reported per year, and, in addition, the multivariate technique of cluster analysis was applied.
RESULTS: Annual rainfall and areas with humid forest (climatic factors) and mortality from transmissible diseases (health factor) are directly associated with reported cases of leishmaniasis. Households with basic access to infrastructure, drinking water, drainage, and electric lighting; illiteracy, regional social progress, and unsatisfied basic needs (social factors); and percentage of urban population (demographic factor) are inversely and significantly associated with cases of leishmaniasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Climatic and environmental factors contribute to the multiplication of the leishmaniasis disease vector. The incidence of leishmaniasis adds up to the mortality rates for transmissible diseases in Peru. As living conditions improve, the incidence of this pathology decreases.",We are grateful to Universidad César Vallejo for their support in financing this study.,This study was financed by the Vice-Rector for Research of the César Vallejo University through resolution number 454-2022-VI-UCV.,Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease,,,,2023-10-26,2023,2023-10-26,,8,11,484,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yupari-Azabache, Irma Luz; Díaz-Ortega, Jorge Luis; Bardales-Aguirre, Lucía Beatriz; Barros-Sevillano, Shamir; Paredes-Díaz, Susana Edita","Yupari-Azabache, Irma Luz (Grupo de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas y Transmisibles, Universidad César Vallejo, Av.

Their interpretative mechanisms are observed in the dispute over the relevance of building urban or agricultural societies in the jungle. Considering their personal trajectories introduces a contextual analysis of the configuration of their argumentative bodies when giving meanings to the rainforest. The Amazonian monitoring and its insertion in the web of knowledge and technologies deployed with the implementation of development plans allow us to point out the most notorious environmental effects after their performance. Originality: Analytically comparing the planning activities in the Amazon brings an innovative description of the circumstances that defined its planners’ work. The article shows how it emerged in the context of the “great acceleration,” with which Environmental History describes the turning point in which state action gained a momentum of sensitive magnitude in the jungle space. Conclusions: Among the planners of Brazil, Ecuador and Peru, the intention to advance development centers prevailed, fostering industrialized urban societies, while those of Colombia preferred a model that affirmed the modernization of agriculture and cattle ranching.

During breeding and non-breeding seasons, seabirds move extraordinary distances among different environments. However, foraging site fidelity by seabirds appears to be high in areas of known high productivity, such as frontal zones and upwellings. Here, we present a tracking study for the Peruvian diving-petrel Pelecanoides garnotii, an endemic seabird of the highly productive Humboldt Current System, to assess whether adults use the same foraging areas throughout the year, combining data from nest monitoring and global location sensors (GLS) deployed on 12 individuals between two breeding seasons (2013–2014 and 2014–2015), in Choros Island (29°15′S; 71°32′W), Chile. Two main foraging areas were registered. During the breeding season, adults moved in the northern direction, between 60 to 144 km away from their colony, foraging in areas with high primary productivity. During the non-breeding period, they moved to southern latitudes (~ 1200 km). Adults spent 37% and 63% of their time in flight/land and on/underwater activities, respectively. We determined that birds move northward from their colony during breeding, where prey availability seems more predictable throughout the year. However, during the non-breeding period, it is likely that other environmental factors influence the distribution pattern of the Peruvian diving-petrel.",We thank Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF) for permission to conduct fieldwork and all logistical facilities during the research.

It is noteworthy that in the studies consulted, there is no precise evidence that determines with accuracy the configurations of these knowledge factors that function as the basis of the teaching profession. Therefore, the objective of this study is to establish the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire on the nature or origin of the academic knowledge of teachers of basic general education, adapted from the Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) Competence Model. Methods: A methodological study was established that applies a test to the processes of reliability and internal consistency. The construct validity was performed through (n = 8) expert judges, using Cohen's Kappa. An exploratory factor analysis was performed following the criteria of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Coefficient (KMO), the Bartlett sphericity test and the principal components extraction method in the factor analysis with varimax rotation. The sample consisted of (n = 27) teachers of basic general education of the Ibarra Canton. Results: The results show a reliability analysis for the instrument obtained a Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.901), estimated to be an excellent level. Conclusions: The questionnaire is relevant, valid and reliable, adapting to the needs of teachers of basic general education to determine the nature or origin of the academic knowledge in a fast and reliable manner.",The authors are grateful for the support of the Universidad Técnica del Norte and the different educational units of the Ibarra canton that participated in the research.,"This study was supported by the Universidad Técnica del Norte.

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and satellite radar signals provide observations beyond ground deformation, including how earthquake and tsunami processes affect variations in the ionosphere. Here, we study the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai (HTHH) volcanic eruption 2022 and its associated tsunami propagation with the analysis GNSS derived Total Electron Content (TEC), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data, complemented with tide gauge observations. We utilize GNSS sites data within a ~ 5000 km radius from the volcanic eruption for estimating the ionospheric perturbation as Vertical TEC. We give evidence on the detection of acoustic gravity, internal gravity, and atmospheric Lamb waves signatures in the TEC perturbation. In particular, the internal gravity waves that concentrated in the southwest of Tonga, directly correlates with the observed tsunami propagation direction as accounted by the tide gauge measurements. However, the acoustic gravity wave signature in the TEC is dominant in the north direction suggesting a surface deformation, which could be verified using Sentinel-1A SAR amplitude data. The analysis presented herein shows that within 5 h of the volcanic eruption, the central part of the HTHH island landscape disappeared with the biggest explosion. The unprecedented detail resolved by integrating satellite data yields previously unknown details of the deformation of the 2022 HTHH volcano eruption.","Mahesh N.

The purpose of this work is to detect and classify type 2 diabetes in patients using machine learning (ML) models, and to select the most optimal model to predict the risk of diabetes. In this paper, five ML models, including K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Bernoulli Naïve Bayes (BNB), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM), are investigated to predict diabetic patients. A Kaggle-hosted Pima Indian dataset containing 768 patients with and without diabetes was used, including variables such as number of pregnancies the patient has had, blood glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, skinfold thickness, body insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), genetic background, diabetes in the family tree, age, and outcome (with/without diabetes). The results show that the K-NN and BNB models outperform the other models. The K-NN model obtained the best accuracy in detecting diabetes, with 79.6% accuracy, while the BNB model obtained 77.2% accuracy in detecting diabetes. Finally, it can be stated that the use of ML models for the early detection of diabetes is very promising.",,This research received no external funding.,Diagnostics,,,,2023-07-15,2023,2023-07-15,,13,14,2383,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando; Espinola-Linares, Karina; Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella Flores; Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael","Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Facultad de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Universidad Autónoma del Perú, Lima 15842, Peru;, oiparraguirre@ieee.org); Espinola-Linares, Karina (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Tecnológica del Perú, Chimbote 02710, Peru;, c24051@utp.edu.pe); Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella Flores (Facultad de Arquitectura e Ingeniería, Universidad César Vallejo, Lima 15314, Peru;, rfloresc@ucv.edu.pe); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15083, Peru)","Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Private University of the North)","Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Espinola-Linares, Karina (Universidad Tecnológica del Perú); Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella Flores (Universidad César Vallejo); Cabanillas-Carbonell, Michael (Private University of the North)",16,16,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/14/2383/pdf?version=1689422105,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160780476,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Nowadays, it has become crucial to identify novel plant larvicides with an eco-friendly impact. The components of essential oils from Croton linearis Jacq. (EO-Cl), Lantana involucrata L. (EO-Li), Ocimum sanctum var. cubensis M. Gómez. (EO-Os), and Zanthoxylum pistaciifolium Griseb. (syn. Zanthoxylum flavum subsp. pistaciifolium (Griseb.) Reynel (EO-Zp) were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Larvicidal and adulticidal bioassays against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles albitarsis and Culex quinquefasciatus, were performed according to the World Health Organization standard methods. A high diversity of compounds was identified in the four oils, with a total of 152 compounds (33-70 components). EO-Cl, EO-Li, and EO-Os were classified as active against both insect forms, larvae and adults. Lantana involucrata showed the best results, with LC50 values from 33.8 to 41.7 mg/L. In most of the cases, it was not possible to associate the main compounds with the measured activity, supporting the hypothesis about probable synergistic interactions among major and minor compounds.

Although historically in America and in the rest of the world men drink more alcohol, in frequency and intensity, alcohol misuse among women is increasing. A close relationship has been linked between excessive alcohol consumption and episodes of verbal, physical and sexual violence in couples. Objective: To measure the prevalence of alcohol consumption, identify types of violence and determine the association between alcohol consumption and dating violence in female high school students. Methodology: A descriptive correlational design was used. 206 adolescents between 15 and 18 years old who were in final exams were excluded, using a non-probabilistic sampling. A survey including personal data, alcohol consumption, and the Dating Violence Scale, prior settlement and informed consent, descriptive and inferential statistical analysis with Spearman's test was used. Results: 59.2% had a partner and showed an average alcohol consumption of 14.7 years; 70.9% drank alcohol at some point in their lives; and 37.7% drank alcohol in the last week. 88.3% suffered psychological violence, 7.8% physical violence, and 3.9% sexual violence; a significant positive statistical correlation was found between the number of drinks consumed on a typical day and psychological violence.

We have previously shown that ethanol-exposed astrocytes alter neuronal neurite outgrowth in an in vitro co-culture system and that ethanol alters the astrocyte-produced extracellular matrix (ECM) in vitro, with similar alterations in vivo. In this study, we utilized the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) procedure in Aldh1l1-EGFP/Rpl10a transgenic mouse primary cortical astrocyte cultures to transcriptionally and translationally profile the astrocyte response to ethanol. We found a large number of differences between the total RNA pool and the translating RNA pool, indicating that the transcriptional state of astrocytes may not always reflect the translational state of astrocytes. In addition, there was a considerable overlap between ethanol-dysregulated genes in the total RNA pool and the translating RNA pool. Comparisons to published datasets indicate the in vitro model used here is most similar to PD1 or PD7 in vivo cortical astrocytes, and the ethanol-regulated genes showed a significant overlap with models of chronic ethanol exposure in astrocytes, a model of third-trimester ethanol exposure in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and an acute model of ethanol exposure in the hippocampus. These findings will further our understanding of the effects of ethanol on astrocyte gene expression and protein translation and how these changes may alter brain development and support the use of in vitro astrocyte cultures as models of neonatal astrocytes.",,"This study was supported by NIH P60AA010760, R01AA029486, and U01AA029965, VA Merit Review Award I01BX001819, and by facilities and resources at the Portland VA Health Care System.

Thus, this study investigated whether genetically predicted risk factors and nutrients play a function in the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC), non-infective colitis (NIC), and Crohn's disease (CD), using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Utilizing the data of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 37 exposure factors, we ran Mendelian randomization analyses based on up to 458,109 participants. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were conducted to determine causal risk factors for IBD diseases. Genetic predisposition to smoking and appendectomy as well as vegetable and fruit intake, breastfeeding, n-3 PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, vitamin D, total cholesterol, whole-body fat mass, and physical activity were related to the risk of UC (p < 0.05). The effect of lifestyle behaviors on UC was attenuated after correcting for appendectomy. Genetically driven smoking, alcohol consumption, appendectomy, tonsillectomy, blood calcium, tea intake, autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes, cesarean delivery, vitamin D deficiency, and antibiotic exposure increased the risk of CD (p < 0.05), while vegetable and fruit intake, breastfeeding, physical activity, blood zinc, and n-3 PUFAs decreased the risk of CD (p < 0.05). Appendectomy, antibiotics, physical activity, blood zinc, n-3 PUFAs, and vegetable fruit intake remained significant predictors in multivariable MR (p < 0.05). Besides smoking, breastfeeding, alcoholic drinks, vegetable and fruit intake, vitamin D, appendectomy, and n-3 PUFAs were associated with NIC (p < 0.05). Smoking, alcoholic drinks, vegetable and fruit intake, vitamin D, appendectomy, and n-3 PUFAs remained significant predictors in multivariable MR (p < 0.05). Our results provide new and comprehensive evidence demonstrating that there are approving causal effects of various risk factors on IBDs. These findings also supply some suggestions for the treatment and prevention of these diseases.","The authors extend their appreciation for Researchers Supporting Project number RSP2023R120 obtained from King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",This research received no external funding.,Nutrients,,,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genome-Wide Association Study; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Risk Factors; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Vitamin D; Vegetables",2023-02-27,2023,2023-02-27,,15,5,1202,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saadh, Mohamed J; Pal, Rashmi Saxena; Arias-Gonzáles, José Luis; Orosco Gavilán, Juan Carlos; Jc, Darshan; Mohany, Mohamed; Al-Rejaie, Salim S; Bahrami, Abolfazl; Kadham, Mustafa Jawad; Amin, Ali H; Georgia, Hrosti","Saadh, Mohamed J (Faculty of Pharmacy, Middle East University, Amman 11831, Jordan.; Applied Science Research Center, Applied Science Private University, Amman 11152, Jordan.); Pal, Rashmi Saxena (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara 144001, Punjab, India.); Arias-Gonzáles, José Luis (Department of Social Sciences, Faculty of Social Studies, Pontifical University of Peru, San Miguel 15088, Peru.); Orosco Gavilán, Juan Carlos (Campus Virtual, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima 15003, Peru.); Jc, Darshan (Department of Pharmacy Practice, Yenepoya Pharmacy College & Research Centre, Yenepoya Deemed to Be University, Mangalore 575018, Karnataka, India.); Mohany, Mohamed (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, P.O.

Secondarily, to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES).
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study based on secondary data analysis of the 2022 Venezuelan Population Residing in Peru Survey (ENPOVE-2022, from the Spanish acronym) was conducted. FI was measured with the FIES, whose properties were tested using the Rasch model. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate relative prevalence ratios with their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals.
SETTING: This survey was conducted in February and March 2022 in the eight cities most populated by Venezuelan migrants and refugees in Peru.
PARTICIPANTS: Venezuelan migrants and refugees over the age of 18 years living in Peru.
RESULTS: A total of 7727 participants were included. Rasch reliability was adequate (0·73). The prevalence of mild, moderate and severe FI was 36·71 %, 31·14 % and 10·48 %, respectively. Being aged 25-34 and 35-44 years, unemployed, uninsured, having no formal education or secondary, illegal status, living in a dwelling with 2-4 and more than 4 people, presenting one or more than one chronic disease, residing in Peru for 0-6 months and perceived discrimination were associated with a higher probability of moderate FI. Furthermore, having secondary education, being unemployed, uninsured, never married, illegal, residing in Tumbes, presenting one or more than one chronic disease and perceived discrimination were significantly associated with severe FI.
CONCLUSION: Four out of ten Venezuelan migrants residing in Peru presented moderate to severe FI. The FIES showed adequate psychometric properties. Differences in the socio-demographic, health and migratory factors associated with FI levels were found. Inter-sectoral and multi-sectoral interventions are needed and should be focused on addressing the determinants of FI.",,,Public Health Nutrition,,,Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; Transients and Migrants; Peru; Cross-Sectional Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Food Insecurity; Prevalence; Chronic Disease; Food Supply,2023-11-10,2023,2023-11-10,2023-12,26,12,2982-2994,All OA; Gold,Article,"Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali; Villarreal-Zegarra, David; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido; Robles-Valcárcel, Pamela; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Al-kassab-Córdova, Ali (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru); Villarreal-Zegarra, David (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Continental, Lima, Peru); Bendezu-Quispe, Guido (Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana, Universidad Privada San Juan Bautista, Filial de Ica, Ica, Peru); Robles-Valcárcel, Pamela (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Herrera-Añazco, Percy (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.

1063,pub.1160570715,10.3389/fams.2023.1214022,,,Study of the stability of a meshless generalized finite difference scheme applied to the wave equation,"When designing and implementing numerical schemes, it is imperative to consider the stability of the applied methods. Prior research has presented different results for the stability of generalized finite-difference methods applied to advection and diffusion equations. In recent years, research has explored a generalized finite-difference approach to the advection-diffusion equation solved on non-rectangular and highly irregular regions using convex, logically rectangular grids. This paper presents a study on the stability of generalized finite difference schemes applied to the numerical solution of the wave equation, solved on clouds of points for highly irregular domains. The stability analysis presented in this work provides significant insights into the proper discretizations needed to obtain stable and satisfactory results. The proposed explicit scheme is conditionally stable, while the implicit scheme is unconditionally stable. Notably, the stability analyses presented in this paper apply to any scheme which is at least second order in space, not just the proposed approach. The proposed scheme offers effective means of numerically solving the wave equation, particularly for highly irregular domains. By demonstrating the stability of the scheme, this study provides a foundation for further research in this area.","The authors thank AULA CIMNE-Morelia, CIC UMSNH, and CONACyT for supporting this research.","Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo and CONACyT provide funds for open-access publication fees, and the International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering provides technical and academic support.",Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,,,,2023-07-11,2023,2023-07-11,,9,,1214022,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tinoco-Guerrero, Gerardo; Domínguez-Mota, Francisco Javier; Guzmán-Torres, José Alberto; Román-Gutiérrez, Ricardo; Tinoco-Ruiz, José Gerardo","Tinoco-Guerrero, Gerardo (Civil Engineering Faculty, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico); Domínguez-Mota, Francisco Javier (Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, UMSNH, Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico); Guzmán-Torres, José Alberto (Civil Engineering Faculty, Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico); Román-Gutiérrez, Ricardo (Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, UMSNH, Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico); Tinoco-Ruiz, José Gerardo (Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, UMSNH, Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico)","Tinoco-Guerrero, Gerardo (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo)","Tinoco-Guerrero, Gerardo (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo); Domínguez-Mota, Francisco Javier (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo); Guzmán-Torres, José Alberto (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo); Román-Gutiérrez, Ricardo (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo); Tinoco-Ruiz, José Gerardo (Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fams.2023.1214022/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160570715,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4903 Numerical and Computational Mathematics,

It could avoid excessive degradations of active compounds with potential therapeutic agents. In this study, the effect on several relevant bioactive compounds, anti-inflammatory activity, and anti-proliferative activity of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) were evaluated. Effects of other drying methods, including vacuum drying (VD), convective drying (CD), infrared drying (IRD), and freeze drying (FD), were also comparatively evaluated. The results of all dried samples showed high polyunsaturated fatty acid contents (of up to 71.3%) and essential amino acid contents (of up to 8.63%). The LTVD method stands out above the other drying methods, since it obtained the highest content of total phenols, chlorogenic acid, and ferulic acid. Both the LTVD and CD samples demonstrated high anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities. These CD and LTVD samples were also the most active against the breast carcinoma MDA-MB-23 cell line. Due to the good retention of bioactive compounds via LTVD, the obtained dried broccoli here can be used in a near time as an ingredient for the development of novel natural products with anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo de la Universidad de La Serena (DIDULS), through the project N°PTE2211115.

Methods: A systematic research involving six electronic databases was conducted using a research strategy that combined MeSH terms with free terms. Article selection and information extraction were performed using a double and independent approach. The Newcastle-Ottawa tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included articles. The meta-analysis used the random-effects approach, with subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis for risk of bias also being performed.
Results: We included 101 articles with a total of 31,123 participants. The studies were conducted between 1990 and 2022, with Brazil accounting for the largest number of studies (n = 37). The overall seroprevalence of human toxocariasis was 31.0% (95% CI: 27.0-35.0%, I2 = 99%). The prevalence of the main characteristics observed in seropositive patients were as follows: ocular toxocariasis (30.0%), asymptomatic (26.0%), and presence of dogs at home (68.0%). In addition, the seroprevalence was lower in studies including only adults than in those including children or both. In contrast, no differences in seroprevalences were found between studies conducted in the community and hospital.
Conclusion: The overall seroprevalence of human toxocariasis in Latin America and the Caribbean was high. Notably, our findings showed that the seroprevalence was increased among populations who kept a dog at home but was decreased in populations comprising only adults. Our findings can be used to establish epidemiological surveillance strategies for the prevention and early identification of toxocariasis.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,,Child; Adult; Humans; Animals; Dogs; Toxocariasis; Latin America; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Caribbean Region; Ethnicity,2023-06-27,2023,2023-06-27,,11,,1181230,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ulloque-Badaracco, Juan R.; Hernandez-Bustamante, Enrique A.; Alarcón-Braga, Esteban A.; Huayta-Cortez, Miguel; Carballo-Tello, Ximena L.; Seminario-Amez, Rosa A.; Rodríguez-Torres, Alejandra; Casas-Patiño, Donovan; Herrera-Añazco, Percy; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.","Ulloque-Badaracco, Juan R.

The identification of the problem arose from the empirical analysis, where serious deficiencies in the manual handling and management of the stock of medicines and hospital supplies were evidenced. This deficiency does not allow a timely response to the demand of the logistics and supply chain, causing stock ruptures in health centers. Based on this finding, we asked ourselves how AI was observed as the most efficient tool to solve this difficulty. The results were obtained through surveys of personnel in charge of hospital and pharmacy supplies. The questions focused on the level of training, seniority in positions related to the problem, knowledge of regulations, degree of innovation in the procedures used in logistics and supply chain and procurement. However, a very striking fact was related to the importance of the use of AI, where, very surprisingly, 64.7% considered that it would not help to reduce human errors generated in the areas analyzed.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Devidas Menon, Tania Stafinski",Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Chile; Health Facilities; Fitness Centers; Pharmaceutical Services,2023-03-09,2023,2023-03-09,,20,6,4839,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bas, Tomas Gabriel; Astudillo, Paula; Rojo, Daniel; Trigo, Angel","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Astudillo, Paula (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Rojo, Daniel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.); Trigo, Angel (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile.)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North)","Bas, Tomas Gabriel (Catholic University of the North); Astudillo, Paula (Catholic University of the North); Rojo, Daniel (Catholic University of the North); Trigo, Angel (Catholic University of the North)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/6/4839/pdf?version=1678359017,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156118759,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Methods: The sample included 138 same-sex male couples. Both dyad members completed self-report measures of attachment insecurity, emotional intimacy, and IH. The actor-partner interdependence model with moderation analysis was applied.
Results: Indicated that higher levels of actor's and partner's attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were associated with lower actor's emotional intimacy. IH moderated the partner effects of attachment avoidance on emotional intimacy. The partner's higher attachment avoidance was associated with one's own lower emotional intimacy at low (but not high) levels of one's own IH and at high (but not low) levels of the partner's IH.
Discussion: Findings suggest that the partner's attachment avoidance may differently affect one's own emotional intimacy depending on the IH levels of both dyad members. Helping partnered sexual minority men decrease attachment insecurity while recognizing their own and their partners' IH may promote relationship quality.",,"This research was funded by the National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development of Chile, FONDECYT 1190240.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2023-03-29,2023,2023-03-29,,14,,1148005,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guzmán-González, Mónica; Gómez, Fabiola; Bahamondes, Joaquín; Barrientos, Jaime; Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia; Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo; Casu, Giulia","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Laboratory of Research in Attachment, Couple Relationships and Family, School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Gómez, Fabiola (School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica, Santiago, Chile); Bahamondes, Joaquín (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Barrientos, Jaime (Faculty of Psychology, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile); Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia (Department of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Casu, Giulia (Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Gómez, Fabiola (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Bahamondes, Joaquín (Catholic University of the North); Barrientos, Jaime (Alberto Hurtado University); Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia (Catholic University of the Maule); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Catholic University of the North); Casu, Giulia (University of Bologna)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1148005/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156598319,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

Our goal is to apply Freire’s the analytical method and the mediaarts for improving the school education and promoting the educational and social inclusion in the schools, through the innovativeeducational programs, and a collaborative and respectful learning environment that values the cultural diversity and the equal opportunities for all students. The Freirean approach to thought focuses on the socio-educational relationship in the educational field. It proposes to integrate the socio-educationaldevelopment, theoretical and practical, into different values and functions of education through the critical pedagogy. This educational proposal seeks to separate the medial arts for transforming the dilemma of critical and medial literacy, and to establisha new relationship between the critical pedagogy and the social education. The influence of Freirean thought involves connecting the culture and the arts in a medial literacy program that includes both the theory and the educational practice. Finally,we propose to open a debate to reflect on the training of teachers and artists for the “virtual school”, interacting with inclusive students from diverse cultures to create artistic works and promote independence in medial arts activities.",,,Alteridad,,,,2023-06-29,2023,2023-06-29,,18,2,164-176,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bernaschina, Diego","Bernaschina, Diego (Investigador independiente)",,"Bernaschina, Diego (Investigador independiente)",2,2,,,https://alteridad.ups.edu.ec/index.php/alteridad/article/download/6269/6762,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160215393,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education",4 Quality Education

The aim of this study was to determine its effect on depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with studies. Using an explanatory cross-sectional design, 1,260 medical, nursing, and dentistry students from both public and private universities in Peru participated in this study. They were assessed using a scale for concern about contracting COVID-19, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), and a brief scale for satisfaction with their studies. After analyzing the data using structural equation modeling, it was found that the explanatory model had an adequate fit. It showed that concern about COVID-19 had a direct and significant effect on anxiety (β = 0.46, p < 0.001) and depression (β = 0.38, p < 0.001). However, the same effect was not evident on satisfaction with studies (β = −0.06, p = 0.068).

However, heterogeneous social and environmental conditions shape this freshwater management challenge at subnational scales. We have noticed different interpretations of this challenge. To map the debate, understand the diverse interpretations, and frame political choices, we conducted semi-structured interviews with institutional and non-institutional stakeholders for performing discourse analysis in an Andean watershed where mountaintop gold mining, midstream farmers, and the downstream Cajamarca city coexist. One discourse dominates the debate on protecting the freshwater supply and argues the importance of river impoundment, municipal storage capacity, and institutional leadership. The other two discourses revolve around protecting the mountain aquifer. The second discourse does so with a fatalistic view of headwaters protection and rural support. The third discourse partially shifts the debate towards the need for improving rural capacity building and (ground)water inventories. To understand evolutions in society, it is crucial to understand these three discourses, including the types of knowledge that actors present as legitimate, the attributed roles to all stakeholders, and the kinds of worldviews informing each discourse.

Moreover, these systems provide essential ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, food provisioning, protection against natural hazards). The present study focuses on the socio-ecological system at the delta of the Magdalena River in the central Caribbean Region in Colombia. This research seeks to assess the multidimensional sustainability of the Magdalena river-mouth system (MRm-SES) to improve the knowledge basis for its integrated management. To do so, an assessment tool named “Circles of Coastal Sustainability” (CCS) was used to evaluate the system splitting it into four domains (environmental, social, economic and governance) that were divided into 5 categories each. These domains were evaluated through a total of 52 indicators distributed like this: 16 for the Environmental domain, 16 for the Economic domain, 12 for the Social and Cultural domain and, 8 for the Governance domain. The results show that the overall sustainability of the MRm-SES is classified as “Satisfactory.” None of the domains is in “Excellent” or “Bad” conditions. However, the evaluation of the categories shows that four (4) of them have “Poor” conditions (i.e., Social Benefits, Demographics, Economic Security, and Resources Management). Hence, it is recommended to put those categories at the centre of the discussion to define management strategies (e.g., Preserving and restoring habitats; tackling sources of pollution and excessive sediment; local reduction of net Greenhouse Gas and adaptation to climate change; participation of local communities in the management design and implementation), without disregarding the interrelation with the other categories and dimensions. Finally, it is argued that despite all the improvement opportunities, the CCS is a valuable tool to evaluate and communicate with different stakeholders (academic community, managers and decision-makers, local communities, etc.), to improve the sustainability of coastal systems in Colombia and the world.","The authors thank Natalia M.

Ritmo y oralidad en Toques de son colorá,"The following article analyzes the centrality that rhythm acquires in the novel Toques de Son Colorá (2020) by the Colombian writer Adelaida Fernández Ochoa. The objective is to demonstrate that the relevance of this component arises linked to the oral tradition, which in turn is linked to the ancestral African roots present both in the biography of the author and throughout the American continent, so they permeate the entire narrative. Specifically, the relevance of the musical genre of salsa along with other Caribbean rhythms within the plot of the novel will be addressed as examples of the presence of that ancestral heritage in the contemporary context of the work. At the same time, this analysis will be guided mainly by the studies on this component developed by the Peruvian researcher Victoria Santa Cruz Gamarra, together with various Afro-centered theoretical proposals that address the concept of orality. We see that in this work this component arises twinned with that of writing, allowing with this to expand the investigations already carried out on Afrodescendants and their role in both Colombian and Latin American identity, considering the approaches obtained from the intersection between gender and race present in the novel.",,,Letras (Lima),,,,2023-06-13,2023,2023-06-13,,94,139,144-155,All OA; Gold,Article,"Herrera, Lilian Joscelyne Salinas","Herrera, Lilian Joscelyne Salinas (Universidad de Playa Ancha, San Felipe, Chile)",,"Herrera, Lilian Joscelyne Salinas (Playa Ancha University of Educational Sciences)",0,0,,,http://revista.letras.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/le/article/download/2419/2357,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160694559,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3602 Creative and Professional Writing,

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) form a category with THR potential due to their ability to deliver nicotine and flavours through heating, not burning, tobacco. By eliminating burning, heated tobacco does not produce smoke but an aerosol which contains fewer and lower levels of harmful chemicals compared to cigarette smoke. In this study we assessed the in vitro toxicological profiles of two prototype HTPs' aerosols compared to the 1R6F reference cigarette using the 3D human (bronchial) MucilAir™ model. To increase consumer relevance, whole aerosol/smoke exposures were delivered repeatedly across a 28 day period (16, 32, or 48 puffs per exposure). Cytotoxicity (LDH secretion), histology (Alcian Blue/H&E; Muc5AC; FoxJ1 staining), cilia active area and beat frequency and inflammatory marker (IL-6; IL-8; MMP-1; MMP-3; MMP-9; TNFα) levels were assessed. Diluted 1R6F smoke consistently induced greater and earlier effects compared to the prototype HTP aerosols across the endpoints, and in a puff dependent manner. Although some significant changes across the endpoints were induced by exposure to the HTPs, these were substantially less pronounced and less frequently observed, with apparent adaptive responses occurring over the experimental period. Furthermore, these differences between the two product categories were observed at a greater dilution (and generally lower nicotine delivery range) for 1R6F (1R6F smoke diluted 1/14, HTP aerosols diluted 1/2, with air). Overall, the findings demonstrate the THR potential of the prototype HTPs through demonstrated substantial reductions in toxicological outcomes in in vitro 3D human lung models.",,,Frontiers in Toxicology,,,,2023-02-16,2023,2023-02-16,,5,,1076752,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chapman, Fiona; Pour, Sarah Jean; Wieczorek, Roman; Sticken, Edgar Trelles; Budde, Jessica; Röwer, Karin; Otte, Sandra; Mason, Elizabeth; Czekala, Lukasz; Nahde, Thomas; O’Connell, Grant; Simms, Liam; Stevenson, Matthew","Chapman, Fiona (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Pour, Sarah Jean (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Wieczorek, Roman (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Sticken, Edgar Trelles (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Budde, Jessica (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Röwer, Karin (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Otte, Sandra (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); Mason, Elizabeth (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Czekala, Lukasz (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Nahde, Thomas (Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, Hamburg, Germany); O’Connell, Grant (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Simms, Liam (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom); Stevenson, Matthew (Imperial Brands PLC, Bristol, United Kingdom)","Chapman, Fiona (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom))","Chapman, Fiona (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Pour, Sarah Jean (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Wieczorek, Roman (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Sticken, Edgar Trelles (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Budde, Jessica (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Röwer, Karin (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Otte, Sandra (Imperial Brands (Germany)); Mason, Elizabeth (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Czekala, Lukasz (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Nahde, Thomas (Imperial Brands (Germany)); O’Connell, Grant (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Simms, Liam (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom)); Stevenson, Matthew (Imperial Brands (United Kingdom))",4,4,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1076752/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155424650,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology,3 Good Health and Well Being

To obtain an overall landscape view of the effects of IFN-γ from brain-resident cells on the cerebral protective immunity, in the present study we employed NanoString nCounter assay and quantified mRNA levels for 734 genes in myeloid immunity in the brains of T and B cell-deficient, bone marrow chimeric mice with and without IFN-γ production by brain-resident cells in response to reactivation of cerebral T. gondii infection. Our study revealed that IFN-γ produced by brain-resident cells amplified mRNA expression for the molecules to activate the protective innate immunity including 1) chemokines for recruitment of microglia and macrophages (CCL8 and CXCL12) and 2) the molecules for activating those phagocytes (IL-18, TLRs, NOD1, and CD40) for killing tachyzoites. Importantly, IFN-γ produced by brain-resident cells also upregulated cerebral expression of molecules for facilitating the protective T cell immunity, which include the molecules for 1) recruiting effector T cells (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), 2) antigen processing (PA28αβ, LMP2, and LMP7), transporting the processed peptides (TAP1 and TAP2), assembling the transported peptides to the MHC class I molecules (Tapasin), and the MHC class I (H2-K1 and H2-D1) and Ib molecules (H2-Q1, H-2Q2, and H2-M3) for presenting antigens to activate the recruited CD8+ T cells, 3) MHC class II molecules (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb1, H2-Ea-ps, H2-DMa, H2-Ob, and CD74) to present antigens for CD4+ T cell activation, 4) co-stimulatory molecules (ICOSL) for T cell activation, and 5) cytokines (IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18) facilitating IFN-γ production by NK and T cells. Notably, the present study also revealed that IFN-γ production by brain-resident cells also upregulates cerebral expressions of mRNA for the downregulatory molecules (IL-10, STAT3, SOCS1, CD274 [PD-L1], IL-27, and CD36), which can prevent overly stimulated IFN-γ-mediated pro-inflammatory responses and tissue damages. Thus, the present study uncovered the previously unrecognized the capability of IFN-γ production by brain-resident cells to upregulate expressions of a wide spectrum of molecules for coordinating both innate and T cell-mediated protective immunity with a fine-tuning regulation system to effectively control cerebral infection with T. gondii.",The authors appreciate the service and assistance in flow cytometry and NanoString assay provided by Markey Shared Resource Facility at University of Kentucky supported by P30CA177558.,"The study was supported in part by the funding from the National Institutes of Health (AI152597, AI095032, and AI136821).",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,,"Animals; Mice; Toxoplasma; Interleukin-18; Persistent Infection; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Immunity, Cellular; Interferon-gamma",2023-02-15,2023,2023-02-15,,13,,1110508,All OA; Gold,Article,"Suzuki, Yasuhiro; Lutshumba, Jenny; Chen, Kuey Chu; Abdelaziz, Mohamed H.; Sa, Qila; Ochiai, Eri","Suzuki, Yasuhiro (Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States); Lutshumba, Jenny (Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States); Chen, Kuey Chu (Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Science, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States; Genomics Core Laboratory, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States); Abdelaziz, Mohamed H.

Resumo A rua Ayacucho na cidade de Medellín viram-se em espaços produzidos, colonizados e com outro estrato socioeconômico pelo capital imobiliário-financeiro e o Estado, negando-lhes ao direito da cidade aos moradores que demandam uma solução ao déficit de habitação, e que ao mesmo tempo, os expulsa à periferia da cidade. O capital imobiliário-financeiro cumpre um papel protagonista no sistema capitalista atual. No seu processo de expansão, o capital em conivência do Estado, gera um conflito de interesses com os grupos sociais, uma vez que eles se debatem entre a reprodução do capital e a reprodução social da vida. Por tanto, em quanto nos instrumentos de planejamento contemporâneo consideram os espaços centrais da cidade para o desenvolvimento de projetos imobiliários sob a premissa da cidade compacta, os interesses de iniciativa privada prevalecem sob aos interesses das classes menos favorecidas, as quais procuram solucionar entre outros problemas o déficit de habitação. Ao mesmo tempo, na tentativa por posicionar a Medellín como uma plataforma competitiva, o Estado desenvolve megaprojetos que geram o despejo (desapropriação) de alguns moradores tradicionais, para dar entrada a moradores com maior renda.
Abstract Ayacucho Street in the city of Medellin has become a space produced, colonized and re-stratified by real estate-financial capital and the State, denying the right to the city to inhabitants who demand a solution to the housing deficit, to the time expels them to the outskirts of the city. Real estate-financial capital plays a leading role in the current capitalist system. In its process of expansion, capital in collusion with the State, generates a conflict of interest with social groups, since they are torn between the reproduction of capital and the social reproduction of life. Therefore, while the contemporary planning instruments contemplate central spaces of the city for the development of real estate projects under the premise of the compact city, the interests of the private prevail over those of the less favored classes that they seek to solve, among other problems. , its housing deficit. At the same time, in an attempt to position Medellín city as a competitive platform, the State develops megaprojects that generate the eviction (expropriation) of some traditional inhabitants, to make way for inhabitants of more favored social classes.",,,urbe Revista Brasileira de Gestão Urbana,,,,2023,2023,2023,,15,,e20220055,All OA; Gold,Article,"Londoño, Carlos Alberto; Carmona, Luz Stella","Londoño, Carlos Alberto (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Colombia); Carmona, Luz Stella (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Colombia)",,"Londoño, Carlos Alberto (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Carmona, Luz Stella (Pontifical Bolivarian University)",1,1,,,https://www.scielo.br/j/urbe/a/nSqmRnZLZcc9rHb9qzWP9WF/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155502928,,

In this study, we present the synthesis of 2-(((2-aminoethyl)imino)methyl)phenol (HL1) and the iron (III) complex (Fe(L1)2Br, (C1)), confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The absorption and emission properties of complex C1 were assessed in the presence and absence of different physiologically relevant analytes, finding a fluorescent turn-on when OH- was added. So, we determined the limit of detection (LOD = 3.97 × 10-9 M), stoichiometry (1:1), and association constant (Kas = 5.86 × 103 M-1). Using DFT calculations, we proposed a spontaneous decomposition mechanism for C1. After characterization, complex C1 was evaluated as an intracellular pH chemosensor on the human primary gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) and non-tumoral gastric epithelia (GES-1) cell lines, finding fluorescent signal activation in the latter when compared to AGS cells due to the lower intracellular pH of AGS cells caused by the increased metabolic rate. However, when complex C1 was used on metastatic cancer cell lines (MKN-45 and MKN-74), a fluorescent turn-on was observed in both cell lines because the intracellular lactate amount increased. Our results could provide insights about the application of complex C1 as a metabolic probe to be used in cancer cell imaging.","The authors thank the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID); the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge, and Innovation, Chile; the Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico (VRIDT) of the Universidad Católica del Norte; the Dirección de Investigación y Postgrado of the Universidad Central de Chile; as well as the Instituto de Investigación y Postgrado of the Universidad Central de Chile.","This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) (by projects Fondequip grant EQM120095; CONICYT grant 21180850 (N.N.); Fondecyt Postdoctorado grant 3200787 (V.A.); Convocatoria Nacional Subvención a Instalación en la Academia Convocatoria año 2021 Folio SA77210078 (M.M.); Becas Chile Scholarship for Doctoral studies 72220004 (M.R.-J.); and Fondecyt Iniciación grant 11220983 (M.S.)); the Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico (VRIDT) of the Universidad Católica del Norte (grant VRIDT UCN 20210401007 (C.C.)); and the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge, and Innovation, Chile, by Millennium Scientific Initiative NCN19_038, MiNuSPain (C.C.).

A non-experimental cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered survey to a sample of 396 teleworkers in Lima, Peru. The hypothesized model was analyzed using PLS-SEM based structural equation modeling. The results show that FSSB has a direct effect on both job satisfaction in remote work and WFPS and WLB. In addition, it shows that WFPS and WLB have positive effects on job satisfaction in remote work. Also, the results show that WFPS and WLB have a mediating role in the influence of FSSB on job satisfaction in remote work. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of supervisor behavior, positive work-to-family spillover, and work-life balance in remote workers' job satisfaction.

We study the conditions of the media’s proximity communication of the triple border: Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The methodology consists of a bibliographic review on the subject. The study utilizes a theoretical approach considering extracts of official documents of the three states, as well as literature on the subject of mediatization and proximity communications. The analysis of the role of the media in democratization and the development of local cohesion considers its ability to overcome the concept of the border as a space of flows in favor of a space of places. We hypothesize that the understanding of proximity communication exercises the integration mandate by tensioning the dimensions of cross-border cultural identity under construction with the securitizing dimension. The results find that the ecology of the local media supports mediatized actualization of cross-border cultural identity; simultaneously, it reiterates securitizing meanings.

The main results of the research show that dialogical education broadens its horizon from the Socratic assumptions of maieutic in two aspects: in the first place, maieutic invites to recover the question and the ability to ask oneself, and, secondly, it demonstrates that knowledge, to be significant, must be a conquest and discovery of the student himself mediated by dialogue with himself, with others and with the other.",,,Sophía,,,,2023-07-14,2023,2023-07-14,,,35,73-96,All OA; Gold,Article,"González, Carlos Alberto Vargas; Carvajal, Dora Patricia Quintero","González, Carlos Alberto Vargas (Universidad de Medellín); Carvajal, Dora Patricia Quintero (Universidad de Medellín)",,"González, Carlos Alberto Vargas (Universidad de Medellín); Carvajal, Dora Patricia Quintero (Universidad de Medellín)",0,0,,,https://sophia.ups.edu.ec/index.php/sophia/article/download/6826/6883,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160720471,39 Education; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,4 Quality Education

Companies may significantly benefit from social media management, which highlights the significance of responsible consumerism highlighted in SDG 12. This study analyzed the relationship of the level of engagement of leading US e-commerce companies according to their position in the financial market through the use of Twitter. The methodology was a quantitative and longitudinal approach, analyzing statistically (through statistical analysis to descriptive statistics, multiple and simple regressions). The 22,400 tweets during 2020, to estimate their engagement. The results showed that the level of engagement on Twitter is not directly related to the financial ranking, neither to its sales nor to the share price.

Average litter abundance on the Caribbean Sea beaches (1.42 items/m2–12.21 g/m2) and in mangrove forests (1.29 items/m2–28.72 g/m2) were greater than that of the Pacific Ocean beaches (0 items/m2–0 g/m2) and mangrove forests (1.13 items/m2–79.41 g/m2). The most abundant litter material was plastic, which represented 93.61% of the total litter content. According to the Clean Coast Index, the sites analyzed in the Caribbean Sea were “Moderate” to “Extremely Dirty”, while those in the Pacific Ocean were “Clean” to “Moderate Dirty”. The Magdalena River is considered the main source of litter on the Caribbean Sea coast, while on the Pacific Ocean coast, litter is essentially associated with the mismanagement of solid wastes.

This article addresses the required phase synchronization to enable precoding techniques in multibeam satellite systems. It contains the detailed design of a frequency and phase compensation loop based on the proportional-integral controller, which deals with the phase drift introduced by the hardware components. Specifically, the phase noise of the local oscillators used for up and down conversion at each system element (gateway, satellite, and user terminals). The implementation of the two-state phase noise model used to emulate this phase drift is included in the article. Besides, a comparative analysis of several methods to combine the frequency and phase measurements obtained from the user terminals is also included. Finally, the performance of the proposed closed-loop synchronization method is validated through simulations using our in-house developed MIMO end-to-end satellite emulator based on SDR platforms.","For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CCBY4.0) license to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.

The identification of the infecting microorganisms is generally by culture, which causes a bias. Recently, metagenomics has been used for microbial identification.
AIM: To systematically review the scientific literature related to DFO in the last 10 years to evaluate if culture and metagenomics are complementary.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To carry out the systematic review, PRISMA and Rayyan were used for the selection of studies, using three databases, using the keywords diabetes, osteomyelitis, culture and microbiome. Articles in English or Spanish were included, containing information related to bacterial identification in DFO. Characteristics of the technique, patients and frequency of bacterial appearance were collected.
RESULTS: Twenty six articles were included, 19 used culture and 7 metagenomics. The patients were predominantly men (68%), with an average age of 61 years, 83% had type 2 diabetes and comorbidities, mainly vascular and neuropathy. The Families with the highest frequency of appearance using the culture technique were Enterobacteriaceae (29.3%) and Staphylococcaceae(28.3%) and with metagenomics Peptoniphilaceae (22.1%) and Staphylococcaceae (9.4%). Peptoniphilaceae were not identified in culture, although they were frequently identified by metagenomics.

Fish is also very susceptible to spoilage and contamination by microorganisms throughout the food chain, which may be part of the usual microbiota or incorporated into food derived from inadequate hygiene practices in the food industry. Fish has been associated worldwide with disease outbreaks derived from consumption, where various bacteria and/or metabolites (biogenic amines) are some of the main casual agents. Citrobacter sp. is considered a pathogen in fish, as well as in humans, derived from the consumption of contaminated food, generating infections or histamine poisoning as it is part of the generating microbiota. Therefore, the objective of this document is to provide information on Citrobacter sp. through a general perspective on animal health and the safety of fish and fish products.

Since its isolation in the last century, AsA has attracted the attention of the scientific community, allowing the discovery of the L-galactose pathway, which is the main pathway for AsA biosynthesis in plants. Thus, the aim of this review is to analyze the genetic and biochemical strategies employed by plant cells for regulating AsA biosynthesis through the L-galactose pathway. In this pathway, participates eight enzymes encoded by the genes PMI, PMM, GMP, GME, GGP, GPP, GDH, and GLDH. All these genes and their encoded enzymes have been well characterized, demonstrating their participation in AsA biosynthesis. Also, have described some genetic and biochemical strategies that allow its regulation. The genetic strategy includes regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In the first one, it was demonstrated that the expression levels of the genes correlate directly with AsA content in the tissues/organs of the plants. Also, it was proved that these genes are light-induced because they have light-responsive promoter motifs (e.g., ATC, I-box, GT1 motif, etc.). In addition, were identified some transcription factors that function as activators (e.g., SlICE1, AtERF98, SlHZ24, etc.) or inactivators (e.g., SlL1L4, ABI4, SlNYYA10) regulate the transcription of these genes. In the second one, it was proved that some genes have alternative splicing events and could be a mechanism to control AsA biosynthesis. Also, it was demonstrated that a conserved cis-acting upstream open reading frame (5'-uORF) located in the 5'-untranslated region of the GGP gene induces its post-transcriptional repression. Among the biochemical strategies discovered is the control of the enzyme levels (usually by decreasing their quantities), control of the enzyme catalytic activity (by increasing or decreasing its activity), feedback inhibition of some enzymes (GME and GGP), subcellular compartmentation of AsA, the metabolon assembly of the enzymes, and control of AsA biosynthesis by electron flow. Together, the construction of this basic knowledge has been establishing the foundations for generating genetically improved varieties of fruits and vegetables enriched with AsA, commonly used in animal and human feed.","The authors are grateful to authorities and administrative-technical staff of the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (UNAP) for providing us with facilities, acceding to the laboratories, and their permanent support during the realization of the present investigation.

Two different waste/Portland-cement ratios (7.5/92.5 and 80/20) were studied. Density and compressive strength decreased when different wastes were added in every proportion. Additions of 7.5% of both shells reduce the density to about 2.5% and the compressive strength to 20%, while 80% reduces the density to 20% and the compressive strength to 90%, while the addition of biomass fly ash decreases the density and compressive strength in a higher proportion than shells. The durability against acid attack is increased when the three wastes are used, and this increase is higher when the waste dosage is increased (up to 15 times more when 80% biomass ash is used). With respect to leaching, scallop and eggshells can be used as a component of hydraulic road binder, but olive pomace ash presents leaching values higher than the limits of different regulations (Se, Pb, Ni, Mo, Cu, and As).

While some studies show a positive correlation between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship, others confirm contradictory results. To contribute to the understanding of the relationship between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention and to contribute to the literature on this topic in Latin America, this research aimed to determine the influence of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial intention of students from five Latin American universities. The type of research is quantitative, cross-sectional, and explanatory. To carry out the study, a questionnaire was applied to 1213 students from five universities in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. The sample size was determined with a probabilistic design, and the sample was collected randomly by convenience. The Chi-square test showed a p-value of 0.056 higher than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis indicating that entrepreneurship education is independent of entrepreneurial intention was accepted. Practical and theoretical implications emerge from these findings. While acknowledging the importance of entrepreneurship education, it becomes apparent that supplementary mechanisms enhancing entrepreneurial intentions are essential. The absence of a definitive consensus on the connection between entrepreneurial education and intent emphasizes the need for further exploration.","We thank the Universidad Privada del Norte for the support in the translation process.

392,pub.1158260487,10.17159/tl.v60i2.13893,,,Alienation in Ntshavheni Alfred Milubi’s poetry,"In this article, I analyse the thematization of alienation in the poetry of the Muvenḓa poet, playwright, and scholar Ntshavheni Alfred Milubi. Milubi ascribes people’s abandonment of moral values to their perpetual frustrations, herein described as alienation. Reference is made to the crumbling African traditional institutions, which, in the past, seemingly functioned as havens for the rehabilitation of alienated individuals in African communities. These institutions are shown to be triggering alienation in the modernising and globalising space, seemingly with no room for recuperation unless one heeds the poet’s clarion calls. I restrict my analysis of Milubi’s poetry only to social and cosmic alienation, guided by a fixed set of themes, namely, from society, a romantic lover, and God, respectively. The article represents the idea that African-language literatures provide insights into how the indigenes have grappled with the interface between tradition and modernity. The three forms of alienation as treated by Milubi serve as a representative sample of how Tshivenḓa poetry in particular and African-language literatures in general often register subaltern voices and the ways in which they inscribe their experiences to explain their relationship with God or god(s), society, and intimate partners, among others.

Given this situation, it is worth highlighting the importance of promoting digital literacy to actively participate in the society in which it develops. This work analyzes the level of mastery of digital skills of the university students in Ecuador. To do this, a descriptive methodology has been used, based on the survey technique, based on a questionnaire (n = 778).

It contains high concentrations of hazardous heavy metals, such as lead, zinc, aluminum, and iron. Methodology: In this study, bioleaching integrated with an electrokinetic approach for heavy metal remediation from MSW incineration fly ash using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bacteria was tested. Results and discussion: The physicochemical properties of fly ash included a particle size of 26.1 μm, with the presence of heavy metals. A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans produced sulphuric acid (0.0289 M and 0.0352 M) during the proliferation; this acid enhances the bioleaching of heavy metals from fly ash. The results of an integrated approach showed an 85%, 47%, 92%, 85%, 46%, 67% 11%, and 55% removal of the heavy metals K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Zn, Pb, and Mg, respectively, in the presence of A. ferrooxidans. Overall, these results evidenced that heavy metals were completely removed from the fly ash using an integrated approach. Therefore, this integrated approach can be used as an effective heavy metal removal method for treating fly ash in MSW.","The authors acknowledge Researchers Supporting Project (RSP 2023R465), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research.

Metabolic phenotypes might offer a more precise tool for identifying patients at higher risk of diabetes, thus enabling more effective and targeted preventive interventions. Objective To determine the association between these metabolic phenotypes and the risk of diabetes. Materials Systematic Review (SR) with a meta-analysis of cohort studies. The search was carried out in four databases: Pubmed/Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Metabolic states were classified into six groups: Metabolically Healthy Normal Weight (MHNW), Metabolically Unhealthy Normal Weight (MUNW), Metabolically Healthy Overweight (MHOW), Metabolically Unhealthy Overweight (MUOW), Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO), and Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity (MUO). Association measures were presented as odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) along with their 95 % confidence intervals (CI95%). Results A total of six studies were evaluated. For the meta-analysis, only studies using OR as the measure of association were included. Compared with individuals with MHNW, a statistically significant association was found for MUNW (OR: 1.82; CI95% 1.62, 2.04), MHOW (OR: 1.19; CI95% 1.07, 1.32), MUOW (OR: 2.44; CI95% 2.19, 2.72), MHO (OR: 2.14; CI95% 1.52, 3.01), and MUO (OR: 3.94; CI95% 3.28, 4.74).

In this sense, the objective of this research is to analyze the actions of corporate social responsibility implemented in the banking sector in Latin America and the Caribbean, taking Bancolombia, Banco de Crédito e Inversiones, and Banco General as a reference. The methodology used was qualitative, cross-sectional, and non-experimental. This was carried out based on a documentary analysis of the annual reports of the aforementioned companies, ranked in the top CSR positions, according to the Merco Ranking. As a result, it was determined that the companies most predominantly carry out social responsibility actions based on the internal dimension, with 26% regarding the adoption of equitable salaries and 28% regarding the quality of the job. On the other hand, the external dimension shows that 25% of corporate actions emphasize the potential for responsible investment. Finally, it was found that the CSR actions and resources allocated by the aforementioned banks in 2021 were used for business sustainability, seen from the promotion of employee stability and satisfaction in the company, as well as responsible investment, evaluating the social, economic, and environmental impact. In this sense, CSR activities that have an impact on an external context stand out with greater importance despite the percentage differences between dimensions, since their impact is identified from the investment in employee training and development programs; the contributions to local and regional economic development based on job creation, as well as the reduction of polluting gas emissions, conversation and environmental education.",,,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,,,,2023-08-14,2023,2023-08-14,,10,1,503,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mesta-Cabrejos, Valeria Fernanda; Huertas-Vilca, Karla Stefanny; Wong-Aitken, Higinio Guillerno; Cordova-Buiza, Franklin","Mesta-Cabrejos, Valeria Fernanda (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Huertas-Vilca, Karla Stefanny (Universidad Privada del Norte, Trujillo, Peru); Wong-Aitken, Higinio Guillerno (Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Research, Innovation and Social Responsibility Department, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru; Faculty of Business Sciences, Universidad Continental, Huancayo, Peru)","Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Private University of the North; Universidad Continental)","Mesta-Cabrejos, Valeria Fernanda (Private University of the North); Huertas-Vilca, Karla Stefanny (Private University of the North); Wong-Aitken, Higinio Guillerno (Private University of the North); Cordova-Buiza, Franklin (Private University of the North; Universidad Continental)",2,2,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01950-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163266335,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

In this study, we investigated the diversity, composition and functional prediction of microbiota of reared Seriolella violacea (palm ruff) in the same cohort sampled at different times (7-, 8- and 9-month-old). Microbial community structure analyses, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, revealed that the intestinal microbiota was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Tenericutes. At the genus level, Candidatus Arthromitus was the most abundant in all sampled timepoints, representing in average 78% of the bacterial community (ranging from 18 to 98%), corresponding to segmented filamentous bacteria, which are interesting because they have been associated with the maturation of immune responses in the gut and protecting the host from bacterial infections. The comparisons of the intestinal microbiota among the three groups showed differences in abundance of bacterial taxa and also in alpha diversity indexes (Shannon and Simpson), as well as beta diversity metrics (weighted and unweighted UniFrac). Potential functions of the intestinal microbiota of palm ruff were retrieved using Philipin and Tax4fun and these analyses revealed high levels of genes for sugar metabolism.

This study aimed to develop and validate a short scale that measures academic co-creation (AC-S) in a sample of higher education students. A total of 3,169 students from three Peruvian cities participated in the study (Mean Age = 25.77 years old; SD = 8.92 years); 1889 were female (59.60%) and 1,280 (40.40%) males. Qualitative and quantitative procedures were used for test construction. Item response theory (IRT) under the two-parameter graded response model (GRM-2PL) and test information function were used to examine reliability; additionally, a brief measure of academic satisfaction was used to provide evidence of relationship with another variable. The AC-S displayed strong fit and reliability, assessed through the test information function and standard error. It also showed a moderate correlation with academic satisfaction, bolstering its validity by linking with a pertinent variable. Its brevity enhances its practicality for education and research, efficiently fitting explanatory models and educational contexts. Despite substantial sample size and advanced psychometric methods, the study acknowledges limitations in sample representativeness and cross-sectional design. In conclusion, IRT and SEM techniques compellingly support the AC-S’s reliability and validity. The scale’s one-dimensionality, local independence, reliability, and academic satisfaction relationship form a foundation for future exploration of co-creation-based educational models.

In the first class of theories, we show that by choosing particular models with a shift-symmetric friction term we are able to alleviate the tension by obtaining a smaller effective Newton’s constant at intermediate times, a feature that cannot be easily obtained in modified gravity. In the second class of theories, which involve two extra propagating degrees of freedom, we show that the H0 tension can be alleviated, and the mechanism behind this is the phantom behavior of the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter.

However, improving the method of ""Broodstock Conditioning In Hatcheries"" is key to ensure permanent seed supplies by minimizing the dependence on marine conditions and by maximizing economic viability in hatcheries. In an effort to overcome these barriers, broodstock were conditioned into two different environments: (a) Natural Environment: Natural marine conditions located in Bahía Inglesa, Atacama Region, Chile. (b) Hatchery: Laboratory conditions to achieve gonadal maturation, spawning induction, fertilization and larval development. The purpose of this research was to evaluate how the type of reproductive conditioning affects the reproductive potential and nutritional quality of the progeny. Both methods were successful at inducing the necessary maturity for reproduction, obtaining viable gametes and larvae. On the other hand, it was observed that in the natural environment, the oocytes and D larvae reached a greater size and nutritional value, being the most significant differences with (p < 0.05): the size of the D larvae reached figures of 95.8 ± 3.1 μm and 91.2 ± 2.7 μm in the environment and hatchery, respectively; the lipid content in dry mass was 25.2 ± 3.1 mg g−1 and 13.5 ± 1.9 mg g−1 for the natural environment and hatchery, respectively. Although quality indicators in hatcheries were slightly lower compared to the natural environment, the possibility of conditioning A. purpuratus broodstock independently of environmental variability highlights the importance of further optimizing broodstock conditioning aspects in hatcheries that would allow more predictable and sustainable production.",The author is extremely grateful to Carlos Gonzalez Allende for his technical assistance.,"This research was funded by the National University of Centro de Investigaciones Costeras, Universidad de Atacama, Chile, and Centro de Innovación Acuícola Aqua Pacífico, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo (Directoral Resolution Nº. 953-2022).

245,pub.1165303260,10.3390/fire6110416,,,The Incorporation of Ladle Furnace Slag in Fire Insulating Gypsum-Based Materials,"Ladle slag, a byproduct of steel manufacturing, exhibits inherent reactivity and undergoes hydration when exposed to water. Nevertheless, these reaction byproducts often remain metastable, leading to microstructural alterations when incorporated into cementitious materials, thereby limiting the recycling potential of ladle slag. This study explores the fire insulating capacity and the physical, mechanical, and leaching characteristics of gypsum-based materials with substantial quantities of ladle slag in instead of gypsum. The mechanical strength of the specimens declines as the ladle slag content increases. Nevertheless, the percentage decrease in compressive strength at various temperatures (300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C) is less pronounced when higher amounts of ladle slag are used. Fire-resistant properties, assessed using the EN 1363-1 standards, diminish with increasing slag proportions; although the inclusion of ladle slag introduces certain endothermic processes that positively affect the fire insulating capacity, resulting in a 20% reduction when 60%wt of slag is employed. Notably, no gas emissions were observed during the fire test, indicating the absence of environmental hazards. In conclusion, ladle slag does not pose a leaching threat to the environment, making it a viable and sustainable alternative to gypsum in gypsum-based materials.",,This research was funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain under project number PID2019-110928RB-C33.,Fire,,,,2023-10-27,2023,2023-10-27,,6,11,416,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peceño, Begoña; Pérez-Soriano, Eva M.; Luna-Galiano, Yolanda; Leiva, Carlos","Peceño, Begoña (Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, begopc@ucl.cl); Pérez-Soriano, Eva M.

In particular, we consider two scalar fields with interaction in scalar-torsion theory. The field equations have a minisuperspace description, and the evolution of the physical variables depends on the potential function that drives the scalar fields’ dynamics. With the requirement for the field equations to admit non-trivial Noether point symmetries and the use of the first theorem of Noether, we constrain all the functional forms for the potential. Finally, we apply symmetry vectors and the corresponding conservation laws to determine exact and analytic solutions in multiscalar-torsion cosmology.","The work was supported by Nazarbayev University Faculty Development Competitive Research Grantno. 11022021FD2926 and by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) under the “First Call for HFRI Research Projects to support Faculty members and Researchers and the procurement of high-cost research equipment grant” (Project number: 2251).

Despite the studies that have been carried out on the basis of documents and some eventual archaeological excavations, the port’s main monument, namely, the Real Felipe Fortress, continues to hide very important information that could be used to understand the role that the fortress played in numerous historical events throughout the centuries. The main contribution of this study is the use of photogrammetry software and a Geographic Information System (GIS) to examine the Real Felipe Fortress. In this way, the nature of the atypical construction within the fortress is determined. As a result, it is possible to accurately establish the location of the defensive wall that surrounded the ancient city of Callao, as well as its first churches, whose records were lost after being destroyed by the 1746 earthquake and tsunami in Lima, the worst cataclysm registered in the history of Peru and South America. As a result, this study demonstrates that technology can be successfully used to establish and validate with great precision the existence of the location of churches that have been built in the port of Callao since the founding of Lima in the 16th century. Such identification allows architects, engineers and students who are interested in the history of monuments to discover hidden structures and buildings and carry out the necessary restoration and archaeological works, with the aim of recovering the history of the colonial architecture of Callao and other similar cities and ports worldwide.",The authors thank the Universidad Privada del Norte for its support and guidance in the development of this research work.

An important implication of such stringy effects is that they can alleviate the initial singularity since the Raychaudhuri equation is modified. We investigate if the Universe can undergo an accelerated expansion phase for a specific domain of the equation of state parameter. The stringy effects are encoded in the parameter Γ, which depends not only on the zero-point length but also on the state parameter ω. We construct two dynamical systems depending on whether − 1 < ω ≤ − 1 / 3 and ω ≥ − 1 / 3 , and we classify the equilibrium points of each system.

The controller is based on the sliding mode and internal model control concepts. The proposed DSMC has an internal P/PD controller to provide systems with disturbance rejection. An identification method approximates the open-loop unstable nonlinear process to a first-order delayed unstable process (FODUP). The reduced-order model(FODUP) is used to synthesize the new controller. The performance of the controller is stable and satisfactory despite nonlinearities in the operating conditions due to set-point and process disturbance changes. In addition, the performance analysis of the control schemes was evaluated based on various indices and transient characteristics, including the integral of squared error (ISE), the total variation of control effort (TVu), the maximum overshoot (Mp), and the settling time (ts). Finally, the process output and the control action for all controllers are compared using the nonlinear process as the real plant.","The authors thank the USFQ Advanced Control Systems Research Group, Quito, Ecuador.","This research was supported by the Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenieras, Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, through the Poli-Grants Program under Grant 17965.",ChemEngineering,,,,2023-06-02,2023,2023-06-02,,7,3,53,All OA; Gold,Article,"Camacho, Christian; Alvarez, Hernan; Espin, Jorge; Camacho, Oscar","Camacho, Christian (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Alvarez, Hernan (Departamento de Procesos y Energía, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Medellín 050041, Colombia); Espin, Jorge (School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA); Camacho, Oscar (Colegio de Ciencias e Ingenierias, Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, Quito 170157, Ecuador)","Camacho, Oscar (Universidad San Francisco de Quito)","Camacho, Christian (Catholic University of the North); Alvarez, Hernan (National University of Colombia); Espin, Jorge (University of Oklahoma); Camacho, Oscar (Universidad San Francisco de Quito)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2305-7084/7/3/53/pdf?version=1685684383,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158592677,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",
238,pub.1154827065,10.3389/fmats.2022.1074738,,,Application of paper sludge ash and incinerated sewage ash in emulsified asphalt cold mixtures,"Certain disadvantages could have appeared while using hot mix asphalt (HMA), such as the release of unhealthy gases into the environment (environmental issues), difficulty in sustaining the temperature over long distances (logistical issues), and consuming a sufficient amount of energy while preparing and laying down (practical and economic issues). To overcome the aforementioned issues, this study aimed to develop rapid-curing emulsified asphalt cold mixes (EACM) comprising a cementitious filler made from industrial by-product materials. Paper sludge ash (PSA) is used as an active filler for application in the EACM rather than conventional mineral filler. Additionally, to maximize the effect of PSA’s hydraulic activity, incinerated sewage ash (ISA) is utilized as an activator at a concentration of 0%–4% by mass of the aggregates. The results demonstrate that the use of waste PSA significantly improves the indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM) by around 10 times more after 2 days than the traditional emulsified asphalt cold mixes. In addition, the improvement in ITSM was around 30% and 65% for 6%PSA+1%ISA and 6%PSA+4%ISA mixes, respectively. Furthermore, the rutting for the 6%PSA+1%ISA and 6%PSA+4%ISA mixes decreased to around 19% and 11% in comparison to the traditional 131-pen HMA. The formation of hydration products and rapid demulsification of asphalt emulsion, which results in binding within the mixtures, are responsible for the increased ITSM and rutting resistance. As a result, environmental issues are minimized, and energy preservation may be maintained.","The authors extend their thanks to the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation and University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa, Iraq for financial support for this study.",The research is partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under the strategic academic leadership program “Priority 2030” (Agreement 075-15-2021-1333 dated 30 September 2021).,Frontiers in Materials,,,,2023-01-25,2023,2023-01-25,,9,,1074738,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dulaimi, Anmar; Qaidi, Shaker; Al-Busaltan, Shakir; Milad, Abdalrhman; Sadique, Monower; Kadhim, Mustafa Amoori; Al-Khafaji, Ruqayah; Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri","Dulaimi, Anmar (College of Engineering, University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa, Ministry of Education, Karbala, Iraq; School of Civil Engineering and Built Environment, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom); Qaidi, Shaker (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Duhok, Duhok, Iraq; Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, Nawroz University, Duhok, Iraq); Al-Busaltan, Shakir (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Kerbala, Karbala, Iraq); Milad, Abdalrhman (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Nizwa, Nizwa, Ad-Dakhliyah, Oman); Sadique, Monower (School of Civil Engineering and Built Environment, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom); Kadhim, Mustafa Amoori (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Kerbala, Karbala, Iraq); Al-Khafaji, Ruqayah (Department of Building and Construction Technologies Engineering, Al-Mustaqbal University College, Babylon, Iraq); Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia)","Dulaimi, Anmar (University of Warith Alanbiyaa; Liverpool John Moores University)","Dulaimi, Anmar (University of Warith Alanbiyaa; Liverpool John Moores University); Qaidi, Shaker (University of Duhok; Nawroz University); Al-Busaltan, Shakir (University of Karbala); Milad, Abdalrhman (University of Nizwa); Sadique, Monower (Liverpool John Moores University); Kadhim, Mustafa Amoori (University of Karbala); Al-Khafaji, Ruqayah (Al-Mustaqbal University College); Sabri, Mohanad Muayad Sabri (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University)",10,10,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmats.2022.1074738/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154827065,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This study aims to investigate forms of concentration, such as the communicational flow of digital media, to determine the opportunities and information defects of these media due to regulatory deficiencies in this sector. Data collection was carried out through a qualitative and quantitative methodology. The prospect of the imminent constituent process in Chile provides the opportunity to evaluate possibilities and propose changes not only at the legislative level but also at the constitutional level, which are likely to provide benefits such as freedom of expression, with greater guarantees toward the pluralism of digital media.

In this sense, environmental performance is now included as a competitive priority throughout the supply chain. Therefore, this study aims to verify, through two case studies, the competitive priorities of two first-tier suppliers from the automotive chain that have adopted lean and green practices. The findings show that the quality priority is the main source of competitive advantage and the focus of the operations that are analyzed here, while the environmental priority is not considered the most important by the companies. However, it is still included as a priority. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that lean practices could generate compatibility for the environmental priority, even indirectly, while trade-offs can arise between priorities. Therefore, the integration between lean and green practices can facilitate the inclusion of the environmental priority into the operations strategy and management systems.",,This research received no external funding.,Machines,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,,11,1,50,All OA; Gold,Article,"Queiroz, Geandra Alves; Filho, Alceu Gomes Alves; Melo, Isotilia Costa","Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Engineering Department, Production Engineering, Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais (UEMG), Passos 37900-106, Minas-Gerais, Brazil); Filho, Alceu Gomes Alves (Industrial Engineering Department, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos 13565-905, São Paulo, Brazil); Melo, Isotilia Costa (Escuela de Ingeniería de Coquimbo (EIC), Universidad Católica del Norte (UCN), Coquimbo 25803-35, Chile)","Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Minas Gerais State University)","Queiroz, Geandra Alves (Minas Gerais State University); Filho, Alceu Gomes Alves (Federal University of São Carlos); Melo, Isotilia Costa (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/11/1/50/pdf?version=1672587078,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154188415,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

In this context, microbial fuel cells (MFC) are one of the emerging technologies with great potential for eco-friendly energy generation; however, the correct choice of electrode material is a significant limitation in the optimal configuration of MFCs. Therefore, this research evaluated the efficiency of activated carbon (AC) anode electrodes for bioenergy production in MFC using synthetic wastewater as a substrate. Peak values of voltage (1120 ± 0.050 mV), current (4.64 ± 0.040 mA), power density (208.14 ± 17.15 mW/cm2), and current density (5.03 A/cm2) were generated, and the Rint obtained was 214.52 ± 5.22 Ω. The substrate was operated at pH values from 5.31 to 7.66, maximum ORP values (858 mV) were reached, and turbidity was reduced to 25.11 NTU. The SEM-EDS (scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analyses allowed us to observe the morphology and composition of the AC electrodes, revealing a predominance of O, C, Si, Al, Fe, K, and Ca.

225,pub.1155923045,10.5194/nhess-23-991-2023,,,Multi-station automatic classification of seismic signatures from the Lascar volcano database,"Abstract. This study was aimed to build a multi-station automatic classification system for volcanic seismic signatures such as hybrid, long period, tremor, tectonic, and volcano–tectonic events. This system was based on a probabilistic model made using transfer learning, which has, as the main tool, a pre-trained convolutional network named AlexNet. We designed five experiments using different datasets with data that were real, synthetic, two different combinations of these (combined 1 and combined 2), and a balanced subset without synthetic data. The experiment presented the highest scores when a process of data augmentation was introduced into processing sequence. Thus, the lack of real data in some classes (imbalance) dramatically affected the quality of the results, because the learning step (training) was overfitted to the more numerous classes. To test the model stability with variable inputs, we implemented a k-fold cross-validation procedure. Under this approach, the results reached high predictive performance, considering that only the percentage of recognition of the tectonic events (TC) class was partially affected. The results obtained showed the performance of the probabilistic model, reaching high scores over different test datasets. The most valuable benefit of using this technique was that the use of volcano seismic signals from multiple stations provided a more generalizable model which, in the near future, can be extended to multi-volcano database systems. The impact of this work is significant in the evaluation of hazard and risk by monitoring the dynamic evolution of volcanic centers, which is crucial for understanding the stages in a volcano’s eruptive cycle.","We express our acknowledgements to the CKELAR-VOLCANES team – Gabriel Ureta, Javier Valdés, Christian Ibaceta, Felipe Aguilera, Felipe Rojas, Diego Jaldín, Álvaro Vergara, Alfredo Esquivel, José Pablo Sepúlveda, Manuel Inostroza and Cristóbal González – and to Greg Wait for his priceless course of training in volcanic signals.","Financial support This research has been supported by ANID/FONDECYT-INICIACIÓN (grant no. 11190190); the Antofagasta regional government, FIC-R project, code BIP (grant no. 30488832-0); the Millennium Institute on Volcanic Risk Research – Ckelar Volcanoes ANID/MILENIO (grant no.

An Empirical Study in the Financial Sector,"Digital transformation has become a notorious topic in the financial sector, as its implementation brings about a positive change in the user experience. Its relevance is seen in how scientists study it from different points of view, while it attracts the interest of financial institutions, as the understanding resulting from the research can improve the implementation of plans in the new digital era. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the impact of digital transformation on consumer behaviour in the financial sector. A quantitative explanatory level approach was used. The study population was finite, consisting of bank customers, considering a simple random probability sample of 385. The technique used was the survey and a questionnaire as a validated and reliable instrument. Digital transformation has been shown to have a significant impact on consumer behaviour in the financial sector, tested by Chi-square and ordinal logistic regression (χ2 = 0.000 < 0.05; Wald coefficient = 29.162 = 0.000; Nagelkerke’s R2 = 0.381), confirming that consumer behaviour is driven by digitisation activities.

For a school citizen science program to be successful, an adequate communication strategy needs to achieve a balance between learning objectives and the generation of scientific knowledge. In this community case study, we report on the communication strategies of an international network, namely, the citizen science program Científicos de la Basura (Litter Scientists), which collaborates with schoolteachers and schoolchildren to investigate anthropogenic litter on marine beaches and in rivers. The program has been active in Chile since 2007, and as of 2018, it had expanded to the 11 countries from the central and southern East Pacific. More than 40 teachers and collaborators from these countries work in this network making an effort to connect the research activities with the learning objectives of the school curriculum. The communication between the coordination team and the teachers includes three main elements (1 - design and planning; 2 - training and research; 3 - evaluation and sharing), with the following activities: (1a) regular internal communication within the coordination team to design, motivate and supervise adequate research projects, (1b) communication with teachers to design appropriate learning materials (co-creation) and get their feedback on the planned research activities, (2a) sharing the final research plan and transfer methodological skills through regular training of the teachers, (2b) responding to methodological questions by the teachers about the sampling, and coordinate data collection and validation, (3a) guiding teachers and schoolchildren in the evaluation and interpretation of their research results, and (3b) encouraging teachers and schoolchildren to communicate their scientific findings to the wider community. Intense internal communication and regular exchange with teachers guarantees successful learning and rigorous scientific information. The main challenges for the program are team capacity, socio-economic stability, internet access, and teachers’ workloads. Recommendations to achieve successful communication and good science are efficient team communication skills, customized contacts, collaborative work, guidance of field work, feedback from participants, and promoting the sense of community.",Foremost we would like to thank the teachers who are the pillars of our network.

These reefs are unique since they have developed near a coastal environment that is directly influenced by the discharges of Veracruz city, the rivers located on the continental shelf, and the port of Veracruz. This study evaluates the functional diversity, in terms of richness, evenness, and divergence, of the PNSAV fish community. We were interested in quantifying any similarities or differences in functional diversity metrics when one examines reef fish assemblages on a single reef or joint reef subsystems; thus, is there a difference based on scale? A total of 297 fish assemblages were observed in seven PNSAV reefs between May 2006 and April 2021. Significant differences were found in the Functional Richness of the assemblages between subsystems, years, and reef-depth interaction, but none were found among the reefs, or between seascapes. The Functional Diversity presented annual mean values between 0.83 (sd= 0.085) and 0.90 (sd= 0.068) and did not show statistical differences between years, seascape, or reefs. In contrast, statistical differences were found between subsystems, and depth level and the seascape-depth interaction. The annual mean Functional Evenness values ranged between 0.34 (sd= 0.128) and 0.44 (sd= 0.060), and significant differences were detected between years, reef, and reefs-depth level interaction, but no difference were found between subsystems. Reef-fish diversity was greater within the north coral reef subsystem than the southern of the PNSAV. There were no overall tendencies for increased functional diversity throughout the time during this study.",GD-A and VC-E were supported by the programs of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional: Estímulo al Desempeño de los Investigadores (EDI) and Comisión de Operación y Fomento de Actividades Académicas (COFAA).

203,pub.1156238284,10.3390/forensicsci3010012,,,The Effects of Physiological Stress on the Accuracy of Age-at-Death Estimation in The Hamann–Todd Collection,"Age-at-death estimation is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Physiological stress is intertwined with these factors, yet their impact on senescence and age estimation is unknown. Stature, linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), and antemortem tooth loss (AMTL) in the Hamann–Todd Osteological Collection (n = 297) are used to understand whether physiological stress is related to age estimation inaccuracy using transition analysis (TA). Considering the low socioeconomic status of individuals in the collection, it was expected that many people experienced moderate to severe physiological stressors throughout their lives. Of the sample, 44.1% had at least one LEH, but analyses found no relationship between LEH incidence and TA error. There was no association between stature and TA error for males or females. However, females with at least one LEH had significantly shorter statures (t = 2.412, p = 0.009), but males did not exhibit the same pattern (t = 1.498, p = 0.068). Further, AMTL frequency and TA error were related (r = 0.276, p < 0.001). A partial correlation controlling for age-at-death yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.024 (p = 0.684), suggesting that this relationship is mostly explained by age-at-death. These data suggest that age estimation methods are not significantly affected by physiological stress in this sample, but further investigations are needed to understand how these variables relate to skeletal aging.",The authors would like to thank Luis Cabo-Perez for his contributions to the data analyses presented in this study.,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Forensic Sciences,,,,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,,3,1,149-168,All OA; Gold,Article,"Simon, Allyson M.; Cheverko, Colleen M.; Clark, Melissa A.; Mellendorf, Tempest D.; Hubbe, Mark","Simon, Allyson M.

The main goal of this study is to carry out a mining approach of the prospective areas of Colombia with strategic minerals for energy transition and climate change, analyzing the geospatial location, mining rights, mineral extraction, and royalty collection. Open data from SGC, ANM, and SIMCO geoportals were consulted. The prospective areas totaled 311,535.2 km2, equivalent to 27.3% of Colombia, and were located mainly in the Andes Mountains. The total area of mining rights and applications with strategic minerals for the energy transition is 112,802.2 km2 or 9.9% of Colombia, representing 5731 rights and 3939 applications. From 2012 to 2023, 448,330 tons of nickel, 172.9 tons of silver, and 171.6 tons of copper were mined in Colombia, which has contributed USD 513,140,286 as royalties to the state.

203,pub.1163239026,10.3390/stresses3030041,,,Assessing Combining Abilities of Popcorn Inbred Lines for Agronomic and Root Traits under Contrasting Water Conditions: Towards Developing Drought-Tolerant Genotypes,"Developing popcorn genotypes that are adapted to water-deficit conditions is crucial due to the significant impact of this abiotic stress on grain yield. This study aimed to assess the combining abilities of preselected popcorn lines for agronomic and root traits under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. A circulating diallel analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of the general and specific combining abilities of 10 lines and their respective hybrids for various traits, including productivity, popping expansion, expanded popcorn volume, 100-grain weight, ear length, ear width, support root angle, crown root angle, number of support roots, number of crown roots, density of support roots, and density of crown roots. Non-additive action genes predominantly influenced the agronomic traits under both water conditions. In contrast, the root traits displayed a greater proportion of additive action gene expression under both conditions, despite being significantly affected by the environment. Lines L61, L71, and L76 demonstrated positive and high effects for general combining ability. The hybrids L65/L76, L71/L76, and L61/L75, in addition to exhibiting satisfactory effects of their specific combining ability, also displayed the most favorable phenotypic responses for most agronomic and root traits, making them ideal candidates for inclusion in popcorn breeding programs aiming to develop drought-tolerant genotypes.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the CAPES, FAPERJ, CNPq, and UENF institutions.",This study was financed in part by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brazil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001.,Stresses,,,,2023-08-10,2023,2023-08-10,,3,3,586-604,All OA;

This research aims to study and describe the evolution and origin of EP indicators in Ibero-American countries, given the similarity of their climatic, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics. A review was made using the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis) analytical framework, finding 61 articles, 150 assessments, and 49 indicators and cataloging them considering their evolution, initial (n = 7), expansion (n = 12), and multidimensional (n = 30) stages. The results show a rise in studies in the last five years, particularly in Spain. Most measurements have been used continuously, and often come from the United Kingdom.

This paper proposes a hybrid method that integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with optimized hyperparameters by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for stock pre-selection and a mean–variance with forecasting (MVF) model for portfolio optimization. In the stock pre-selection step, to reduce the computational complexity of the model, the CNN network is trained on the clustered stocks via the K-means method instead of training on each stock. The proposed model also includes a novel feature selection method that weighs features based on their impact on predicting stock returns for more accurate predictions. The results of implementing this model on 21 stocks from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market demonstrate that the proposed method for training the CNN network on clustered stocks does not signicantly differ in prediction accuracy to conventional methods. Moreover, in the portfolio optimization step, the returns predicted in the stock pre-selection step are used to optimize the weight of stocks in the portfolio. Compared to other benchmark models, the proposed model exhibits superior financial performance.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,,,2023-10,2023,,2023-10,35,9,101737,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ashrafzadeh; Taheri, Hasan Mehtari; Gharehgozlou, Mahmoud; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani","Ashrafzadeh (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran); Taheri, Hasan Mehtari (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran); Gharehgozlou, Mahmoud (Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Ashrafzadeh (Amirkabir University of Technology); Taheri, Hasan Mehtari (Amirkabir University of Technology); Gharehgozlou, Mahmoud (Amirkabir University of Technology); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)",9,9,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksuci.2023.101737,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163652617,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

A survey was carried out with specialists that assessed 27 practices (PR) proposed by ISO 56002, considering two types of firms: small and medium-sized industries (SMI) and large industries (LI). The methodological approach included Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to identify the similarities between the specialists and define levels of specialists, as well as Fuzzy TOPSIS and frequency and sensitivity analyses to examine their responses. PR1 (analysis of internal and external issues that impact innovation management) was deemed the best practice for LIs, whereas PR10 (adequate assessment of potential partnerships) was best evaluated for SMIs. The PR27 (periodic audits to identify opportunities for improvement) received the lowest rating from both LIs and SMIs. In general, SMIs in the Brazilian context have more severe deficiencies in terms of applying innovation management practices than LIs. A broad overview of the innovation practices adopted in the Brazilian industrial scenario is provided. The study’s findings may assist managers and policymakers to develop initiatives and actions to improve the capacity of Brazilian industries to innovate.

Based on the information gathered from these experiences, it seeks to advance the discussion on women's participation in STEM focusing on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work). The main difficulties experienced by women in STEM as discussed in the academic literature were mapped. This provided input to develop a questionnaire containing qualitative and quantitative questions used to conduct interviews with women working in STEM. The sample consisted of highly qualified professionals working in high positions in the hierarchies of multinational companies in the STEM field with experience both in Brazil and abroad. The data collected was analyzed using a mixed-methods approach, including content analysis for qualitative questions and the Grey Relational Analysis for quantitative questions. The results revealed that the lack of flexible work systems, the scarcity of gender-sensitive organizational policies and labor policies, and the prevalence of traditional cultural models are some of the main difficulties faced both in Brazil and abroad by the women interviewed. The need to discuss issues of gender equality and decent work in the early stages of education is important for increasing women’s participation in STEM, which is a critical factor in the development of inclusive organizations and in fully achieving the sustainable development of society. This paper presents a unique perspective of the perceived difficulties faced by executive women who worked in Brazil and in different countries (i.e., Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United States). Gender equality in organizations is highly context-dependent, and cross-cultural analysis generates relevant insights to face the challenges and advance the discussion on women’s participation in STEM.",,The authors are grateful for the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil) under the Grants No 304145/2021-1 and No 303924/2021-7.,Discover Sustainability,,,,2023-02-20,2023,2023-02-20,,4,1,11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kemechian, Tatiane; Sigahi, Tiago F.

We first formulate an f-NLED cosmological model with a more general function fF$$f \left( {F}\right) $$ and show that all NLED models can be expressed in this framework; then, we investigate in detail two interesting examples of the function fF$$f \left( {F}\right) $$. We present our phenomenological model based on a new Lagrangian for NLED. Solutions to the field equations with the physical properties of the cosmological parameters are obtained. We show that the early Universe had no Big-Bang singularity, which accelerated in the past. We also investigate the qualitative implications of NLED by studying the inflationary parameters, like the slow-roll parameters, spectral index ns$$n_s$$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and compare our results with observational data. Detailed phase-space analysis of our NLED cosmological model is performed with and without matter source. As a first approach, we consider the motion of a particle of unit mass in an effective potential. Our systems correspond to fast-slow systems for physical values of the electromagnetic field and the energy densities at the end of inflation. We analyze a complementary system using Hubble-normalized variables to investigate the cosmological evolution before the matter-dominated Universe.","HBB gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the University of Sharjah.

This has caused a rapid expansion of scientific production on DL-AV in recent years, encouraging researchers to conduct systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to organize knowledge on the topic. However, a critical analysis of the existing SLRs on DL-AV reveals some methodological gaps, particularly regarding the use of bibliometric software, which are powerful tools for analyzing large amounts of data and for providing a holistic understanding on the structure of knowledge of a particular field. This study aims to identify the strategic themes and trends in DL-AV research using the Science Mapping Analysis Tool (SciMAT) and content analysis. Strategic diagrams and cluster networks were developed using SciMAT, allowing the identification of motor themes and research opportunities. The content analysis allowed categorization of the contribution of the academic literature on DL applications in AV project design; neural networks and AI models used in AVs; and transdisciplinary themes in DL-AV research, including energy, legislation, ethics, and cybersecurity. Potential research avenues are discussed for each of these categories.

The most evident temporal variability beyond seasonal timescales observed for the OMZ was related to inter-annual variability associated with El Niño, when warmer and more oxygenated waters arrive at shallower zones and the OMZ becomes deeper. However, the impact of oxygen-deficient water that appears sporadically over the shelf is not yet understood. This study provides an integrated view of the oceanographic and climatic conditions behind bottom oxygen conditions along the Chilean continental margin, considering the temporal variability in the South East (SE) Pacific during the last ~2000 years. We organized the information on redox-sensitive metals and δ15N from sedimentary cores obtained from shelf zones from 23°S to 36°S at water depths lower than 100 m. The results demonstrate the variability in the upper part of the OMZ over the shelf, which seems to respond to climatic oscillations. The element distribution indicated in particular a more intense OMZ was developed over the shelf before 1400 AD, followed by more oxygenated bottom conditions afterward, except between 1925 and 1970 off 36°S when the OMZ was intensified, a condition that was not observed at the northern sites. This period mostly coincided with a low Pacific Decadal Oscillation amplitude and reduced El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity.

174,pub.1160355776,10.3389/fmars.2023.1155932,,,On the interpretation of changes in the subtropical oxygen minimum zone volume off Chile during two La Niña events (2001 and 2007),"Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are extended oceanic regions for which dissolved oxygen concentration is extremely low. They are suspected to be expanding in response to global warming. However, currently, the mechanisms by which OMZ varies in response to climate variability are still uncertain. Here, the variability of the subtropical OMZ off central Chile of a regional coupled physical–biogeochemical regional model simulation was analyzed for the period 2000–2008, noting that its fluctuations were significant despite the relatively weak amplitude of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, the interannual variability in the OMZ volume (OMZVOL, defined as the volume with dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) ≤ 45μM) was approximately 38% larger than that of the seasonal cycle, with maximum and minimum anomalies of OMZVOL taking place during two cold La Niña (LN) years (2001 and 2007). The model analyses further reveal that these anomalies resulted from a combined effect of changes in (1) the oxygen-poor waters poleward transport by the Peru–Chile undercurrent (PCUC), (2) the intensity of quasi-zonal jets influencing the transport of water to and from the OMZ, and (3) the zonal DO transport related to mesoscale eddy activity. Specifically, the interannual variability of the PCUC modulated primarily the DO contents of the OMZ core [(DO) ≤ 20μM] and secondarily the OMZVOL, while cross-shore DO transport by the zonal jets and the eddy fluxes played a major role in ventilating and shaping the offshore extent of the OMZ. When the OMZVOL was maximum (minimum), the PCUC transport was slightly increased (reduced), which was associated with a reduction (increase) in the ventilation of the OMZ through negative (positive) anomalies of zonal advection and DO eddy fluxes. Our results demonstrate that significant natural interannual variability in the subtropical OMZ off Chile originates from the interplay between oceanic equatorial teleconnection (PCUC transport) and local non-linear dynamics (the zonal jets and mesoscale eddies).",,"This work was funded by the Chilean Agency for Research and Development (FONDECYT Postdoctoral Project No. 3220768.

This explanation is achieved through the utilization of both tree-level and radiative seesaw mechanisms. In this model, the tiny masses of the light active neutrinos are generated via a three-loop radiative inverse seesaw mechanism, with Dirac and Majorana submatrices arising at one-loop level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the inverse seesaw mechanism being implemented with both submatrices generated at one- loop level. The model contains a global U(1)X symmetry which, after its spontaneous breaking, allows for the stabilization of the Dark Matter (DM) candidates. We show that the electroweak precision observables, the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments as well as the Charged Lepton Flavor Violating decays, μ → eγ, are consistent with the current experimental limits. In addition, we analyze the implications of the model for the 95 GeV diphoton excess recently reported by the CMS collaboration and demonstrate that such anomaly could be easily accommodated. Finally, we discuss qualitative aspects of DM in the considered model.","A.E.C.H, I.S. and S.K. are supported by ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1210378, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1230391, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1180232, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 3150472, ANID-Chile FONDECYT 1230160, ANID PIA/APOYO AFB220004 and Proyecto Milenio-ANID: ICN2019_044.

170,pub.1158456046,10.3389/fmars.2023.1154755,,,Genetic footprints of Quaternary glacial cycles over the patterns of population diversity and structure in three Nacella (Patellogastropoda: Nacellidae) species across the Magellan province in southern South America,"Quaternary glaciations severely altered landscape/seascape at high latitudes and had major consequences on species geographical ranges, population sizes, genetic differentiation and speciation rates. The Magellan province in southern South America, constitutes an interesting area to evaluate the effect of glaciations over near-shore marine benthic organisms. Existing data have showed clear signatures of population genetic bottlenecks during glacial maxima followed by recent recolonizations and expansions during the interglacial. Here, we present new population-based analyses in species of the patellogastropod genus Nacella (N. deaurata, N. magellanica, and N. mytilina). The species N. magellanica and N. deaurata inhabit rocky ecosystems while N. mytilina lives closely associated with kelps. The analyzed species exhibit narrow bathymetric ranges and consequently should have been severely affected by recurrent glacial cycles. We performed phylogeographic and demographic analyses in Nacella species including different localities across their respective distributions in the Magellan province including the Falkland/Malvinas Islands (F/M). Genetic analyses showed that all Nacella species exhibited low levels of genetic diversity, the presence of single dominant broadly distributed haplotypes, lack of correlation between geographical and genetic distance, and recent demographic growths, which are evidence supporting rapid postglacial expansions. Such results may have been facilitated by larval and/or rafting-mediated dispersal following the Cape Horn Current System. The three species showed strong and significant differentiation between F/M and southern Pacific margin (SPM) populations including localities across the Strait of Magellan and Cape Horn. Haplotype genealogies and mismatch analyses recognized older and more complex demographic histories in the F/M than in South America. Different glaciological histories between SPM and F/M may be responsible of the marked phylogeographic structure in the analyzed species of Nacella. Alternatively, as previously proposed, the F/M represent a glacial refugium for Nacella species (sink area), as well as a secondary contact zone where endemic haplotypes are found together with recently arrived South American ones. Historical and contemporary processes, contrasting glacial histories between the analyzed areas, as well as life history traits of the analyzed organisms are main factors explaining current phylogeographic patterns of shallow Magellan marine benthic organisms.","Many thanks to Angie Díaz, Jaime Ojeda, Mathias Hüne, Javier Naretto, and Karin Gérard, for field assistance and samplings in southern South America.

169,pub.1164914886,10.3389/fenrg.2023.1256219,,,Natural disasters and energy innovation: unveiling the linkage from an environmental sustainability perspective,"Natural disasters, characterized by their escalating frequency and intensification, fueled relentlessly by the inexorable forces of climate change, unambiguously underscore the urgent need to reassess our built environments and meticulously revise infrastructure design to withstand the unforgiving onslaught of these extreme events, thereby demanding concerted attention and unwavering dedication from policymakers and academic researchers to navigate this formidable predicament. The current study delves into the exploration of how natural disaster impact the course of energy technology evolution. To achieve this, This investigation uses panel data from 1990–2020 and sophisticated econometric analyses to model the effect of calamities on energy technology advancement across BRICS countries. Rigorous empirical methodologies lend credibility regarding the observed detrimental impact of disasters on innovation. The preliminary findings of the investigation suggest that natural disasters potentially exert a markedly detrimental effect on energy technology innovation. This influence is not merely confined to the year of the disaster occurrence but persistently lingers for the subsequent 4-year period. Moreover, the adverse impacts of such environmental upheavals on energy evolution seem to be mitigated by various factors. These include robust economic growth, government stability, interpersonal globalization, financial openness, trade openness, and the expansion of social globalisation. Adding further dimension to this research is the understanding that epidemics have the most pronounced negative implications on energy innovation. Concluding on a nuanced note, the study underscores a significant inverse relationship between natural disasters and low-carbon energy innovation. Interestingly, however, there is no discernible correlation when it comes to non-low carbon energy innovation. In a nutshell, this research presents a potential reference guide for policymakers, illuminating pathways to enhance the degree of energy innovation while tackling natural disasters and ensuring environmental sustainability.",,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

As infrastructure approaches end of life, understanding such values is critical to inform decommissioning decisions. This study uses a decade of industry remotely operated vehicle (ROV) imagery to describe fish, invertebrate, and benthic communities on gas field infrastructure. Sampling was conducted over 22 km of flowline, three wells and one manifold in the temperate waters of Bass Strait, south east Australia in depths of 155 to 263 m. A total of 10,343 mobile animals from 69 taxa were observed. A higher diversity of fishes were observed on flowlines (28 taxa) compared to wells (19 taxa). Fish and invertebrate communities observed along flowlines were distinct from those observed on wells/manifold, however, there was also high spatial variability among the different flowlines surveyed and between the three wells and manifold. These differences appear to be driven by habitat and depth preferences of the species observed. Many sand-affiliated species were associated with buried sections of flowlines (Tasmanian giant crab Pseudocarcinus gigas, Balmain bug Ibacus peronii, slender sand burrower Creedia haswelli, red cod Pseudophycis spp., blue grenadier Macruronus novaezelandiae) whilst reef-associated and schooling species were observed on the wells/manifold (jackass morwong Nemadactylus macropterus, redbait Emmelichthys nitidus, splendid perch Callanthias australis). Species of ecological importance were also noted including the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus), long-lived foxfish (Bodianus frenchii), and handfish (Brachionichthyidae spp). This study describes the habitat value of oil and gas infrastructure in a data poor temperate region that is important for understanding how the decommissioning of these structures may affect local marine ecosystems and fisheries. Therefore, it is critical to understand the habitat value of O&G infrastructure to marine life in the Bass Strait and whether decommissioning of these structures affect local marine ecosystems and fisheries. This study shows the complexity of determining temporal change in biodiversity values associated with these O & G structures from historical industry datasets that will be key for informing future decommissioning options. We also provide some guidance on how future quantitative data can be obtained in a systematic way using industry ROV data to better inform ecological investigations and decommissioning options.","We thank Cooper Energy for their project support, in particular Phil Deshon.

150,pub.1160390594,10.3847/1538-4357/acd4bd,,,Stellar Characterization and Radius Inflation of Hyades M-dwarf Stars from the APOGEE Survey,"We present a spectroscopic analysis of a sample of 48 M-dwarf stars (0.2 M ⊙ < M < 0.6 M ⊙) from the Hyades open cluster using high-resolution H-band spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. Our methodology adopts spectrum synthesis with LTE MARCS model atmospheres, along with the APOGEE Data Release 17 line list, to determine effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and projected rotational velocities. The median metallicity obtained for the Hyades M dwarfs is [M/H] = 0.09 ± 0.03 dex, indicating a small internal uncertainty and good agreement with optical results for Hyades red giants. Overall, the median radii are larger than predicted by stellar models by 1.6% ± 2.3% and 2.4% ± 2.3%, relative to a MIST and DARTMOUTH isochrone, respectively. We emphasize, however, that these isochrones are different, and the fractional radius inflation for the fully and partially convective regimes have distinct behaviors depending on the isochrone. Using a MIST isochrone there is no evidence of radius inflation for the fully convective stars, while for the partially convective M dwarfs the radii are inflated by 2.7% ± 2.1%, which is in agreement with predictions from models that include magnetic fields. For the partially convective stars, rapid rotators present on average higher inflation levels than slow rotators. The comparison with SPOTS isochrone models indicates that the derived M-dwarf radii can be explained by accounting for stellar spots in the photosphere of the stars, with 76% of the studied M dwarfs having up to 20% spot coverage, and the most inflated stars with ∼20%–40% spot coverage.","We thank the referee for comments that improved the paper significantly.

Measurements of emitted gases therefore provide insights into volcanic processes. On 16 July 2021, we made airborne measurements of weak gas plumes emitted from four remote Alaska volcanoes: Iliamna Volcano, Mount Douglas, Mount Martin, and Mount Mageik. Integrated into a small fixed-wing aircraft, a new Imaging Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument was used to map the spatial extent of SO2 plumes as they drifted downwind. Contrary to conventional Mobile DOAS instruments, which provide only a single viewing direction, the Imaging DOAS simultaneously measures SO2 column density along 48 individual viewing directions oriented in a swath above or below the aircraft. Each of the individual measurements have a comparable precision and sensitivity to those obtained by conventional instruments. Together, they provide high resolution 2D imagery of the volcanic plumes and allow calculation of limited emission rate time series information. Although zenith-facing DOAS measurements achieve greater accuracy and are performed here, the application of the Imaging DOAS in a nadir-facing setup is also discussed and compared to satellite observations made in similar geometries. Also onboard the aircraft, a suite of electrochemical and optical sensors measured the relative abundances of the six major volcanic volatile species H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S, HCl, and HF as the aircraft passed through the plumes. Mean SO2 emission rates of 90 ± 10, 20 ± 3, and 13 ± 3 t/d were measured at Iliamna Volcano, Mount Douglas, and Mount Martin, respectively. SO2 emissions were below the DOAS detection limit at Mount Mageik but CO2 and H2S could be measured with the in situ sensors. The information gleaned from these measurements was used to assess and compare activity at these volcanoes, all of which were found to be in a state of background degassing but whose emissions pointed to different source conditions ranging from mixed magmatic-hydrothermal to purely hydrothermal in character. Additional measurements at Mount Spurr, Redoubt Volcano, and Augustine Volcano failed to detect the very weak gas concentrations downwind of these persistently degassing vents.","The authors would like to thank Jason Ward, Chuck Werly and the Security Aviation team for their assistance integrating our instruments into the Cessna Conquest aircraft.

The comparison is done using network parameters and during the development of computer programming tasks and the solution of first-order algebraic equations. For that purpose, electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) were made with a volunteer group of 16 students of systems engineering of Universidad del Norte in Colombia, while they were performing computer programming tasks and solving first-order algebraic equations with three levels of difficulty. Then, based on the Synchronization Likelihood method, graph models of functional cortical networks were developed, whose parameters of Small-Worldness (SWN), global(Eg) and local (El) efficiency were compared between both types of tasks. From this study, it can be highlighted, first, the novelty of studying cortical function during the solution of algebraic equations and during programming tasks; second, significant differences between both types of tasks observed only in the delta and theta bands. Likewise, the differences between simpler mathematical tasks with the other levels in both types of tasks; third, the Brodmann areas 21 and 42, associated with auditory sensory processing, can be considered as differentiating elements of programming tasks; as well as Brodmann area 8, during equation solving.",I am very grateful to the coordination of the Chemistry and Biology Department at Universidad del Norte for their permanent support in this research.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Fabio Rapallo,Humans; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Algorithms; Mathematics; Colombia,2023-06-27,2023,2023-06-27,,18,6,e0274713,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández, Oscar; Zurek, Eduardo; Barbosa, John; Villasana, Minaya","Hernández, Oscar (Departamento de Química y Biología, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Zurek, Eduardo (Departamento de Ingeniería de sistemas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Barbosa, John (Departamento de Ingeniería de sistemas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia); Villasana, Minaya (Departamento de Cómputo Científico y Estadística, Universidad Simón Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela)","Hernández, Oscar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández, Oscar (Universidad del Norte); Zurek, Eduardo (Universidad del Norte); Barbosa, John (Universidad del Norte); Villasana, Minaya (Simón Bolívar University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274713&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160154648,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

The main advantage of the Drift-Flux Model is the reduced number of differential equations, which results in a lower computational time. However, the accuracy of the model depends on a suitable constitutive equation for the velocity of the dispersed phase, commonly, the gas phase. The gas velocity constitutive equation includes two important parameters, namely, the distribution coefficient and the void-fraction-weighted drift velocity. A drift-flux-model code was developed, by using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) with staggered grid system, to evaluate the effect of highly viscous liquid and pipe geometry (pipe diameter and pipe inclination) in the prediction of liquid hold-up and pressure drop gradient. The gas phase compressibility was also included in the model. The results show that the energy consumption to pump the fluids through the lift system has been overestimated when highly viscous liquids are produced. For the case of a vertical upward flow, the overestimation can be up to 10 % of energy consumption. We strongly recommend incorporating the effects of pipe inclination and liquid viscosity into the estimation of the Distribution Coefficient of the dispersed phase, encompassing both C0 and gas drift velocity.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"The authors gratefully acknowledge Universidad del Norte, Colombia (Contract Identification: CCBUNDDA/12/2016) for the financial support.

We sought to validate a Latin-American Spanish version of the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA; Mendelson et al. 2001).MethodsThe BESAA was translated, culturally adapted, and validated in a sample of adults in Colombia (N = 525, 65% women, Mage 24.4, SD = 9.28). We assessed factor structure (using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and exploratory structural equation model (ESEM)), internal reliability (using Cronbach’s alpha and omega), validity (using the Body Appreciation Scale BAS and Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire SATAQ), test–retest stability in a small subsample (N = 84, using Intraclass correlations ICC) and measurement invariance across gender. To evaluate the generalizability of the scale, we assessed reliability, validity, and factor structure in a second sample from rural Nicaragua (N = 102, 73% women, Mage 22.2, SD = 4.72), and assessed measurement invariance across Nicaraguan and Colombian participants.ResultsThe scale showed good internal reliability and validity in both samples, and there was evidence of adequate test–retest stability in the Colombian sample. EFA showed a three-factor structure with subscales we labelled ‘appearance-positive’, ‘appearance-negative’ and ‘weight’, that was confirmed using CFA and ESEM in the Colombian sample. Measurement invariance was confirmed across the Colombian and Nicaraguan samples, and across gender within the Colombian sample.ConclusionThe Latin-American Spanish version of the BESAA (BESAA-LA) appears to be a psychometrically sound measure with good reliability, validity and invariance across gender and countries. These results support the use of this scale to measure body satisfaction/dissatisfaction in Latin American adult populations.","We thank Elvis Calero for his facilitation at the university of URACCAN, as well as all our participants for their time.

The outcomes were evaluated with other works obtained from the literature to validate the suggested fuzzy systems for categorizing the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. The fuzzy Inference Systems worked with different input features, according to the studies obtained from the literature. The outcomes confirm that most performance' metrics in several cases were greater than the achieved results from the literature for the output variable for the different Fuzzy Inference Systems-FIS, demonstrating superior precision.","The first and the fourth authors express their profound thanks to the Administrative Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation—MINCIENCIAS of Colombia and the Universidad del Norte.",This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Santoso Wibowo,"Humans; Female; Fuzzy Logic; Breast Neoplasms; Wisconsin; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Knowledge Bases",2023-03-14,2023,2023-03-14,,20,6,5103,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Julio, Yamid Fabián; Díaz-Pertuz, Leonardo Antonio; Prieto-Guevara, Martha Janeth; Barrios-Barrios, Mauricio Andrés; Nieto-Bernal, Wilson","Hernández-Julio, Yamid Fabián (Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Accounting Sciences, Universidad del Sinú Elías Bechara Zainúm, Montería 230002, Colombia); Díaz-Pertuz, Leonardo Antonio (Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Accounting Sciences, Universidad del Sinú Elías Bechara Zainúm, Montería 230002, Colombia); Prieto-Guevara, Martha Janeth (Departamento de Ciencias Acuícolas–Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia (CINPIC), Universidad de Córdoba, Montería 230002, Colombia); Barrios-Barrios, Mauricio Andrés (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia); Nieto-Bernal, Wilson (Facultad de Ingeniería, Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 80001, Colombia)","Hernández-Julio, Yamid Fabián (Universidad del Sinú)","Hernández-Julio, Yamid Fabián (Universidad del Sinú); Díaz-Pertuz, Leonardo Antonio (Universidad del Sinú); Prieto-Guevara, Martha Janeth (University of Córdoba); Barrios-Barrios, Mauricio Andrés (University of the Coast); Nieto-Bernal, Wilson (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/6/5103/pdf?version=1678781635,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156203804,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

The catalytic tests were carried out in a MAT-type reactor under typical conditions. The zeolites were subjected to alkaline treatment with NaOH at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 mol/L, resulting in the creation of several samples (Z-0.05, Z-0.10, Z-0.20, Z-0.30 and Z-0.40) that were then hydrothermally stabilized (Z-0.05-M, Z-0.10-M, Z-0.20-M, Z-0.30-M and Z-0.40-M) to increase mesoporosity and reduced crystallinity. The increase in mesoporosity was accompanied by an improvement in acidity. Despite Z-0.30-M having higher acidity, Z-0.00-M and Z-0.10-M exhibited the highest activity due to their high crystallinity and microporosity, yielding the highest gas yields. Gasoline was the main product, with maximum yields exceeding 30%. Z-0.20-M produced more aromatic and olefin compounds than the others, resulting in higher quality gasoline. Coke formation followed the trend: Z-0.00-M < Z-0.10-M < Z-0.20-M < Z-0.30-M. The higher intracrystalline mesoporosity in the zeolites favored the formation of a more condensed coke.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The present cross-sectional study assessed the association between health behaviors of first-semester students and these factors.
METHOD: N = 189 (Mage = 18.79; SD = 1.07; female = 68.8%) first-semester students in Colombia completed an online questionnaire investigating current and expected health behaviors as well as influencing factors. ANCOVAs, bivariate correlations, moderation analyses, and hierarchical regressions were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: expected food consumption (stronger among participants who live with parents) as well as current and expected heavy drinking and binge drinking (stronger among participants who do not live with parents) were significantly correlated to the respective parental behavior. Current and expected drinking was significantly correlated to partners' drinking. Expected physical activity was correlated with peers' physical activity. Partners' attempts to encourage drinking moderated the association between participants' current and expected drinking with partners' drinking. Time spent with peers was related to heavy drinking and engaging in more physical activity.
CONCLUSION: in Colombia, parents appear to play a significant role in their offspring's health behaviors during their first semester at university, particularly regarding food consumption and alcohol use.

One of the contexts in which the LTE is considered is the intensive care unit (ICU). This review is to describe the competencies for the execution of a nursing professional role in the LTE in the ICU.
Method: An integrative review of the literature published between the years 2010 and 2023. The search was carried out in five databases: Medline, Wiley Online Library, SciELO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme in Spanish was used as the template for study evaluation. The methodology of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) was used to assess the level of evidence and the degree of recommendation.
Result: A total of 25 articles in a wide range of studies were included. The findings suggest that the competencies for LTE in the ICU are direct patient care, family-centered care, and the role of the nurse within the team. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these conclusions. Three categories were identified: (a) competencies as defender agent between the patient, his family, and the interdisciplinary team; (b) competencies for decision-making in limiting the therapeutic effort; and (c) competencies for nursing therapeutic interventions at the end of life.
Conclusion: The competencies of the nursing professionals who work in the adult ICU in the LTE are essential to the patient's quality of life, dignity of their death, and comprehensive family support for coping with grief.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Nursing Sciences,,,,2023-12-19,2023,2023-12-19,2024-01,11,1,143-154,All OA; Gold,Article,"López-Panza, Elvia R.; Pacheco-Roys, Vanessa C.; Fernández-Ahumada, Kelly J.; Díaz-Mass, Diana C.; Expósito-Concepción, María Y.; Villarreal-Cantillo, Elizabeth; Gonzalez, Cesar I.

Methods: A literature review was carried out using seven databases. The search was conducted using the keywords ""Idiopathic spinal cord herniation"" OR ""Idiopathic Ventral Spinal Cord Herniation"" AND ""Case report"" OR ""case series.""
Results: A total of 92 relevant papers reporting 224 cases, besides the index case, were determined. Of the cases, 58.5% were females and the mean age was 50.7 (SD 13.2) years. Symptoms, diagnoses, and outcomes were similar between genders. The most common clinical signs included motor symptoms (82.6%), instability (61.3%), hypoesthesia (59.2%), and disturbance of thermal sensitivity (47.3%). Brown-Séquard syndrome was observed in 27.2% of the cases, and surgical treatment was employed in 89.7% of the cases.
Conclusions: ISCH is a pathology that is principally treated with surgical approach. This study provides valuable insights into the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ISCH, which can aid in the early recognition and treatment of this rare condition.",,,Spine Surgery and Related Research,,,,2023-09-04,2023,2023-09-04,2024-05-27,8,3,225-234,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rairan, Luis Garcia; Henriquez, Alberto; Diaz, Gustavo; Mejía, Juan Armando; Gomez, Diego; Ramon, Juan Fernando; Hakim, Enrique Jimenez","Rairan, Luis Garcia (Department of Neurosurgery, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotà, Colombia); Henriquez, Alberto (Faculty of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Bogotá, Colombia); Diaz, Gustavo (Faculty of Medicine, Universidad El Bosque, Bogotá, Colombia); Mejía, Juan Armando (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia); Gomez, Diego (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia); Ramon, Juan Fernando (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia); Hakim, Enrique Jimenez (Department of Neurosurgery, Fundación Santa Fe, Bogotá, Colombia)",,"Rairan, Luis Garcia (National University of Colombia); Henriquez, Alberto (Universidad del Norte); Diaz, Gustavo (El Bosque University); Mejía, Juan Armando (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Gomez, Diego (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Ramon, Juan Fernando (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Hakim, Enrique Jimenez (Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá)",0,0,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ssrr/advpub/0/advpub_2023-0102/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163807088,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

There is a great need for better-developed scales that comply with Rasch model requirements.
Methods: Prospective study including patients with DED. A series of focus groups were performed to determine the best items to be included. A Rasch modeling methodology was used to validate the Medellín Dry Eye Inventory (ME·Dry). After iterative analysis and scale modification, a final version of the scale was attained which complied with the Rasch analysis expectations. Correlation between the different subscales of the ME·Dry and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was evaluated through Spearman correlation.
Results: A total of 166 patients with DED were included. Rasch modeling demonstrated an excellent behavior for the ME·Dry, including four subscales: Symptoms, Triggers, Activity Limitation, and Emotional Compromise. Infit and Outfit parameters were all between 0.50 and 1.50, with excellent category utilization. Person and item separation and reliability were excellent for all subscales. There was a need for a category collapsing for the Emotional Compromise subscale. There was a strong correlation between the different subscales of the ME·Dry except for the Emotional Compromise subscale, which seems to be independent.
Conclusion: The ME·Dry is a reliable scale, complying with the Rasch model expectations, that allows for a reliable measurement of quality of life compromise in patients with DED. Emotional compromise secondary to DED does not seem to correlate with disease severity as assessed by the other quality-of-life subscales.",The authors are in debt to the patients who were capital in the process of developing the items for the scale.

Hemoperfusion (HPF) can remove inflammatory cytokines and can reduce the negative effects of cytokine storm in COVID-19. We compared the mortality rate, inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury (AKI) prevalence among patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 treated with and without HPF with HA330 cartridge.
Methods: Mortality rate, serum creatinine, and ferritin values were compared between patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency secondary to COVID-19 who received conventional treatment and another group of patients who additionally received four sessions of HPF with HA330.
Results: Of 116 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), one group (n: 84) received support treatment and the other group (n: 32) additionally received HPF with HA330 cartridge. Both groups had no renal disease and similar age and comorbidities at admission, except for obesity and mechanical ventilation requirement, which were significantly higher in the HPF group. Mortality rate (61% vs. 31%, P: 0.008), serum creatinine (1.4 vs. 0.5 mg/dl, P < 0.001), and post-HPF serum ferritin (2868 vs. 1675, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the HPF group.
Conclusion: Mortality rate, serum ferritin, and AKI were significantly reduced in critical COVID-19 patients who received HPF with HA330 cartridge than in those who did not receive it.

This creates an urgent need to know the families of inhibitors and their concentration levels. This article uses ethylene green to synthesize an ethylene-propylene copolymer. It describes the impact of trace impurities of furan in ethylene green and how this furan influences the loss of properties such as thermal and mechanical properties of the random copolymer. For the development of the investigation, 12 runs were carried out, each in triplicate. The results show an evident influence of furan on the productivity of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst (ZN); productivity losses of 10, 20, and 41% were obtained for the copolymers synthesized with ethylene rich in 6, 12, and 25 ppm of furan, respectively. PP0 (without furan) did not present losses. Likewise, as the concentration of furan increased, it was observed that the melt flow index (MFI), thermal (TGA), and mechanical properties (tensile, bending, and impact) decreased significantly. Therefore, it can be affirmed that furan should be a substance to be controlled in the purification processes of green ethylene.",We acknowledge Dalila Fernandez Viloria.,This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,Cristina Cazan,,2023-05-11,2023,2023-05-11,,15,10,2264,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Puello-Polo, Esneyder; Márquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia.; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo Km 1 Vía Turbaco, Cartagena 130001, Colombia.; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia.); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (Group de Investigación en Oxi/Hidrotratamiento Catalítico Y Nuevos Materiales, Programa de Química-Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Atlántico, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia.); Márquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Carrera 51B, Km 5, Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia.)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (University of Atlántico); Márquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/10/2264/pdf?version=1683779604,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157965416,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

For this reason, this paper aims to introduce a protocol for training Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks via combining federated learning and homomorphic encryption, where the data are distributed in multiple clients, and the data privacy is preserved. This proposal was validated by running several simulations using a dataset for a multi-class classification problem, different MLP neural network architectures, and different numbers of participating clients. The results are shown for several metrics in the local and federated settings, and a comparative analysis is carried out.

Through the analysis of the global and local reactivity of the reagents, it was determined that the furan acts as an electron donor. In contrast, the titanium of the ZN catalyst acts as an electron acceptor. It is postulated that this difference in reactivity could lead to forming a furan-titanium complex, which blocks the catalyst's active sites and reduces its efficiency for propylene polymerization. Theoretical results showed a high adsorption affinity of furan to the active site of the Ti catalyst, indicating that furan tends to bind strongly to the catalyst, thus blocking the active sites and decreasing the availability for propylene polymerization. The experimental data revealed that the presence of furan significantly reduced the productivity of the ZN catalyst by 10, 20, and 41% for concentrations of 6, 12.23, and 25.03 ppm furan, respectively. In addition, a proportional relationship was observed between the furan concentration and the MFI melt index of the polymer, where the higher the furan concentration, the higher the MFI. Likewise, the presence of furan negatively affected the mechanical properties of polypropylene, especially the impact Izod value, with percentage decreases of 9, 18, and 22% for concentrations of 6, 12.23, and 25.03 ppm furan, respectively.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,Haiyang Gao,,2023-09-21,2023,2023-09-21,,24,18,14368,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín; Puello-Polo, Esneyder; Marquez, Edgar","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (Chemistry Program, Department of Natural and Exact Sciences, San Pablo Campus, University of Cartagena, Cartagena 130015, Colombia; Chemical Engineering Program, School of Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolivar, Parque Industrial y Tecnológico Carlos Vélez Pombo, Cartagena 130001, Colombia; Department of Natural and Exact Science, Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (Group de Investigación en Oxi/Hidrotratamiento Catalítico Y Nuevos Materiales, Programa de Química-Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Atlántico, Puerto Colombia 081001, Colombia;, esneyderpuello@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co); Marquez, Edgar (Grupo de Investigaciones en Química Y Biología, Departamento de Química Y Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)","Hernández-Fernández, Joaquín (University of Cartagena; Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar; University of the Coast); Puello-Polo, Esneyder (University of Atlántico); Marquez, Edgar (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/18/14368/pdf?version=1695276711,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164318726,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry,

This study characterized the competencies of professionals in the Colombian Caribbean, the circumstances that favor and hinder the development of appropriate care, as well as the preferences, expectations and attitudes toward an educational intervention supported by ICTs.
METHODS: We used a qualitative, phenomenological approach, combining documentary review and data obtained through observation, an online survey and two focus groups involving 55 healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses and psychologists) of varying experience. For the analysis and integration of results, the Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation and Behavior model and the Theoretical Domains Framework were used as references. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist guided the reporting of this study.
RESULTS: Competency deficits were found regardless of the profession and experience, which are related to inadequacies in undergraduate and post-graduate training. Structural problems in Colombian society and healthcare service organization were also discovered, which were considered unmodifiable barriers and have been aggravated by the social, economic and health effects of the pandemic. The main modifiable barriers found were as follows: pain underestimation and under-treatment of older adults, as well as stereotypes regarding old age and pain, lack of knowledge of the psychosocial determinants of pain and of techniques for its assessment and treatment, overestimation of pharmacological treatment and failure to update pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques.

The present study investigates the impact of aromaticity on racemization using advanced theoretical techniques based on density functional theory. Calculations were performed at the ωb97xd/6-311++g(d,p) level of theory. A compelling explanation for the observed aromatic stabilization via resonance is put forward, involving a carbanion intermediate. The analysis, employing Hammett's parameters, convincingly supports the presence of a negative charge within the transition state of aromatic compounds. Moreover, the combined utilization of natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations confirms the pronounced stabilization of electron distribution within the carbanion intermediate. To enhance our understanding of the racemization process, a thorough examination of the evolution of NBO charges and Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) at all points along the IRC profile is performed. This approach offers valuable insights into the synchronicity parameters governing the racemization reactions.",The authors have used the high-performance computing (HPC) system available in USFQ for the theoretical calculations presented in this work.,This study was supported by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito by the Collaboration grants 2022–2023.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,,"Amino Acids, Aromatic; Hydrogen Bonding",2023-07-25,2023,2023-07-25,,24,15,11877,All OA; Gold,Article,"Andino, Mateo S.; Mora, José R.; Paz, José L.; Márquez, Edgar A.; Perez-Castillo, Yunierkis; Agüero-Chapin, Guillermin","Andino, Mateo S.

For instance, graphene-like materials have been employed as asphalt binder modifying agents in pavement engineering. In the literature, it has been reported that (in comparison to an unmodified binder) the Graphene Modified Asphalt Binders (GMABs) exhibit an enhanced performance grade, a lower thermal susceptibility, a higher fatigue life, and a decreased accumulation of permanent deformations. Nonetheless, although GMABs stand out significantly from traditional alternatives, there is still no consensus on their behavior regarding chemical, rheological, microstructural, morphological, thermogravimetric, and surface topography properties. Therefore, this research conducted a literature review on the properties and advanced characterization techniques of GMABs. Thus, the laboratory protocols covered by this manuscript are atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic shear rheometer, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

The influence of the abnormal function of mentalis muscle on the shape and posture of the mandible was evaluated using a finite element approach.
METHODS: Finite element analysis was used to create a three-dimensional representation of a human mandible that represents a dry normal mandible with teeth (33-36 gm/cm2). Pressures were applied directly to the labial surface of the mandible's lower anterior dento-alveolar structure reflecting the normal lips muscle function. While on abnormal swallowing pattern, lip muscle force (300 gm\cm2) had been assumed.
RESULTS: Shape and postural abnormality of the mandible with malocclusion particularly at the anterior dentoalveolar and basal bone region in sagittal direction as well as inward pressure on the mandibular posterior region.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal perioral muscle function throughout growth and development may result in a shape and postural abnormality of the mandible and a companying malocclusion.","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the University of Mosul, College of Dentistry, and College of Engineering for their ongoing support.

This approach pivoted on the incorporation of byproducts, with a spotlight on ground glass powder (GP) as a pivotal supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Our goal was twofold: engineering cost-efficient concrete while maintaining environmental integrity. The derived RPC showcased robust mechanical strength and impressive workability. Rigorous evaluations, containing attributes like compressive strength, resistance to chloride ion penetration, ultrasonic pulse speed, and drying shrinkage, highlighted its merits. Notably, the optimized RPC, despite an insignificant decrease in compressive strength at 90 days compared to its traditional counterpart, maintained steady strength augmentation over time. The refinement process culminated in a notable 29% reduction in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) usage and a significant 64% decrease in silica fume (SF), with the optimized mix composition being 590 for cement, 100 for SF, 335 for GP, and 257 kg/m3 for calcium carbonate. Additionally, the optimized RPC stood out due to the enhanced rheological behavior, influenced by the lubricative properties of calcium carbonate and the water conservation features of the glass powder. The reactive properties of SF, combined with GP, brought distinct performance variations, most evident at 28 days. Yet, both mixtures exhibited superior resistance to chloride, deeming them ideal for rigorous settings like coastal regions. Significantly, the RPC iteration, enriched with selective mineral admixtures, displayed a reduced tendency for drying-induced shrinkage, mitigating potential crack emergence.","The authors extend their appreciation to Researcher Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R692), King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Normally, such cases would be left undecided, while on the other hand, timely taxonomic decisions are required. We argue that morphological, chorological, and ecological data can be informative to illuminate patterns of speciation. Their use can provide a first step in testing taxon concepts at species level. We focused on five cases of nested singletons in trees of the genus Casearia. We employed PCA and cluster analysis to assess phenotypic differentiation. Using geocoordinates, we calculated niche space differentiation based on 19 bioclim variables, by means of PCA and niche equivalency and similarity tests and generated dot maps. We found that the singletons were morphologically distinctive in two of the five cases (Casearia selloana and C. manausensis), relatively distinctive in two other cases (C. zizyphoides and C. mariquitensis), and partially overlapping in the last case (C. grandiflora). For two cases (C. mariquitensis and C. selloana), ecological niche space was broadly overlapping, in two cases it was found broadly nested (C. grandiflora and C. zizyphoides), and in one case narrowly nested (C. manausensis), but in no case niche differentiation was observed. Niche overlap, similarity and equivalency showed corresponding patterns. Given these data, one would interpret C. selloana and C. manausensis as presumably well-distinguished taxa, their narrow distribution ranges suggesting recently emerging lineages. The other three cases are not clearcut. Morphological data would suggest particularly C. grandiflora conspecific with C. arborea, but differences in the distribution are intriguing. Our approach would reject the notion of potential synonymy based on nested phylogenetic placement for at least two of the five cases. The other case also shows no complete lack of differentiation which would support synonymy.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are thankful to Mac H.

The degree of pathogenesis of clinical isolates varies greatly. This study was aimed to molecular identification of E. histolytica in children using the nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), and then, a genotyping of positive E. histolytica isolates using the quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay through targeting serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) gene. For this purpose, a total of 50 bloody diarrheic stool samples were collected from the children attended to the Al-Zahraa' Teaching Hospital and Alkut Hospital for Gynecology, Obstetric and Pediatrics (Alkut, Wasit, Iraq) were subjected to the present study from September to December 2021. Firstly, the extracted DNAs that amplified using specific primers through targeting 18S rRNA gene and tested using nPCR assay were revealed an overall 48% (24/50) positive samples for E. histolytica. For genotyping, our results were detected an existence of four different genotypes (I, II, III and IV) with a significant prevalence of Genotype-II (54.17%) when compared to Genotype-I (20.83%), Genotype-III (12.5%) and Genotype- IV (12.5%). In addition, results of melting temperature of targeted genotypes were 84ºC, 83 - 83.5ºC, 82.5ºC and 81ºC for Genotype-I, II, III and IV, respectively. In conclusion, molecular amplification of 18S rRNA gene was revealed the large prevalence of E. histolytica among bloody diarrheic children of study areas; while, amplification of SREHP gene was reflected the widespread phenotypic variation of the Genotype-II suggesting the high ability of this genotype to spread infection in children.

The Born-Oppenheimer electronic energy curve for this molecular model consists of two-intercrossing harmonic oscillator potentials with minima displaced in energy and nuclear coordinate. The results obtained show how these optical responses are sensitive to explicit considerations of both intramolecular coupling and the presence of the solvent through their stochastic interaction. Our study shows that the permanent dipoles of the system and the transition dipoles induced by electromagnetic field effects represent critical quantities for the analysis. The solvent action in our model is treated through the natural Bohr frequency shift to a time-dependent function, with explicit manifestations in its comparison as if the upper state were broadened. Significant variations in the nonlinear optical properties for cases of perturbative and saturative treatments, relaxation times, and optical propagation, mainly due to changes in the probe and pump intensities, are studied. Our studies relating the intramolecular effects with those generated by the presence of the solvent and its stochastic interaction with the solute of study, have allowed not only to analyze the influence of these in the profile of the optical responses, but they could also provide some insights into the analysis and characterization of molecular systems through nonlinear optical properties.",The work was carried out using the computational resources provided by the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos through its Vice Rectorate of Research and Postgraduate Studies.

Therefore, different authors have developed mathematical models for its calculation. The target of this review was to analyze the work carried out on mathematical models of body composition variables from different anthropometric measurements, answering the following questions: what is the corporal variable that the model predicts?, what are the input variables for model development?, how is the patients typification in each model?, what data analysis method has been used?, and how has been the model evaluated? The search was limited to journals found in repositories in the areas of Medicine, Nursing, Biochemistry, Biology, Health, Pharmacology, Immunology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Four hundred and twenty-four articles were found, which were reduced to 30 by applying the systematic literature review process. The analyzed studies are oriented to the prediction of variables related to body fat mass. The evaluation results found for fat-free mass, fat mass and metabolic rate differ according to the comparison technique and the body segments analyzed. The evaluation is mainly based on the intraclass correlation, the Pearson correlation and the coefficient of determination (r2), and they present a good correlation for the population under study.",,,Nutrición Hospitalaria,,,Humans; Body Composition; Anthropometry,2023,2023,,2023,40,5,1068-1079,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eraso-Checa, Francisco; Rosero, Ricardo; González, Carlos; Cortés, David; Hernández, Eder; Polanco, Juan Pablo; Díaz-Tribaldos, Carolina","Eraso-Checa, Francisco (Programa de Ingeniería Electrónica.

The purpose of this study was to examine the evidence of the validity of internal structure (construct) and reliability of the Florida Patient Acceptance Survey (FPAS) in a sample of ICD patients, comparing the psychometric indicators of the complete (FPAS-18 item) and abbreviated (FPAS-12 item) versions. The sample included 151 participants (97 males, mean age of 55.7 ± 14.1 years) who completed the cross-culturally adapted version of the FPAS instrument for the Brazilian context. The psychometric properties of both versions of the FPAS instrument were evaluated by two distinct approaches:•Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis: used to test the internal structure of the instrument•Cronbach's Alpha and McDonald's Omega: used to determine the reliability of the instrument The two versions of the FPAS-Br instrument showed consistent evidence of internal structure validity and reliability.

METHOD: comparative, correlational and cross-sectional design. The sample used (n=271) constituted 40.9% of the total number of nursing professionals. Psychometric properties of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy for Health Professionals were studied. Descriptive statistics were calculated: mean and standard deviation. The association between empathy and age was estimated using regression equations and statistical significance of the regression coefficients, after evaluating the type of curve using variance analysis.
RESULTS: the underlying model of three dimensions of empathy was identified. The values of the descriptive statistics observed were relatively low in empathy and its dimensions. Empathy levels were not associated with the age range. No differences in empathy were found between the types of work schedules. Variability was found in the dimensions: ""compassionate care"" and ""Walking on the patient's shoes"".
CONCLUSION: these results show that the levels of empathy observed may imply a deficient performance in empathetic care for patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 33 municipal markets of the 14 departmental capitals of El Salvador. The sample consisted of 256 out of 456 possible market stalls. A sample of chicken meat was obtained from each market stall. The microbiological analysis was conducted at the National Public Health Laboratory. Frequencies, percentages, measures of central tendency and association were calculated with SPSS version 21.
RESULTS.: Escherichia coli was found in 74% of the samples, Staphylococcus aureus in 24% and Salmonella spp. in 1%. The presence of Salmonella spp. was associated with not using hand sanitizer and not using towels for drying the hands. S. aureus was associated with the use of personal accessories and improper storage. The presence of S. aureus was associated with the lack of hand washing, not using a towel to dry the hands and not wearing an apron.
CONCLUSION.: The hygienic-sanitary conditions of the handlers and the market stalls were associated with microbiological contamination of chicken meat marketed in El Salvador.","Marieta Solani Rivera Corona, Senior Specialist, Department of Food Analysis for Human Consumption, National Laboratory of Food Hygiene, for her contribution to the technical review of the manuscript.

The research was conducted by the psychology department of a reproductive health institution in Mexico City. The objective was to know the relation between marital satisfaction/dissatisfaction and gender roles, self-esteem, the types of coping strategies and the types of violence perceived from the partner. It was a nonexperimental, retrospective, cross-sectional study of two samples-one of women and one of men-classified by marital satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The nonprobability quota sampling included 208 participants: 104 women and 104 men. Comparisons, correlations and a discriminant analysis were made to identify the most significant variables. Women with marital dissatisfaction perceived blackmail, psychological violence and humiliation/devaluation from their partner; they preferably adopt a submissive gender role and use escape/avoidance as a coping strategy, and so do the men with marital dissatisfaction, who also perceived blackmail, control and psychological violence from their partner; they have low self-esteem, and they preferably adopt a submissive gender role. Isolating factors will allow for more specificity in terms of psychological care at health institutions as well as avoiding gender biases and preventing an increase of violence in couples.",We thank the National Institute of Perinatology for the facilities for this study.,This research received no external funding.,Healthcare,,"Isabel Cuadrado-Gordillo, Parra Guadalupe Martín-Mora, Walter R.

Thus far, there have been several records of mycovirus infection in Colletotrichum spp., primarily by viruses of the Partitiviridae family. There have also been records of infections by mycoviruses of the Chrysoviridae family. Mycoviruses are (+)ssRNA and dsRNA genome viruses, which may or may not be enveloped. To date, no mycovirus with a DNA genome has been isolated from Colletotrichum spp. Typically, mycoviruses cause latent infections, although hypo- and hypervirulence have also been reported in Colletotrichum spp. In addition to its effects on pathogenic behavior, mycovirus infection can lead to important physiological changes, such as altered morphological characteristics, reduced vegetative growth, and suppressed conidia production. Therefore, research on mycoviruses infecting phytopathogenic fungi can help develop alternative methods to chemical control, which can cause irreversible damage to humans and the environment. From an agricultural perspective, mycoviruses can contribute to sustainable agriculture as biological control agents via changes in fungal physiology, ultimately resulting in the total loss of or reduction in the virulence of these pathogens.","This study was financed by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), Brazil, (financing Code 001) and the Foundation of Research Support of Amazonas State (FAPEAM 002/2018 – UNIVERSAL AMAZONAS).

This study aims to analyze the level of anxiety, as well as coping strategies, among the health personnel in Latin American countries and Spain. An exploratory, descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 584 participants from the healthcare population. No significant differences were observed in anxiety levels due to COVID-19 between Latin American countries and Spain. In Spain, an active and passive coping style is used, while in Latin American countries, an avoidance coping style is employed; there is a direct correlation between anxiety levels and the avoidance coping style. There exists an inverse correlation between anxiety levels and the use of an active coping style; moreover, there are no significant differences in the anxiety level of health personnel depending on whether they have cared for patients with COVID-19. Low cognitive activity, use of the avoidance method and Spanish geography were the main predictive coping styles of anxiety.

The Delphi process, with a ≥8 0% pre-defined participants' agreement, included three phases and a Coordinating Group. During the Preparation phase three panels of experts were selected and invited to participate: a) Regional academic/professional Dental Associations (Associations-Panel): n = 12; b) Regional Dental Schools (Dental-Schools-Panel): existing dental schools (n = 263) from the 19 Spanish-speaking regional countries; c) International academic/professional associations Peer Experts (Peer-Panel): n = 4. Based on consensus documents from Europe, Colombia, the Caribbean, USA, Chile and Spain, and updated scientific evidence, the Coordinating Group developed a baseline framework proposal of domains, main competencies (MC) and specific competencies (SC). The Consultation-Agreement and Consensus phases included three rounds of questionnaires with a step-wise sharing of the MC updated version of the consensus framework with the Dental-Schools-Panel and including SC with the Associations-Panel. Diverse communication strategies were used ( e.g ., independent google-form questionnaires and workshops). Consensus was reached after an on-site Associations-Panel workshop and secret voting, followed by an online meeting with the Peers-Panel.

In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time.
Methods: A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System.
Results: 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALYs (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1).
Conclusions: Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable diseases (NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.","To Ángel Cruz-Roa, PhD, for his contribution in estimations through free software, on a script in Python 3.0 programming language, on the Jupyter Notebook platform with NumPy, and Pandas libraries.",The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,"Colombia; Humans; Male; Female; Adult; Child, Preschool; Child; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Infant; Cost of Illness; Disability-Adjusted Life Years; Aged; Young Adult; Infant, Newborn; Aged, 80 and over; Noncommunicable Diseases",2023-11-20,2023,2023-11-20,,11,,1257,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar; Grisales-Romero, Hugo","Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar (Escuela de Salud Pública, Universidad de los Llanos, Villavicencio, Meta, Colombia; Grupo Demografía y Salud, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia); Grisales-Romero, Hugo (Escuela de Salud Pública, Universidad de los Llanos, Villavicencio, Meta, Colombia)","Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar (University of the Llanos; University of Antioquia)","Gutiérrez-Lesmes, Oscar (University of the Llanos; University of Antioquia); Grisales-Romero, Hugo (University of the Llanos)",0,0,,,https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1257/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166197575,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

Proliferation, migration and overall behaviour of those cells is greatly determined by micromechanical queues provided by the ECM. Lung fibrosis displays an aberrant increased deposition of ECM which likely changes filament organization and stiffens the ECM, thus upregulating the profibrotic profile of pulmonary cells. We have previously used AFM to assess changes in the Young's Modulus (E) of the ECM in the lung. Here, we perform further ECM topographical, mechanical and viscoelastic analysis at the micro- and nano-scale throughout fibrosis development. Furthermore, we provide nanoscale correlations between topographical and elastic properties of the ECM fibres. Firstly, we identify a softening of the ECM after rats are instilled with media associated with recovery of mechanical homeostasis, which is hindered in bleomycin-instilled lungs. Moreover, we find opposite correlations between fibre stiffness and roughness in PBS- vs bleomycin-treated lung. Our findings suggest that changes in ECM nanoscale organization take place at different stages of fibrosis, with the potential to help identify pharmacological targets to hinder its progression.",,"This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PID2020-113910RB-I00-AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SAF2017-85574-R, and PID2020-116808RB-I00 AEI-Retos) and SEPAR (900-2019).

Teachers underwent a re-planning of their teaching approaches, shifting from face-to-face teaching formats to remote ones. These challenges resulted in high levels of burnout. The identification of risk/protective factors contributing to burnout is crucial in order to inform intervention programs. Thus, we hypothesized a mediation role of teachers' mentalizing ability (processing of emotions, a component of mentalized affectivity) on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and depersonalization (burnout dimension). Two reverse models were computed. Job satisfaction, teachers' age and gender, school grade, and length of teaching experience served as covariates.
METHODS: 466 (M(sd) = 46.2 (10.4) years) online questionnaires were completed by Italian teachers of primary (n = 204) and middle (n = 242) schools. Measures of burnout, depression, anxiety, and mentalization were administered.
RESULTS: The findings corroborated our hypotheses: in all models, processing emotions served as a mediator on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and depersonalization, and on the reciprocal one. Job satisfaction positively impacted processing emotion, and negatively impacted depression and depersonalization; women teachers reported high levels of the anxious trait.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it can be concluded that the ability to mentalize has a beneficial impact on teachers' well-being. Policymaking, clinical, and research implications were discussed.",We thank all teachers who completed the questionnaires.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Humans; Female; Depression; Mentalization; COVID-19; Anxiety; Burnout, Professional; School Teachers",2023-01-03,2023,2023-01-03,,20,1,859,All OA; Gold,Article,"Levante, Annalisa; Petrocchi, Serena; Bianco, Federica; Castelli, Ilaria; Lecciso, Flavia","Levante, Annalisa (Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy; Lab of Applied Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy); Petrocchi, Serena (Lab of Applied Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy; Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università della Svizzera Italiana, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland); Bianco, Federica (Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Bergamo, 24100 Bergamo, Italy); Castelli, Ilaria (Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Bergamo, 24100 Bergamo, Italy); Lecciso, Flavia (Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy; Lab of Applied Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Salento, 73100 Lecce, Italy)","Levante, Annalisa (University of Salento; University of Salento)","Levante, Annalisa (University of Salento; University of Salento); Petrocchi, Serena (University of Salento; University of Lugano); Bianco, Federica (University of Bergamo); Castelli, Ilaria (University of Bergamo); Lecciso, Flavia (University of Salento; University of Salento)",13,13,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/859/pdf?version=1672727396,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154216817,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Methods: A population-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using pooled data from the Demographic and Family Health Surveys of Peru, 2015-2019. A total sample of 8850 adolescent girls aged 12 to 19 years who reported a history of sexual intercourse were included. To identify factors related to adolescent pregnancy, the study employed adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The aPR were obtained from a multivariable logistic regression model.
Results: The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy among sexually active adolescents in Peru was 30.9% (95%CI: 29.4-32.4%). In the multivariable analysis; being 17-19 years (aPR: 1.48; 95%CI:1.33-1.64), being married or cohabitant (aPR: 4.01; 95%CI: 3.48-4.61) and belonging to the Quechua ethnicity group (aPR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.07-1.25), were associated with a higher prevalence. Conversely, the following factors were associated with a lower prevalence of pregnancy: being employed (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.76-0.86), being currently studying (aPR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.38-0.49), belonging to the second (aPR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.85-0.97), third (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.74-0.89), fourth (aPR: 0.79; 95%CI: 0.69-0.91) and fifth (aPR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.47-0.75) wealth quintile, initiating sexual relations in middle adolescente (aPR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.69-0.83) or late adolescence (aPR: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.35-0.46), perceiving a future pregnancy as a problem (aPR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.72-0.83) and having knowledge of the moment in the cycle when pregnancy can occur (aPR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.77-0.92).
Conclusions: Approximately three out of ten adolescents who initiated a sexual life had at least one pregnancy. Age, marital status, employment, education, wealth, ethnicity, age at first intercourse, knowledge of when in the cycle she may become pregnant, and perception of future pregnancy were associated with adolescent pregnancy. To decrease the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Peru, it is imperative to enhance national policies concerning family planning and provide comprehensive sex education targeted at adolescents.",,The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.,F1000Research,,,Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Adolescent; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Peru; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Surveys,2023-10-02,2023,2023-10-02,,11,,566,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caira-Chuquineyra, Brenda; Fernandez-Guzman, Daniel; Meza-Gómez, Adria; Luque-Mamani, Beatriz Milagros; Medina-Carpio, Shawny Luz; Mamani-García, Carlos S.; Romani-Peña, Marilia; Díaz-Vélez, Cristian","Caira-Chuquineyra, Brenda (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Fernandez-Guzman, Daniel (Escuela Profesional de Medicina Humana, Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Cusco, 0800, Peru); Meza-Gómez, Adria (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Luque-Mamani, Beatriz Milagros (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Medina-Carpio, Shawny Luz (Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa, Arequipa, Arequipa, 04001, Peru); Mamani-García, Carlos S.

Moreover, chronic stress can affect sleep. A unidirectional relationship has been established between burnout and sleep, and it is known that white-collar workers with burnout syndrome have sleep fragmentation and marked daytime sleepiness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between burnout and sleep quality in elementary school teachers in Mexico.
METHODS: We collected data from more than 400 teachers who completed tests. Correlation analyses controlled for anxiety and depression, and Poisson logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships of burnout with sleep quality, depression, and anxiety.
RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between burnout syndrome (mainly in the dimension of emotional exhaustion) and sleep disturbances; significant correlations were also observed with other burnout, depression, and anxiety dimensions. The strength of the correlations decreased after controlling for depression and anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of burnout syndrome in teachers can overlap with sleep disorders, so it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis to differentiate burnout syndrome from depression and anxiety, among others.",We sincerely acknowledge the teachers for their participation in this research.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Anthony Montgomery, Igor Portoghese, Renato Pisanti, Chiara Consiglio, Amal K.

To improve access to water, it has been argued that an important factor, if not the most important, is to strengthen water sector governance and reduce corruption. Looking at the relationship between governance indicators and access to water sources and controlling for various factors, our contribution fills a gap in proving empirically, for a cross-country analysis including 147 countries, that governance indeed matters. In particular, we add a nuance to the debate, showing that rural populations are more vulnerable to weak governance.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Anillo, Andrea; Boehm, Frédéric; Polo-Otero, José","Anillo, Andrea (Universidad del Norte); Boehm, Frédéric (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe); Polo-Otero, José (University of Barcelona)",,"Anillo, Andrea (Universidad del Norte); Boehm, Frédéric (Universidad Autónoma del Caribe); Polo-Otero, José (University of Barcelona)",0,0,,0.0,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/54820/1/MPRA_paper_54820.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102403838,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The mathematical theory of Brownian motion has been applied in contexts ranging far beyond the movement of particles in fluids. Until recently, stock market researchers have confronted the same problem. While they can chart the path of the market on a minute by minute basis it is very hard for them to observe who buys, who sells and how demand and supply affects price fluctuations. There exist many researchers about how the behavior of different investors makes the option price movement in a stock market. The purpose of this paper is to construct the black Scholes option pricing model in the stock markets by using of Brownian motion approach. The main ambition of this study is fourfold: 1) First we begin our approach to construction of Brownian motion from the simple symmetric random walk. 2) Next we introduce the Black – Scholes option pricing model with stock price movement by using of Geometric Brownian motion. 3) Then we extent this Brownian motion approach in the stock market and 4) Finally we construct the model for the generalization based on the deformation of the standard Brownian motion and Black Scholes pricing formula.

atomistic structure of two-dimensional crystals dictate their chemical,
electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. These properties change when
the two-dimensional and ideal crystal structure evolves into arbitrary shapes,
providing a direct and dramatic link among geometry and material properties due
to the larger structural flexibility when compared to bulk three-dimensional
materials. We describe methods to understand the local geometrical information
of two-dimensional conformal crystals quantitatively and directly from atomic
positions, even in the presence of atomistic defects. We then discuss direct
relations among the discrete geometry and chemically-relevant quantities
--mean-bond-lengths, hybridization angles and $\sigma-\pi$ hybridization. These
concepts are illustrated for carbon-based materials and ionic crystals. The
piramidalization angle turns out to be linearly proportional to the mean
curvature for relevant crystalline configurations. Discrete geometry provides
direct quantitative information on the potential chemistry of conformal
two-dimensional crystals.",,,arXiv,,,,2014-01-12,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Sanjuan, Alejandro A.

Assistive technologies can support this population, potentially improving their autonomy and promoting their participation in society. However, most existing research does not explicitly consider socio-cultural aspects, which differ between developing and developed countries. In this paper, we describe a multidisciplinary research line on technology-based assistive solutions for motor disabilities involving institutions in Colombia and Switzerland. The key aspect of our approach is the involvement of engineers, therapists, designers and end-users from early stages of the design process. This allowed us to characterize the local population with motor disabilities, highlighting a large incidence of violence-related injuries, reduced accessibility to assistive technologies and a perception of social exclusion. In the quest for context-suited solutions, we have developed a mechanical wheelchair and a sensorized facility for motor rehabilitation. The prototypes of these devices will be tested in the upcoming months. Importantly, we established a training program that uniquely covers both clinical and technical aspects of motor rehabilitation; providing experts from different domains with a common knowledge that facilitates the multidisciplinary work, enabling us to initiate experiments on clinical research; thus strengthening the links between academic, clinical and rehabilitation institutions.",This works have been supported by Colciencias and the Cooperation &amp; Development center of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne This works have been supported by Colciencias and the Cooperation &amp; Development center of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

mechanical, electronic and chemical properties. The local geometry of a surface
is determined from the two invariants of the metric and the curvature tensors.
Here we discuss those invariants directly from atomic positions in terms of
angles, areas, vertex and normal vectors from carbon atoms on the graphene
lattice, for arbitrary elastic regimes and atomic conformations, and without
recourse to an effective continuum model. The geometrical analysis of graphene
membranes under mechanical load is complemented with a study of the local
density of states (LDOS), discrete induced gauge potentials, velocity
renormalization, and non-trivial electronic effects originating from the scalar
deformation potential. The asymmetric LDOS is related to sublattice-specific
deformation potential differences, giving rise to the pseudomagnetic field. The
results here enable the study of geometrical, mechanical and electronic
properties for arbitrarily-shaped graphene membranes in experimentally-relevant
regimes without recourse to differential geometry and continuum elasticity.",,,arXiv,,,,2014-02-15,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Sanjuan, Alejandro A.

Imperatives to equip graduates to participate in the project of transformative constitutionalism since 1994 have had significant implications for curriculum reform and the training of lawyers. Perspectives on what the impact of transformative constitutionalism should be on legal education are drawn from the writing of Klare and Justices Langa and Moseneke. They focus attention on the need for a shift in legal culture and fundamental changes to the repertoire of legal reasoning skills that are required for all lawyers to work toward aligning the law with the values of the Constitution. However, in light of the data available on the success rates of students in higher education, it is clear that these aspirational goals will have to be harmonised with the challenges resulting from a legacy of educational disadvantage that persists twenty years after the demise of apartheid. An approach that is responsive to, and inclusive of all who seek to pursue the promise of transformative constitutionalism, must be firmly rooted in and embody the values enshrined in the Constitution.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Greenbaum, Lesley Anne","Greenbaum, Lesley Anne (University of Cape Town (UCT) - Faculty of Law)",,"Greenbaum, Lesley Anne (University of Cape Town)",2,0,,1.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102426629,39 Education; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,4 Quality Education
202,pub.1046030453,10.5194/bgd-11-5053-2014,,,Mangrove habitats provide refuge from climate change for reef-building corals,"Risk analyses indicate that more than 90% of the world's reefs will be threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts by the year 2030 under ""business as usual"" climate scenarios. Increasing temperatures and solar radiation cause coral bleaching that has resulted in extensive coral mortality. Increasing carbon dioxide reduces seawater pH, slows coral growth, and may cause loss of reef structure. Management strategies include establishment of marine protected areas with environmental conditions that promote reef resiliency. However, few resilient reefs have been identified, and resiliency factors are poorly defined. Here we characterize the first natural, non-reef, coral refuge from thermal stress and ocean acidification and identify resiliency factors for mangrove–coral habitats. We measured diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and seawater chemistry; characterized substrate parameters; and examined water circulation patterns in mangrove communities where scleractinian corals are growing attached to and under mangrove prop roots in Hurricane Hole, St. John, US Virgin Islands. Additionally, we inventoried the coral species and quantified incidences of coral bleaching, mortality and recovery for two major reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans and Diploria labyrinthiformis, growing in mangrove shaded and exposed (unshaded) areas. At least 33 species of scleractinian corals were growing in association with mangroves. Corals were thriving in low-light (more than 70% attenuation of incident PAR) from mangrove shading and at higher temperatures than nearby reef tract corals. A higher percentage of C. natans colonies was living shaded by mangroves, and no shaded colonies bleached. Fewer D. labyrinthiformis colonies were shaded by mangroves, however more unshaded colonies bleached. A combination of substrate and habitat heterogeniety, proximity of different habitat types, hydrographic conditions, and biological influences on seawater chemistry generate chemical conditions that buffer against ocean acidification. This previously undocumented refuge for corals provides evidence for adaptation of coastal organisms and ecosystem transition due to recent climate change. Identifying and protecting other natural, non-reef coral refuges is critical for sustaining corals and other reef species into the future.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2014-03-31,2014,2014-03-31,,11,3,5053-5088,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Yates, K.

It then decomposes the contribution of potential explanatory factors to the distributional changes. The US emerges as the frontier country, not because of on average better management, but because its best firms are far better than those of its close competitors. Part of the process of convergence to the frontier across the development process represents a trimming of the left tail, much es movement of the central mass and, for rich countries, it is actually the best firms than lag the frontier benchmark. Among potential explanatory variables that may drive convergence, ownership and human capital appear critical, the former especially for poorer countries and that latter for richer suggesting that the mechanics of convergence change across the process. These variables lose their explanatory power as firm and average country management quality rises.

Baade's Window. uvby images were collected with EFOSC2@NTT, while NIR catalogs
are based on VIRCAM@VISTA and SOFI@NTT data. The matching with HST photometry
allowed us to obtain proper-motion-cleaned samples of cluster and bulge stars.
The huge color sensitivity of Stroemgren-NIR CMDs helped us in disentangling
age and metallicity effects. The RGB of NGC6528 is reproduced by scaled-solar
isochrones with solar abundance or alpha-enhanced isochrones with the same iron
content, and an age of t = 11+/-1 Gyr. These findings support literature age
estimates for NGC6528. We also performed a theoretical metallicity calibration
based on the Stroemgren index m1 and on visual-NIR colors for RGs, by adopting
scaled-solar and alpha-enhanced models. We applied the calibration to estimate
the metallicity of NGC6528, finding [Fe/H] = -0.04+/-0.02, with an intrinsic
dispersion of 0.27 dex (by averaging abundances based on the scaled-solar [m],
y - J and [m], y - K Metallicity-Index-Color relations), and of -0.11+/-0.01
(sig = 0.27 dex), by using the m1, y - J and m1, y - K relations. These
findings support the results of Zoccali et al. (2004) which give [Fe/H] =
-0.10+/-0.2, and a low alpha-enhancement, [alpha/Fe] = 0.1, and of Carretta et
al. (2001), that find [Fe/H] = 0.07+/-0.01, with [alpha/Fe] = 0.2. By applying
the scaled-solar MIC relations to Baade's window RGs, we find a metallicity
distribution extending from [Fe/H] ~ -1.0 to ~ 1 dex, with peaks at [Fe/H] ~
-0.2 and +0.55 ([m], y - J and [m], y - K relations), and [Fe/H] ~ -0.25 and
+0.4 (m1, y - J and m1, y - K relations). These findings are in good agreement
with the spectroscopic studies of Hill et al. (2011) for the Baade's window, of
Uttenthaler et al. (2012) for a region centered at (l,b) = (0, -10), and with

131,pub.1038528210,10.5194/acpd-14-32979-2014,,,OH populations and temperatures from simultaneous spectroscopic observations of 25 bands,"OH rotational temperatures are widely used to derive mesopause temperatures and their variations. Since most data sets are only based on a fixed set of lines of a single band, it is important to know possible systematic uncertainties related to the choice of lines. Therefore, a comprehensive study of as many as possible OH bands is desirable. For this purpose, astronomical echelle spectrographs at large telescopes are the most suitable instruments. They offer a wide wavelength coverage, relatively high spectral resolution, and high sensitivity. Moreover, since each ground-based astronomical observation has an imprint of the Earth's atmosphere, the data archives of large astronomical facilities are a treasure for atmospheric studies. For our project, we used archival data of the medium-resolution X-shooter echelle spectrograph operated by the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal in Chile. The instrument can simultaneously observe all OH bands that are accessible from ground. We reduced and analysed a set of 343 high-quality spectra taken between 2009 and 2013 to measure OH line intensities and to derive rotational and vibrational temperatures of 25 bands from OH(8-2) to OH(9-7). We studied the influence of the selected line set, OH band, upper vibrational level v′, and the molecular data on the derived level populations and temperatures. The rotational temperature results indicate differences by several degrees depending on the selection. There is a discrepancy for bands of even and odd v′, which increases with v′. A study of the temporal variations revealed that the v′ from to 2 to 9 show a clear trend in the change of the variability pattern. In particular, the spread of temperatures tends to increase during the night, and the time of the minimum temperature depends on v′. The vibrational temperatures depend on the range of v′ used for their determination, since the higher vibrational levels from 7 to 9 seem to be overpopulated compared to the lower levels. The vibrational temperature tends to increase during the night, while the intensity decreases. Our results support the assumption that the OH emission altitude depends on v′. Moreover, the emission layer appears to rise in the course of the night, which makes the OH thermalisation less efficient. The derived rotational temperatures and their change with v′ seem to be significantly affected by non-equilibrium populations.",,,EGUsphere,,,,2014-12-23,2014,2014-12-23,,14,23,32979-33043,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Noll, S.; Kausch, W.; Kimeswenger, S.; Unterguggenberger, S.; Jones, A.

The research focused on devising indicators on university–community engagement by conceptualising engagement as ‘interconnectedness’. Interconnectedness describes the relationship (in tension) of academics engaging with those outside of the university while simultaneously linking back to the university. Interconnectedness is operationalised along two dimensions: (1) ‘articulation’ which describes the extent to which engagement activities link to the university’s strategic objectives and to external constituents in a sustainable manner, and (2) the ‘academic core’ which describes the extent to which engagement activities link to the university’s core functions of research and teaching and learning. Broadly speaking, the study aimed to develop a deeper understanding of the tension inherent in university engagement activities and, in particular, how these activities impact on the university as key knowledge producer. The study found that it is possible to develop a set of indicators to assess the extent to which university engagement activities are articulated and strengthening the core functions of universities. The concept of interconnectedness provides a useful framework for operationalising research on engagement activities, and the indicators and their graphical representation provide a useful tool for identifying patterns, and for revealing and confirming informative dimensions of university–community engagement activities. The study suggests that engagement between university academics and those external to the university is active. The nature of this engagement, however, varies considerably and, more portentously, based on the findings of this study, the degree to which such engagement activities can be said to be strengthening the university as key knowledge producing institution is uneven and too frequently marginal.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"van Schalkwyk, Francois","van Schalkwyk, Francois (Stellenbosch University)",,"van Schalkwyk, Francois (Stellenbosch University)",5,2,,1.67,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/University_Engagement_as_Interconnectedness_Indicators_and_Insights/1267271/1/files/1833233.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101734041,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",

Las historias que nos unen. 21 relatos para la integración entre Perú y Chile reúne algunos artículos escritos por autores peruanos, otros por autores chilenos, y varios por parejas de autores, uno de cada país. Todos estos escritos son relatos de hermanamiento entre los dos países a través de historias de amistad que tocan aspectos políticos, sociales y, principalmente, de la vida cotidiana, y por medio de historias vinculadas a Tarapacá y la región de frontera que se extiende hasta Tacna. Este volumen no intenta obviar los eventos dolorosos de la historia, sobre los que ambas colectividades deberían conversar con madurez y respeto en un futuro cercano. Más bien, la compilación busca ampliar la mirada sobre nuestro pasado común para mostrar que chilenos y peruanos protagonizaron intensos episodios de amistad que ameritan ser recordados, como el aporte del libertador chileno Bernardo O´Higgins a la Independencia del Perú, la admiración al bolerista peruano Lucho Barrios en Chile, la influencia de la culinaria nacional en el país del sur. Estos, entre muchos otros temas, configuran un recorrido por el pasado peruano-chileno que desconocemos, aquel que traza los lazos de unión que deben acercar a las generaciones del futuro.",,,,,"Daniel Parodi Revoredo, Sergio Gonzáles Miranda",,2014,2014,2023,2014,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Edited Book,,,,,1,0,,,https://repositorio.pucp.edu.pe/index/bitstream/123456789/173141/1/Las%20historias%20que%20nos%20unen.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156997365,,

31,pub.1046367421,10.4324/9781315815190,,,Radio Audiences and Participation in the Age of Network Society,"This book maps, describes and further explores all contemporary forms of interaction between radio and its public, with a specific focus on those forms of content co-creation that link producers and listeners. Each essay will analyze one or more case studies, piecing together a map of emerging co-creation practices in contemporary radio. Contributors describe the rise of a new class of radio listeners: the networked ones. Networked audiences are made up of listeners that are not only able to produce written and audio content for radio and co-create along with the radio producers (even definitively bypassing the central hub of the radio station, by making podcasts), but that also produce social data, calling for an alternative rating system, which is less focused on attention and more on other sources, such as engagement, sentiment, affection, reputation, and influence. What are the economic and political consequences of this paradigm shift? How are radio audiences perceived by radio producers in this new radioscape? What’s the true value of radio audiences in this new frame? How do radio audiences take part in the radio flow in this age? Are audiences’ interactions and co-creations overrated or underrated by radio producers? To what extent listeners' generated content can be considered a form of participation or ""free labour"" exploitation? What’s the role of community radio in this new context? These are some of the many issues that this book aims to explore.

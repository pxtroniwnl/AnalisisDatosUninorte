A puzzling aspect of ZIKV emergence is that all human outbreaks and birth defects to date have been exclusively associated with the Asian ZIKV lineage, despite a growing body of laboratory evidence pointing towards higher transmissibility and pathogenicity of the African ZIKV lineage. Whether this apparent paradox reflects the use of relatively old African ZIKV strains in most laboratory studies is unclear. Here, we experimentally compare seven low-passage ZIKV strains representing the recently circulating viral genetic diversity. We find that recent African ZIKV strains display higher transmissibility in mosquitoes and higher lethality in both adult and fetal mice than their Asian counterparts. We emphasize the high epidemic potential of African ZIKV strains and suggest that they could more easily go unnoticed by public health surveillance systems than Asian strains due to their propensity to cause fetal loss rather than birth defects.","We thank Catherine Lallemand for assistance with mosquito rearing, the Institut Pasteur animal facility staff for the breeding of Ifnar1−/− mice.

With the current global COVID-19 pandemics, the usual health care service has been significantly altered in many aspects. Given the fragile health system and high number of immunocompromised populations in lower and lower-middle income countries, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are anticipated to be worse. In such scenarios, technological solutions like, Telemedicine which is defined as the delivery of healthcare service remotely using telecommunication technologies for exchange of medical information, diagnosis, consultation and treatment is critical. The aim of this study was to assess healthcare providers' acceptance and preferred modality of telemedicine and factors thereof among health professionals working in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A multi-centric online survey was conducted via social media platforms such as telegram channels, Facebook groups/pages and email during Jul 1- Sep 21, 2020. The questionnaire was adopted from previously validated model in low income setting. Internal consistency of items was assessed using Cronbach alpha (α), composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) to evaluate both discriminant and convergent validity of constructs. The extent of relationship among variables were evaluated by Structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS Amos version 23.
RESULTS: From the expected 423 responses, 319 (75.4%) participants responded to the survey questionnaire during the data collection period. The majority of participants were male (78.1%), age <30 (76.8%) and had less than five years of work experience (78.1%). The structural model result confirmed the hypothesis ""self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on effort expectancy"" with a standardized coefficient estimate (β) of 0.76 and p-value <0.001. The result also indicated that self-efficacy, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence have a significant direct effect on user's attitude toward using telemedicine. User's behavioral intention to use telemedicine was also influenced by effort expectancy and attitude. The model also ruled out that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence does not directly influence user's intention to use telemedicine. The squared multiple correlations (r2) value indicated that 57.1% of the variance in attitude toward using telemedicine and 63.6% of the variance in behavioral intention to use telemedicine is explained by the current structural model.
CONCLUSION: This study found that effort expectancy and attitude were significantly predictors of healthcare professionals' acceptance of telemedicine. Attitude toward using telemedicine systems was also highly influenced by performance expectancy, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions. effort expectancy and attitude were also significant mediators in predicting users' acceptance of telemedicine. In addition, mHealth approach was the most preferred modality of telemedicine and this opens an opportunity to integrate telemedicine systems in the health system during and post pandemic health services in low-income countries.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, pregnancy disorders and cardiovascular diseases, and have emerged as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the detection, prognosis and therapeutics of a myriad of diseases. In this review, we describe recent advances related to the regulatory mechanisms of exosome biogenesis, release and molecular composition, as well as their role in health and disease, and their potential use as disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of their main isolation methods, characterization and cargo analysis, as well as the experimental methods used for exosome-mediated drug delivery, are discussed.

METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to a cohort of persons from the general population of eight countries: Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) from April 22 to May 5 and May 26 to June 1, 2020. Country-level stringency indices were adopted from the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Primary outcomes were HRQoL, measured using the EQ-5D-5L, and mental well-being, measured using the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being (WHO-5).
FINDINGS: 21,354 respondents were included in the study. Diseased respondents had lower EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 scores compared to healthy respondents. Younger respondents had lower WHO-5 scores than older respondents. The stringency index had a stronger association with the EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 among diseased respondents compared to healthy respondents. Increasing stringency was associated with an increase in EQ-5D-5L scores but a decrease in the WHO-5 index.
CONCLUSION: The stringency of government response is inversely related to HRQoL and mental well-being with a small positive relation with HRQoL and strong negative relation with mental well-being. The magnitude of effects differed for healthy and diseased persons and by age but was most favourable for diseased and older persons.","We thank Periklis Charalampous, Vanessa Gorasso, Svetlana S.

This study longitudinally examines the effect of the perceived impact of COVID-19 on comfort food consumption and whether this effect is mediated by emotional distress. A convenience sample of 1048 students and university staff (academic and non-academic) from two universities completed monthly online surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic across six waves (W; W1 to W6). Participants reported their perceived impact of COVID-19 (economic, interpersonal, and health), comfort food consumption, and emotional distress (DASS-21). Using structural equation models, we found an indirect longitudinal effect of the perceived impact of COVID-19 (W1) on comfort food consumption (W3 to W6) through increased emotional distress (W2). The perceived negative impact of COVID-19 on comfort food consumption was fully mediated by the emotional distress during the first waves (W3 and W4), ending in a partial mediation in the last waves (W5 and W6). These findings contribute to disentangling the mechanisms by which the perceived impact of COVID-19 affects comfort food consumption over time, and highlight the role of emotional distress. Future interventions should address comfort food consumption by focusing on handling emotional distress during a crisis.",,"This research was funded by National Research and Development Agency (ANID, Chile), grant number COVID0282.",Nutrients,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Diet; Emotions; Faculty; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Perception; Psychological Distress; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult",2021-06-02,2021,2021-06-02,,13,6,1910,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salazar-Fernández, Camila; Palet, Daniela; Haeger, Paola A.; Mella, Francisca Román","Salazar-Fernández, Camila (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco 478000, Chile;, camila.salazar@ufrontera.cl, (C.S.-F.);, daniela.palet@ufrontera.cl, (D.P.)); Palet, Daniela (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco 478000, Chile;, camila.salazar@ufrontera.cl, (C.S.-F.);, daniela.palet@ufrontera.cl, (D.P.)); Haeger, Paola A.

Therefore, having access to an automatic, reliable system that is able to detect the presence of melanoma via a dermatoscopic image of lesions and/or skin pigmentation can be a very useful tool in the area of medical diagnosis.
MethodsAmong state-of-the-art methods used for automated or computer assisted medical diagnosis, attention should be drawn to Deep Learning based on Convolutional Neural Networks, wherewith segmentation, classification and detection systems for several diseases have been implemented. The method proposed in this paper involves an initial stage that automatically crops the region of interest within a dermatoscopic image using the Mask and Region-based Convolutional Neural Network technique, and a second stage based on a ResNet152 structure, which classifies lesions as either “benign” or “malignant”.ResultsTraining, validation and testing of the proposed model was carried out using the database associated to the challenge set out at the 2017 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging. On the test data set, the proposed model achieves an increase in accuracy and balanced accuracy of 3.66% and 9.96%, respectively, with respect to the best accuracy and the best sensitivity/specificity ratio reported to date for melanoma detection in this challenge. Additionally, unlike previous models, the specificity and sensitivity achieve a high score (greater than 0.8) simultaneously, which indicates that the model is good for accurate discrimination between benign and malignant lesion, not biased towards any of those classes.ConclusionsThe results achieved with the proposed model suggest a significant improvement over the results obtained in the state of the art as far as performance of skin lesion classifiers (malignant/benign) is concerned.",Not applicable.,FundingNot applicable.

METHODS: The study included a total of 624 young adults aged 21-30 years from the Ellisras rural area. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure (BP), and biochemical measurements were measured.
RESULTS: BRI was significantly correlated with insulin (0.252 males, females 0.255), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-β (0.250 males, females 0.245), and TG (0.310 males, females 0.216). Conicity Index was significantly associated with pulse rate (PR) (β 0.099, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.017, 0.143, p < 0.013; β 0.081, 95% CI 0.000 0.130, p < 0.048), insulin (β 0.149, 95% CI 0.286 0.908, p < 0.001; β 0.110, 95% CI 0.123 0.757, p < 0.007). Conicity Index is associated with insulin resistance (IR) (odds ratio (OR) 7.761, 95% CI 5.783 96.442, p < 0.001; OR 4.646, 95% CI 2.792 74.331, p < 0.007), underweight (OR 0.023, 95% CI 0.251 0.433, p < 0.001; OR 0.031, 95% CI 0.411 0.612, p < 0.001), and obesity (OR 1.058, 95% CI 271.5 4.119, p < 0.001; OR 1.271, 95% CI 0.672 1.099, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Conicity Index was positively associated with insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Further investigation of these indices and their association with nutritional status and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) could assist in efforts to prevent CVD in the rural South African population.","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the National Research Foundation of South Africa, Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the University of Limpopo.

It has a crucial function in tumor development and metastasis. Thus, angiogenesis has become one of the most exciting targets for drug development in cancer treatment. Here we discuss the regulatory effects on angiogenesis in glioblastoma (GBM) of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long ncRNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA). These ncRNAs may function in trans or cis forms and modify gene transcription by various mechanisms, including epigenetics. NcRNAs may also serve as crucial regulators of angiogenesis-inducing molecules. These molecules include, metalloproteinases, cytokines, several growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, and epidermal growth factor), phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transforming growth factor signaling pathways.",,,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,,,2021-09-27,2021,2021-09-27,,9,,716462,All OA; Gold,Article,"Balandeh, Ebrahim; Mohammadshafie, Kimia; Mahmoudi, Yaser; Pourhanifeh, Mohammad Hossein; Rajabi, Ali; Bahabadi, Zahra Razaghi; Mohammadi, Amir Hossein; Rahimian, Neda; Hamblin, Michael R.; Mirzaei, Hamed","Balandeh, Ebrahim (Department of Clinical Psychology, School of Medicine, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran); Mohammadshafie, Kimia (Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Golestan University, Gorgan, Iran); Mahmoudi, Yaser (Department of Anatomical Sciences, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran); Pourhanifeh, Mohammad Hossein (Razi Drug Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Rajabi, Ali (Razi Drug Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; School of Medicine, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran); Bahabadi, Zahra Razaghi (Razi Drug Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; School of Medicine, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran); Mohammadi, Amir Hossein (Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran); Rahimian, Neda (Endocrine Research Center, Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Hamblin, Michael R.

A total of 31 contigs is assembled with a total length of 3,264,448 bases, with all contigs matching the core genome of different groups in the database. The genome size is 3,540,752 bases with GC content of 44.53% and the genome repeat sequences constitute around 457,386 bases of the assembly. The UTNGt2 matches the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum genome with 99% identity. The genome contains 3115 genes, 3052 protein-coding genes, assigned with the EggNOG database. On the basis of the results, 745 proteins are classified with an unknown function, from which 128 proteins have no match in the BLASTN database. It also contains 57 tRNAs, 5 copies of 5S rRNA, and 1 copy of tmRNA. Based on gene prediction and annotation results, 9.4% of proteins are involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism and 8.46% in transcription, 2.36% are responsible for defense mechanisms, 0.5% are responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, transport, and catabolism, while 25.11% have an unknown function. The genome revealed the presence of genes involved in riboflavin and folate production, the presence of CRISPR/Cas genes, phage sequences, the absence of acquired antibiotics resistance genes, virulence, and pathogenic factors, suggesting that UTNGt2 is a safe strain. Its highly antimicrobial capacity is related to the presence of two bacteriocin clusters (class IIc) of the sactipeptide class (contig 4) and plantaricin E class (contig 22), as detected by the BAGEL 4 webserver. Several RiPP-like peptides (non-bactericidal ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified peptides), polyketides (PKs), and terpenes were predicted. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that the UTNGt2 strain has diverse bacteriocins with a high inhibitory capacity, thus it is a bacteriocinogenic strain. Considering the safety profile, UTNGt2 is a nonpathogenic, nonvirulent strain with valuable biotechnological traits and can be further exploited for its probiotic and antimicrobial potential in the food industry or as a potential producer strain of antimicrobial peptides as an alternative to conventional antibiotics.","The authors are thankful to Technical University of the North, Centre of Research (CUICYT) for funding this research.

There are many ways to detect it, among them, with the use of blood biomarkers such as albumin, although the association between the two has not been confirmed yet.
This review synthesizes the knowledge on the association between sarcopenia and serum albumin among elderly individuals through a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on the etiology and risk factors. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute software for the review and conducted a search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS databases while two reviewers conducted an independent manual search. EpiDat, version 3.1 was used for the meta-analysis; mean differences with the albumin scores disaggregated by sarcopenia were analyzed by the random-effects model. The degree of heterogeneity was assessed with the DerSimonian and Laird Q test.
We analyzed 630 articles and finally included 14 in the review. Higher blood albumin levels were found in the meta-analysis, which was statistically significant among the elderly adults who did not present sarcopenia compared to those who did. Although there are studies exploring the association between albumin and sarcopenia, there is a need to continue evaluating its association with biological markers and comparing them to verify which can be used to detect sarcopenia among the elderly.",,,Biomédica,,,Aged; Aging; Humans; Risk Factors; Sarcopenia; Serum Albumin,2021-09-22,2021,2021-09-22,,41,3,590-603,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto; Rojas-Huayta, Violeta Magdalena; Aparco-Balboa, Juan Pablo; Céspedes-Panduro, Bernardo; Partezani-Rodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida","Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto (Escola de Enfermagem, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil, Universidade de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Centro Brasileiro para o Cuidado à Saúde Baseado em Evidências: Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil, Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil); Rojas-Huayta, Violeta Magdalena (Núcleo de Investigación en Alimentación y Nutrición Pública, Escuela de Nutrición, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil); Aparco-Balboa, Juan Pablo (Núcleo de Investigación en Alimentación y Nutrición Pública, Escuela de Nutrición, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil); Céspedes-Panduro, Bernardo (Núcleo de Investigación en Alimentación y Nutrición Pública, Escuela de Nutrición, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil; Escuela de Estadística, Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Perú, Universidade São Marcos, Escuela de Estadística, Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Brazil; Facultad de Estudios Generales, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú, Universidad Privada del Norte, Facultad de Estudios Generales, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Partezani-Rodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida (Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brasil, Universidade de São Paulo, Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil)","Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto (Universidade de São Paulo; Centro Brasileiro para o Cuidado à Saúde Baseado em Evidências: Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil, Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil)","Silva-Fhon, Jack Roberto (Universidade de São Paulo; Centro Brasileiro para o Cuidado à Saúde Baseado em Evidências: Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil, Centro de Evidência do JBI, São Paulo, Brasil); Rojas-Huayta, Violeta Magdalena (National University of San Marcos); Aparco-Balboa, Juan Pablo (National University of San Marcos); Céspedes-Panduro, Bernardo (National University of San Marcos; National University of San Marcos; Private University of the North); Partezani-Rodrigues, Rosalina Aparecida (Universidade de São Paulo)",30,25,3.4,13.54,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5765/4813,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141364926,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

We investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nifurtimox administered as divisible, dispersible 30 mg and 120 mg tablets in children with Chagas disease. In this blinded, controlled study conducted January 2016-July 2018, 330 patients aged <18 years from 25 medical centres across three South American countries were randomised 2:1 to nifurtimox 10-20 mg/kg/day (aged <12 years) or 8-10 mg/kg/day (aged ≥12 years) for 60 days (n = 219), or for 30 days plus placebo for 30 days (n = 111) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974). The primary outcome was anti-Trypanosoma cruzi serological response (negative seroconversion or seroreduction ≥20% in mean optical density from baseline determined by two conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) at 12 months in the 60-day treatment group versus historical placebo controls. Nifurtimox for 60 days achieved negative seroconversion (n = 10) and seroreduction (n = 62) in 72 patients (serological response 32.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26.4%, 39.3%, of all treated patients), confirming superiority relative to the upper 95% CI of 16% for controls. In patients aged <8 months, 10/12 treated for 60 days (83.3%) and 5/7 treated for 30 days (71.4%) achieved negative seroconversion. Overall serological response was lower for 30-day than for 60-day nifurtimox (between-treatment difference 14.0% [95% CI 3.7%, 24.2%]). The frequency of T. cruzi-positive quantitative polymerase chain reactions decreased substantially from baseline levels (60-day regimen 53.4% versus 1.4%; 30-day regimen 51.4% versus 4.5%). Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which were observed in 62 patients (28.3%) treated for 60 days and 29 patients (26.1%) treated for 30 days, were generally mild or moderate and resolved without sequelae; 4.2% of all TEAEs led to nifurtimox discontinuation. Age- and weight-adjusted nifurtimox for 60 days achieved a serological response at 12 months post-treatment that was superior to historical placebo, was well tolerated and had a favourable safety profile in children with Chagas disease. Although, at 1 year serological follow-up, efficacy of the shorter nifurtimox treatment was not comparable to the 60-day treatment regimen for the overall study population, further long-term follow-up of the patients will provide important information about the progress of serological conversion in children treated with nifurtimox, as well as the potential efficacy difference between the two regimens over time.","JA has acted as a consultant to Bayer for the design, conduct and review of the CHICO and SECURE studies.

This study aimed to compare students' performance in team-based learning and traditional lectures.
METHODS: A total of 176 class 4 and 202 class 6 medical students from University of Bahri, Khartoum, Sudan, participated in the study during 2018. Experienced staff were selected to conduct the teaching and assessment of the two groups, using the standard team-based learning procedure (iRAT, gRAT and AppT) in the first topic and the lecture-based learning procedure in the second, within the same time limit for the two methods.
RESULTS: The two classes overall mean score has a significant 5.1 points difference (p<0.001; 95% CI: 3.5, 6.0). Separate analysis showed consistency of superiority of TBL to LBL in either gender. A remarkable difference was observed when we compared the two methods in class 6 separately from class 4. Class 6 mean score was high for both TBL and LBL (77.2 and 70.2, respectively), with a significant mean difference of 7.0 (p<0.001; 95% CI: 5.1, 8.9). In class 4, the score was lower for both methods (mean of 62.8 for TBL and 59.9 for LBL). The mean difference of 2.95 points was still significant (p<0.05; 95% CI: 0.46, 5.43). Separate multivariate linear regression for TBL and LBL showed no significant difference in performance of males and females in either method. Controlling for gender in TBL, class 4 had a mean of -14.26 points, (p<0.001; 95% CI: -12.54, -15.98) less than class 6.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play crucial role in virtually all cellular processes of both plants and animals, such as cell growth, cell division, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The study of rice MIR168a has demonstrated for the first time that exogenous plant MIR168a influences cholesterol transport in mice by inhibiting low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 expression. Inspired by this finding, the cross-kingdom regulation of plant-derived miRNAs has drawn a lot of attention because of its capability to provide novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of miRNA deregulation-related diseases. Notably, unlike mRNA, some plant miRNAs are robust because of their 3' end modification, high G, C content, and the protection by microvesicles, miRNAs protein cofactors or plant ingredients. The stability of these small molecules guarantees the reliability of plant miRNAs in clinical application. Although the function of endogenous miRNAs has been widely investigated, the cross-kingdom regulation of plant-derived miRNAs is still in its infancy. Herein, this review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the anti-virus, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, immune modulation, and intestinal function regulation effects of plant-derived miRNAs in mammals. It is expected that exploring the versatile role of plant-derived miRNAs may lay the foundation for further study and application of these newly recognized, non-toxic, and inexpensive plant active ingredients.",,"Funding.

A model was tested that evaluated the contribution of socio-demographic factors and fear of COVID-19 on anxiety and depression in samples of residents in seven Latin American countries (Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, and El Salvador). A total of 4,881 individuals, selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. Moderate and severe levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety were identified, as well as a moderate average level of fear of COVID-19. In addition, it was observed that about a quarter of the participants presented symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and a major depressive episode. Fear of COVID-19 significantly and positively predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas the effects of socio-demographic variables are generally low [χ2(287) = 5936.96, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.064 [0.062, 0.065]; CFI = 0.947; and SRMR = 0.050].

We evaluate several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in a butterfly family, the Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generate a time-calibrated phylogeny containing 2,866 nymphalid species (~45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the latitudinal diversity gradient among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. The Neotropical diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and biotic interchanges with other regions are rare. Southeast Asia is also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, is the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, combined with tropical niche conservatism, played a major role in generating the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of nymphalid butterflies.","This study would not have been possible without the generous support of amateur and professional lepidopterists around the world, too many to name here; thank you to all for providing specimens and information about life histories of the butterflies.

Results: A total of 8,115 participants were included, with a mean age of 20. The percentage of no PA per week increased significantly and then slightly fell, and that of ≥150 min/week substantially decreased and then rebounded partially (all p < 0.001) (for instance, the percentage of ≥150 min/week of PA total decreased from 38.6 to 19.4%, then rebounded back to 25.3%). Means hours per day spent in sedentary behaviors had significantly increased during lockdown comparing to pre-COVID-19 (all p < 0.001). There were more participants reported reduced PA level than those indicated increased, and more participating youths had their sedentary behavior level increased than those who had it decreased. Conclusions: The study found COVID-19 had both immediate and longer-term impacts on self-reported physical activities and sedentary behaviors among Chinese youths. Relevant efforts should be strengthened to get youths physically moving again.",,Funding.

BACKGROUND: The nursing profession involves high work stress due to emotional involvement, workload and available resources.
METHODS: Descriptive multicentric cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and migration data were collected and participants completed the Job Satisfaction Questionnaire S20/23 and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The data were analysed using descriptive statistical methods using the program SPSS.
RESULTS: The sample included 228 nurses (187 women and 41 men), with a mean age of 37.11 ± 10.87. Reported job satisfaction was medium to high. Overall, values were low in emotional fatigue and medium in depersonalization and personal fulfilment. In terms of migration, 21.59% of the participants had already moved to other Spanish regions or another country, while 18.58% had the intention of doing so.
CONCLUSION: Nurses with a temporary contract showed a high burnout rate, and high levels of emotional fatigue, depersonalization and lack of personal fulfilment.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Strategies are needed to improve working and contractual conditions such as enhancing teamwork, management and leadership skills in nurses; achieving internal promotion; and having higher participation in decision-making and a better balance of power between health institution managers and health professionals.",,"Funding information This study was partially financed by Generalitat de Catalunya, Serra Hunter Programme, and University of Lleida financial aid to promote deficit research areas",Journal of Nursing Management,,,"Burnout, Professional; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Nurses; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workload",2021-06-27,2021,2021-06-27,2021-10,29,7,2208-2215,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acea‐López, Lorena; del Mar Pastor‐Bravo, María; Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther; Bellon, Filip; Blanco‐Blanco, Joan; Gea‐Sanchez, Montserrat; Briones‐Vozmediano, Erica","Acea‐López, Lorena (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain); del Mar Pastor‐Bravo, María (Department of Nursing, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain; ENFERAVANZA research group, IMIB‐Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain); Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; CIBER of Diabetes and Associated Cardiometabolic Diseases (CIBERDEM), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Barcelona, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Bellon, Filip (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Blanco‐Blanco, Joan (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Gea‐Sanchez, Montserrat (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain); Briones‐Vozmediano, Erica (Department of Nursing and Physiotherapy, Lector Serra Húnter, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Society, Health, Education and Culture Research Group (GESEC) of the University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain)","Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Lleida)","Acea‐López, Lorena (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain); del Mar Pastor‐Bravo, María (University of Murcia; ENFERAVANZA research group, IMIB‐Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain); Rubinat‐Arnaldo, Esther (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Lleida); Bellon, Filip (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida); Blanco‐Blanco, Joan (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida); Gea‐Sanchez, Montserrat (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida); Briones‐Vozmediano, Erica (University of Lleida; Health Care Research Group (GRECS) ‐ IRB Lleida, Lleida, Spain; University of Lleida)",18,13,2.86,8.45,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jonm.13376,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138105445,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,

Of particular interest is the LP family of surfactin, immunogenic molecules involved in induced systemic resistance (ISR) and the bacterial colonization of plant surfaces. We hypothesize that the concentration of surfactin produced by a strain correlates directly with its ability to colonize and persist on different plant surfaces, which conditions its capacity to trigger ISR. We used two Bacillus velezensis strains (BBC023 and BBC047), whose antagonistic potential in vitro is practically identical, but not on plant surfaces. The surfactin production of BBC047 is 1/3 higher than that of BBC023. Population density and SEM images revealed stable biofilms of BBC047 on leaves and roots, activating ISR on both plant surfaces. Despite its lower surfactin production, strain BBC023 assembled stable biofilms on roots and activated ISR. However, on leaves only isolated, unstructured populations were observed, which could not activate ISR. Thus, the ability of a strain to effectively colonize a plant surface is not only determined through its production of surfactin. Multiple aspects, such as environmental stressors or compensation mechanisms may influence the process. Finally, the importance of surfactin lies in its impacts on biofilm formation and stable colonization, which finally enables its activity as an elicitor of ISR.","The authors are thankful to Stefanie Maldonado, Williams Arancibia and Juan Pablo Araya for technical support in the laboratory, UCN Coquimbo for granting access to the SEM platform as well as to Servicios y Almacigos SA for providing assistance with seedling growth.","This research was funded by Projects BIP 30127532 and BIP 30403034 (Regional Fund of Innovation for Competitiveness Coquimbo Region FIC-R, Chile) (A.S.) and ANID Beca Doctorado Nacional Grant/Award N° 21140504 (R.S.-M.).",Microorganisms,,,,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,9,11,2251,All OA; Gold,Article,"Stoll, Alexandra; Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo; González, Máximo; Araya, Michael","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Departamento de Biología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena 1720170, Chile;, rsmesteban@gmail.com); Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo (Programa de Doctorado en Biología y Ecología Aplicada, Departamento de Biología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena 1720170, Chile;, rsmesteban@gmail.com); González, Máximo (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl); Araya, Michael (Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Algas CIDTA, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile;, mmaraya@ucn.cl)","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; University of La Serena)","Stoll, Alexandra (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl; University of La Serena); Salvatierra-Martínez, Ricardo (University of La Serena); González, Máximo (Laboratorio de Microbiología Aplicada, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena 1720256, Chile;, maximo.gonzalez@ceaza.cl); Araya, Michael (Catholic University of the North)",33,23,2.84,7.93,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/11/2251/pdf?version=1635429038,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143009653,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,2 Zero Hunger

In addition to food/beverage and cosmetic applications, citrus EOs could also potentially be used as an alternative to antibiotics in food-producing animals. A commercial citrus EO-Brazilian Orange Terpenes (BOT)-was fractionated by vacuum fractional distillation to separate BOT into various fractions: F1, F2, F3, and F4. Next, the chemical composition and biological activities of BOT and its fractions were characterized. Results showed the three first fractions had a high relative amount of limonene (≥10.86), even higher than the whole BOT. Conversely, F4 presented a larger relative amount of BOT's minor compounds (carvone, cis-carveol, trans-carveol, cis-p-Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, and trans-p-Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol) and a very low relative amount of limonene (0.08-0.13). Antibacterial activity results showed F4 was the only fraction exhibiting this activity, which was selective and higher activity on a pathogenic bacterium (E. coli) than on a beneficial bacterium (Lactobacillus sp.). However, F4 activity was lower than BOT. Similarly, F4 displayed the highest antioxidant activity among fractions (equivalent to BOT). These results indicated that probably those minor compounds that detected in F4 would be more involved in conferring the biological activities for this fraction and consequently for the whole BOT, instead of the major compound, limonene, playing this role exclusively.","The authors are grateful to CIENCIACTIVA from the “Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Inovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru; Contract 278-2015-FONDECYT) and to the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES, Brazil) for Carmen M.S.

With the aim of finding non-toxic and effective P-gp inhibitors, we investigated a panel of quinolin-2-one-pyrimidine hybrids. Among the active compounds, two of them significantly increased intracellular doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 accumulation by inhibiting the efflux mediated by P-gp and restored doxorubicin toxicity at nanomolar range. Structure–activity relationships showed that the number of methoxy groups, an optimal length of the molecule in its extended conformation, and at least one flexible methylene group bridging the quinolinone to the moiety bearing the pyrimidine favored the inhibitory potency of P-gp. The best compounds showed a similar binding pattern and interactions to those of doxorubicin and tariquidar, as revealed by MD and hybrid QM/MM simulations performed with the recent experimental structure of P-gp co-crystallized with paclitaxel. Analysis of the molecular interactions stabilizing the different molecular complexes determined by MD and QTAIM showed that binding to key residues from TMH 4–7 and 12 is required for inhibition.","This work was supported by the Universidad Católica de Córdoba, CONICET (PIP 2014-2016), FONCyT (PICT 2014-1594, PICT 2017-1381 and PICT 2015-1769), the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, project #RTI2018-098560-B-C22, Universidad de Jáen, Consejería de Innovación, Ciencia y Empresa (Junta de Andalucía, Spain).

The prognostic significance of TAMs has been confirmed in various tumors. However, whether TAMs can be prognostic factors in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the prognostic value of TAMs in ccRCC.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science for relevant published studies before December 19, 2020. Evidence from enrolled studies were pooled and analyzed by a meta-analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to evaluate the pooled results.
RESULTS: Both of high CD68+ TAMs and M2-TAMs were risk factors for poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. The pooled HRs indicated that elevated CD68+ TAMs correlated with poor OS and PFS (HR: 3.97, 95% CI 1.39-11.39; HR: 5.73, 95% CI 2.36-13.90, respectively). For M2-TAMs, the pooled results showed ccRCC patients with high M2-TAMs suffered a worse OS and shorter PFS, with HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.16-1.50) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.14-1.72), respectively. Also, high density of TAMs was associated with advanced clinicopathological features in ccRCC.
CONCLUSIONS: TAMs could be potential biomarkers for prognosis and novel targets for immunotherapy in ccRCC. Further researches are warranted to validate our results.",We are grateful to the authors and patients of the included studies.,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-04-26,2021,2021-04-26,,11,,657318,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shen, Haixiang; Liu, Jin; Chen, Shiming; Ma, Xueyou; Ying, Yufan; Li, Jiangfeng; Wang, Weiyu; Wang, Xiao; Xie, Liping","Shen, Haixiang (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Liu, Jin (Department of Surgical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Chen, Shiming (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Ma, Xueyou (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Ying, Yufan (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Li, Jiangfeng (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Wang, Weiyu (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Wang, Xiao (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China); Xie, Liping (Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China)","Wang, Xiao (Zhejiang University); Xie, Liping (Zhejiang University)","Shen, Haixiang (Zhejiang University); Liu, Jin (Zhejiang University); Chen, Shiming (Zhejiang University); Ma, Xueyou (Zhejiang University); Ying, Yufan (Zhejiang University); Li, Jiangfeng (Zhejiang University); Wang, Weiyu (Zhejiang University); Wang, Xiao (Zhejiang University); Xie, Liping (Zhejiang University)",35,20,2.27,8.97,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.657318/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137488163,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

To explore the association between metal exposure and alterations in glucose metabolism, inflammatory status, and oxidative stress in individuals with chronic exposure to metals, a cross-sectional study was performed with 25 volunteers, between 45-65 years old. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure urinary levels of total arsenic (As) and its metabolites, cooper, nickel, chromium, and lead. Lipid profile, glucose, and insulin were measured in blood, as well as inflammation (interleukin-6, IL-6) and oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) markers. Increased levels of Low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol and 8-OHdG, and the index for homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were observed in 72%, 60%, and 56% of the volunteers, respectively. Blood-glucose levels were correlated with dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.019), inorganic As (Asi) (R2 = 0.40, p = 0.012), and Ni (R2 = 0.56; p = 0.044). The models with these compounds explained 72% of the glycemia variability (βDMA = -6.47; βAsi = 6.68; βNi = 6.87). Ni showed a significantly influence on IL-6 variability (β = 0.85: R2 = 0.36). Changes in glycemia could be related to exposure to low levels of Asi and Ni, representing risk factors for metabolic diseases. Body mass index would confuse the relation between IL-6 and Ni levels, probably due to known chronic inflammation present in obese people.","We are grateful to the Chañaral community for their participation.

The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of ethnic identity on the relationship between the experience of racial and ethnic discrimination and psychological well-being in Colombian immigrants living in Chile. A total of 962 immigrants over the age of 18 from three cities in Chile participated. Of these, 50.7% were women. The average age was 35 years (SD = 10.23). Participants were evaluated using Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scales, Phinney's adapted version of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Scale, and Krieger's Discrimination Experience Scale. After the analysis of the measurement models, a mediation model was analyzed using structural equations. The results provide evidence that ethnic and racial discrimination have negative effects on psychological well-being, with the effect of racial discrimination being greater. Likewise, ethnic identity has positive effects on psychological well-being and partially and completely mediates the effects of ethnic and racial discrimination on psychological well-being. The full effect of discrimination on psychological well-being, mediated by ethnic identity, is exercised only by racial discrimination and not by ethnic discrimination.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Carlos María Alcover, Gabriela Nazar",Adult; Chile; Emigrants and Immigrants; Ethnicity; Female; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Racism,2021-02-28,2021,2021-02-28,2021-03-01,18,5,2359,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Henríquez, Diego; Domic, Marcos; Acevedo, Daniel; Ralph, Sebastian; Reyes, Gonzalo; Tang, Diego","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, acaqueo@academicos.uta.cl); Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Domic, Marcos (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Acevedo, Daniel (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Ralph, Sebastian (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Reyes, Gonzalo (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Tang, Diego (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.))","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.))","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Domic, Marcos (Catholic University of the North; Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.);, mdomic@ucn.cl, (M.D.)); Acevedo, Daniel (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Ralph, Sebastian (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Reyes, Gonzalo (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.)); Tang, Diego (University of Tarapacá; Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, daniieel.ignacio7@gmail.com, (D.A.);, sebastian.ralph.ponce@gmail.com, (S.R.);, mr.resille@gmail.com, (G.R.);, diego.mineria3d@gmail.com, (D.T.))",13,8,2.11,4.85,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/5/2359/pdf?version=1614512833,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135834651,44 Human Society; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The ARGs have been regarded as a contaminant of serious environmental threats on a global scale. The constant increase in aquaculture production has led to extensive use of antibiotics as a means to prevent and treat bacterial infections; there is a universal concern about the environmental risk of ARGs in the aquaculture environment. In this study, a survey was conducted to evaluate the abundance and distributions of 10 ARGs, bacterial community, and environmental factors in sediment samples from aquatic farms distributed in Anhui (AP1, AP2, and AP3), Fujian (FP1, FP2, and FP3), Guangxi (GP1, GP2, and GP3), Hainan (HP1, HP2, and HP3), and Shaanxi (SP1, SP2, and SP3) Province in China. The results showed that the relative abundance of total ARGs was higher in AP1, AP2, AP3, FP3, GP3, HP1, HP2, and HP3 than that in FP1, FP2, GP1, GP2, SP1, SP2, and SP3. The sul1 and tetW genes of all sediment samples had the highest abundance. The class 1 integron (intl1) was detected in all samples, and the result of Pearson correlation analysis showed that the intl1 has a positive correlation with the sul1, sul2, sul3, bla OXA, qnrS, tetM, tetQ, and tetW genes. Correlation analysis of the bacterial community diversity and environmental factors showed that the Ca2+ concentration has a negative correlation with richness and diversity of the bacterial community in these samples. Of the identified bacterial community, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidota were the predominant phyla in these samples. Redundancy analysis showed that environmental factors (TN, TP, Cl-, and Ca2+) have a positive correlation with the bacterial community (AP1, GP1, GP2, GP3, SP1, SP2, and SP3), and the abundance of ARGs (sul1, tetW, qnrS, and intl1) has a positive correlation with the bacterial community (AP2, AP3, HP1, HP2, and HP3). Based on the network analysis, the ARGs (sul1, sul2, bla CMY, bla OXA, qnrS, tetW, tetQ, tetM, and intl1) were found to co-occur with bacterial taxa from the phyla Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Halobacterota, and Proteobacteria.

It is imperative to understand the best available evidence concerning which public health interventions reduce morbidity, mortality and health inequalities in children aged under five years. To address this gap, we carried out an umbrella review (a systematic reviews of reviews) to identify evidence on the effects of public health interventions (promotion, protection, prevention) on morbidity, mortality and/or health inequalities due to infectious diseases amongst children in LMICs. Ten databases were searched for records published between 2014-2021 alongside a manual search of gray literature. Articles were quality-assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2). A narrative synthesis was conducted. We identified 60 systematic reviews synthesizing 453 individual primary studies. A majority of the reviews reported on preventive interventions (n = 48), with a minority on promotion (n = 17) and almost no reviews covering health protection interventions (n = 2). Effective interventions for improving child health across the whole population, as well as the most disadvantaged included communication, education and social mobilization for specific preventive services or tools, such as immunization or bed nets. For all other interventions, the effects were either unclear, unknown or detrimental, either at the overall population level or regarding health inequalities. We found few reviews reporting health inequalities information and the quality of the evidence base was generally low. Our umbrella review identified some prevention interventions that might be useful in reducing under five mortality from infectious diseases in LMICs, particularly amongst the most disadvantaged groups.","AT and CB&#x27;s contributions were supported by the Norwegian Research Council BEDREHELSE work programme (CHAIN: Centre for Global Health Inequalities Research, project number 288638, https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/about-the-research-council/programmes/bedrehelse/).

Hence, we aimed to uncover the role of As in shaping bacterial composition, structure, and functional potential in five different sites in this altiplanic wetland using a shotgun metagenomic approach. The sites exhibit wide gradients of As (9 to 321 mg/kg), and our results showed highly diverse communities and a clear dominance exerted by the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla. Functional potential analyses show broadly convergent patterns, contrasting with their great taxonomic variability. As-related metabolism, as well as other functional categories such as those related to the CH4 and S cycles, differs among the five communities. Particularly, we found that the distribution and abundance of As-related genes increase as the As concentration rises. Approximately 75% of the detected genes for As metabolism belong to expulsion mechanisms; arsJ and arsP pumps are related to sites with higher As concentrations and are present almost exclusively in Proteobacteria. Furthermore, taxonomic diversity and functional potential are reflected in the 12 reconstructed high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the Bacteroidetes (5), Proteobacteria (5), Cyanobacteria (1), and Gemmatimonadetes (1) phyla. We conclude that SH microbial communities are diverse and possess a broad genetic repertoire to thrive under extreme conditions, including increasing concentrations of highly toxic As. Finally, this environment represents a reservoir of unknown and undescribed microorganisms, with great metabolic versatility, which needs further study. IMPORTANCE As microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments are fundamental for maintaining ecosystems, many studies concerning composition, functionality, and interactions have been carried out. However, much is still unknown. Here, we sampled microbial communities in the Salar de Huasco, an extreme environment subjected to several abiotic stresses (high UV radiation, salinity and arsenic; low pressure and temperatures). We found that although microbes are taxonomically diverse, functional potential seems to have an important degree of convergence, suggesting high levels of adaptation. Particularly, arsenic metabolism showed differences associated with increasing concentrations of the metalloid throughout the area, and it effectively exerts a significant pressure over these organisms. Thus, the significance of this research is that we describe highly specialized communities thriving in little-explored environments subjected to several pressures, considered analogous of early Earth and other planets, that have the potential for unraveling technologies to face the repercussions of climate change in many areas of interest.","We thank the illustrator Florence Gutzwiller (IG: @spideryscrawl) for the SH landscape painting (https://spideryscrawl-illustration.webnode.com/).

However, the generality of this idea is challenged because (i) most studies have been conducted on two economically important forage grasses {tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) Dumort] and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)}, (ii) endophyte-mediated mechanisms and effects on plant responses to drought have shown to be highly variable across species, and that (iii) symbiosis incidence in plant populations occurring in extremely arid environments is usually low. We question this idea by reviewing the existing information about Epichloë fungal endophyte effects on drought tolerance in cool-season grasses. We combined standard review, vote counting, and calculation of effect sizes to synthesize the literature, identify information gaps, and guide future research. The total number of studies was higher for domesticated than for wild species, a ratio that was balanced when papers with data quality for effect size calculus were considered. After the drought, endophyte-infected plants accumulated more aboveground and belowground biomass than non-infected counterparts, while no effect on tillering was observed. However, these effects remained significant for wild (even on tillering) but not for domesticated species. Interestingly, despite the continuous effort in determining physiological mechanisms behind the endophyte effects, no studies evaluated plant fecundity as a measure of ecological fitness nor vital rates (such as survival) as to escalate individual-level variables to population. Together with the high variability in results, our work shows that generalizing a positive effect of fungal endophytes in plant tolerance to drought may be misleading.

The interplay between emotions and learning is less well understood. Gaining greater insights into learner emotions has potential to guide how best we manage emotions and optimise learning. This study aimed to understand learners’ lived emotional experiences in complex simulation and the perceived impact on learning.MethodsEight final-year medical students participated in the study. Wearing video-glasses, participants took part in a ward-based simulation. Video-footage was used to elicitate exploratory interviews and analysed using Template Analysis reflexively.ResultsAnalysis yielded four main themes: ‘nervous anticipation’: encapsulating the fear, anxiety and uncertainty experienced by learners prior to simulation; ‘shock and awe’: feelings of anxiousness and being overwhelmed at the start of a simulation; ‘in the moment: flowing or buffeting with the emotions’: experiencing fear of being judged as incompetent, but also experiencing positive emotions such as satisfaction; ‘safe-landing?’: whilst debriefing aimed to encourage more positive emotions, negative emotions about the simulation could persist even with debriefing.ConclusionsComplex simulation can evoke intense emotions in students. If students experienced a positive progression, they reported positive emotions and felt competent which was perceived to have a positive impact on learning. If students experienced failure, they reported strong negative emotions which made them question about their future performance and was perceived as negative for learning. Bringing to the surface these complex emotional dynamics, could permit educators to be aware of and adapt the emotional climate within simulation in order to optimise learning.","The authors would like to thank all of the students, faculty staff and SPs who participated in the study.",,Advances in Simulation,,,,2021-07-03,2021,2021-07-03,2021-12,6,1,24,All OA; Gold,Article,"Behrens, Claudia C.; Driessen, Erik W.; Dolmans, Diana H.; Gormley, Gerard J.","Behrens, Claudia C.

Celery slices of 2 mm thick were pretreated for 5 min using ultrasound (32 W/L, 40 kHz), vacuum (75 kPa vacuum pressure) and ethanol (99.8% v/v, as drying accelerator) applied individually or in combination. To evaluate individual effects of ultrasound and vacuum, the treatments were also performed with distilled water or air medium, respectively. Moreover, the cavitational level was characterized in each condition. Drying kinetics was evaluated tending into account the drying time required by each treatment and the Page's model parameters. In addition, microstructural effects and shrinkage were evaluated. As results, ethanol combined with ultrasound significantly improved drying kinetics reducing drying time by around 38%. However, vacuum pretreatment did not affect drying kinetics even in combination with ethanol and/or ultrasound. Microstructural evaluation did not evidence cell disruption, suggesting changes in intercellular spaces, pores and/or cell wall permeability. The use of ethanol and vacuum showed a greater effect on shrinkage after pretreatment and after drying, respectively. In conclusion, at the studied conditions, the drying acceleration by vacuum and ultrasound is lower compared to the effect produced using ethanol.","The authors are grateful to the Programa Nacional de Investigación Científica y Estudios Avanzados (PROCIENCIA) from the ‘‘Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica” (CONCYTEC, Peru) for funding the project n° 409-2019-FONDECYT, to the Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN, Peru) for funding the project n° 20201005, to the São Paulo Research foundation (FAPESP, Brazil), for funding the project n° 2019/05043-6, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil), for funding the productivity grant of PED Augusto (310839/2020-3).",,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,,,Apium; Desiccation; Ethanol; Vacuum; Vegetables,2021-10-08,2021,2021-10-08,2021-11,79,,105779,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miano, Alberto Claudio; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay; Augusto, Pedro E D","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru.); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Dirección de Investigación y Desarrollo, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Trujillo, Peru.); Augusto, Pedro E D (Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of São Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North)","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Private University of the North); Rojas, Meliza Lindsay (Private University of the North); Augusto, Pedro E D (Universidade de São Paulo)",27,17,1.94,3.69,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105779,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141720456,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

METHOD: a quantitative, exploratory, descriptive and analytical study. Two hundred and eighty-two health professionals participated in the study. For data collection, a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were used. The psychometric sensitivity for the MBI-HSS items was estimated by measures of central tendency, variability and the distribution shape. Internal consistency was estimated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the adequacy of the sample was verified using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index. As indexes for assessing the quality of fit of the model, the chi-square ratio by the degrees of freedom (χ2/DoF), the comparative fit index (CFI), the goodness of fit index (GFI), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were considered. To test data fit, the maximum likelihood method was used.
RESULTS: the three-factor structure of the Maslach Burnout Inventory was confirmed. Items 9, 12, 15 and 16 had a factorial weight below what was considered appropriate and were removed from the model. The second order hierarchical model with the aforementioned modifications presented an adequate adjustment to the data and can be considered the best and most parsimonious model tested according to the information theory indexes. The internal consistency of the instrument's factors was recalculated considering the exclusion of the items and the three factors were considered adequate.

The fundamental hypothesis is that moral disengagement, personality traits, self-esteem, values, parenting, sex, and socioeconomic situation can function as possible casual factors of aggression in adolescents. The study examined the variables using the structural equations model (SEM) to determine causal factors of aggression in a sample of 827 adolescents (54% men and 46% women) between 11 and 16 years of age. According to the scientific literature review, sociodemographic, personal, and familiar variables were included in the causal model. The influence of the variables occurred in two ways: one that inhibits aggression and the other that reinforces it. The results are discussed based on identifying protective and risk factors against aggression: biological sex and values of conformity and transcendence as aggression's inhibitors and, on the other hand, openness, moral disengagement, and leadership values as the most important predictors of aggression.",,"This research was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia y Tecnología de Colombia, COLCIENCIAS, Ph.D. scholarship program.",Brain Sciences,,"Annarita Milone, Gianluca Sesso",,2021-07-15,2021,2021-07-15,,11,7,933,All OA; Gold,Article,"Robles-Haydar, Claudia A.; Martínez-González, Marina B.; Flórez-Niño, Yuliana A.; Ibáñez-Navarro, Luz M.; Amar-Amar, José J.","Robles-Haydar, Claudia A.

For the service sector and, particularly for the retail industry, we initially propose a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model that determines how many employees should be multiskilled, in which and how many departments they should be trained, and how their weekly working hours will be assigned. Then, the deterministic model is reformulated using a two-stage stochastic optimization (TSSO) model to explicitly incorporate the uncertain personnel demand. The methodology is tested for a case study using real and simulated data derived from a Chilean retail store. We also compare the TSSO approach solutions with the myopic approaches' solutions (i.e., zero and total multiskilling). The case study is oriented to answer two key questions: how much multiskilling to add and how to add it. Results show that TSSO approach solutions always report maximum reliability for all levels of demand variability considered. It was also observed that, for high levels of demand variability, a k-chaining policy with k≥2 is more cost-effective than a 2-chaining policy. Finally, to evaluate the conservatism level in the solutions reported by the TSSO approach, two truncation types in the probability density function (pdf) associated with the personnel demand were considered. Results show that, if the pdf is only truncated at zero (more conservative truncation) the levels of required multiskilling are higher than when the pdf is truncated at 5th and 95th percentiles (less conservative truncation).",,,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,,,Cost-Benefit Analysis; Policy; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty,2021-11-22,2021,2021-11-22,2021,19,1,892-917,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mercado, Yessica Andrea; Henao, César Augusto; González, Virginia I.","Mercado, Yessica Andrea (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Henao, César Augusto (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); González, Virginia I.

A major factor of the modern-day ecological diversity of the group, and supposedly in the past as well, is represented by the highly specialised larval forms of lacewings. Quantitative analyses of the morphology of larvae revealed a loss of morphological diversity in several lineages. Here we explored the diversity of the larvae of mantis lacewings (Mantispidae), lance lacewings (Osmylidae), beaded lacewings (Berothidae and Rhachiberothidae, the latter potentially an ingroup of Berothidae), and pleasing lacewings (Dilaridae), as well as fossil larvae, preserved in amber, resembling these. We used shape analysis of the head capsule and stylets (pair of conjoined jaws) as a basis due to the high availability of this body region in extant and fossil specimens and the ecological importance of this region. The analysis revealed a rather constant morphological diversity in Berothidae. Mantispidae appears to have lost certain forms of larvae, but has seen a drastic increase of larval diversity after the Cretaceous; this is in contrast to a significant decrease in diversity in adult forms.","Mónica M.

The bacterial microbiome of adult (males and females) and nymph Rhipicephalus microplus ticks collected from a collared peccary, Pecari tajacu, captured in the rural area of Botijón Village in the Amazon region of Madre de Dios, Peru, was evaluated using metagenomics. The Chao1 and Shannon–Weaver analyses indicated greater bacterial richness and diversity in female ticks (GARH; 375–4.15) and nymph ticks (GARN; 332–4.75) compared to that in male ticks (GARM; 215–3.20). Taxonomic analyses identified 185 operational taxonomic units representing 147 bacterial genera. Of the 25 most prevalent genera, Salmonella (17.5%) and Vibrio (15.0%) showed the highest relative abundance followed by several other potentially pathogenic genera, such as Paracoccus (7.8%), Staphylococcus (6.8%), Pseudomonas (6.6%), Corynebacterium (5.0%), Cloacibacterium (3.6%), and Acinetobacter (2.5%). In total, 19.7% of the detected genera are shared by GARH, GARM, and GARN, and they can be considered as the core microbiome of R. microplus. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the microbiome of ticks collected from P. tajacu and to report the presence of Salmonella and Vibrio in R. microplus. The pathogenic potential and the role of these bacteria in the physiology of R. microplus should be further investigated due to the possible implications for public health and animal health in populations neighboring the habitat of P. tajacu.",Marcelo B.

The Omega-3 Index (O3I), clinical variables, biometric indices, and nutritional information were directly determined for 74 patients with severe COVID-19 and 10 healthy quality-control subjects. The relationships between the OI3 and mechanical ventilation (MV) and death were analyzed. Results: Patients with COVID-19 exhibited low O3I (mean: 4.15%; range: 3.06-6.14%)-consistent with insufficient fish and Omega-3 supplement consumption, and markedly lower than the healthy control subjects (mean: 7.84%; range: 4.65-10.71%). Inverse associations were observed between O3I and MV (OR = 0.459; C.I.: 0.211-0.997) and death (OR = 0.28; C.I.: 0.08-0.985) in severe COVID-19, even after adjusting for sex, age, and well-known risk factors. Conclusion: We present preliminary evidence to support the hypothesis that the risk of severe COVID-19 can be stratified by the O3I quartile.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with different adipo- and immuno-modulatory capacities on metabolic and immunological parameters and intestinal composition microbiota in high-fat-diet-induced in mice fed a high-fat diet Methods: Balb/c weaning male mice were fed a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with or without supplementation with Limosilactobacillus fermentum CRL1446 (CRL1446), Lactococcus lactis CRL1434 (CRL1434), or Lacticaseibacillus casei CRL431 (CRL431) for 45 days. Biochemical and immunological parameters, white-adipose tissue histology, gut microbiota composition, and ex vivo cellular functionality (adipocytes and macrophages) were evaluated in SD and HFD mice. Results: CRL1446 and CRL1434 administration, unlike CRL431, induced significant changes in the body and adipose tissue weights and the size of adipocytes. Also, these strains caused a decrease in plasmatic glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, TNF-α, IL-6 levels, and an increase of IL-10. The CRL1446 and CRL1434 obese adipocyte in ex vivo functionality assays showed, after LPS stimulus, a reduction in leptin secretion compared to obese control, while with CRL431, no change was observed. In macrophages from obese mice fed with CRL1446 and CRL1434, after LPS stimulus, lower levels of MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6 compared to obese control were observed. In contrast, CRL431 did not induce modification of cytokine values. Regarding gut microbiota, all strain administration caused a decrease in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes index and diversity. As well as, related to genus results, all strains increased, mainly the genera Alistipes, Dorea, Barnesiella, and Clostridium XIVa. CRL1446 induced a higher increase in the Lactobacillus genus during the study period. Conclusions: The tested probiotic strains differentially modulated the intestinal microbiota and metabolic/immunological parameters in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. These results suggest that CRL1446 and CRL1434 strains could be used as adjuvant probiotics strains for nutritional treatment to obesity and overweight. At the same time, the CRL431 strain could be more beneficial in pathologies that require regulation of the immune system.",We sincerely thank Jose Luis Alvarado for his technical assistance in animal care and Lic.

Essential oils (EOs) from propolis residues could be a potential source of natural bioactive compounds to replace antibiotics and synthetic antioxidants in pig production. In this study, we determined the antibacterial/antioxidant activity of EOs from crude organic propolis (EOP) and from propolis residues, moist residue (EOMR), and dried residue (EODR), and further elucidated their chemical composition. The EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation, and their volatile profile was tentatively identified by GC-MS. All EOs had an antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum as they caused disturbances on the growth kinetics of both bacteria. However, EODR had more selective antibacterial activity, as it caused a higher reduction in the maximal culture density (D) of E. coli (86.7%) than L. plantarum (46.9%). EODR exhibited mild antioxidant activity, whereas EOMR showed the highest antioxidant activity (ABTS = 0.90 μmol TE/mg, FRAP = 463.97 μmol Fe2+/mg) and phenolic content (58.41 mg GAE/g). Each EO had a different chemical composition, but α-pinene and β-pinene were the major compounds detected in the samples. Interestingly, specific minor compounds were detected in a higher relative amount in EOMR and EODR as compared to EOP. Therefore, these minor compounds are most likely responsible for the biological properties of EODR and EOMR. Collectively, our findings suggest that the EOs from propolis residues could be resourcefully used as natural antibacterial/antioxidant additives in pig production.","The authors are thankful to Henrique Breyer from Breyer &amp; Cia Ltd.

METHODS: Data was retrieved from the qualitative component of a multi-method research conducted with pregnant immigrants in Barranquilla, Colombia, between 2018 and 2019, and triangulated with a review of regulations established by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.
RESULTS: Having limited economic capital, participants use social capital from personal networks and migrant organizations. They obtain cultural health capital in the form of information on the health system and use their cultural competencies to interact with this system.
CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Migrants exert their agency through the use of capitals, although with certain constraints. Policies aimed at this social group should consider the strengths of migrants.",,"Funding: This research was funded by the Research, Development and Innovation Department of Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, ATL, Colombia.",Revista de Saúde Pública,,,Brazil; Colombia; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Qualitative Research; Transients and Migrants,2021-08-16,2021,2021-08-16,,55,,49,All OA; Gold,Article,"Giraldo, Vanesa; Sobczyk, Rita; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth; Bojorquez, Ietza","Giraldo, Vanesa (University of Massachusetts, Department of Anthropology, Amherst, MA, USA, University of Massachusetts.

Real-world data of ATLL in Latin America are lacking.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients with ATLL (acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering) encountered in 11 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2019. Treatment response was assessed according to the 2009 consensus report. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.
RESULTS: We identified 253 patients; 226 (lymphomatous: n = 122, acute: n = 73, chronic: n = 26, and smoldering: n = 5) had sufficient data for analysis (median age 57 years). Most patients with ATLL were from Peru (63%), Chile (17%), Argentina (8%), and Colombia (7%). Hypercalcemia was positively associated with acute type (57% v lymphomatous 27%, P = .014). The median survival times (months) were 4.3, 7.9, 21.1, and not reached for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering forms, with 4-year survival rates of 8%, 22%, 40%, and 80%, respectively. First-line zidovudine (AZT)-interferon alfa (IFN) resulted in an overall response rate of 63% (complete response [CR] 24%) for acute. First-line chemotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 41% (CR 29%) for lymphomatous. CR rate was 42% for etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus 12% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone-like regimen (P < .001). Progression-free survival at 1 year for acute type patients treated with AZT-IFN was 67%, whereas 2-year progression-free survival in lymphomatous type patients who achieved CR after chemotherapy was 77%.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms Latin American ATLL presents at a younger age and has a high incidence of lymphomatous type, low incidence of indolent subtypes, and worse survival rates as compared with Japanese patients. In aggressive ATLL, chemotherapy remains the preferred choice for lymphomatous favoring etoposide-based regimen (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), whereas AZT-IFN remains a good first-line option for acute subtype.",,,JCO Global Oncology,,,"Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Argentina; Chile; Colombia; Humans; Latin America; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Lymphoma; Middle Aged; Peru",2021-07-16,2021,2021-07-16,2021-12,7,7,go.21.00084,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malpica, Luis; Enriquez, Daniel J.; Castro, Denisse A.; Peña, Camila; Idrobo, Henry; Fiad, Lorena; Prates, Maria; Otero, Victoria; Biglione, Mirna; Altamirano, Milagros; Sandival-Ampuero, Gustavo; Aviles-Perez, Ursula; Meza, Kelly; Aguirre-Martinez, Laura; Cristaldo, Nancy; Maradei, Juan L.; Guanchiale, Luciana; Soto, Pablo; Viñuela, Jose L.; Cabrera, Maria E.; Paredes, Sally Rose; Riva, Eloisa; Di Stefano, Marcos; Noboa, Andrea; Choque, Juan A.; Candelaria, Myrna; Von Glasenapp, Alana; Valvert, Fabiola; Torres-Viera, Maria A.; Castillo, Jorge J.; Ramos, Juan Carlos; Villela, Luis; Beltran, Brady E.","Malpica, Luis (Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX); Enriquez, Daniel J.

It is therefore important that this theme is taken into account as part of universities´ teaching and research programs.MethodsA three-tiered approach was used, consisting of a bibliometric analysis, an online survey and a set of case studies, which allow a profile to be built, as to how a sample of universities from 45 countries handle climate change as part of their teaching programs.ResultsThis paper reports on a study which aimed at identifying the extent to which matters related to climate change are addressed within the teaching and research practices at universities, with a focus on the training needs of teaching staff. It consists of a bibliometric analysis, combined with an online worldwide survey aimed at ascertaining the degree of involvement from universities in reducing their own carbon footprint, and the ways they offer training provisions on the topic. This is complemented by a set of 12 case studies from universities round the world, illustrating current trends on how universities handle climate change. Apart from reporting on the outcomes of the study, the paper highlights what some universities are doing to handle climate issues, and discusses the implications of the research.ConclusionsThe paper lists some items via which universities may better educate and train their students on how to handle the many challenges posed by climate change.",Not applicable.,There is no external funding received for the research included in the manuscript.,Environmental Sciences Europe,,,,2021-09-25,2021,2021-09-25,2021-12,33,1,109,All OA; Gold,Article,"Leal Filho, Walter; Sima, Mihaela; Sharifi, Ayyoob; Luetz, Johannes M.; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Mifsud, Mark; Olooto, Felicia Motunrayo; Djekic, Ilija; Anholon, Rosley; Rampasso, Izabela; Kwabena Donkor, Felix; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta; Klavins, Maris; Finnveden, Göran; Chari, Martin Munashe; Molthan-Hill, Petra; Mifsud, Alexandra; Sen, Salil K.; Lokupitiya, Erandathie","Leal Filho, Walter (School of Science and the Environment, Manchester Metropolitan University, Chester Street, M1 5GD, Manchester, UK; Research and Transfer Centre “Sustainable Development and Climate Change Management”, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany); Sima, Mihaela (Romanian Academy, Institute of Geography, 12 Dimitrie Racovita St, Sector 2, 023993, Bucharest, Romania); Sharifi, Ayyoob (Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and Network for Education and Research on Peace and Sustainability, Hiroshima University, 739-8530, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan); Luetz, Johannes M.

These effects are particularly relevant in the lung context, given the dynamic nature of cyclic stretch that the ECM is continuously subjected to during breathing. This work uses an in vivo model of pulmonary fibrosis to characterize the macro- and micromechanical properties of lung ECM subjected to stretch. To that aim, we have compared the micromechanical properties of fibrotic ECM in baseline and under stretch conditions, using a novel combination of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and a stretchable membrane-based chip. At the macroscale, fibrotic ECM displayed strain-hardening, with a stiffness one order of magnitude higher than its healthy counterpart. Conversely, at the microscale, we found a switch in the stretch-induced mechanical behaviour of the lung ECM from strain-hardening at physiological ECM stiffnesses to strain-softening at fibrotic ECM stiffnesses. Similarly, we observed solidification of healthy ECM versus fluidization of fibrotic ECM in response to stretch. Our results suggest that the mechanical behaviour of fibrotic ECM under stretch involves a potential built-in mechanotransduction mechanism that may slow down the progression of PF by steering resident fibroblasts away from a pro-fibrotic profile.",,"This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PID2020-113910RB-I00-AEI/10.13039/501100011033, SAF2017-85574-R, and PID2020-116808RB-I00 AEI-Retos) and SEPAR (900-2019).

To gain insights into the regulation of gene expression in CHD, we obtained the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in 22 heart tissue samples with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) through strand-specific transcriptomic analysis. Using a causal inference framework based on the expression correlations and validated microRNA (miRNA)-lncRNA-mRNA evidences, we constructed the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-mediated network driven by lncRNAs. Four lncRNAs (FGD5-AS1, lnc-GNB4-1, lnc-PDK3-1, and lnc-SAMD5-1) were identified as hub lncRNAs in the network. FGD5-AS1 was selected for further study since all its targets were CHD-related genes (NRAS, PTEN, and SMAD4). Both FGD5-AS1 and SMAD4 could bind with hsa-miR-421, which has been validated using dual-luciferase reporter assays. Knockdown of FGD5-AS1 not only significantly reduced PTEN and SMAD4 expression in HEK 293 and the fetal heart cell line (CCC-HEH-2) but also increased the transcription of its interacted miRNAs in a cell-specific way. Besides ceRNA mechanism, RNAseq and ATACseq results showed that FGD5-AS1 might play repression roles in heart development by transcriptionally regulating CHD-related genes. In conclusion, we identified a ceRNA network driven by lncRNAs in heart tissues of TOF patients. Furthermore, we proved that FGD5-AS1, one hub lncRNA in the TOF heart ceRNA network, regulates multiple genes transcriptionally and epigenetically.",,"Funding.

The major functions of HSP27 include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides and protecting cells from toxic stress. Dysregulation of stress proteins is associated with many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by the presence of aggregates of α-synuclein in the central and peripheral nervous system, which induces the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and in the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic dysfunction is an important non-motor phenotype of PD, which includes cardiovascular dysregulation, among others. Nowadays, the therapies for PD focus on dopamine (DA) replacement. However, certain non-motor symptoms with a great impact on quality of life do not respond to dopaminergic drugs; therefore, the development and testing of new treatments for non-motor symptoms of PD remain a priority. Since small HSP27 was shown to prevent α-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, this protein might constitute a suitable target to prevent or delay the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. In the first part of our review, we focus on the cardiovascular dysregulation observed in PD patients. In the second part, we present data on the possible role of HSP27 in preventing the accumulation of amyloid fibrils and aggregated forms of α-synuclein. We also include our own studies, highlighting the possible protective cardiac effects induced by L-DOPA treatment through the enhancement of HSP27 levels and activity.",,"This research was funded by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Science (SAF/FEDER2013-49076-P, FIS PI10 02827) and Fundación Séneca (20847/PI/18).",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,Nikolai B.

(Digenea: Allocreadiidae) from native Labeobarbus aeneus (Cyprinidae) in South Africa, including notes on its biology, evolutionary history and an updated key of African Allocreadium","Adult trematodes of Allocreadium Looss, 1900 (Digenea) infect the intestine of mostly freshwater fishes in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. During routine parasitological surveys in the Vaal River system, adult trematodes were collected from the intestine of smallmouth yellowfish, Labeobarbus aeneus (Burchell). The trematodes were confirmed to represent a member of Allocreadium and did not match any existing taxon. Therefore, they are described as a new species, Allocreadium apokryfi sp. n. The morphology of the new species most closely resembles that of Allocreadium aswanense El-Naffar, Saoud et Hassan, 1984, but it differs from it by having a bipartite internal seminal vesicle, wider eggs, a shorter intertesticular distance, an intestinal bifurcation at the ventral sucker level, a ventral sucker that is larger than the oral sucker, and a genital pore near the intestinal bifurcation or the ventral sucker. The surface topology of the new species is notably different from that of other allocreadiids. Papillae were observed in the ventral sucker and surrounding both ventral and oral suckers, but the number and arrangement of the latter were not consistent among specimens. The protruding cirrus of A. apokryfi sp. n. was described using SEM and is the first such observation for the genus. Genetic characterisation showed that the new species was clearly distinct from other Allocreadium spp. using both 18S (nucleotide difference 1.3-9.1%) and 28S (4.7-6.5%) rDNA, forming a well-supported clade in Allocreadium. The presence of A. apokryfi sp. n. in a well-studied river is unexpected, and considering the diet of its host and the scarcity of Allocreadium in Africa, the possible biology of this species is discussed herein.",,,Folia Parasitologica,,,Animals; Biological Evolution; Cyprinidae; Fish Diseases; Host-Parasite Interactions; Life History Traits; Prevalence; South Africa; Trematoda; Trematode Infections,2021-05-25,2021,2021-05-25,,68,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dos Santos, Quinton M; Gilbert, Beric M; Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie; Dumbo, Jose C","Dos Santos, Quinton M (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Gilbert, Beric M (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Spectrum Analytical Facility, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Dumbo, Jose C (Department of Zoology, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Department of Biological Sciences, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.)",,"Dos Santos, Quinton M (University of Johannesburg); Gilbert, Beric M (University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg); Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie (University of Johannesburg); Dumbo, Jose C (University of Johannesburg; Eduardo Mondlane University)",9,5,1.63,4.92,http://folia.paru.cas.cz/doi/10.14411/fp.2021.013.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138342994,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",

The stigma is a relevant barrier to diabetes management. However, evidence in this regard is scarce in Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the level of stigma surrounding type 2 diabetes in the Colombian population and its relationships with sociodemographic, clinical, psychosocial variables and behaviors related to management of the disease (self-management behaviors). This cross-sectional study included 501 Colombian adults with type 2 diabetes. We estimated the relation between stigma and selected variables through linear regression models. Additionally, we analyzed the mediator role of psychosocial variables in the relationship between stigma and self-management behaviors through structural equation models. A total of 16.4% of patients showed concerning levels of stigma. The time elapsed since diagnosis (β = -0.23) and socioeconomic status (β = -0.13) were significant predictors of the level of stigma. Stigma was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (β = -0.36), self-esteem (β = -0.37), and relationship with health care provider (β = -0.46), and positively correlated with stress (β = 0.23). Self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the relationships with health care providers had a mediation role in the relationship between stigma and self-management behaviors. These variables would be part of the mechanisms through which the perception of stigma harms self-management behaviors. The stigma of type 2 diabetes is frequent in the Colombian population and negatively associated with important aspects of disease management.",,"This research was funded by Universidad Andres Bello, grant number, DI-01-19/CB and Universidad Andres Bello-Universidad del Norte (Colombia) Research Collaboration Agreement UN-OJ-2019-46584.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Ana López De Andrés, Lisa Newson, Ian Davies, Julie Abayomi","Adult; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Self Concept; Social Stigma",2021-12-01,2021,2021-12-01,,18,23,12657,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pedrero, Victor; Manzi, Jorge; Alonso, Luz Marina","Pedrero, Victor (Nursing Faculty, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago 8370146, Chile; School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile;, jmanzi@uc.cl); Manzi, Jorge (School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago 7820436, Chile;, jmanzi@uc.cl); Alonso, Luz Marina (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, lmalonso@uninorte.edu.co)","Pedrero, Victor (Andrés Bello National University; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)","Pedrero, Victor (Andrés Bello National University; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Manzi, Jorge (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile); Alonso, Luz Marina (Universidad del Norte)",12,11,1.61,5.04,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/23/12657/pdf?version=1638340471,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143557999,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, the prognostic values of LIMK1 and correlation with immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma are still not understood. Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic role of LIMK1 and its correlation with immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Transcriptional expression profiles of LIMK1 between lung adenocarcinoma tissues and normal tissues were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The LIMK1 protein expression was assessed by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and the Human Protein Atlas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to differentiate lung adenocarcinoma from adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier method was conducted to assess the effect of LIMK1 on survival. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by the STRING. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using the ""ClusterProfiler"" package. The relationship between LIMK1 mRNA expression and immune infiltrates was determined by tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER) and tumor-immune system interaction database (TISIDB).
RESULTS: The expression of LIMK1 in lung adenocarcinoma tissues was significantly upregulated than those in adjacent normal tissues. Increased LIMK1 mRNA expression was associated with lymph node metastases and high TNM stage. The ROC curve analysis showed that with a cutoff level of 4.908, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for LIMK1 differentiate lung adenocarcinoma from adjacent controls were 69.5, 93.2, and 71.9%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed lung adenocarcinoma patients with high- LIMK1 had a worse prognosis than those with low- LIMK1 (43.1 vs. 55.1 months, P = 0.028). Correlation analysis indicated LIMK1 mRNA expression was correlated with tumor purity and immune infiltrates.
CONCLUSION: Upregulated LIMK1 is significantly correlated with poor survival and immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma. Our study suggests that LIMK1 can be used as a biomarker of poor prognosis and potential immune therapy target in lung adenocarcinoma.",,"Funding.

A clustering analysis was performed, grouping the peptides by physicochemical features. Although a relationship between the overall yield and the physicochemical features of the sequences was not established, the process showed good performance despite sequence diversity. The recycling system allowed to reduce N, N-dimethylformamide usage by 25-30% and reduce the deprotection reagent usage by 50%.

In the present study, we tested the biostimulant proprieties of a sedimentary shale ore-extracted humic acid (HA) on Micro Tom tomato plants under increasing nutritional stress and investigated the correlation with the chemical features of HA by means of ultra-high resolution FT-ICR MS, FT-ATR, and 13C-NMR. Humic acid application proved effective in alleviating the nutritional stress by improving nutrient use efficiency, with results comparable to the control treatment supplied with higher NPK nutrition. Increased yield (up to +19%) and fruit quality (in the range +10-24%), higher ascorbic acid content and a better root growth were the main parameters affected by HA application. Molecular-level characterization identified the possible chemical drivers of bioactivity, and included flavonoids, quinones, and alkaloids among the most represented molecules, some of which exhibiting antioxidant, pro-oxidant, and antimicrobial activity. The redox effect was discussed as a determinant of the delicate homeostasis balance, capable of triggering plant defense response and eventually inducing a protective priming effect on the plants.","A portion of this work was performed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, which is supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Chemistry and Division of Materials Research through Cooperative Agreement No. DMR-1644779 and the state of Florida.","Funding.

Integration and social competence in the migrant population are determined by several factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of resilience and acculturation stress on the levels of integration and social competence in migrant students in Northern Chile. In total, 292 school children of both genders aged 8 to 18, from the fourth grade to senior year of high school, participated in the investigation. A subscale of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System (Sistema de evaluación de niños y adolescentes SENA) was used to assess integration and social competence. Additionally, the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12) and the Acculturation Stress Source Scale (FEAC) were used. The results show that integration and social competence have statistically significant and direct associations with resilience (p < 0.001) and indirect associations with acculturation stress (p = 0.009). Both constructs could be defined as protection and risk factors, respectively, and should be considered in educational contexts to favor adaptation in the integration of migrant children and adolescents.",,This research was funded by ANID PIA CIE160007.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of IPD and the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-10 (PCV-10) over a 10-year period in Bogotá, Colombia.
METHODS: This was a laboratory-based surveillance study of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with IPD from 82 hospitals over 10 years in Bogotá, Colombia. Data were compared between two periods: 2007-2011 (before the introduction of PCV-10) and 2012-2017 (after the introduction of PCV-10).
RESULTS: In total, 1670 patients with IPD were included in the study between 2007 and 2017. Between 2007 and 2011, the most common serotypes were 14, 1, 6B, 6A and 3. Between 2012 and 2017, the most common serotypes were 19A, 3, 14 and 1. A decrease in the incidence of IPD, particularly in children aged 0-4 years, was noted after the introduction of PCV-10. Importantly, this reduction in incidence was not observed in patients aged ≥50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The IPD burden in Bogotá remained stable between 2007 and 2017. The incidence of IPD decreased in children but not in older adults. The introduction of PCV-10 led to a change in the most prevalent serotypes to serotypes that are not included in PCV-10.",,,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,"Aged; Child, Preschool; Colombia; Cost of Illness; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumococcal Infections; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Serogroup; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Vaccines, Conjugate",2021-02-11,2021,2021-02-11,2021-04,105,,32-39,All OA; Gold,Article,"Severiche-Bueno, David Felipe; Severiche-Bueno, Diego Fernando; Bastidas, Alirio; Caceres, Eder L; Silva, Edwin; Lozada, Julián; Gomez, Sandra; Vargas, Hernán; Viasus, Diego; Reyes, Luis F","Severiche-Bueno, David Felipe (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Severiche-Bueno, Diego Fernando (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Bastidas, Alirio (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia; Clínica Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Caceres, Eder L (Clínica Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Silva, Edwin (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Lozada, Julián (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia.); Gomez, Sandra (Grupo Laboratorio de Salud Pública de Bogotá, Secretaria de Salud de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia.); Vargas, Hernán (Grupo Laboratorio de Salud Pública de Bogotá, Secretaria de Salud de Bogotá, Bogotá, Colombia.); Viasus, Diego (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Reyes, Luis F (Universidad de la Sabana, Chía, Colombia; Clínica Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia.

Gut mycobiota can be a source of novel yeasts with the potential to be used as probiotics or have industrial applications. In this work, we characterized two as-yet unexplored yeast communities from the intestinal content of the cultured marine Chilean fishes Genypterus&nbsp;chilensis (G. chilensis) and Seriolella violacea (S.&nbsp;violacea). Yeasts were isolated through culture, identified by sequencing their ITS region, and characterized their enzymatic profile with API®ZYM. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was identified in both fish species. For the first time, Candida palmioleophila, Candida pseudorugosa, Cystobasidium slooffiae, and a member of the Yamadazyma genus were also identified and described as part of the normal fish gut-microbiota. Furthermore, the diverse enzymatic profile exhibited by some of these isolates suggests that it may be possible to develop novel applications for them, such as new probiotics and other biotechnological applications.",We would like to gratefully acknowledge Colorado Chile S.A for the kind donation of the G. chilensis fish.

The participants were 1147 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (male: n = 479; female: n = 668) who watched a 12 s animation representing the situation and filled out a questionnaire to analyze the legitimation of violent behaviors and anxiety levels. We registered their decisions to solve the situation using a categorical scale that included assertive, avoidant, aggressive, submissive, and supportive behaviors. Gender was not associated with the adolescent's behaviors in facing a simulated peer aggression situation. However, male teenagers tended to perceive adults as sanctioners and neutrals; those who used the diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization to justify their behavior also showed a higher state of anxiety. Female teenagers who expected legitimation from their peers, presented higher anxiety as well. Educational interventions may use these results, helping adolescents to understand that their acts have substantial implications in the lives of others. It is essential to develop group interventions that modify how adolescents manage their conflicts and change gender stereotypes that significantly impact health. We highlight the need for linking families in educational programs facing the challenges of transforming the legitimization of violence in parental practices.",,This research received no external funding.,Brain Sciences,,"Annarita Milone, Gianluca Sesso",,2021-04-03,2021,2021-04-03,,11,4,458,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez-González, Marina B.; Turizo-Palencia, Yamile; Arenas-Rivera, Claudia; Acuña-Rodríguez, Mónica; Gómez-López, Yeferson; Clemente-Suárez, Vicente J.","Martínez-González, Marina B.

In this context, purinergic signaling emerges as a promising pathway for intervention due to its known role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. In this work, we explored in more detail the role of purinergic signaling in GC with several experimental approaches. First, we measured extracellular ATP concentrations on GC-derived cell lines (AGS, MKN-45, and MKN-74), finding higher levels of extracellular ATP than those obtained for the non-tumoral gastric cell line GES-1. Next, we established the P2Y2 and P2X4 receptors (P2Y2R and P2X4R) expression profile on these cells and evaluated their role on cell proliferation and migration after applying overexpression and knockdown strategies. In general, a P2Y2R overexpression and P2X4R downregulation pattern were observed on GC cell lines, and when these patterns were modified, concomitant changes in cell viability were observed. These modifications on gene expression also modified transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), showing that higher P2Y2R levels decreased TEER, and high P2X4R expression had the opposite effect, suggesting that P2Y2R and P2X4R activation could promote and suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively. These effects were confirmed after treating AGS cells with UTP, a P2Y2R-agonist that modified the expression patterns towards mesenchymal markers. To further characterize the effects of P2Y2R activation on EMT, we used cDNA microarrays and observed that UTP induced important transcriptional changes on several cell processes like cell proliferation induction, apoptosis inhibition, cell differentiation induction, and cell adhesion reduction. These results suggest that purinergic signaling plays a complex role in GC pathophysiology, and changes in purinergic balance can trigger tumorigenesis in non-tumoral gastric cells.","We are grateful with the Unidad de Microarreglos del Laboratorio Nacional de Apoyo a las Ciencias Genómicas from Instituto de Fisiología Celular-UNAM-México, to Adriana Gonzalez Gallardo for its technical assistance and to Hervis Galleguillos (UCN) for his technical assistance.","Our work was funded by FONDECYT Regular Grant 1161490, FONDEQUIP EQM140100, PAPIIT-UNAM-México IN202620, Intramural grant N° 20210401007 “Núcleo para el estudio del cáncer a nivel básico, aplicado y clínico”, VRIDT, UCN and Millennium Nucleus for the Study of Pain.

The study focused on the Asphalt-Binders' high-temperature rheological properties, namely, the G*, δ, G*/Sin(δ) and G*/(1 - (1/Tan(δ)Sin(δ))) parameters, measured using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) device. The DSR data analyzed in the study were extracted from the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database, namely, the Texas Data Storage System (DSS), covering two Asphalt-Binders (ABs), performance grade (PG) 64-22 and PG 76-22 plant-mix extracted ABs that were treated as rolling thin film oven (RTFO) residue, and sourced from 14 different suppliers. The study findings substantiate that material-source has an effect on the high-temperature rheological properties of ABs. Additionally, it was also concluded that in as much as performance superiority and costs are crucial issues in deciding the AB source/provider, consistency and quality aspects cannot be disregarded. Therefore, material-source effects should be inclusively evaluated from both performance (rheological properties) and quality (consistence) standpoints as well as cost considerations when choosing a supplier. In general, the study contributes to the state-of-the-art enrichment on aspects of material-source effects on RTFO residue ABs' high-temperature rheological properties, consistency, variability, and data quality.","The authors thank the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for their support, particularly the Texas flexible pavements and overlays database (the Texas DSS) project that valuably served as the data source for the work presented in this paper.

A concerning aspect of invasive candidiasis is the emergence of resistant isolates, especially those highly resistant to fluconazole, the first choice of treatment for these infections. Fungal sphingolipids have been considered a potential target for new therapeutic approaches and some inhibitors have already been tested against pathogenic fungi. The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the action of two sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, aureobasidin A and myriocin, against different C. albicans and C. glabrata strains, including clinical isolates resistant to fluconazole. Susceptibility tests of aureobasidin A and myriocin were performed using CLSI protocols, and their interaction with fluconazole was evaluated by a checkerboard protocol. All Candida strains tested were sensitive to both inhibitors. Regarding the evaluation of drug interaction, both aureobasidin A and myriocin were synergic with fluconazole, demonstrating that sphingolipid synthesis inhibition could enhance the effect of fluconazole. Thus, these results suggest that sphingolipid inhibitors in conjunction with fluconazole could be useful for treating candidiasis cases, especially those caused by fluconazole resistant isolates.",The authors thank Walter Oelemann for English revision.,This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnolÓgico (CNPq) Universal-Processo # 408981/2018-0 and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do estado do Rio de Janeiro-CNE (Faperj) Processo # E-26/202974/2017.,Pathogens,,Jonathan Richardson,,2021-07-07,2021,2021-07-07,,10,7,856,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rollin-Pinheiro, Rodrigo; Bayona-Pacheco, Brayan; Domingos, Levy Tenorio Sousa; da Rocha Curvelo, Jose Alexandre; de Castro, Gabriellen Menezes Migliani; Barreto-Bergter, Eliana; Ferreira-Pereira, Antonio","Rollin-Pinheiro, Rodrigo (Laboratório de Química Biológica de Microrganismos, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, rodrigorollin@gmail.com, (R.R.-P.);, eliana.bergter@micro.ufrj.br, (E.B.-B.)); Bayona-Pacheco, Brayan (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, bbayona@uninorte.edu.co, (B.B.-P.);, levydomingos@yahoo.com.br, (L.T.S.D.);, alexandrecurvelo@hotmail.com, (J.A.d.R.C.);, g.migliani@gmail.com, (G.M.M.d.C.); Departamento de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, vía Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Domingos, Levy Tenorio Sousa (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, bbayona@uninorte.edu.co, (B.B.-P.);, levydomingos@yahoo.com.br, (L.T.S.D.);, alexandrecurvelo@hotmail.com, (J.A.d.R.C.);, g.migliani@gmail.com, (G.M.M.d.C.)); da Rocha Curvelo, Jose Alexandre (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, bbayona@uninorte.edu.co, (B.B.-P.);, levydomingos@yahoo.com.br, (L.T.S.D.);, alexandrecurvelo@hotmail.com, (J.A.d.R.C.);, g.migliani@gmail.com, (G.M.M.d.C.)); de Castro, Gabriellen Menezes Migliani (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, bbayona@uninorte.edu.co, (B.B.-P.);, levydomingos@yahoo.com.br, (L.T.S.D.);, alexandrecurvelo@hotmail.com, (J.A.d.R.C.);, g.migliani@gmail.com, (G.M.M.d.C.)); Barreto-Bergter, Eliana (Laboratório de Química Biológica de Microrganismos, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, rodrigorollin@gmail.com, (R.R.-P.);, eliana.bergter@micro.ufrj.br, (E.B.-B.)); Ferreira-Pereira, Antonio (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro 21941-902, Brazil;, bbayona@uninorte.edu.co, (B.B.-P.);, levydomingos@yahoo.com.br, (L.T.S.D.);, alexandrecurvelo@hotmail.com, (J.A.d.R.C.);, g.migliani@gmail.com, (G.M.M.d.C.))","Ferreira-Pereira, Antonio (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro)","Rollin-Pinheiro, Rodrigo (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); Bayona-Pacheco, Brayan (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro; Universidad del Norte); Domingos, Levy Tenorio Sousa (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); da Rocha Curvelo, Jose Alexandre (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); de Castro, Gabriellen Menezes Migliani (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); Barreto-Bergter, Eliana (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); Ferreira-Pereira, Antonio (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro)",14,10,1.45,3.98,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/7/856/pdf?version=1625671364,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139586415,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,

Here, we evaluate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) present in pre-transmission infant and maternal plasma and breast milk (BM) against the contemporaneous maternal HIV-1 variants. HIV-1-exposed uninfected compared with HIV-1-exposed infected infants have higher ADCC and a combination of ADCC and nAb responses against their corresponding mother's strains. ADCC does not correlate with nAbs, suggesting they are independent activities. The infected infants with high ADCC compared with low ADCC, but not those with higher ADCC plus nAbs, have lower morbidity up to 1 year after birth. A higher IgA to IgG ratio, observed in BM supernatants and in a higher proportion of the infected compared with the uninfected infants, associates with lower ADCC. Against the exposure strains, ADCC, more than nAbs, associates with both lower mother-to-child transmission and decreased post-infection infant morbidity.","We thank the participants of the BAN study, without whom none of this work would be possible.

Such attributes are of great importance for use in industrial purposes. Understanding how these characteristics are affected is still complex, but with the help of molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum calculations (QM), it is possible to understand the behavior of polymers at the molecular level with great consistency. This study was applied to polymers derived from polyacrylamide (PAM) due to its great use in various industries. The polymers studied include hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) (PAMPS), polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylene oxide polymer (PEO), and guar gum polysaccharide (GUAR). Each one has different attributes, which help in understanding the effects on the polymer and the medium in which it is applied along a broad spectrum. The results include the conformation, diffusion, ion condensation, the structure of the water around the polymer, and interatomic polymer interactions. Such characteristics are important to selecting a polymer depending on the environment in which it is found and its purpose. The effect caused by salinity is particular to each polymer, where polymers with an explicit charge or polyelectrolytes are more susceptible to changes due to salinity, increasing their coiling and reducing their mobility in solution. This naturally reduces its ability to form polymeric bridges due to having a polymer with a smaller gyration radius. In contrast, neutral polymers are less affected in their structure, making them favorable in media with high ionic charges.","G.R.Q., J.S. and R.I.J. thank the Centro CRHIAM Project ANID/Fondap/15130015 for financial support.

To determine the best treatment, detecting EGFR and KRAS mutations is of interest. However, non-invasive ways to obtain this information are not available. Furthermore, many times there is a lack of big enough relevant public datasets, so the performance of single classifiers is not outstanding. In this paper, an ensemble approach is applied to increase the performance of EGFR and KRAS mutation prediction using a small dataset. A new voting scheme, Selective Class Average Voting (SCAV), is proposed and its performance is assessed both for machine learning models and CNNs. For the EGFR mutation, in the machine learning approach, there was an increase in the sensitivity from 0.66 to 0.75, and an increase in AUC from 0.68 to 0.70. With the deep learning approach, an AUC of 0.846 was obtained, and with SCAV, the accuracy of the model was increased from 0.80 to 0.857. For the KRAS mutation, both in the machine learning models (0.65 to 0.71 AUC) and the deep learning models (0.739 to 0.778 AUC), a significant increase in performance was found. The results obtained in this work show how to effectively learn from small image datasets to predict EGFR and KRAS mutations, and that using ensembles with SCAV increases the performance of machine learning classifiers and CNNs. The results provide confidence that as large datasets become available, tools to augment clinical capabilities can be fielded.",This research could not have been performed without the aid of the Fulbright Visiting Researcher Scholarship that allowed the collaboration between the University of South Florida and Universidad del Norte in Colombia.

In turn, sleep disorders (SD) may be more frequently reported in uncertain circumstances.
OBJECTIVES: To identify the association between loneliness and severe SD, in women quarantined due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study carried out in women, between 40 and 79 years and living in Colombia. The women were invited through social network to complete 5 digital instruments: de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Menopause Rating Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Five-item Version, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and Francis Religion Scale. Bivariate analysis and adjusted logistic regression between loneliness and SD were performed.
RESULTS: 1133 women participated, half of them under 50 years old. 43.1% had emotional loneliness, 39.9% social loneliness and 43.3% general loneliness. SD were identified in 6 out of 10 women, those with mild SD presented an OR of 1.84, 1.85, and 1.64, for emotional, social and general loneliness, respectively. Loneliness was associated twice with moderate SD, and more than twice with severe SD. Very severe SD reached OR:5.81 for emotional loneliness, OR:4.38 social loneliness and OR:4.02 general loneliness. In the presence of religiosity, fear and anxiety due to COVID-19, statistical significance was retained for associations, except intense SD with general loneliness.
CONCLUSIONS: SD were significantly associated with loneliness in our study population. It is important to assess sleep quality and perception of loneliness in middle-aged women, especially during periods of quarantine due to a pandemic to avoid health implications.","To the Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia, which institutionally supports the Women’s Health Research Group and the CAVIMEC+COVID STUDY (Calidad de Vida en la Menopausia y Etnias Colombianas bajo condición de Pandemia).","Funding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Primary Care & Community Health,,,Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Wake Disorders,2021-01,2021,2021-06-16,2021-01,12,,21501327211025170,All OA; Gold,Article,"Monterrosa-Castro, Álvaro; Monterrosa-Blanco, Angélica; González-Sequeda, Andrea","Monterrosa-Castro, Álvaro (Grupo de Investigación Salud de la Mujer.

Methods: Obtaining the expression of apoptosis-related genes and associated clinical parameters from online datasets (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA), their biological function analyses were performed through differently expressed genes. By means of LASSO, unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analyses, this predictive signature was constructed and validated by internal and external databases (both TCGA and ArrayExpress). Results: A total of nine apoptosis-related genes (SLC27A2, TNFAIP2, IFI44, CSF2, IL4, MDK, DOCK8, WNT5A, APP) were ultimately screened as associated hub genes and utilized to construct a prognosis model. Then our constructed riskScore model significantly passed the validation in both the internal and external datasets of OS (all p < 0.05) and verified their expressions by qRT-PCR. Moreover, we conducted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), finding the area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were all above 0.70 which indicated that riskScore was a stable independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05). Furthermore, prognostic nomograms were established to figure out the relationship between 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and individual parameters for ccRCC patients. Additionally, survival analyses indicated that our riskScore worked well in predicting OS in subgroups of age, gender, grade, stage, T, M, N0, White (all p < 0.05), except for African, Asian and N1 (p > 0.05).

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and intensity of occupational burnout among pre-hospital emergency staff in Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data resources included Scientific Information Database (SID), Magiran, Islamic World Science Citation Center (ISC), Irandoc, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.
RESULTS: Initially, 178 articles were extracted, and then 13 articles were finally analyzed. Overall,2034 pre-hospital emergency personnel were examined. Mean of occupational burnout in term of frequency, respectively for emotional exhaustion (16.78, 95% CI = 8.89-24.67, I2 = 62.30%, p = 0.004), depersonalization (11.57, 95% CI = 6.97-16.18, I2 = 68.50%, p = 0.001) and the lack of personal accomplishment (16.11, 95% CI = 8.60 -23.62, I2 = 74.70%, p = 0 <001) were determined. Also, in term of intensity, respectively for emotional exhaustion (17.90, 95% CI = 8.24-27.57, I2 = 64.80, p = 0.004), depersonalization (11.20, 95% CI = 6.80-16.22, I2 = 49.60%, p = 0.044) and the lack of personal accomplishment (23.45, 95% CI = 13.41 -33.49, I2 = 84.80%, p = 0 <001) were determined.
CONCLUSIONS: According to findings, depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment had moderate and high-level, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary health policymakers pay special attention to identifying and resolving the causes of occupational burnout in this population.","The authors thank Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran for the financial support of this research.",,Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research,,,,2021-01-18,2021,2021-01-18,2021-01,26,1,11-17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sahebi, Ali; Golitaleb, Mohamad; Jahangiri, Katayoun","Sahebi, Ali (Department of Health in Disasters and Emergencies, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Golitaleb, Mohamad (Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran); Jahangiri, Katayoun (Department of Health in Disasters and Emergencies, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran)","Jahangiri, Katayoun (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences)","Sahebi, Ali (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences); Golitaleb, Mohamad (Arak University of Medical Sciences); Jahangiri, Katayoun (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences)",7,6,1.36,3.83,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_175_20,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137521640,42 Health Sciences; 4204 Midwifery; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

The history of tachinid collectors in Chile and authors who have contributed to the systematic knowledge of Chilean tachinids is extensively reviewed. The classification has been updated and 122 genera and 264 species are recognised in Chile. There is a significant amount of endemism with 28 genera and 100 species known only from Chile. There are also 113 species with distributions shared only between Chile and Argentina, particularly in the southern portions of these countries comprising Patagonia. The catalogue is based on examination of the original descriptions of all nominal species and all other references known to us containing relevant taxonomic and distributional information, for a total of approximately 450 references. Many of the name-bearing types and other Chilean specimens housed in collections were examined. Taxa are arranged hierarchically and alphabetically under the categories of subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus (where recognised), and species. Nomenclatural information is provided for genus-group and species-group names, including lists of synonyms (mostly restricted to Neotropical taxa) and name-bearing type data. Species distributions are recorded by country within the New World and by larger geographical divisions in the Old World. Additional information is given in the form of notes and references under valid names at the level of tribe, genus, and species. Two genera are newly recorded from Chile: Chaetoepalpus Vimmer & Soukup, 1940 (Tachinini) (also newly recorded from Argentina) and Patelloa Townsend, 1916 (Goniini). Four species are newly recorded from Chile or other countries: Lyphaornata Aldrich, 1934 (Chile); Chaetoepalpuscoquilleti Vimmer & Soukup, 1940 (Argentina and Chile); Phytomypteraevanescens (Cortés, 1967) (Argentina); and Xanthobasisunicolor Aldrich, 1934 (Chile).

Food-borne diseases are considered a major public health challenge worldwide due to their incidence, associated mortality, and negative economic repercussions. Food safety is the guarantee that foods will not cause harm to the health of those who consume them, and it is a fundamental property of food quality. Food safety can be at risk of being lost at any stage of the food chain if the food is contaminated by pathogenic microorganisms. Many diverse bacteria are present in the environment and as part of the microbiota of food that can be transmitted to humans during the handling and consumption of food. Plesiomonas shigelloides has been mainly associated with outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases due to the consumption of fish. This bacterium inhabits the environment and aquatic animals and is associated with the microbiota of fish such as tilapia, a fish of importance in fishing, aquaculture, commercialization, and consumption worldwide. The purpose of this document is to provide, through a bibliographic review of databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, among others), a general informative perspective on food-borne diseases and, in particular, the consumption of fish and tilapia. Diseases derived from contamination by Plesiomonas shigelloides are included, and control and prevention actions and sanitary regulations for fishery products established in several countries around the world are discussed to promote the safety of foods of aquatic origin intended for human consumption and to protect public health.",Alejandro De Jesús Cortés Sánchez and Luis Daniel Espinosa-Chaurand acknowledge financial support given by the National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT) to “Cátedra” position at CIBNOR.

However, few studies have analyzed the relationship between identity from different theoretical perspectives, and the mental health of migrants in the Latin-American context. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between several identity indicators such as ethnic identity, collective self-esteem, identity fusion (with the country of origin and the host country) simultaneously, and different dimensions of psychological well-being of Colombian migrants living in Chile. The sample consisted of 887 Colombian migrants, of whom 435 (49%) were men and 452 (51%) were women. Participants were residents of the cities of Arica (n=204; 23%), Antofagasta (n=469; 52.9%), and Santiago (n=214; 24.1%) in Chile. The results revealed by structural equation modeling indicate that collective self-esteem and ethnic identity show positive relationships with almost all dimensions of psychological well-being, while identity fusion with Colombia only showed a positive relationship with the dimension positive relationships and identity fusion with Chile only showed a positive relationship with the dimension autonomy. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed at the end.",,"This publication is derived from the project FONDECYT Regular #1180315, funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of the Government of Chile.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-10-20,2021,2021-10-20,,12,,707101,All OA; Gold,Article,"Henríquez, Diego; Urzúa, Alfonso; López-López, Wilson","Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); López-López, Wilson (Facultad de Psicología, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Henríquez, Diego (Catholic University of the North); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); López-López, Wilson (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana)",7,4,1.3,2.28,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.707101/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142006061,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

During the last decade, a shift in serotype prevalence has occurred as traditionally less prevalent serotypes are increasing in frequency of infections, especially those related to poultry meat contamination. S. Infantis is one of the major emerging serotypes, and these strains commonly display antimicrobial resistance and can persist despite cleaning protocols. Thus, this work aimed to isolate S. Infantis strains from a poultry meat farm in Santiago, Chile and to characterize genetic variations present in them. We determined their genomic and phenotypic profiles at different points along the production line. The results indicate that the strains encompass 853 polymorphic sites (core-SNPs) with isolates differing from one another by 0-347 core SNPs, suggesting variation among them; however, we found discrete correlations with the source of the sample in the production line. Furthermore, the pan-genome was composed of 4854 total gene clusters of which 2618 (53.9%) corresponds to the core-genome and only 181 (3.7%) are unique genes (those present in one particular strain). This preliminary analysis will enrich the surveillance of Salmonella, yet further studies are required to assess their evolution and phylogeny.","Genome sequencing was carried out by MicrobesNG (http://www.microbesng.uk, accessed on 13 February 2021), which is supported by the BBSRC (grant number BB/L024209/1).

The objective of this study was to determine the body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (% BF), waist circumference (WC), and anemia in university students. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2,285 university students from Lima, Peru. The sample was selected by nonprobability convenience sampling. Anthropometric data and hemoglobin levels were measured. The Chi-square test was used. The analysis of the associated factors was done using binary logistic regression. A significance level of 5% was considered. There were no significant differences between men and women in BMI (p > 0.05). The men presented significantly high and very high levels of % BF (p < 0.001). The proportion of women who presented anemia and high and very high WC was significantly higher compared to men (p < 0.001).

Fruits: An Atlas of Metabolites With Biotechnological Significance,"The whole genome of Weissella cibaria strain UTNGt21O isolated from wild fruits of Solanum quitoense (naranjilla) shrub was sequenced and annotated. The similarity proportions based on the genus level, as a result of the best hits for the entire contig, were 54.84% with Weissella, 6.45% with Leuconostoc, 3.23% with Lactococcus, and 35.48% no match. The closest genome was W. cibaria SP7 (GCF_004521965.1) with 86.21% average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 3.2% alignment coverage. The genome contains 1,867 protein-coding genes, among which 1,620 were assigned with the EggNOG database. On the basis of the results, 438 proteins were classified with unknown function from which 247 new hypothetical proteins have no match in the nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) database. It also contains 78 tRNAs, six copies of 5S rRNA, one copy of 16S rRNA, one copy of 23S rRNA, and one copy of tmRNA. The W. cibaria UTNGt21O strain harbors several genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, cellular process, general stress responses, cofactors, and vitamins, conferring probiotic features. A pangenome analysis indicated the presence of various strain-specific genes encoded for proteins responsible for the defense mechanisms as well as gene encoded for enzymes with biotechnological value, such as penicillin acylase and folates; thus, W. cibaria exhibited high genetic diversity. The genome characterization indicated the presence of a putative CRISPR-Cas array and five prophage regions and the absence of acquired antibiotic resistance genes, virulence, and pathogenic factors; thus, UTNGt21O might be considered a safe strain. Besides, the interaction between the peptide extracts from UTNGt21O and Staphylococcus aureus results in cell death caused by the target cell integrity loss and the release of aromatic molecules from the cytoplasm. The results indicated that W. cibaria UTNGt21O can be considered a beneficial strain to be further exploited for developing novel antimicrobials and probiotic products with improved technological characteristics.","The authors are thankful to the Centre of Research (CUICYT), Technical University of the North, Ecuador, for funding the work.

Furthermore, free-roaming domestic animals and use of yucca and/or manioc as a primary food source favor the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths, e.g., Toxocara&nbsp;canis and Toxocara&nbsp;cati, the roundworms of dogs and cats. Infection may result in the clinical picture of toxocarosis, one of the most common zoonotic helminthoses worldwide. To estimate the Toxocara seroprevalence in four different villages of the Wiwa community, serum samples from 483 inhabitants were analyzed for anti-Toxocara-antibodies. Overall, 79.3% (383/483) of analyzed samples were seropositive. Statistically significant differences were observed between the four villages, as well as age groups (adults > adolescents > children), while sex had no effect. The high seropositivity rate demonstrates the risk of zoonotic roundworm infections and potential clinical disease in vulnerable indigenous inhabitants.","The authors would like to thank the Else-Kröner-Fresenius-Foundation for funding an earlier project in which the blood samples were collected.

Activates Ubiquitination and Proteasome Degradation of β-catenin to Suppress Metastasis of Hepatitis B-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Compound Phyllanthus urinaria L. (CP) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for cancer treatment in the clinic, particularly during progression of hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-associated HCC). Nevertheless, its anti-metastatic action and mechanisms are not well elucidated. In this study, CP was found to exert remarkable inhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HBV-associated HCC cells. The following network and biological analyses predicted that CP mainly targeted Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) to induce anti-metastatic effects, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway was one of the core mechanisms of CP action against HBV-associated HCC. Further experimental validation implied that Cav-1 overexpression promoted metastasis of HBV-associated HCC by stabilizing β-catenin, while CP administration induced autophagic degradation of Cav-1, activated the Akt/GSK3β-mediated proteasome degradation of β-catenin via ubiquitination activation, and subsequently attenuated the metastasis-promoting effect of Cav-1. In addition, the anti-cancer and anti-metastatic action of CP was further confirmed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments. It was found that CP inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis of HBV-associated HCC in both mice liver cancer xenograft and zebrafish xenotransplantation models. Taken together, our study not only highlights the novel function of CP formula in suppressing metastasis of HBV-associated HCC, but it also addresses the critical role of Cav-1 in mediating Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis to control the late-phase of cancer progression.",The authors are grateful to the support of Laboratory of TCM Syndrome Essence and Objectification.

Although Grade group (GG) is widely accepted as an indicator of prostate cancer grade, there are malignancies that cannot be defined by GG alone. Moreover, the relationship between GG and other parameters remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to explore the biological characteristics of prostate cancer.
METHODS: This study included 299 radical prostatectomy cases. The Chi-square test and analysis of variance were used to analyze the association of GG with binary and continuous variables. We then conducted morphological analyses. Multivariate analyses were performed to extract the data on risk factors for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and lymph node metastasis.
RESULTS: The lymphatic, venous, perineural, and seminal vesicle invasion rates were 37/299 (12.4%), 25/299 (8.4%), 280/299 (93.6%), and 23/299 (7.7%), respectively. The extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive surgical margin, tertiary Gleason pattern 5, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate gland, and lymph node metastasis rates were 89/299 (29.8%), 106/299 (35.5%), 33/260 (12.7%), 56/299 (18.7%), and 23/299 (7.7%), respectively. As GG increased, various parameters became easier to visualize; however, there were differences between the parameters. Postoperative BCR was observed in 31/242 (12.8%) cases without preoperative hormone therapy; GG2, GG3, GG4, and GG5 accounted for 4, 7, 7, and 13 cases, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that GG and tumor diameter were significant risk factors for early BCR, whereas lymphatic invasion, EPE, and seminal vesicle invasion were significant risk factors for lymph node metastasis. For BCR, the odds ratios (ORs) for GG and tumor diameter were 2.253 (95% confidence interval (CI]): 1.297-3.912; P=0.004) and 1.074 (95% CI: 1.011-1.142; P=0.022), respectively. For lymph node metastasis, ORs for the presence of lymphatic invasion, EPE, and seminal vesicle invasion were 7.425 (95% CI: 1.688-22.583; P=0.004), 4.391 (95% CI: 1.037-18.589; P=0.044), and 5.755 (95% CI: 1.308-25.316; P=0.021), respectively.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with kidney cancer were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to comprise the training group from 2010 to 2017, and the validation group was drawn from our academic medical center. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses explored the statistical relationships between the included variables and BM. Statistically significant risk factors were applied to develop a nomogram. Calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, probability density functions (PDF), and clinical utility curves (CUC) were used to verify the predictive performance. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves demonstrated survival differences between two subgroups of kidney cancer with and without BMs. A convenient web calculator was provided for users via ""shiny"" package.
RESULTS: A total of 43,503 patients were recruited in this study, of which 42,650 were training group cases and 853 validation group cases. The variables included in the nomogram were sex, pathological grade, T-stage, N-stage, sequence number, brain metastases, liver metastasis, pulmonary metastasis, histological type, primary site, and laterality. The calibration plots confirmed good agreement between the prediction model and the actual results. The area under the curve (AUC) values in the training and validation groups were 0.952 (95% CI, 0.950-0.954) and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.809-0.860), respectively. Based on CUC, we recommend a threshold probability of 5% to guide the diagnosis of BMs.
CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive predictive tool consisting of nomogram and web calculator contributes to risk stratification which helped clinicians identify high-risk cases and provide personalized treatment options.",The authors thank Haoxi Feng for his help in processing the figures.,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81601901) and Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning, China (No. 2019-MS-079).",Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-25,2021,2021-11-25,,11,,731905,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dong, Shengtao; Yang, Hua; Tang, Zhi-Ri; Ke, Yuqi; Wang, Haosheng; Li, Wenle; Tian, Kang","Dong, Shengtao (Department of Bone and Joint, First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China; Department of Spine Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China); Yang, Hua (Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China); Tang, Zhi-Ri (School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Ke, Yuqi (Department of Orthopaedics Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China); Wang, Haosheng (Orthopaedic Medical Center, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China); Li, Wenle (Department of Orthopedics, Xianyang Central Hospital, Xianyang, China; Clinical Medical Research Center, Xianyang Center Hospital, Xianyang, China); Tian, Kang (Department of Bone and Joint, First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China)","Li, Wenle (Xian Yang Central Hospital; Clinical Medical Research Center, Xianyang Center Hospital, Xianyang, China); Tian, Kang (Dalian Medical University)","Dong, Shengtao (Dalian Medical University; Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Yang, Hua (Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Tang, Zhi-Ri (Wuhan University); Ke, Yuqi (Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Wang, Haosheng (Second Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University); Li, Wenle (Xian Yang Central Hospital; Clinical Medical Research Center, Xianyang Center Hospital, Xianyang, China); Tian, Kang (Dalian Medical University)",15,10,1.16,5.61,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.731905/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143508172,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

We ascertained whether these predictors are different in women vs. men and between women living with vs. without children. Data were collected through online surveys administered to 1038 participants from two universities (staff and students) in Chile, across five waves (July to October 2020). Participants provided information about their past-week unhealthy food and alcohol consumption and mental health. Using latent growth curve modeling analysis, we found that higher perceived health and interpersonal COVID-19 impact, younger age and lower depression symptoms were associated with more rapid increases over time in unhealthy food consumption. On the other hand, higher perceived COVID-19 economic impact and older age were associated with more rapid diachronic decreases in alcohol consumption. Gender and living with or without children, for women only, were moderators of these trajectories. This longitudinal study provides strong evidence identifying the multiple repercussions of COVID-19 and mental health factors on unhealthy food and alcohol consumption. These findings highlight the need for interventions aimed at minimizing the impact of the pandemic on unhealthy food and alcohol consumption over time.",,"This research was funded by National Research and Development Agency (ANID, Chile), grant number COVID0282.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

Combining X-ray diffraction analyses, scanning electron microscopy and molecular diversity studies, we have characterized twenty previously unexplored Andean microbial ecosystems in eight different lakes and wetlands from the middle-east and south-east regions of this salt flat. The mats and microbialites studied are mainly formed by calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite) and halite, whereas the endoevaporites are composed predominantly of gypsum and halite. The carbonate-rich mats and microbialites are dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, the most abundant classes are Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. While in the phylum Bacteroidetes, the most abundant classes are Bacteroidia and Rhodothermia. Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia phyla are also well-represented in the majority of these systems. Gypsum endoevaporites, on the contrary, are dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Euryarchaeota phyla. The Cyanobacteria phylum is also abundant in these systems, but it is less represented in comparison to mats and microbialites. Regarding the eukaryotic taxa, diatoms are key structural components in most of the microbial ecosystems studied. The genera of diatoms identified were Achnanthes, Fallacia, Halamphora, Mastogloia, Navicula, Nitzschia, and Surirella. Normally, in the mats and microbialites, diatoms form nano-globular carbonate aggregates with filamentous cyanobacteria and other prokaryotic cells, suggesting their participation in the mineral precipitation process. This work expands our knowledge of the microbial ecosystems inhabiting the extreme environments from the Central Andes region, which is important to ensure their protection and conservation.",,"This work was supported by the Company Albemarle Ltda Chile and the Scientific and Technological Research Fund from Argentina (FONCyT, PICT V 2015/3825).

Improving the nutrient storage capacity of soils or substrates is an effective approach for solving this problem. Humic acids (HA) are excellent soil conditioners. Thus, in the present study, their ability to improve the physico-chemical properties of three substrates with different textures was evaluated. HA treatments included 1% HA root application in three different types of substrates, including pure sand, pure cocopeat, and a mixture of sand:cocopeat (1:1, v/v) and their relative controls. We examined the morphological parameters of cucumber seedlings as well as pH buffering capacity (pHBC), total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and nutrient storage capacity of the three substrates. The results show that HA application improved the morphological parameters of cucumber seedlings (plant height, stem diameter, and biomass) in pure cocopeat and cocopeat-sand mixture treatments. On the contrary, HA addition had harmful effects on the cucumber seedlings cultivated in sand due to the low pHBC of sand. The seedlings cultivated in pure cocopeat showed the best morphological parameter performances among the seedlings grown in the three substrates. Furthermore, pHBC, TOC, OM, and CEC were enhanced by HA application. Incorporation of HA improved ammonium (NH4 +) and potassium (K+) storage capacity while decreasing phosphorus (P) storage. Pure cocopeat had the highest pHBC, TOC, OM, CEC, and nutrient storage capacity among the three substrates. In conclusion, mixing 1% HA into substrates promoted cucumber growth, improved substrate properties, and enhanced fertilizer use efficiency. Pure cocopeat is a suitable substrate for cucumber cultivation, and mixing cocopeat with sand amends the substrate properties and consequently improves plant growth.","We are grateful to Heng Wang, Lin Chai, Peng Liu, and Xue Zhang for their constructive advice on the experiments, Yangfan Song and Cong Wang for the management of greenhouse.

A total of 5183 people from the aforementioned countries participated, selected using the snowball sampling method. Measurement invariance was assessed by multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) and Multi-Group Factor Analysis Alignment (CFA-MIAL). In addition, item characteristics were assessed based on Item Response Theory. The results indicate that the original five-item version of the PCIBS is not adequate; whereas a four-item version of the PCIBS (PCIBS-4) showed a good fit in all countries. Thus, using the MG-CFA method, the PCIBS-4 achieved metric invariance, while the CFA-MIAL method indicated that the PCIBS-4 shows metric and scalar invariance. Likewise, the four items present increasing difficulties and high values in the discrimination parameters. The comparison of means of the PCIBS-4 reported irrelevant differences between countries; however, Mexico and Peru presented the highest frequency of preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. It is concluded that the PCIBS-4 is a unidimensional self-report measure which is reliable and invariant across the twelve participating Latin American countries. It is expected that the findings will be of interest to social and health scientists, as well as those professionals directly involved in public health decision making.","The authors would like to thank the respondents, who kindly participated in this research.",This research was funded by COVID-19 crisis seed grant from Universidad Privada del Norte to TC-R (registry number: FCS_UPN_2021-2).,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-11-16,2021,2021-11-16,,12,,763993,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Valencia, Pablo D.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Vivanco-Vidal, Andrea; Saroli-Araníbar, Daniela; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; White, Michel; Rojas-Jara, Claudio; Polanco-Carrasco, Roberto; Gallegos, Miguel; Cervigni, Mauricio; Martino, Pablo; Palacios, Diego Alejandro; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Samaniego-Pinho, Antonio; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Ferrari, Ilka Franco; Flores-Mendoza, Carmen; Figares, Andrés Buschiazzo; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena; Corrales-Reyes, Ibraín Enrique; Calderón, Raymundo; Tapia, Bismarck Pinto; Gallegos, Walter L.

In the greenhouse cultivation, air temperature and relative air humidity are regulated by switching on/off the evaporative systems and opening/closing the roof windows, which causes VPD fluctuation. However, it remains unclear how VPD fluctuation affects photosynthetic and growth performance in plants. Here, we examined the effects of the VPD fluctuation on the photosynthetic and growth characteristics in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The parameters for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass production were evaluated under the conditions of drastic (1.63 kPa for 6 min and 0.63 for 3 min) or moderate (1.32 kPa for 7 min and 0.86 kPa for 3 min) VPD fluctuation. The drastic VPD fluctuation induced gradual decrease in stomatal conductance and thus CO2 assimilation rate during the measurements, while moderate VPD fluctuation caused no reduction of these parameters. Furthermore, data showed moderate VPD fluctuation maintained leaf expansion and the efficiency of CO2 diffusion across leaf surface, resulting in enhanced plant growth compared with drastic VPD fluctuation. Taken together, fine regulation of VPD can be crucial for better plant growth by maintaining the photosynthetic performance in lettuce. The present work demonstrates the importance of VPD control during plant cultivation in plant factories and greenhouses.",,"Funding.

The causes of acculturation stress are diverse, but most are similar in the migrant population. Despite the importance of evaluating this variable, few studies have reported culturally adapted and validated instruments for specific populations. Based on this, the aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a short scale for the evaluation of acculturation stress (EBEA).MethodsTwo studies were conducted, involving 1725 first-generation Colombian and Peruvian migrants living in Chile, between the ages of 18 and 60 years. In addition to the EBEA and as evidence of validity, the Beck Anxiety Scale and the WHOQOL-BREF psychological health domain were applied. A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out, and the reliability and nomological validity were evaluated.ResultsThe results in both studies indicated that the scale presents a factorial structure of three dimensions: (a) the stress derived from the preparation and departure from the country of origin, (b) the stress produced by socioeconomic concerns in the host country, and (c) the tensions typical of adaptation to sociocultural changes or Chilean society. The reliability coefficients and the analysis of their nomological validity were very good.ConclusionsThe EBEA is a measure that offers quick, useful screening for researchers who need a short measure for research among migrants. This tool contributes to the work of education, prevention, and intervention in the field of general health and migrants’ mental health.",Not applicable.,"This study was funded by the National Research and Development Agency of the Government of Chile (ANID) through FONDECYT 1180315, which had no influence on the writing of this article.",Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica,,,,2021-01-06,2021,2021-01-06,2021-12,34,1,3,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Henríquez, Diego; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Smith-Castro, Vanessa","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Avda.

The electrical potentials of the SOO and IOO muscles were recorded using a DAB-Bluetooth electromyography machine (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany) during the following tasks: At clinical rest, saliva swallowing, lip protrusion, lip compression, and production of the syllable/pa/. The Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare the study results between the groups. An analysis of the electromyographical (EMG) recordings showed that the electrical activity of the orbicularis oris muscle in children with DS and lip incompetence was significantly higher compared to healthy children during saliva swallowing, lip compression, and when producing the syllable/pa/, and this may suggest greater muscular effort due to the need to seal the lips during these functional conditions.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,Mark A.

The hypotheses of this study hold that (1) self-reports of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients and caregivers would be positively correlated, (2) caregivers would self-report a greater impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and (3) patients infected with COVID-19 would experience lower levels of mental health improvement and higher levels of psychological distress. Hypotheses were tested using correlations, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen's d). The results showed that patients with schizophrenia who had been in quarantine for almost a year showed similar levels of concern as their caregivers in the domains of health and social life. However, caregivers showed significant differences from patients in the areas of income, concern, and employment status. In addition, patients who were infected with COVID-19 showed lower levels of well-being and worse psychological recovery. The implications of the findings highlight the need to incorporate mental health interventions in the pandemic health context for caregivers of people with schizophrenia. Finally, the results suggest that Covid-19 infection has a significant effect on the recovery and psychological well-being of patients with schizophrenia.",,This study was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile ANID through FONDECYT 1200785.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-11-05,2021,2021-11-05,,12,,729793,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Urzúa, Alfonso; Ponce-Correa, Felipe; Ferrer, Rodrigo","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); Ferrer, Rodrigo (Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Ponce-Correa, Felipe (University of Tarapacá); Ferrer, Rodrigo (University of Tarapacá)",14,11,1.06,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.729793/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142403612,52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

METHODS: An observational descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. After applying the selection criteria, 315 clinical records were recovered. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used, reporting proportions, means and standard deviations.
RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 45.23 years old and 63.8% of them were females. Patients were mostly referred by retina specialists, general ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, and cornea specialists. Meantime between the first ocular symptom and uveitis specialist evaluation was 2.08 years. Patients had been previously evaluated by a mean of 1.9 ophthalmologists. In 79.9% of patients, inflammation was recognized by the remittent; however, only 4.7% of patients were correctly graded according to SUN classification. At first time consultation with the uvea specialist, 52.1% of the patients arrived with an adequate infectious panel, 58.1% with an adequate rheumatologic panel, 11.6% with aqueous humor PCR study, 65.1% with an initial etiological diagnosis, 34.9% with inadequate topical treatment, and 59.6% with inadequate systemic treatment. The mean time to reach a diagnosis by the uvea specialist was 5.27 weeks (0.10 years). A diagnostic coincidence was not reached in 58.7% of the cases.
CONCLUSION: The referral process to uveitis specialists is complex but highly relevant for those who suffer from this pathology. Health professionals must be aware of the standardized classification of the disease, the appropriate treatment according to the classification, and early referral to the uveologist with adequate laboratory tests.","We thank Universidad del Rosario for their help, guidance, and financial support.

After drifting for several weeks in the ocean, the post-larval glaucothoes settle in the shallow subtidal zone, undergo metamorphosis, and the early juveniles then subsequently make their way to land where they undergo further physiological changes that prevent them from ever entering the sea again. Here, we sequenced, assembled and analyzed the coconut crab genome to shed light on its adaptation to terrestrial life. For comparison, we also assembled the genomes of the long-tailed marine-living ornate spiny lobster, Panulirus ornatus, and the short-tailed marine-living red king crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus. Our selection of the latter two organisms furthermore allowed us to explore parallel evolution of the crab-like form in anomurans.ResultsAll three assembled genomes are large, repeat-rich and AT-rich. Functional analysis reveals that the coconut crab has undergone proliferation of genes involved in the visual, respiratory, olfactory and cytoskeletal systems. Given that the coconut crab has atypical mitochondrial DNA compared to other anomurans, we argue that an abundance of kif22 and other significantly proliferated genes annotated with mitochondrial and microtubule functions, point to unique mechanisms involved in providing cellular energy via nuclear protein-coding genes supplementing mitochondrial and microtubule function. We furthermore detected in the coconut crab a significantly proliferated HOX gene, caudal, that has been associated with posterior development in Drosophila, but we could not definitively associate this gene with carcinization in the Anomura since it is also significantly proliferated in the ornate spiny lobster. However, a cuticle-associated coatomer gene, gammacop, that is significantly proliferated in the coconut crab, may play a role in hardening of the adult coconut crab abdomen in order to mitigate desiccation in terrestrial environments.ConclusionThe abundance of genomic features in the three assembled genomes serve as a source of hypotheses for future studies of anomuran environmental adaptations such as shell-utilization, perception of visual and olfactory cues in terrestrial environments, and cuticle sclerotization. We hypothesize that the coconut crab exhibits gene proliferation in lieu of alternative splicing as a terrestrial adaptation mechanism and propose life-stage transcriptomic assays to test this hypothesis.",We would like to thank Zachary Y.H.

The objective was to correlate personality traits with the academic performance of students in a higher education institution. This is a quantitative, correlational research, with a final sample of 214 students. Results confirmed that there is a positive correlation between those variables. Personality traits of abstractedness and perfectionism correlate with academic performance. Results show that perfectionism and abstractedness traits and sex, affect academic performance. It is still important to notice that there are other factors (beyond the scope of this research) that could possibly have a significant impact on academic performance.","The authors would like to acknowledge Judith García, psychologist of the Counselling Department at the Universidad Metropolitana (Barranquilla, Colombia) for the application and assessment of the 16 PF Questionnaire to all new students for admission purposes. This information was taken to build the raw database with which the researchers began this investigation. In this same order of ideas, to Universidad Metropolitana.

The Peruvian version of the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS-PE) is a BCST that relies minimally on educational attainment and has shown good diagnostic accuracy in an urban illiterate population in Peru, yet its psychometric properties in illiterate populations in rural settings of the country have not been previously investigated. Objectives: To establish the diagnostic accuracy of the RUDAS-PE compared to expert clinical diagnosis using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale in healthy and cognitively impaired illiterate persons living in two culturally and geographically distinct rural communities of Peru. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study of residents ≥ 50 years of age living in the Peruvian rural communities of Santa Clotilde and Chuquibambilla. A total of 129 subjects (76 from Santa Clotilde and 53 from Chuquibambilla) were included in this study. Gold standard diagnostic neurocognitive evaluation was based on expert neurological history and examination and administration of the CDR. Receiver operating characteristics, areas under the curve (AUC), and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the performance of RUDAS-PE compared to expert gold standard diagnosis. Results: Compared to gold standard diagnosis, the RUDAS-PE was better at correctly discriminating between MCI and dementia than discriminating between MCI and controls in both sites (97.0% vs. 76.2% correct classification in Chuquibambilla; 90.0% vs. 64.7% in Santa Clotilde). In Chuquibambilla, the area under the curve (AUC) of the RUDAS to discriminate between dementia and MCI was 99.4% (optimal cutoff at <18), whereas between MCI and controls it was 82.8% (optimal cutoff at <22). In Santa Clotilde, the area under the curve (AUC) of the RUDAS to discriminate between dementia and MCI was 99.1% (optimal cutoff at <17), whereas between MCI and controls it was 75.5% (optimal cutoff at <21). Conclusions: The RUDAS-PE has acceptable psychometric properties and performed well in its ability to discriminate MCI and dementia in two cohorts of illiterate older adults from two distinct rural Peruvian communities.",,"Funding.

Aim of the Study: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of TP in treating DKD and offer solid evidence for further clinical applications of TP. Materials and Methods: Eight databases (CNKI, VIP, CBM, WanFang, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were electronically searched for eligible studies until October 17, 2020. We selected animal experimental studies using TP versus renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or nonfunctional liquids to treat DKD by following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two researchers independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias tool. Fixed-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Inplasy registration number: INPLASY2020100042. Results: Twenty-six studies were included. Meta-analysis showed that TP significantly reduced albuminuria (14 studies; standardized mean difference SMD: -1.44 [-1.65, -1.23], I2 = 87%), urine albumin/urine creatinine ratio (UACR) (8 studies; SMD: -5.03 [-5.74, -4.33], I2 = 84%), total proteinuria (4 studies; SMD: -3.12 [-3.75, -2.49], I2 = 0%), serum creatinine (18 studies; SMD: -0.30 [-0.49, -0.12], I2 = 76%), and blood urea nitrogen (12 studies; SMD: -0.40 [-0.60, -0.20], I2 value = 55%) in DKD animals, compared to the vehicle control. However, on comparing TP to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in DKD treatment, there was no marked difference in ameliorating albuminuria (3 studies; SMD: -0.35 [-0.72, 0.02], I2 = 41%), serum creatinine (3 studies; SMD: -0.07 [-0.62, 0.48], I2 = 10%), and blood urea nitrogen (2 studies; SMD: -0.35 [-0.97, 0.28], I2 = 0%). Of note, TP exhibited higher capacities in reducing UACR (2 studies; SMD: -0.66 [-1.31, -0.01], I2 = 0%) and total proteinuria (2 studies; SMD: -1.18 [-1.86, -2049], I2 = 0%). Meta-regression implicated that the efficacy of TP in reducing DKD albuminuria was associated with applied dosages. In addition, publication bias has not been detected on attenuating albuminuria between TP and RAS inhibitors after the diagnosis of DKD.

This work aims to measure the enzymatic activity and non-enzymatic activity of two microalgae species in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and carotenoids, respectively, in response to static magnetic fields-induced stress. Two magnet configurations (north and south) and two exposure modes (continuous and pulse) were applied. Two microalgae species were considered, the Scenedesmus obliquus and Nannochloropsis gaditana. The SOD activity increased by up to 60% in S. obliquus under continuous exposure. This trend was also found for CAT in the continuous mode. Conversely, under the pulse mode, its response was hampered as the SOD and CAT were reduced. For N. gaditana, SOD increased by up to 62% with the south configuration under continuous exposure. In terms of CAT, there was a higher activity of up to 19%. Under the pulsed exposure, SOD activity was up to 115%. The CAT in this microalga was increased by up to 29%. For N. gaditana, a significant increase of over 40% in violaxanthin production was obtained compared to the control, when the microalgae were exposed to SMF as a pulse. Depending on the exposure mode and species, this methodology can be used to produce oxidative stress and obtain an inhibitory or enhanced response in addition to the significant increase in the production of antioxidant pigments.",The authors would like to thank the Universidad de Antofagasta for their support in performing this study.,"This research was funded by ANID/FONDEF/IDEA, grant number ID15I10487, and in part by the Programa Semilleros de Investigación: “Caracterización de una línea base para el análisis y determinación de los components celulares”, by the Fondo para el Desarrollo en investigación científica y/o tecnológica de actividades de titulación de pregrado 2018: “Producción de metabolitos de alto valor económico mediante exposición a un campo magnético estático tipo continuo y tipo pulso en las microalgas Scenedesmus obliquus y Nannochloropsis gaditana”, and by Programa Asignación año 2021 de Asistentes de investigación de la Universidad de Antofagasta código ANT20992.",Marine Drugs,,Carlos Almeida,Animals; Magnetic Fields; Microalgae; Oxidative Stress,2021-09-21,2021,2021-09-21,,19,9,527,All OA; Gold,Article,"Serrano, Génesis; Miranda-Ostojic, Carol; Ferrada, Pablo; Wulff-Zotelle, Cristian; Maureira, Alejandro; Fuentealba, Edward; Gallardo, Karem; Zapata, Manuel; Rivas, Mariella","Serrano, Génesis (Laboratorio de Biotecnología Ambiental Aplicada, Departamento de Biotecnología, Universidad de Antofagasta, Av.

The semaphorin 6B (SEMA6B) gene has been recently reported a causal gene of PME. Independent studies are warranted to further support these findings. Here we report that one nonsense variant in NM_032108.3 exon17 c.2056C > T (p.Gln686∗) and one missense variant in exon14 c.1483G > T (p.Gly495Trp) of SEMA6B, both occurring de novo, underlie early-onset epilepsy with variable severity and different response to treatment in two patients. In vitro analyses have demonstrated that the nonsense variant, p.Gln686∗, results in a truncated protein with remarkably increased expression compared to that of the wild type. The truncated protein presented more homogeneous and failed to locate in the plasma membrane. The missense variant p.Gly495Trp affects evolutionarily conserved amino acid and is located in the sema domain, a key functional domain of SEMA6B. It was predicted to perturb the SEMA6B function by altering the tertiary structure of mutant protein, although neither change of protein length and expression nor difference of cellular distribution was observed. Co-immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated that both variants influence protein binding of SEMA6B and PlxnA2 with varying degrees. Our results provide further evidence to support the initial findings of SEMA6B being causal to epilepsy and indicate that mediating Semaphorin/Plexin signaling is the potential mechanism of the SEMA6B-related disease.",,"Funding.

Our objective was to examine the mediating role of Acculturative Stress in the association between ethnic discrimination and racial discrimination with physical and mental health. This research is a non-experimental, analytical, cross-sectional study. A total of 976 adult Colombian migrants living in Chile were interviewed. We used the Everyday Discrimination Scale, the acculturative stress scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12) for health status; we found that racial and ethnic discrimination had a negative effect on physical and mental health. In the simultaneous presence of both types of discrimination, racial discrimination was completely absorbed by ethnic discrimination, the latter becoming a total mediator of the effect of racial discrimination on mental and physical health. Our findings are consistent with the literature, which suggests that there are various types of discrimination which, individually or in their intersectionality, can have negative effects on health.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo—ANID, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Lorenzo Tarsitani,Acculturation; Adult; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Humans; Racism,2021-05-17,2021,2021-05-17,,18,10,5312,All OA; Gold,Article,"Urzúa, Alfonso; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Henríquez, Diego; Williams, David R.","Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica 1000000, Chile;, acaqueo@academicos.uta.cl, (A.C.-U.);, xdiegohenriquez@gmail.com, (D.H.)); Henríquez, Diego (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile); Williams, David R.

However, many governments have hesitated to implement them due to their costs. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI program to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia.
METHODS: We developed a Markov simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both the health system and the societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity loss, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
FINDINGS: Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduces COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saves an average of $1,045 and $850 per case when observed from the social and the health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to two times the current health expenditures in Colombia per year.
INTERPRETATION: The TTI program is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Colombia. TTI programs depend on their successful and speedy implementation.

Changes in S100B biomarker levels are associated with TBI severity and patient outcome. The S100B quantification is often difficult since standard immunoassays are time-consuming, costly, and require extensive expertise. A zero-length cross-linking approach on a cysteamine self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was performed to immobilize anti-S100B monoclonal antibodies onto both planar (AuEs) and interdigitated (AuIDEs) gold electrodes via carbonyl-bond. Surface characterization was performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and specular-reflectance FTIR for each functionalization step. Biosensor response was studied using the change in charge-transfer resistance (Rct) from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in potassium ferrocyanide, with [S100B] ranging 10-1000 pg/mL. A single-frequency analysis for capacitances was also performed in AuIDEs. Full factorial designs were applied to assess biosensor sensitivity, specificity, and limit-of-detection (LOD). Higher Rct values were found with increased S100B concentration in both platforms. LODs were 18 pg/mL(AuES) and 6 pg/mL(AuIDEs). AuIDEs provide a simpler manufacturing protocol, with reduced fabrication time and possibly costs, simpler electrochemical response analysis, and could be used for single-frequency analysis for monitoring capacitance changes related to S100B levels.","We thanks to the GNano group in the São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC)-USP, Brazil, for facilitate some of the necessary materials and equipment for all the surface characterization experiments.","This research was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757–2016 and by Gobernación del Atlántico call number 809–2018.

Here, we present a new approach to unravel the bacterial phylogeographic patterns combining community-wide survey by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and intra-species resolution through the oligotyping method, allowing robust estimations of genetic and phylogeographic indices, and migration parameters. As a proof-of-concept, we focused on the bacterial genus Spirochaeta across three distant biogeographic provinces of the Southern Ocean; maritime Antarctica, sub-Antarctic Islands, and Patagonia. Each targeted Spirochaeta operational taxonomic units were characterized by a substantial intrapopulation microdiversity, and significant genetic differentiation and phylogeographic structure among the three provinces. Gene flow estimations among Spirochaeta populations support the role of the Antarctic Polar Front as a biogeographic barrier to bacterial dispersal between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic provinces. Conversely, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current appears as the main driver of gene flow, connecting sub-Antarctic Islands with Patagonia and maritime Antarctica. Additionally, historical processes (drift and dispersal limitation) govern up to 86% of the spatial turnover among Spirochaeta populations. Overall, our approach bridges the gap between microbial and macrobial ecology by revealing strong congruency with macroorganisms distribution patterns at the populational level, shaped by the same oceanographic structures and ecological processes.","We thank Peter Beerli and Franz-Sebastian Krah for their technical supports.

Previous AD epidemiologic studies have been mainly retrospective and/or have been performed through surveys instead of in-person visits. Epidemiological studies concerning AD in Latin American countries are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To describe sociodemographic and clinical features and the economic burden of AD on children and adult patients in Colombia through in-person visits.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 212 patients that included sociodemographic and clinimetric data. The diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka was used and data relating to disease distribution, disease severity (through the BSA: Body surface area; EASI: Eczema Area and Severity Index; SCORAD: Scoring Atopic Dermatitis), Fitzpatrick's skin phototypes, personal and familiar history of allergic diseases, previous treatments, and personal history of comorbidities, was collected.
RESULTS: Patient age range was 12-76, and 52.8% were female. Disease distribution was mainly flexural (19.6%). Early age start, Denni-Morgan fold, and infections tendency were more frequent in adolescents compared to adults. Mean age of diagnosis was 12 years old, AD diagnosis was made mostly by a dermatologist, 48.1% (102 patients) reported alcohol consumption, and 59% of consumers were heavy drinkers. Comorbidities found were: chronic rhinitis (68.9%) food allergy (32.5%), allergic conjunctivitis (29.7%), and asthma (28.8%). Around 81% earned less than $896 US dollars and 59% invested 6-30% of their monthly budget yearly, and 40% had work or school absenteeism. Mean scores of BSA, EASI, and SCORAD involvement were 32.6, 13.7, and 42.4, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds well-supported data through an in-depth clinical and economical characterization of Colombian adolescents and adult patients with atopic dermatitis and shows its high impact and burden on patients and their families. It also contributes to understand the burden of AD in Latin America.","We thank all the patients for their willingness to participate.

The genome of PRV consists of about 23,600 bp, with 10 segments of double-stranded RNA, classified as small (S1 to S4), medium (M1, M2 and M3) and large (L1, L2 and L3); these range approximately from 1000 bp (segment S4) to 4000 bp (segment L1). How the genetic variation among PRV strains affects the virulence for salmonids is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to describe the molecular phylogeny of PRV based on an extensive sequence analysis of the S1 and M2 segments of PRV available in the GenBank database to date (May 2020). The analysis was extended to include new PRV sequences for S1 and M2 segments. In addition, subgenotype classifications were assigned to previously published unclassified sequences. It was concluded that the phylogenetic trees are consistent with the original classification using the PRV genomic segment S1, which differentiates PRV into two major genotypes, I and II, and each of these into two subgenotypes, designated as Ia and Ib, and IIa and IIb, respectively. Moreover, some clusters of country- and host-specific PRV subgenotypes were observed in the subset of sequences used. This work strengthens the subgenotype classification of PRV based on the S1 segment and can be used to enhance research on the virulence of PRV.",,"This research was funded by the Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Aplicadas (CIBA) and supported by the Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria, Laboratorio de Biotecnología, Universidad San Sebastián, Sede de La Patagonia.",Pathogens,,,,2021-01-07,2021,2021-01-07,,10,1,41,All OA; Gold,Article,"Godoy, Marcos; Medina, Daniel A.; Suarez, Rudy; Valenzuela, Sandro; Romero, Jaime; Kibenge, Molly; Wang, Yingwei; Kibenge, Frederick","Godoy, Marcos (Laboratorio de Biotecnología Aplicadas, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad San Sebastián, Sede De la Patagonia, Lago Panguipulli 1390, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile;, marcos.godoy@uss.cl, (M.G.);, daniel.medina@uss.cl, (D.A.M.); Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas Aplicadas (CIBA), Lago Panguipulli 1390, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile;, rudy.suarez@ciba.cl, (R.S.);, sandrolvalenzuelad@gmail.com, (S.V.); Doctorado en Acuicultura, Programa Cooperativo Universidad de Chile, Universidad CatÓlica del Norte, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile); Medina, Daniel A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: This was a retrospective cohort, that used information collected from clinical records and official epidemiological surveillance systems (NOTIWEB, SISCOVID and SINADEF), on hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Information was collected on sociodemographic and clinical factors, considering discharge (death/survival) and days of hospitalization as outcomes.
RESULTS.: The in-hospital fatality rate was 39.6%, and significant differences were found between hospitalization time and status at discharge in people over 60 years of age (p<0.001). Age older than 60 years (HR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.76-4.68),) unattended ICU bed request (HR: 3.49; 95% CI: 2.02-6.05), oxygen saturation less than 80% at admission (HR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.35-5.53) and the use of ivermectin (HR: 1.68; 95%CI 1.06-2.68) were factors associated with lethality. The chosen ML model considered that the most important variables were oxygen saturation, age over 60 years, time of hospitalization and time of the onset of symptoms.
CONCLUSION.: The factors that could increase lethality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were age, oxygen saturation less than 80%, use of ivermectin as part of hospital treatment and unattended request for ICU beds. Future studies with better representativeness could confirm these possible relationships at the regional or national level.",,,Revista Peruana de Medicina Experimental y Salud Pública,,,Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Ivermectin; Middle Aged; Peru; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2,2021-12-22,2021,2021-12-22,2021,38,4,501-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anyaypoma-Ocón, Walter; Vásquez, Sandra Ñuflo; Bustamante-Chávez, Hugo Cesar; Sedano-De la Cruz, Edyson; Zavaleta-Gavidia, Víctor; Angulo-Bazán, Yolanda","Anyaypoma-Ocón, Walter (Oficina de Epidemiología.

Invasion of the cornea can cause severe vision loss. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common post-transcriptional modification of eukaryotic mRNA, which can regulate mRNA splicing, stability, nuclear transport, and translation. To our best knowledge, there is no current research on the mechanism of m6A in pterygium.
METHODS: We obtained 24 pterygium tissues and 24 conjunctival tissues from each of 24 pterygium patients recruited from Shanghai Yangpu Hospital, and the level of m6A modification was detected using an m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit. Expression and location of METTL3, a key m6A methyltransferase, were identified by immunostaining. Then we used m6A-modified RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and bioinformatics analyses to compare the differential expression of m6A methylation in pterygium and normal conjunctival tissue.
RESULTS: We identified 2,949 dysregulated m6A peaks in pterygium tissue, of which 2,145 were significantly upregulated and 804 were significantly downregulated. The altered m6A peak of genes were found to play a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway and endocytosis. Joint analyses of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq data identified 72 hypermethylated m6A peaks and 15 hypomethylated m6A peaks in mRNA. After analyzing the differentially methylated m6A peaks and synchronously differentially expressed genes, we searched the Gene Expression Omnibus database and identified five genes related to the development of pterygium (DSP, MXRA5, ARHGAP35, TMEM43, and OLFML2A).
CONCLUSION: Our research shows that m6A modification plays an important role in the development of pterygium and can be used as a potential new target for the treatment of pterygium in the future.",,Funding.

The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) was used to detect participants at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals CI).ResultsModerate or extreme problems appeared more frequently in the dimensions of Pain/Discomfort (60.8%) and Anxiety/Depression (30.8%). The mean score of the EQ-VAS was 74.3 (± 17.3), significantly larger in the state of complete health (11111) compared with those with problems in more than one of the quality-of-life dimensions.

In Colombia, in 2019 diabetes affected 8.4% of the Colombian adult population and more than one million Colombian adults of this age group have hidden or undetected diabetes. This disease is not only characterized by increased premature mortality, loss of productivity, and economic impact, but it also involves a deterioration in the quality of life of people with diabetes with their respective families. However, very Little is known about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a population at risk or with prediabetes. This study has evaluated the quality of life in patients at risk of diabetes and their behavior with some variables as sociodemographic, lifestyle, history, and established their difference in two territories of the Colombian Caribbean. The results of this study indicate that the HRQoL of people at risk of type 2 diabetes is affected by factors such as gender, city, dysglycemia, medication for hypertension and education level. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to these determinants of HRQL to design and implement strategies that reduce this risk of developing type 2 diabetes, prevent prediabetes and improve the quality of life in prediabetic or diabetic patients.",Not applicable.,"FundingThis project was financed by the Colombian National Program for Science, Technology, and Health Innovation (COLCIENCIAS) in line with the theme focused on chronic non-transmutable diseases.

The mathematical modeling is implemented in Matlab/Simulink® software to evaluate the influence of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and overpotentials on the overall performance. The models are further merged into an integrated electrolyzer-fuel cell system for electrical power generation. The operational description of the integrated system focuses on estimating the overall efficiency as a novel indicator. Additionally, the study presents an economic assessment to evaluate the cost-effectiveness based on different economic metrics such as capital cost, electricity cost, and payback period. The parametric analysis showed that as the temperature rises from 30 to 70 °C in both devices, the efficiency is improved between 5-20%. In contrast, pressure differences feature less relevance on the overall performance. Ohmic and activation overpotentials are highlighted for the highest impact on the generated and required voltage. Overall, the current density exhibited an inverse relation with the efficiency of both devices. The economic evaluation revealed that the integrated system can operate at variable load conditions while maintaining an electricity cost between 0.3-0.45 $/kWh. Also, the capital cost can be reduced up to 25% while operating at a low current density and maximum temperature. The payback period varies between 6-10 years for an operational temperature of 70 °C, which reinforces the viability of the system. Overall, hydrogen-powered systems stand as a promising technology to overcome energy transition as they provide robust operation from both energetic and economic viewpoints.","The authors thank UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE, UNIVERSIDAD DE LA COSTA, the industrial instrumentation and thermal machines laboratory (LIMTER) at UNIVERSIDAD DEL ATLÁNTICO, and SPHERE ENERGY Company.",This work was supported by COLCIENCIAS and Gobernación del Atlántico (Grant No. 673 (2014) and Grant 727 (2015)).,Heliyon,,,,2021-03-19,2021,2021-03-19,2021-03,7,3,e06506,All OA; Gold,Article,"Escobar-Yonoff, Rony; Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel; Charry, Sebastián; Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana; Portnoy, Ivan","Escobar-Yonoff, Rony (KAÍ Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8 - 49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (KAÍ Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8 - 49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Charry, Sebastián (KAÍ Research Unit, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8 - 49, Puerto Colombia, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana (Universidad del Norte, Department of Mechanical Engineering, km 5 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte, Department of Mechanical Engineering, km 5 Antigua vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia; Universidad de la Costa, Department of Productivity and Innovation, Calle 58 # 55 – 66, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)","Escobar-Yonoff, Rony (University of Atlántico); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (University of Atlántico); Charry, Sebastián (University of Atlántico); Rincón-Montenegro, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); Portnoy, Ivan (Universidad del Norte; University of the Coast)",45,25,0.79,16.22,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844021006095/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136499148,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This results in a form of chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH) characterized by alternating periods of work at high altitude and rest periods at sea level. Previous studies performed in our laboratory showed that aerobic capacity is reduced at 3,800 m, even when oxygen content is maintained. Our study aimed to determine the corporal composition, food intake, maximum oxygen uptake, and concentration of high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) in an acclimatized miner population that work from 0 to 2,500 m with CIHH exposure over 4 years. All miners recruited for our study were operators of heavy trucks with CIHH for over 4 years (shiftwork 7*7 days), and our experimental population was composed of 54 miners at sea level, 61 at 1,600 m, and 38 at 2,500 m. All evaluations were performed on the 3rd or 4th day of diurnal shiftwork. To determine corporal composition, we measured weight and height (to calculate body mass index, BMI), skinfolds (to calculate body fatty, BF), and waist circumference (WC); maximal aerobic capacity was evaluated using a ramp-incremental cycling to exhaustion protocol and a venous blood sample before the exercise test to measure (hsCRP) via an ELISA test. We found higher values of BMI, BF, and WC, in the miners' population but observed no significant difference between populations. We found a decrease in VO2 of 11.6% at 1,600 m and 25.9% at 2,500 m compared to miners at sea level. An increase in (hsCRP) at 1,600 and 2,500 m regards sea level. We observed a high prevalence of overweight and obese subjects, which was related to the ad libitum availability of food and low physical activity (sedentarism). We found that work capacity was maintained despite a decreased VO2 max at moderate altitude. However, overweight and obesity support an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in miner's which is unrelated to altitude. In contrast, an increased hsCRP level could be associated with increased inflammatory mechanisms at 1,600 and 2,500 m.","We are grateful for the technical assistance of Mrs. Hervis Galleguillos and Andrés Robles who collaborated in procedures, evaluations, and operational support.

We tested the hypothesis that Tibetans display better muscle and brain tissue oxygenation during exercise in hypoxia. Using near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) to provide indices of tissue oxygenation, we measured oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin ([O2Hb] and [HHb], respectively) responses of the vastus lateralis muscle and the right prefrontal cortex in ten Han Chinese and ten Tibetans during incremental cycling to exhaustion in a pressure-regulated chamber at simulated sea-level (air at 1 atm: normobaric normoxia) and 5,000 m (air at 0.5 atm: hypobaric hypoxia). Hypoxia reduced aerobic capacity by ∼22% in both groups (d = 0.8, p < 0.001 vs. normoxia), while Tibetans consistently outperformed their Han Chinese counterpart by ∼32% in normoxia and hypoxia (d = 1.0, p = 0.008). We found cerebral [O2Hb] was higher in Tibetans at normoxic maximal effort compared Han (p = 0.001), while muscle [O2Hb] was not different (p = 0.240). Hypoxic exercise lowered muscle [O2Hb] in Tibetans by a greater extent than in Han (interaction effect: p < 0.001 vs. normoxic exercise). Muscle [O2Hb] was lower in Tibetans when compared to Han during hypoxic exercise (d = 0.9, p = 0.003), but not during normoxic exercise (d = 0.4, p = 0.240). Muscle [HHb] was not different between the two groups during normoxic and hypoxic exercise (p = 0.778). Compared to Han, our findings revealed a higher brain tissue oxygenation in Tibetans during maximal exercise in normoxia, but lower muscle tissue oxygenation during exercise in hypoxia. This would suggest that the Tibetans privileged oxygenation of the brain at the expense of that of the muscle.","We thank the participants for their participation, the technical support personnel of the hypobaric chamber at the National Key Laboratory of High Altitude Medicine in Xining for their expert help and the doctors and nurses at the Qinghai People’s Hospital in Xining for their assistances.",Funding.

Scarce lagoons associated with salt flats (salars) in this desert are the surface expression of shallow groundwater; these ponds serve as refugia for life and often host microbial communities associated with evaporitic mineral deposition. Results based on multidisciplinary field campaigns and associated laboratory examination of samples collected from the Puquios of the Salar de Llamara in the Atacama Desert during austral summer provide unprecedented detail regarding the spatial heterogeneity of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of these salar environments. Four main lagoons (‘Puquios’) and more than 400 smaller ponds occur within an area less than 5 km2, and are characterized by high variability in electrical conductivity, benthic and planktonic biota, microbiota, lagoon bottom type, and style of mineral deposition. Results suggest that electrical conductivity is a driving force of system heterogeneity. Such spatial heterogeneity within the Puquios is likely to be expanded with temporal observations incorporating expected seasonal changes in electrical conductivity. The complexity of these Andean ecosystems may be key to their ability to persist in extreme environments at the edge of habitability.","The authors are grateful to René Daza, Sara Swaminathan, Blake Cunningham, Nicolas Barroilhet, Kevin Coloma, and Andy White for their support in field work and data organization.

Our goal was to provide up-to-date data on the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in breast milk from Chilean women and to estimate the exposure of infants due to breast milk consumption. In Chile, we conducted a cross-sectional study based on methodologies proposed by the WHO, with a sample of 30 women recruited from three defined areas: 10 from the Arica Region (urban; Arica and Parinacota Region), 10 from Coltauco (rural; O'Higgins Region), and 10 from Molina (40% rural; Maule Region). High-resolution gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) was performed on pooled samples from each area. We calculated equivalent toxic concentrations (WHO-TEQ) based on the current WHO Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEF). The minimum and maximum values of ∑ PCDDs/Fs + DL-PCBs-TEQ were 4.317 pg TEQ/g fat in Coltauco and 6.31 pg TEQ/g fat in Arica. Molina had a total TEQ of 5.50 pg TEQ/g fat. The contribution of PCDD/Fs was approximately five-fold higher than that of DL-PCBs. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) of ∑ PCDDs/Fs + DL-PCBs based on the three pooled samples ranged between 6.71 and 26.28 pg TEQ/kg body weight (bw)/day, with a mean intake of 16.11 (±6.71) pg TEQ/kg bw/day in breastfed children from 0 to 24 months old. These levels were lower than those reported in international studies. Despite the fact that the observed levels were low compared to those in most industrialized countries, the detection of a variety of POPs in breast milk from Chilean women indicates the need for follow-up studies to determine whether such exposures during childhood could represent a health risk in adulthood.","The authors would like to acknowledge the Primary Health Centers of Arica, Coltauco, and Molina for their work in this study.

Translocated orangutans exposed to human diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), pose risks to wild and previously released conspecifics. Wildlife disease risk experts recommended halting great ape translocations during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize risk of disease transmission to wild populations. We collected data on orangutan releases and associated disease risk management in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic, and developed a problem description for orangutan disease and conservation risks. We identified that at least 15 rehabilitated ex-captive and 27 wild captured orangutans were released during the study period. Identified disease risks included several wild-to-wild translocated orangutans in direct contact or proximity to humans without protective equipment, and formerly captive rehabilitated orangutans that have had long periods of contact and potential exposure to human diseases. While translocation practitioners typically employ mitigation measures to decrease disease transmission likelihood, these measures cannot eliminate all risk, and are not consistently applied. COVID-19 and other diseases of human origin can be transmitted to orangutans, which could have catastrophic impacts on wild orangutans, other susceptible fauna, and humans should disease transmission occur. We recommend stakeholders conduct a Disease Risk Analysis for orangutan translocation, and improve pathogen surveillance and mitigation measures to decrease the likelihood of potential outbreaks. We also suggest refocusing conservation efforts on alternatives to wild-to-wild translocation including mitigating human-orangutan interactions, enforcing laws and protecting orangutan habitats to conserve orangutans in situ.","We thank all participating individuals for information on orangutan releases, other conservation activities, and disease risks.

A suitable absorbent for a particular type of pollutant does not necessarily absorb other types of compounds, so knowing the compatibility between a particular pollutant and a potential absorbent before experimentation seems to be fundamental. In this work, the molecular interactions between some pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin, ibuprofen, and tetracycline derivatives) with two potential absorbers, chitosan and graphene oxide models (pyrene, GO-1, and coronene, GO-2), were studied using the ωB97X-D/6-311G(2d,p) level of theory. The energetic interaction order found was amoxicillin/chitosan > amoxicillin/GO-1 > amoxicillin/GO-2 > ibuprofen/chitosan > ibuprofen/GO-2 > ibuprofen/GO-1, the negative sign for the interaction energy in all complex formations confirms good compatibility, while the size of Eint between 24-34 kcal/mol indicates physisorption processes. Moreover, the free energies of complex formation were negative, confirming the spontaneity of the processes. The larger interaction of amoxicillin Gos, compared to ibuprofen Gos, is consistent with previously reported experimental results, demonstrating the exceptional predictability of these methods. The second-order perturbation theory analysis shows that the amoxicillin complexes are mainly driven by hydrogen bonds, while van der Waals interactions with chitosan and hydrophobic interactions with graphene oxides are modelled for the ibuprofen complexes. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) shows that electrostatic energy is a major contributor to the stabilization energy in all cases. The results obtained in this work promote the use of graphene oxides and chitosan as potential adsorbents for the removal of these emerging pollutants from water.",The authors wish to thank Alessandra Misad for proofreading the manuscript.,This research received no external funding.,Polymers,,"Riccardo Concu, Michael González-Durruthy",,2021-05-17,2021,2021-05-17,,13,10,1620,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anchique, Leonardo; Alcázar, Jackson J.; Ramos-Hernandez, Andrea; Méndez-López, Maximiliano; Mora, José R.; Rangel, Norma; Paz, José Luis; Márquez, Edgar","Anchique, Leonardo (Programa de Química, Grupo Química Supramolecular Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias Básicas, Semillero Electroquímica Aplicada, Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla 081001, Colombia;, lanchique@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (L.A.);, andrearamos@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, (A.R.-H.)); Alcázar, Jackson J.

We utilize public data for the consumer price index, the gross domestic product, and the employee and per capita income distributions as inputs for a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation, the solutions to which provide an in-depth analysis of the population dynamics. Specifically, the per capita income distribution stands out as a solution to the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. According to our results, the concavity of employee income distribution is a decisive input parameter and, in contrast to the distributions typically observed for Chile and other countries in Latin America, should ideally be non-negative. Based on the results of our model, we advocate for the implementation of social policies designed to stimulate social mobility by broadening the distribution of higher salaries.","We would like to acknowledge partial financial support from Fondecyt grants 1181558 and 11150182, and Beca de postdoctorado Universidad Católica del Norte No 004/2019&quot;.

However, the mechanistic role of lncRNA in glioma progression and tumor immunology remains largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in the prognosis of and its immune-related roles in gliomas. The expression levels of MEG3 were analyzed using Oncomine and TIMER database. As an important imprinted gene, the copy number variation (CNV) of MEG3 in both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) were analyzed using GSCALite database, whereas its prognostic significance was assessed using PrognoScan and GEPIA databases. The relationship between MEG3 and tumor-infiltrated immune cells was analyzed using TIMER. Results showed that MEG3 expression was lower in most of the human cancer tissues than in the normal tissues. We also found that heterozygous deletion of MEG3 occurred more frequent than heterozygous amplification in gliomas, and mRNA expression of MEG3 was significantly positively correlated with its CNV in both the GBM and LGG group. Survival analysis showed that the CNV level of MEG3 had significant correlation with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with wild type in LGG. Lower MEG3 expression was related with poor prognosis. Further analysis showed that in GBM, MEG3 expression level was significantly positively correlated with that of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and significantly negatively correlated with that of infiltrating dendritic cells. In LGG, MEG3 expression level was significantly negatively correlated with levels of infiltrating B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Univariate Cox survival analysis demonstrated that only the level of infiltrating dendritic cells significantly affected the survival time of patients with GBM, while all six types of immune cells had a significant effect on the survival time of patients with LGG. Furthermore, MEG3 expression showed strong correlations with multiple immune markers in gliomas, especially in LGG. The current findings suggest that MEG3 expression might serve as a possible prognostic marker and potential immunotherapeutic target for gliomas.",We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.,Funding.

However, the clinical significance of CAV1 expression in penile cancer remains largely unknown. Here the expression patterns of CAV1 were analyzed in a retrospective cohort (n=43) of penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Upon penile cancer progression, significantly increased CAV1-levels were determined within the malignant epithelium, whereas within the tumor stroma, namely the fibroblastic tumor compartment harboring activated and/or cancer associated fibroblasts, CAV1 levels significantly decline. Concerning the clinicopathological significance of CAV1 expression in penile cancer as well as respective epithelial-stromal CAV1 distributions, high expression within the tumor cells as well as low expression of CAV1 within the stromal compartment were correlated with decreased overall survival of penile cancer patients. Herein, CAV1 expressions and distributions at advanced penile cancer stages were independent of the immunohistochemically proven tumor protein p53 status. In contrast, less differentiated p16-positive tumor epithelia (indicative for human papilloma virus infection) were characterized by significantly decreased CAV1 levels. Conclusively, we provide further and new evidence that the characteristic shift in stromal-epithelial CAV1 being functionally relevant to tumor progression even occurs in penile SCC.",We thank Mohamed Benchellal and Eva Gau for their excellent technical assistance.

Our aim was to explore the optimal chemotherapy regimens for relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 24 adult patients with relapsed or metastatic urachal carcinoma from January 2014 to September 2020 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. We summarized the chemotherapy regimens and classified them as fluorouracil based, platinum based, and paclitaxel based. Nine patients received XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimens, seven patients received TX (paclitaxel and capecitabine) regimens, and eight of them received chemotherapy including GP (gemcitabine and cisplatin), TP (paclitaxel and cisplatin), TN (paclitaxel and nedaplatin), and tislelizumab.
RESULTS: The disease control rate was 75%. Among all patients, one patient treated with XELOX achieved partial remission (PR), while 17 patients showed stable disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in all treated patients was 7.43 and 29.7 months, respectively. The patients receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy presented better PFS than those without platinum (median PFS 8.23 vs. 3.80 months, p = 0.032), but not significant for OS between two groups. There is no significant difference in PFS and OS for fluorouracil-based and paclitaxel-based groups as first-line regimen.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a deep mental representation of written information. The objective of this research was to determine through a systematic review and meta-analysis the proportion of university students who have an optimal performance at each level of reading comprehension. Systematic review of empirical studies has been limited from 2010 to March 2021 using the Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, and PsycINFO databases. Two reviewers performed data extraction independently. A random-effects model of proportions was used for the meta-analysis and heterogeneity was assessed with I 2. To analyze the influence of moderating variables, meta-regression was used and two ways were used to study publication bias. Seven articles were identified with a total sample of the seven of 1,044. The proportion of students at the literal level was 56% (95% CI = 39-72%, I 2 = 96.3%), inferential level 33% (95% CI = 19-46%, I 2 = 95.2%), critical level 22% (95% CI = 9-35%, I 2 = 99.04%), and organizational level 22% (95% CI = 6-37%, I 2 = 99.67%). Comparing reading comprehension levels, there is a significant higher proportion of university students who have an optimal level of literal compared to the rest of the reading comprehension levels. The results have to be interpreted with caution but are a guide for future research.",,Funding.

Phytoplankton production provides food for fish, mammals, mollusks and birds. This trophic network is affected by the presence of toxic phytoplankton species. In July 2017, samples of phytoplankton were obtained from Paracas Bay, an important zone for scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) aquaculture in Peru. Morphological analysis revealed the presence of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, which was isolated and cultivated in laboratory conditions. Subsequently, the monoclonal cultures were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and identified as P. multistriata, based on both the morphological characteristics, and internal transcribed spacers region (ITS2) sequence phylogenetic analysis. Toxin analysis using liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed the presence of domoic acid (DA) with an estimated amount of 0.004 to 0.010 pg cell-1. This is the first report of DA from the coastal waters of Peru and its detection in P. multistriata indicates that it is a potential risk.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, N. pectoralis is assessed globally as Data Deficient. Using low-coverage short Illumina 300 bp pair-end reads sequencing, this study reports, for the first time, the genome size, single/low-copy genome content, and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S rRNA DNA operon and microsatellites, in N. pectoralis. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer approach was 816.04 Mbp, which is within the range previously reported for other representatives of the Carangiformes order. Single/low-copy genome content (63%) was relatively high. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to the known repeat element families. Considering only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were considerably more abundant than Class I-Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements and Class I-LTR Retroviral elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon in N. pectoralis consists of, in the following order: a 5' ETS (length = 948 bp), ssrDNA (1835 bp), ITS1 (724 bp), a 5.8S rDNA (158 bp), ITS2 (508 bp), lsrDNA (3924 bp), and a 3' ETS (32 bp). A total of 44 SSRs were identified. These newly developed genomic resources are most relevant for improving the understanding of biology, developing conservation plans, and managing the fishery of the iconic N. pectoralis.",J.A.B. thanks Vincent P.

This criticism reflects the increasing maturity of the field as well as the different theoretical perspectives and methodological practices of researchers in different disciplines. While debates addressing these criticisms are likely to lead to valuable insights, no empirical studies have been carried out to date that have investigated researchers' critical views on the development and conceptualization of mixed methods research. This study examines the criticisms of the mixed methods field raised by a cross-national sample of researchers in education, nursing, psychology, and sociology. We carried out a secondary analysis of semi-structured interviews with 42 researchers and identified 11 different criticisms, which we classified in four domains: essence of mixed methods, philosophy, procedures, and politics. The criticisms related to the procedures domain were equally distributed among the four disciplines, while those related to the essence, philosophy and politics domains were more common among sociologists. Based on our findings, we argue that the divergence of views on foundational issues in this field reflects researchers' affiliation to different communities of practice, each having its own principles, values, and interests. We suggest that a greater awareness of this divergence of perspectives could help researchers establish effective collaboration and anticipate potential challenges when working with researchers having different methodological approaches.","The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Thus, the present study aims to assess depression levels and their relationship with sleep quality in institutionalized and community older adults.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 220 older people of both sexes, divided into two groups, institutionalized older adults, and community older adults. The older adults were monitored by Community Health Agents (CHA), through identification of everyone in their micro area using a method of random name generation, based on geographic location. Due to the small number of institutionalized older adults, all residents in the institutions were recruited, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess depression and sleep quality.ResultsAmong the 220 older adults, 175 were community members and 45 were institutionalized. The survey revealed that institutionalized older adults had a higher percentage of severe depression compared to community dwelling older adults (p <  0.039).ConclusionOlder adults in the community present greater symptoms of depression and better sleep than institutionalized older adults. There was a direct association between sleep quality and depression. In our sample, being institutionalized and female positively influenced and feeling alone negatively influenced depressive symptoms.",We thank Faculdade de Medicina do ABC for providing support and Acre State Government.,FundingInstitutional Agreement number 007/2015 between Faculdade de Medicina do ABC and Acre State Government.

One of its complications is neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), which is mainly caused by sympathetic hyperactivity. Due to the complexity of the pathophysiological process and the unspecificity of the clinical presentation, it is little known by general practitioners, medical students and other health care workers not directly related to the neurological part, making the management of this chaotic condition difficult. This review aims to present recent evidence on clinical concepts relevant to the identification and management of NPE secondary to SAH.Main body of the abstractNPE is defined as a syndrome of acute onset following significant central nervous system (CNS) injury. Its etiology has been proposed to stem from the release of catecholamines that produce cardiopulmonary dysfunction, with this syndrome being associated with spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disorders, traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, and meningitis. NPE has long been considered a rare event; but it may occur more frequently, mainly in patients with SAH. There are two clinical presentations of NPE: the early form develops in the first hours/minutes after injury, while the late form presents 12–24 h after neurological injury. Clinical manifestations consist of non-specific signs of respiratory distress: dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia, pink expectoration, crackles on auscultation, which usually resolve within 24–48 h in 50% of patients. Unfortunately, there are no tools to make the specific diagnosis, so the diagnosis is by exclusion. The therapeutic approach consists of two interventions: treatment of the underlying neurological injury to reduce intracranial pressure and control sympathetic hyperactivity related to the lung injury, and supportive treatment for pulmonary edema.Short conclusionSAH is a severe condition that represents a risk to the life of the affected patient due to the possible complications that may develop. NPE is one of these complications, which due to the common manifestation of a respiratory syndrome, does not allow early and accurate diagnosis, being a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, in any case of CNS lesion with pulmonary involvement, NPE should be suspected immediately.",Not applicable.,FundingThis study was not funded by any source.

Despite of its apparent generality, a growing body of evidence shows that 'anomalous' LDG (i.e., inverse or hump-shaped trends) are common among marine organisms along the Southeastern Pacific (SEP) coast. Here, we evaluate the shape of the LDG of marine benthic polychaetes and its underlying causes using a dataset of 643 species inhabiting the continental shelf (<200 m depth), using latitudinal bands with a spatial resolution of 0.5°, along the SEP (3-56° S). The explanatory value of six oceanographic (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), SST range, salinity, salinity range, primary productivity and shelf area), and one macroecological proxy (median latitudinal range of species) were assessed using a random forest model. The taxonomic structure was used to estimate the degree of niche conservatism of predictor variables and to estimate latitudinal trends in phylogenetic diversity, based on three indices (phylogenetic richness (PDSES), mean pairwise distance (MPDSES), and variation of pairwise distances (VPD)). The LDG exhibits a hump-shaped trend, with a maximum peak of species richness at ca. 42° S, declining towards northern and southern areas of SEP. The latitudinal pattern was also evident in local samples controlled by sampling effort. The random forest model had a high accuracy (pseudo-r2 = 0.95) and showed that the LDG could be explained by four variables (median latitudinal range, SST, salinity, and SST range), yet the functional relationship between species richness and these predictors was variable. A significant degree of phylogenetic conservatism was detected for the median latitudinal range and SST. PDSES increased toward the southern region, whereas VPD showed the opposite trend, both statistically significant. MPDSES has the same trend as PDSES, but it is not significant. Our results reinforce the idea that the south Chile fjord area, particularly the Chiloé region, was likely the evolutionary source of new species of marine polychaetes along SEP, creating a hotspot of diversity. Therefore, in the same way as the canonical LDG shows a decline in diversity while moving away from the tropics; on this case the decline occurs while moving away from Chiloé Island. These results, coupled with a strong phylogenetic signal of the main predictor variables suggest that processes operating mainly at evolutionary timescales govern the LDG.","Rodrigo A.

Seventy-three women (36.9 ± 13.6 years) who had been victims of domestic violence participated. The analysis was based on their coping strategies, early maladaptive schemes, and their decisions in response to vignettes describing the following domestic violence situations: humiliation to women's maternal identity with children as witnesses and body shaming. We used Student's t and Mann-Whitney tests to compare the results between groups. The participants presented some coping strategies (social support seeking, wishful thinking, and professional support seeking) and several early maladaptive schemes (emotional deprivation, defectiveness/shame, social isolation/alienation, failure to achieve, attachment, and subjugation) associated with their reactions facing a situation of humiliation with children as witnesses. When the humiliation was against the body image, their reactions were associated with some coping strategies (wishful thinking, professional support seeking, autonomy, negative auto-focus coping, and positive reappraisal) and one maladaptive scheme (defectiveness/shame). Women who reacted avoidantly showed higher social and professional support seeking but experienced higher indicators of discomfort and deterioration of self-esteem than those who opted for assertive decisions. The presence of children as witnesses seems to be a factor of stress in the configuration of coping strategies and maladaptive schemes in female victims of domestic violence. The evolution of early maladaptive schemes and coping strategies requires observation to avoid the risk of isolation and permanence in victimizing relationships.",,"The research was funded by the Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación of the Republic of Colombia in call 761 for “Jóvenes Investigadores e Innovadores, 2016.

Thus far, only two cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) associated with hypereosinophilia have been reported. In this paper, we present a case of paraneoplastic hypereosinophilia associated with renal cell carcinoma and a review of the reported cases of hypereosinophilia in solid tumors.
METHODS: The review is based on an electronic literature search performed in the PubMed database in September 2020 with the following key terms: eosinophilia & neoplasm; eosinophilia & cancer; eosinophilia & paraneoplastic syndrome. Papers were included based on screening the titles and/or abstracts. We also included the case of our patient in the analysis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old Caucasian female patient with recurrent CCRCC was admitted to our Clinic for exacerbating dyspnea and chest and right upper abdominal pain, accompanied by confusion. Preliminary blood tests showed an increased white blood cell count of 40,770/μl, and an increased eosinophil count of 6,530/μl indicating eosinophilia. Several tests were carried out to rule out the noncancer causes of hypereosinophilia. The temporal appearance of eosinophilia and the recurrence of CCRCC without any other apparent potential causes led to the diagnosis of paraneoplastic hypereosinophilia. Despite treating with high doses of corticosteroids, only a transient decrement in eosinophil count was observed along with further deterioration of the patient's condition. The patient succumbed to the disease 6 months following the tumor surgery and 2 months after the diagnosis of hypereosinophilia and tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Our observations are in agreement with the majority of reports showing that the occurrence of eosinophilia following tumor resection may indicate a poor prognosis, tumor recurrence, and rapid disease progression.",,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-03-24,2021,2021-03-24,,11,,639395,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zalewska, Ewa; Obołończyk, Łukasz; Sworczak, Krzysztof","Zalewska, Ewa (Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.); Obołończyk, Łukasz (Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.); Sworczak, Krzysztof (Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.)","Zalewska, Ewa (Medical University of Gdańsk)","Zalewska, Ewa (Medical University of Gdańsk); Obołończyk, Łukasz (Medical University of Gdańsk); Sworczak, Krzysztof (Medical University of Gdańsk)",11,9,0.66,4.96,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.639395/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136618446,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

This species is characterized by a fast uptake and release of the toxin. In this work, the main characteristics of the uptake mechanism have been studied by incubation of digestive gland thin slices in media with different composition and DA concentration. DA uptake seems to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a very high estimated KM (1722 µg DA mL-1) and a Vmax of 71.9 µg DA g-1 h-1, which is similar to those found for other amino acids in invertebrates. Replacement of NaCl from the incubation media by Cl-choline (Na+-free medium) did not significantly reduce the uptake, but replacement by sorbitol (Na+-free and Cl--depleted medium) did. A new experiment replacing all chlorides with their equivalent gluconates (Na+- and Cl--free medium) showed an important reduction in the uptake that should be attributed to the absence of chloride, pointing to a Na+-independent, Cl- (or anion-) dependent transporter.

Unfortunately, current pharmacotherapy only offers symptom relief for patients with side effects such as bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, there is a present need to provide other therapeutic alternatives for treatments for these disorders. The 5-HT4 receptor is an attractive therapeutic target since it has a potential role in central and peripheral nervous system disorders such as AD, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroparesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of a series of 62 active compounds in the 5-HT4 receptor was carried out in the present work. The structure-activity relationship was estimated using three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) techniques based on these structures' field molecular (force and Gaussian field). The best force-field QSAR models achieve a value for the coefficient of determination of the training set of R2training = 0.821, and for the test set R2test = 0.667, while for Gaussian-field QSAR the training and the test were R2training = 0.898 and R2test = 0.695, respectively. The obtained results were validated using a coefficient of correlation of the leave-one-out cross-validation of Q2LOO = 0.804 and Q2LOO = 0.886 for force- and Gaussian-field QSAR, respectively. Based on these results, novel 5-HT4 partial agonists with potential biological activity (pEC50 8.209-9.417 for force-field QSAR and 9.111-9.856 for Gaussian-field QSAR) were designed. In addition, for the new analogues, their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties were also analyzed. The results show that these new derivatives also have reasonable pharmacokinetics and drug-like properties. Our findings suggest novel routes for the design and development of new 5-HT4 partial agonists.","A.C.-A. and R.N. would like to acknowledge the FONDECYT program.

This study explored the association between ureteral double J stent colonization and lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) severity. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2021 to June 2021 in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, who required double J stent (DJS) insertion. Patients who came to the site for stent removal were invited to participate in the study and enrolled using a consecutive sampling technique between January 15, 2021, and March 15, 2021. Results The study enrolled 176 patients, of whom 73.33% had colonization and the remaining had no colonization. The factors significantly associated with symptom severity included colonization of the DJS (P-value = 0.001) and the patients' ages (P-value = 0.046). The two groups have significantly different symptoms, which included incontinence (P-value = 0.001), polyuria (P-value = 0.001), and nocturia (P-value = 0.001). Conclusion Our study found more severe symptoms in DJS patients with colonization than in those without colonization. Irritative voiding symptoms, including nocturia and dysuria, are more common in DJS patients with colonization.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-11-08,2021,2021-11-08,2021-11-08,13,11,e19354,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hussain, Malik Hatim; Jilanee, Daniyal; Naeem, Mustafa; Ashraf, Syed Usama; Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo A.; Mehta, Shivani; Zaidi, Syed Ali H.; Zaidi, Syed Kumail H.; Tousif, Sohaib; Barkat, Rahil; Jilanee, Daniyal; Ashraf, Syed; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño; Mehta, Shivani M.; Zaidi, Syed Ali H.","Hussain, Malik Hatim (); Jilanee, Daniyal (); Naeem, Mustafa (); Ashraf, Syed Usama (); Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo A.

Validation of the Content of the Diagnostic Label Professional Traumatic Grief,"(1) Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has put our healthcare systems to the test, exposing their vulnerability and demanding a high degree of commitment and dedication from healthcare teams to confront and contain the disease. In this sense, nursing professionals have played a prominent role in the treatment of complex cases that have required hospitalisation and have manifested pre-existing health complications or mortality. This unprecedented situation made it difficult to regulate the emotional impact and manage grief, often turning it into a traumatic grief whose psychological and emotional manifestations are increasingly evident but very little researched in the current context. (2) Purpose: Validation of the definition, defining characteristics and related factors for the proposal of the nursing diagnosis of professional traumatic grief. (3) Method: Based on Fehring's content validation model, the label name, defining characteristics and other related factors were agreed upon by Spanish experts. (4) Results: The content validity index was 0.9068. A total of 21 defining characteristics were validated by the experts, as all of them scored above 0.6. With respect to the related factors of the proposed 10, all were validated. (5) Conclusion: The present study supports the proposal to develop a nursing diagnosis for professional traumatic grief.

In the light of current discussions on the vaccinations of children it seems necessary to better identify children who are immune against SARS-CoV-2 due to a previous infection and to better understand COVID-19 related immune reactions in children. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, children aged 1-17 were recruited through primary care pediatricians for the study (a) randomly, if they had an appointment for a regular health check-up or (b) if parents and children volunteered and actively wanted to participate in the study. Symptoms were recorded and two antibody tests were performed in parallel directed against S (in house test) and N (Roche Elecsys) viral proteins. In children with antibody response in either test, neutralization activity was determined. Results: We identified antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 162 of 2,832 eligible children (5.7%) between end of May and end of July 2020 in three, in part strongly affected regions of Bavaria in the first wave of the pandemic. Approximately 60% of antibody positive children (n = 97) showed high levels (>97th percentile) of antibodies against N-protein, and for the S-protein, similar results were found. Sufficient neutralizing activity was detected for only 135 antibody positive children (86%), irrespective of age and sex. Initial COVID-19 symptoms were unspecific in children except for the loss of smell and taste and unrelated to antibody responses or neutralization capacity. Approximately 30% of PCR positive children did not show seroconversion in our small subsample in which PCR tests were performed. Conclusions: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are unspecific in children and antibody responses show a dichotomous structure with strong responses in many and no detectable antibodies in PCR positive children and missing neutralization activity in a relevant proportion of the young population.","We are grateful to all participants for their bravery in giving blood and their parents for their great support, the Bavarian red cross for support in Tirschenreuth and especially Mr. Schedel; the students who helped organizing the study, packing study sets, transporting sets and samples across the study areas; the assistants and helpers in all pediatric outpatient clinics who did a tremendous job on top of their routine work; all lab personal in the involved laboratories for extra and weekend hours; and Birgit Kulawik for providing graphic design.

Specifically, people at risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have shown to benefit from being physically active. The objective of this study was to explore what factors were associated with low physical activity in people at high risk of T2D living in Bogota and Barranquilla, Colombia. Methodology: Cross-sectional study using baseline data from a quasi-experimental clinical trial (PREDICOL Project). The study included 1,135 participants of Bogota and Barranquilla that presented a high risk of developing T2D according to the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (>12 points) and who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. The main outcome variable was the level of physical activity assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In total, 72.5% of the study participants had low level of physical activity. Participants in the age group between 45 and 54 years showed 74% greater odds of having low physical activity compared with the youngest age group (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.1 -2.8). People living in Barranquilla were eight times more likely to have low physical activity compared with those in Bogotá D.C. (OR 8.1, 95% CI 5.7 to 11.4). Conclusion: A large proportion of the population at risk of developing D2T in two large cities of Colombia have a sedentary lifestyle. Interventions should be designed and implemented in order to increase physical activity in these populations.",,"Funding.

CG01: An Antarctic Cadmium-Resistant Strain Capable of Biosynthesizing CdS Nanoparticles Using Methionine as S-Source,"Here, we present the draft genome sequence of Pseudomonas sp. GC01, a cadmium-resistant Antarctic bacterium capable of biosynthesizing CdS fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) employing a unique mechanism involving the production of methanethiol (MeSH) from methionine (Met). To explore the molecular/metabolic components involved in QDs biosynthesis, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis, searching for the genes related to cadmium resistance and sulfur metabolic pathways. The genome of Pseudomonas sp. GC01 has a 4,706,645 bp size with a 58.61% G+C content. Pseudomonas sp. GC01 possesses five genes related to cadmium transport/resistance, with three P-type ATPases (cadA, zntA, and pbrA) involved in Cd-secretion that could contribute to the extracellular biosynthesis of CdS QDs. Furthermore, it exhibits genes involved in sulfate assimilation, cysteine/methionine synthesis, and volatile sulfur compounds catabolic pathways. Regarding MeSH production from Met, Pseudomonas sp. GC01 lacks the genes E4.4.1.11 and megL for MeSH generation. Interestingly, despite the absence of these genes, Pseudomonas sp. GC01 produces high levels of MeSH. This is probably associated with the metC gene that also produces MeSH from Met in bacteria. This work is the first report of the potential genes involved in Cd resistance, sulfur metabolism, and the process of MeSH-dependent CdS QDs bioproduction in Pseudomonas spp. strains.","In the loving memory of Claudio Vásquez Guzmán, an excellent friend, mentor, and scientist, but a better human being.

A DFT Study,"In this study, the degradation mechanism of chloroacetanilide herbicides in the presence of four different nucleophiles, namely: Br-, I-, HS-, and S2O3-2, was theoretically evaluated using the dispersion-corrected hybrid functional wB97XD and the DGDZVP as a basis set. The comparison of computed activation energies with experimental data shows an excellent correlation (R2 = 0.98 for alachlor and 0.97 for propachlor). The results suggest that the best nucleophiles are those where a sulfur atom performs the nucleophilic attack, whereas the other species are less reactive. Furthermore, it was observed that the different R groups of chloroacetanilide herbicides have a negligible effect on the activation energy of the process. Further insights into the mechanism show that geometrical changes and electronic rearrangements contribute 60% and 40% of the activation energy, respectively. A deeper analysis of the reaction coordinate was conducted, employing the evolution chemical potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index, as well as the electronic flux. The charge analysis shows that the electron density of chlorine increases as the nucleophilic attack occurs. Finally, NBO analysis indicates that the nucleophilic substitution in chloroacetanilides is an asynchronous process with a late transition state for all models except for the case of the iodide attack, which occurs through an early transition state in the reaction.",The authors are grateful to the USFQ Collaboration and POLI grants 2019-2021 for the financial support of this research.

Identifying the domestic species (alpaca and llama) in archaeological sites based solely on morphological data is challenging due to their similarity with respect to their wild ancestors. Using genetic methods also presents challenges due to the hybridization history of the domestic species, which are thought to have extensively hybridized following the Spanish conquest of South America that resulted in camelids slaughtered en masse. In this study, we generated mitochondrial genomes for 61 ancient South American camelids dated between 3,500 and 2,400 years before the present (Early Formative period) from two archaeological sites in Northern Chile (Tulán-54 and Tulán-85), as well as 66 modern camelid mitogenomes and 815 modern mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America. In addition, we performed osteometric analyses to differentiate big and small body size camelids. A comparative analysis of these data suggests that a substantial proportion of the ancient vicuña genetic variation has been lost since the Early Formative period, as it is not present in modern specimens. Moreover, we propose a domestication hypothesis that includes an ancient guanaco population that no longer exists. Finally, we find evidence that interbreeding practices were widespread during the domestication process by the early camelid herders in the Atacama during the Early Formative period and predating the Spanish conquest.","The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,eLife,,"George H Perry, Jessica C Thompson","Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Archaeology; Camelids, New World; Chile; DNA, Ancient; DNA, Mitochondrial; Domestication; Genetic Variation; Genome, Mitochondrial; Hybridization, Genetic",2021-03-16,2021,2021-03-16,,10,,e63390,All OA; Gold,Article,"Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández; Rey-Iglesia, Alba; Cartajena, Isabel; Núñez, Lautaro; Westbury, Michael Vincent; Varas, Valeria; Moraga, Mauricio; Campos, Paula F; Orozco-terWengel, Pablo; Marin, Juan Carlos; Hansen, Anders Johannes","Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Rey-Iglesia, Alba (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Cartajena, Isabel (Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Núñez, Lautaro (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile); Westbury, Michael Vincent (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark); Varas, Valeria (Faculty of Sciences, Austral University of Chile, Valdivia, Chile); Moraga, Mauricio (Human Genetics Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago de Chile, Chile); Campos, Paula F (CIIMAR, University of Porto, Matosinhos, Portugal); Orozco-terWengel, Pablo (School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom); Marin, Juan Carlos (Faculty of Sciences, Bio-Bio University, Chillán, Chile); Hansen, Anders Johannes (Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark)","Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández (University of Copenhagen); Orozco-terWengel, Pablo (Cardiff University); Marin, Juan Carlos (Faculty of Sciences, Bio-Bio University, Chillán, Chile)","Diaz-Maroto, Paloma Fernández (University of Copenhagen); Rey-Iglesia, Alba (University of Copenhagen); Cartajena, Isabel (University of Chile); Núñez, Lautaro (Catholic University of the North); Westbury, Michael Vincent (University of Copenhagen); Varas, Valeria (Austral University of Chile); Moraga, Mauricio (University of Chile); Campos, Paula F (University of Porto); Orozco-terWengel, Pablo (Cardiff University); Marin, Juan Carlos (Faculty of Sciences, Bio-Bio University, Chillán, Chile); Hansen, Anders Johannes (University of Copenhagen)",28,14,0.62,8.31,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.63390,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136427590,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3105 Genetics,

We seek to show the experience of parenthood from the perspective of LGBTIQ+ people, considering its particularities and the role that health care services play as a potential support network. We used the biographical method through open-ended interviews, participants were LGBT people, and key informants from Chile, Colombia, and Mexico were selected based on a sociostructural sampling. We found that internalized stigma impacts LGBTIQ+ parenting in five ways: the impossibility of thinking of oneself as a parent, fear of violating children's rights, fear of passing on the stigma, fear of introducing their LGBTIQ+ partner, and the greater discrimination that trans and intersex people suffer. We identified gaps in health care perceptions: the need to guarantee universal access to health care, the need to include a gender perspective and inclusive treatment by health personnel, mental health programs with a community approach, access to assisted fertilization programs, and the generation of collaborative alliances between health services, civil society organizations, and the LGBTIQ+ community. We conclude that the health system is a crucial space from which to enable guarantees for the exercise of rights and overcome internalized stigma.",,"This research was funded by CONICYT/ANID, Chilean Government, grant number 21190448. 2019-2020.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"José Siles Gonzalez, Paulo Joaquim Pina Queirós, Carmen Solano Ruiz, Benito Yañez-Araque",Child; Chile; Colombia; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Mexico; Parenting; Qualitative Research; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Stigma,2021-05-18,2021,2021-05-18,,18,10,5373,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alday-Mondaca, Carolina; Lay-Lisboa, Siu","Alday-Mondaca, Carolina (Facultad de Humanidades, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile); Lay-Lisboa, Siu (Facultad de Humanidades, Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1270709, Chile)","Alday-Mondaca, Carolina (Catholic University of the North)","Alday-Mondaca, Carolina (Catholic University of the North); Lay-Lisboa, Siu (Catholic University of the North)",11,8,0.62,4.62,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5373/pdf?version=1621423855,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138164881,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 44 Human Society,3 Good Health and Well Being

The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines produced during immunological responses contributes to disease prognosis and progression. Parasite tissue persistence can induce chronic inflammatory stimuli, which can cause long-term tissue injury and fibrosis. Chronic Chagas' patients exhibit increased levels of interleukin (IL)-9, an important cytokine in the regulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic processes. Data on the role of IL-9 in other pathologies are sometimes contradictory, and few studies have explored this cytokine's influence in Chagas' disease pathology. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of IL-9 in the progression of T. cruzi infection in vivo and in vitro. In vitro infection demonstrated that IL-9 reduced the number of infected cells and decreased the multiplication of intracellular amastigotes in both C2C12 myoblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages. In myoblasts, the increased production of nitric oxide (NO) was essential for reduced parasite multiplication, whereas macrophage responses resulted in increased IL-6 and reduced TGF-β levels, indicating that parasite growth restriction mechanisms induced by IL-9 were cell-type specific. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice with T. cruzi trypomastigotes of the Y strain implicated a major role of IL-9 during the chronic phase, as increased Th9 and Tc9 cells were detected among splenocytes; higher levels of IL-9 in these cell populations and increased cardiac IL-9 levels were detected compared to those of uninfected mice. Moreover, rIL9 treatment decreased serum IL-12, IL-6, and IL-10 levels and cardiac TNF-α levels, possibly attempting to control the inflammatory response. IL-9 neutralization increased cardiac fibrosis, synthesis of collagens I and III, and mastocyte recruitment in BALB/c heart tissue during the chronic phase. In conclusion, our data showed that IL-9 reduced the invasion and multiplication of T. cruzi in vitro, in both myoblasts and macrophages, favoring disease control through cell-specific mechanisms. In vivo, IL-9 was elevated during experimental chronic infection in BALB/c mice, and this cytokine played a protective role in the immunopathological response during this phase by controlling cardiac fibrosis and proinflammatory cytokine production.",We thank Wiley Editing Services for the careful English review and Daniela Teixeira for the flow cytometry critical help and analysis.,"This work was supported by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) (2016/15000-4 and 2017/17103-8), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).",Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,,,"Animals; Chagas Disease; Cytokines; Humans; Interleukin-9; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Trypanosoma cruzi",2021-10-15,2021,2021-10-15,,11,,756521,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva; Orikaza, Cristina Mary; de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues; dos Santos, Luana Aguiar; Salu, Bruno Ramos; Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela; de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita; Mortara, Renato Arruda","de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); dos Santos, Luana Aguiar (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Salu, Bruno Ramos (Biochemistry Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela (Biochemistry Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita (Electronic Microscopy Center, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology Department, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil)","Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Federal University of São Paulo); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Federal University of São Paulo)","de Lira Silva, Nadjania Saraiva (Federal University of São Paulo); Orikaza, Cristina Mary (Federal University of São Paulo); de Santana, Fabiana Rodrigues (Federal University of São Paulo); dos Santos, Luana Aguiar (Federal University of São Paulo); Salu, Bruno Ramos (Federal University of São Paulo); Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela (Federal University of São Paulo); de Cássia Sinigaglia, Rita (Federal University of São Paulo); Mortara, Renato Arruda (Federal University of São Paulo)",6,3,0.62,2.71,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.756521/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141910784,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

We employ a novelty procedure to explore this phenomenon. This procedure performs apriori segmentation based on gender and generation. It then applies the deep learning technique to identify the predictors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, altruism, telepresence, social identity, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, perceived physical condition, social norms, habit, and trust) by segments. The predictor variables were taken from the literature on the use of social network sites, and an empirical study was carried out by quota sampling with a sample size of 395 older people. The results show different predictors of social network sites considering all the samples, baby boomer (born between 1947 and 1966) males and females, silent (born between 1927 and 1946) males and females. The high heterogeneity among older people is confirmed; this means that dealing with older adults as a uniform set of users of social network sites is a mistake. This study demonstrates that the four segments behave differently, and many diverse variables influence the acceptance of social network sites.",,"Funding.

The prescribed treatment for these conditions often includes electrophysical therapies, whose effectiveness in improving symptoms and function is a source of debate. Therefore, this systematic review aims to provide an integrative overview of the efficacy of these modalities in sensorimotor rehabilitation compared to placebo, manual therapy, or between them.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. We perform a literature review in the following databases: Biomed Central, Ebscohost, Lilacs, Ovid, PEDro, Sage, Scopus, Science Direct, Semantic Scholar, Taylor & Francis, and Web of Science, for the period 1980-2020. We include studies that discussed the sensorimotor rehabilitation of people with non-degenerative ulnar, radial, or median nerve injury. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Risk of Bias Tool described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the risk of bias across studies with the GRADE approach described in the GRADE Handbook.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included in the systematic review and 34 in the meta-analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as low or very low according to GRADE criteria. Low-level laser therapy and ultrasound showed favourable results in improving symptom severity and functional status compared to manual therapy. In addition, the low level laser showed improvements in pinch strength compared to placebo and pain (VAS) compared to manual therapy. Splints showed superior results to electrophysical modalities. The clinical significance of the results was assessed by effect size estimation and comparison with the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).
CONCLUSIONS: We found favourable results in pain relief, improvement of symptoms, functional status, and neurophysiological parameters for some electrophysical modalities, mainly when applied with a splint. Our results coincide with those obtained in some meta-analyses. However, none of these can be considered clinically significant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2006 to January 2021, 234 patients who underwent bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) surgery were included in the analysis. A Lasso regression model was utilized to select the most useful predictive features from among 46 laboratory variables. Then, a logistic regression analysis was used to develop the prediction model. Calibration curves, concordance index (C-index) and Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were performed to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. We also investigated model fit using changes in Akaike Information Criteria (AICs). Decision curve analyses (DCAs) were applied to assess the clinical usefulness of this nomograms. Its internal validation was confirmed.
RESULTS: Among the 234 patients, 53 were confirmed to have ENE. The platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were significantly associated with ENE (P<0.05). The individualized prediction nomogram, including the PLR, SCC-Ag, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and pathologic tumor stage(pT-stage), showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.817 (95% CI, 0.745 to 0.890) and good calibration. Clinical-laboratory nomogram (AIC, 180.034) become the best-fitting model. DCA findings revealed that the clinical-laboratory nomogram was more clinically useful than the pT-stage or tumor grade.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a clinicopathologic and laboratory-based nomogram that incorporates PLR, SCC-Ag, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and pT-stage, which can be conveniently utilized to facilitate the individualized prediction of lymph node metastasis ENE in patients with penile cancer.",The authors wish to thank all the patients and their families.

Although affected males with WAS usually manifest severe symptoms, female carriers have no significant clinical manifestations. Here, we describe a Chinese girl diagnosed with WAS carrying a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 2 of the WAS gene. The patient presented with persistent thrombocytopenia with small platelets and decreased WAS protein detected by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The methylation analysis of the HUMARA gene displayed an extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation (SXCI) pattern, where the X-chromosomes bearing normal WAS gene were predominantly inactivated, leaving the mutant gene active. Hence, our results suggest that completely inactivating the unaffected paternal X-chromosomes may be the reason for such phenotype in this female patient. SXCI has important implications for genetic counseling of female carriers with a family history of WAS.","We would like to thank all members of the study team, the patient and her family.",Funding.

A number of previous studies have revealed potential regulatory mechanisms by which epigenetics regulate pigmentation. However, the genome-wide DNA methylation involved in animal coat color dilution remains unknown. Results: We compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in Rex rabbit hair follicles in a Chinchilla group (Ch) and a diluted Chinchilla group (DCh) through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Approximately 3.5% of the cytosine sites were methylated in both groups, of which the CG methylation type was in greatest abundance. In total, we identified 126,405 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the two groups, corresponding to 11,459 DMR-associated genes (DMGs). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that these DMGs were principally involved in developmental pigmentation and Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, two DMRs were randomly selected to verify that the WGBS data were reliable using bisulfite sequencing PCR, and seven DMGs were analyzed to establish the relationship between the level of DNA methylation and mRNA expression using qRT-PCR. Due to the limitation of small sample size, replication of the results with a larger sample size would be important in future studies.

Mesoamerican societies were multicultural in nature and also experienced significant admixture during Spanish colonization of the region. Despite these facts, Native Mexican Y chromosome diversity has been greatly understudied. To further elucidate their genetic history, we conducted a high-resolution Y chromosome analysis with Chichimecas, Nahuas, Otomies, Popolocas, Tepehuas, and Totonacas using 19 Y-short tandem repeat and 21 single nucleotide polymorphism loci. We detected enormous paternal genetic diversity in these groups, with haplogroups Q-MEH2, Q-M3, Q-Z768, Q-L663, Q-Z780, and Q-PV3 being identified. These data affirmed the southward colonization of the Americas via Beringia and connected Native Mexicans with indigenous populations from South-Central Siberia and Canada. They also suggested that multiple population dispersals gave rise to Y chromosome diversity in these populations.","We thank the enthusiastic participation of the Native American populations represented herein: Chichimecas (Éza&#x27;r), Nahuas, Otomies (Hñähñús), Popolocas, Tepehuas, and Totonacas; their collaboration made this study possible.

ADHD-affected patients display visual-motor and visuospatial abilities and skills that depart from those exhibited by non-affected individuals and struggle with perceptual organization, which might partially explain impulsive responses. Endophenotypes (quantifiable or dimensional constructs that are closely related to the root cause of the disease) might provide a more powerful and objective framework for dissecting the underlying neurobiology of ADHD than that of categories offered by the syndromic classification. In here, we explore the potential presence of the linkage and association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), harbored in genes implicated in the etiology of ADHD (ADGRL3, DRD4, and FGF1), with cognitive endophenotypes related to working memory and perceptual organization in 113 nuclear families. These families were ascertained from a geographical area of the Caribbean coast, in the north of Colombia, where the community is characterized by its ethnic diversity and differential gene pool. We found a significant association and linkage of markers ADGRL3-rs1565902, DRD4-rs916457 and FGF1-rs2282794 to neuropsychological tasks outlining working memory and perceptual organization such as performance in the digits forward and backward, arithmetic, similarities, the completion of figures and the assembly of objects. Our results provide strong support to understand ADHD as a combination of working memory and perceptual organization deficits and highlight the importance of the genetic background shaping the neurobiology, clinical complexity, and physiopathology of ADHD. Further, this study supplements new information regarding an ethnically diverse community with a vast African American contribution, where ADHD studies are scarce.","We express our highest appreciation to all idividuals enrolled in this study.

In 2019, five QPP F1 hybrids were selected for further evaluation due to superior agronomics, endosperm protein quality, and popping quality traits. Though these BC2F5 QPP hybrids were phenotypically similar to their popcorn parents, the QPP cultivars conveyed slightly inferior popping characteristics when compared to the original popcorn germplasm. The objective of this study was twofold. First, BC2F5 inbred lines were crossed to their popcorn parents and BC3F4 inbred lines were produced for hybridization to test the agronomic, protein, and popping trait effects from an additional QPP by popcorn backcross. Second, BC2- and BC3-hybrids were simultaneously evaluated alongside ConAgra Brands® elite cultivars and ranked for potential commercialization in the spring of 2020. These 10 QPP hybrids were grown alongside five ConAgra Brands® elite popcorn cultivars in three locations and agronomic, protein quality, and popping quality traits were evaluated. Significant improvements in popcorn quality traits were observed in the QPP BC3 cultivars compared to their BC2 counterparts, and yield averages were significantly lower in BC3-derived QPP hybrids compared to the BC2 population. Protein quality traits were not significantly different between QPP backcrossing populations and significantly superior to ConAgra elite popcorn varieties. Utilizing a previously published ranking system, six QPP hybrids, three from the BC2F5 population and three from the BC3F4 population, were evaluated as candidates for final selection. The successful evaluation and ranking system methodology employed is transferable to other hybrid production and testing programs. Incorporating this analysis with concurrent sensory studies, two QPP hybrids were chosen as premier cultivars for potential commercialization.","We offer appreciation to ConAgra Brands® for continued funding, cooperation, and providing popcorn germplasm.

All participants provided verbal consent prior to completing the survey. A 37-question web-based survey with no personal identifiers was sent to 212 previously identified AD patients. Itching, sleep disturbances, SARS-CoV-2, illness cost, economic dependence, monthly income, and monthly investment in AD before and during the pandemic, were all included in the analysis. A response rate of 73.1% was obtained. The mean age of participants was 30 years-old, and 57% were women. Around 75% reported AD worsening, and 59.4% of the patients reported sleep problems. Uncertainty, anxiety, and pessimism were frequent during the pandemic. Only 1.3% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and it was only significantly associated with comorbidities (p=0.03; Chi2 Test). A significant difference was found in economic dependence and monthly income when compared between before and during the pandemic. This study provides probably the best possible assessment of the clinical, social, and economic effects of the pandemic on patients with an already proven diagnosis of AD.","We thank all the patients for their willingness to participate.

Treatment options, such as surgery and cryotherapy may be difficult or not feasible. Alternative therapies, such as immunomodulating drugs, can potentially be used for companion large animals. The hypothesis of the following retrospective study is: following multiple intravenous and intralesional injections of a mycobacterial cell wall stimulant (MCW) regression of SCC in equine, bovine and caprine patients will be observed. In this observational-retrospective case series, patients included are 2 bovine, 2 caprine and 3 equine patients. The medical records at two different teaching veterinary hospitals were searched for cases with a positive histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma that were subsequently treated with MCW, as either the sole therapy, or in conjunction with other therapies. Seven cases were included in this retrospective study. The median duration of therapy was 56.5 days, with 3 of the 7 patients being euthanized. Significant complications were seen in 3/7 patients. Repeated injections of a MCW may lead to reduction in lesion size of SCC in some cases, but long-term resolution is unlikely and the risk of significant complications is high; due to limited sample size and the variety in species, it is difficult to conclude if MCW is an effective therapy for SCC.",The authors would like to acknowledge the staff at both Oklahoma State University and North Carolina State University for their assistance and help with each of the cases reported in the manuscript.

Survey Results of the European PROspective Penile Cancer Study (E-PROPS),"BACKGROUND: Penile cancer represents a rare malignant disease, whereby a small caseload is associated with the risk of inadequate treatment expertise. Thus, we hypothesized that strict guideline adherence might be considered a potential surrogate for treatment quality. This study investigated the influence of the annual hospital caseload on guideline adherence regarding treatment recommendations for penile cancer.
METHODS: In a 2018 survey study, 681 urologists from 45 hospitals in four European countries were queried about six hypothetical case scenarios (CS): local treatment of the primary tumor pTis (CS1) and pT1b (CS2); lymph node surgery inguinal (CS3) and pelvic (CS4); and chemotherapy neoadjuvant (CS5) and adjuvant (CS6). Only the responses from 206 head and senior physicians, as decision makers, were evaluated. The answers were assessed based on the applicable European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines regarding their correctness. The real hospital caseload was analyzed based on multivariate logistic regression models regarding its effect on guideline adherence.
RESULTS: The median annual hospital caseload was 6 (interquartile range (IQR) 3-9). Recommendations for CS1-6 were correct in 79%, 66%, 39%, 27%, 28%, and 28%, respectively. The probability of a guideline-adherent recommendation increased with each patient treated per year in a clinic for CS1, CS2, CS3, and CS6 by 16%, 7.8%, 7.2%, and 9.5%, respectively (each p < 0.05); CS4 and CS5 were not influenced by caseload. A caseload threshold with a higher guideline adherence for all endpoints could not be perceived. The type of hospital care (academic vs. non-academic) did not affect guideline adherence in any scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence for most treatment recommendations increases with growing annual penile cancer caseload. Thus, the results of our study call for a stronger centralization of diagnosis and treatment strategies regarding penile cancer.",We would like to thank all participating clinics and physicians for supporting the E-PROPS project.,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-29,2021,2021-11-29,,11,,759362,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lebentrau, Steffen; Wakileh, Gamal Anton; Schostak, Martin; Schmid, Hans-Peter; Suarez-Ibarrola, Rodrigo; Merseburger, Axel S.; Hutterer, Georg C.; Necknig, Ulrike H.; Rink, Michael; Bögemann, Martin; Kluth, Luis Alex; Pycha, Armin; Burger, Maximilian; Brookman-May, Sabine D.; Bründl, Johannes; May, Matthias","Lebentrau, Steffen (Department of Urology, Werner Forßmann Hospital, Eberswalde, Germany); Wakileh, Gamal Anton (Department of Urology, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany); Schostak, Martin (Department of Urology and Urooncology, University Medical Center Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany); Schmid, Hans-Peter (Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland); Suarez-Ibarrola, Rodrigo (Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany); Merseburger, Axel S.

We use the Duncan Index to measure segregation based on income at the municipality level for 324 municipalities. LS is obtained from the CASEN survey, which considers a question about self-reported well-being. Segregation's impact upon LS is not clear at first glance. On one hand, there is evidence telling that segregation's consequences are negative due to the spatial concentration of poverty and all the woes related to it. On the other hand, segregation would have positive effects because people may feel stress, unhappiness, and alienation when comparing themselves to better-off households. Additionally, there is previous evidence regarding the fact that people prefer to neighbor people of a similar socioeconomic background. Hence, an empirical test is needed. In order to implement it, we should deal with two problems, first, the survey limited statistical significance at the municipal level, hence we use the small area estimation (SAE) methodology to improve the estimations' statistic properties, and second, the double causality between segregation and LS; to deal with the latter, we include lagged LS as a regressor. Our findings indicate that socioeconomic segregation has a positive effect on LS. This result is robust to different econometric specifications.","MV acknowledges the support of the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies, project ANID/FONDAP/15130009.",,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-02-05,2021,2021-02-05,,11,,604194,All OA; Gold,Article,"Montero, Rodrigo; Vargas, Miguel; Vásquez, Diego","Montero, Rodrigo (Facultad de Economía y Negocios, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago, Chile); Vargas, Miguel (Facultad de Economía y Negocios, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago, Chile); Vásquez, Diego (Observatorio Social, Ministerio de Desarrollo Social, Santiago, Chile)","Vargas, Miguel (Andrés Bello National University)","Montero, Rodrigo (Andrés Bello National University); Vargas, Miguel (Andrés Bello National University); Vásquez, Diego (Observatorio Social, Ministerio de Desarrollo Social, Santiago, Chile)",4,4,0.53,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.604194/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135136446,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Citrobacter gillenii FP75 was identified by using biochemical tests and 16S ribosomal gene analysis. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the qnrB89 gene exhibited an identity to qnrB of 81.24% and 91.59%, respectively. The genetic environment of qnrB89 was characterized by the upstream location of a sequence encoding for a protein containing a heavy metal-binding domain and a gene encoding for a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase protein, whereas downstream to qnrB89 gene were detected the csp and cspG genes, encoding cold-shock proteins. The qnrB89 gene was located on a large chromosomal contig of the FP75 genome and was not associated with the 10-kb plasmid and class 1 integron harbored by the FP75 strain. This study reports for the first time the carriage of a qnrB gene by the C. gillenii species, and its detection in a bacterial strain isolated from farmed salmon in Chile.","The authors acknowledge to Luz Hurtado for expert assistance with MIC assays.

The influence of the processing parameters on the physical, microstructural, and mechanical properties was investigated. The bimodal microstructure was achieved from the blends of powder particles with different sizes, while the porous structure was obtained using the space-holder technique (50 vol.% of ammonium bicarbonate). Mechanically milled powders (10 and 20 h) were mixed in 50 wt.% or 75 wt.% with c.p. titanium. Four different mixtures of powders were precompacted via uniaxial cold pressing at 400 MPa. Then, the specimens were sintered at 750 °C via hot pressing in an argon gas atmosphere. The presence of a bimodal microstructure, comprised of small-grain regions separated by coarse-grain ones, was confirmed by optical and scanning electron microscopies. The samples with a bimodal microstructure exhibited an increase in the porosity compared with the commercially available pure Ti. In addition, the hardness was increased while the Young's modulus was decreased in the specimens with 75 wt.% of the milled powders (20 h).","The authors thank the laboratory technicians Jesus Pinto at Universidad de Sevilla (Spain), Claudio Aravena and Gabriel Cornejo at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (Chile) for their support carrying out the microstructure characterization and mechanical testing.","This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of Chile government [grant number Fondecyt 11160865, and FONDEQUIP EQM130103 and EQM150101, and Scholarship Program/DOCTORADO/2021-21211274], and the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación of Spain under the grant PID2019-109371GB-I00.",Materials,,Javier Gil,,2021-12-25,2021,2021-12-25,,15,1,136,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chávez-Vásconez, Ricardo; Lascano, Sheila; Sauceda, Sergio; Reyes-Valenzuela, Mauricio; Salvo, Christopher; Mangalaraja, Ramalinga Viswanathan; Gotor, Francisco José; Arévalo, Cristina; Torres, Yadir","Chávez-Vásconez, Ricardo (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Lascano, Sheila (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Sauceda, Sergio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Reyes-Valenzuela, Mauricio (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Avenida Vicuña Mackenna 3939, Santiago 8940572, Chile;, ricardo.chavezv@usm.cl, (R.C.-V.);, sergio.sauceda@usm.cl, (S.S.);, mauricio.reyes@usm.cl, (M.R.-V.)); Salvo, Christopher (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Bío-Bío, Avda.

This work is related to the kinetic study of the leaching of gold and copper contained in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and silver contained in mining wastes (MW), using the O2-thiosemicarbazide system. The results obtained show that this non-toxic leaching system is adequate for the leaching of said metals. Reaction orders were found ranging from 0 (Cu), 0.93 (Ag), and 2.01 (Au) for the effect of the reagent concentration and maximum recoveries of 77.7% (Cu), 95.8% (Au), and 60% (Ag) were obtained. Likewise, the activation energies found show that the leaching of WEEE is controlled by diffusion (Cu Ea = 9.06 and Au Ea = 18.25 kJ/Kmol), while the leaching of MW (Ea = 45.55 kJ/Kmol) is controlled by the chemical reaction. For the case of stirring rate, it was found a low effect and only particles from WEEE and MW must be suspended in solution to proceed with the leaching. The pH has effect only at values above 8, and finally, for the case of MW, the O2 partial pressure has a market effect, going the Ag leaching from 33% at 0.2 atm up to 60% at a 1 atm.",The authors are thankful to CONACyT of the Mexican Government for the support with the scholarship awarded to the master student (A.H.R.-C) with CVU 739728 and the doctorate student (E.A.C.-R) with CVU 778782.,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,Ndue Kanari,,2021-11-30,2021,2021-11-30,,14,23,7329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cerecedo-Sáenz, Eduardo; Cárdenas-Reyes, Edgar A.; Rojas-Calva, Abner H.; Reyes-Valderrama, Ma.

Medical history data were collected, information bias was controlled for, and descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test and the Mann–Whitney U test in SPSS 25.0. Of the patients in the cohort, 36.7% presented technique-related complications, 56.7% developed sepsis, 23.3% had low birth weight, 26.7% were preterm births, 43.3% had other malformations, 26.7% had congenital heart defects, and 13.3% presented pulmonary hypertension. The mean hospital stay was 26 days. The mortality rate was 16.7%; it was significantly higher among patients with other malformations, congenital heart defects, pentalogy of Cantrell and pulmonary hypertension. The Abello technique for the treatment of giant omphalocele showed a high neonatal survival rate and a low rate of procedure-related complications. The main factors associated with the death of neonatal patients were the presence of other malformations, congenital heart defect, pentalogy of Cantrell and pulmonary hypertension.",,,Scientific Reports,,,"Colombia; Female; Hernia, Umbilical; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Length of Stay; Male; Retrospective Studies",2021-01-11,2021,2021-01-11,,11,1,310,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barrios-Sanjuanelo, Alexander; Abelló-Munarriz, Cristóbal; Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio","Barrios-Sanjuanelo, Alexander (Epidemiology, University of Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia); Abelló-Munarriz, Cristóbal (North University (Universidad del Norte-Uninorte), Barranquilla, Colombia; Metropolitan University (Universidad Metropolitana-UM), Barranquilla, Colombia; Minimally Invasive, High-Complexity Pediatric Surgery Group, CMI International Pediatrics Clinic (Clínica CMI Pediátrica International), Barranquilla, Colombia); Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio (School of Microbiology, University of Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia)","Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio (University of Antioquia)","Barrios-Sanjuanelo, Alexander (University of Antioquia); Abelló-Munarriz, Cristóbal (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Metropolitana; Minimally Invasive, High-Complexity Pediatric Surgery Group, CMI International Pediatrics Clinic (Clínica CMI Pediátrica International), Barranquilla, Colombia); Cardona-Arias, Jaiberth Antonio (University of Antioquia)",2,1,0.5,1.03,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78991-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134478517,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

From the Positive Youth Development approach, the promotion of personal protective factors takes on special importance against some risks, such as the consumption of addictive substances. (2) Methods: This research is one of the first to study the role of trait and ability emotional intelligence in relation to cannabis use and with respect to other personal variables of protection, such as coping styles and assertiveness. For this purpose, a final sample of 799 schoolchildren was obtained. (3) Results: After controlling for age and gender, the results of the regression analyses revealed that emotional perception, emotional facilitation, emotional clarity, emotional repair, active coping style, and assertiveness were inversely and significantly associated with cannabis use behaviors. On the other hand, the emotional attention and avoidant coping style factors were positively and significantly associated with these behaviors.

The multistep invasion process involves specific interactions between parasite ligands and erythrocyte receptors. Erythrocyte-binding-like (EBL) proteins, type I integral transmembrane proteins released from the merozoite micronemes, are known to play an important role in the initiation and formation of tight junctions between the apical end of the merozoite and the erythrocyte surface. In Plasmodium yoelii EBL (PyEBL), a single amino acid substitution in the putative Duffy binding domain dramatically changes parasite growth rate and virulence. This suggests that PyEBL is important for modulating the virulence of P. yoelii parasites. Based on these observations, we sought to elucidate the receptor of PyEBL that mediates its role as an invasion ligand. Using the eukaryotic wheat germ cell-free system, we systematically developed and screened a library of mouse erythrocyte proteins against native PyEBL using AlphaScreen technology. We report that PyEBL specifically interacts with basigin, an erythrocyte surface protein. We further confirmed that the N-terminal cysteine-rich Duffy binding-like region (EBL region 2), is responsible for the interaction, and that the binding is not affected by the C351Y mutation, which was previously shown to modulate virulence of P. yoelii. The identification of basigin as the putative PyEBL receptor offers new insights into the role of this molecule and provides an important base for in-depth studies towards developing novel interventions against malaria.",We thank Prof. Richard Culleton of Ehime University for critical reading of the manuscript.,"This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Nos.

The study was specifically focused on black South African professionals. Black professionals were found to exhibit signs of deep-rooted pain, anger and general emotional fatigue stemming from workplace-, socio-economic- and political triggers that evoked generational trauma and overall negative black lived experiences. The negative lived experiences could have led to racial identity dissonance and, in extreme cases, complete racial identity disassociation. Moreover, black professionals were found to display symptoms of 'survivor guilt,' stemming from the shared history of oppression amongst black people in South Africa. The 'survivor guilt' contributed toward a profound sense of shared responsibility and purpose to change the circumstances, experiences and overall perceptions about the capabilities of black professionals. Results showed that upbringing, determination, resilience, black support networks, and black leadership representation within organizational structures were important ingredients that positively contributed to the leadership aspirations and success of black professionals. The research discovered that, in some cases, black professionals leveraged white relationships to propel their careers forward, however, this practice reportedly resulted in the black professionals experiencing feelings of self-doubt in their own abilities. Self-doubt, also found to be a result of historical oppression, could have and have been shown to eventually lead to self-deselection, negatively impacting the aspirations and career advancement prospects of black professionals in organizational leadership. Furthermore, the research found that black leaders believed that their blackness, specifically, its unique texture of experiences and history in South Africa, provided them with superior empathetic leadership abilities toward other black employees. Black leaders frequently highlighted the distinctive values of ubuntu as the cornerstone of their leadership approach. In addition, it was found that black professionals also considered their blackness, particularly the shade of their skin, to detract from their leadership opportunities, as it reduced the odds of being authorized as natural leaders, thus fortifying a skewed self-perception of their own leadership capabilities.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2021-03-08,2021,2021-03-08,,12,,626473,All OA; Gold,Article,"Myeza, Angel; April, Kurt","Myeza, Angel (Graduate School of Business, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa); April, Kurt (Allan Gray Centre for Values-Based Leadership, Graduate School of Business, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa)","Myeza, Angel (University of Cape Town); April, Kurt (University of Cape Town)","Myeza, Angel (University of Cape Town); April, Kurt (University of Cape Town)",7,6,0.5,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.626473/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136205524,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

The isolates were recovered from fin lesion and kidney samples of diseased rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, during two Flavobacteriosis outbreaks occurring in freshwater farms located in Southern Chile. The strains were identified as Epilithonimonas spp. by using biochemical tests and by genome comparison analysis using the PATRIC bioinformatics platform and exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxytetracycline of 128 µg/mL. The tet(X) genes were located on small contigs of the FP105 and FP233-J200 genomes. The sequences obtained for the tet(X) genes and their genetic environment were compared with the genomes available in the GenBank database of strains of the Chryseobacterium clade belonging to the Flavobacterium family, isolated from fish and carrying the tet(X) gene. The Tet(X) proteins synthesized by the Chilean Epilithonimonas strains showed a high amino acid similarity (range from 84% to 100%), with the available sequences found in strains belonging to the genus Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium isolated from fish. An identical neighborhood of tet(X) genes from both Chilean strains was observed. The genetic environment of tet(X) observed in the two strains of Epilithonimonas studied was characterized by the upstream location of a sequence encoding a hypothetical protein and a downstream located alpha/beta hydrolase-encoding gene, similar to the observed in some of the tet(X) genes carried by Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium strains isolated from fish, but the produced proteins exhibited a low amino acid identity (25-27%) when compared to these synthesized by the Chilean strains. This study reports for the first time the carriage of the tet(X) gene by the Epilithonimonas genus and their detection in fish pathogenic bacteria isolated from farmed salmonids in Chile, thus limiting the use of therapies based on oxytetracycline, the antimicrobial most widely used in Chilean freshwater salmonid farming.

It has been used as a predictor of long-term survival and prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of CCI score on mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients and test the efficacy of the CoLACD score (COVID-19 lymphocyte ratio, age, CCI score, dyspnoea) in predicting mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
METHODOLOGY: It was a retrospective cohort, and the data of this study were gathered from two tertiary hospitals of Karachi, including Liaquat National Hospital and Ziauddin Hospital. Data of patients hospitalized in any of these tertiary care hospitals and diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 infection were used in the study from January 15, 2021, to April 30, 2021.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 53.22 (±14.21) years. The majority of participants were males (74.91%). Predictors of mortality include CCI score, age of participants, D-dimer, smoking status, and shortness of breath. The sensitivity of this CoLACD score was 80.23%, and specificity was 50.23% (diagnostic accuracy is 60.45%). The negative predictive value (NPV) of this test was 39.44%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 83.01%.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that CCI can be used in a clinical setting to achieve a prediction of mortality in COVID-19 patients.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-11-27,2021,2021-11-27,2021-11-27,13,11,e19937,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ahmed, Jawad; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Capriles, Natalia M.

Our goal was to assess the genetic diversity and the degree of differentiation among groups of Prosopis individuals of different species from Section Algarobia and putative hybrids (hereafter populations) co-occurring in these isolated oases from the Atacama Desert and determine whether genetic patterns are associated with dispersal barriers. Thirteen populations were sampled from oases located on three hydrographic basins (Pampa del Tamarugal, Rio Loa, and Salar de Atacama; northern, central, and southern basins, respectively). Individuals genotyped by eight SSRs show high levels of genetic diversity (H O = 0.61, A r = 3.5) and low but significant genetic differentiation among populations (F ST = 0.128, F ST-ENA = 0.129, D JOST = 0.238). The AMOVA indicates that most of the variation occurs within individuals (79%) and from the variance among individuals (21%); almost, the same variation can be found between basins and between populations within basins. Differentiation and structure results were not associated with the basins, retrieving up to four genetic clusters and certain admixture in the central populations. Pairwise differentiation comparisons among populations showed inconsistencies considering their distribution throughout the basins. Genetic and geographic distances were significantly correlated at global and within the basins considered (p < .02), but low correlation indices were obtained (r < .37). These results are discussed in relation to the fragmented landscape, considering both natural and non-natural (humans) dispersal agents that may be moving Prosopis in the Atacama Desert.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, Chile (FONDECYT 11180805, 1160045; Anillo SOC1405), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCYT (PICT2016‐0388), and Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, UBA (UBACYT 20020190200106BA).

Their distribution suggests an ancient origin during a cold period of the earth's history. In this study, we evaluated this hypothesis and corroborated the non-monophyly of the genus Sprattus, using a phylogenetic approach based on DNA sequences of five mitochondrial genome regions. Sprattus sprattus is more closely related to members of the genus Clupea than to other Sprattus species. We also investigated the historical biogeography of the genus, with the phylogenetic tree showing two well-supported clades corresponding to the species distribution in each hemisphere. Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses showed that an ancient divergence between Northern and Southern Hemispheres occurred at 55.8 MYBP, followed by a diversification in the Oligocene epoch in the Northern Hemisphere clade (33.8 MYBP) and a more recent diversification in the Southern Hemisphere clade (34.2 MYBP). Historical biogeography analyses indicated that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) likely inhabited the Atlantic Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. These results suggest that the ancestral population of the MRCA diverged in two populations, one was dispersed to the Northern Hemisphere and the other across the Southern Hemisphere. Given that the Eocene was the warmest epoch since the Paleogene, the ancestral populations would have crossed the tropics through deeper cooler waters, as proposed by the isothermal submergence hypothesis. The non-monophyly confirmed for the genus Sprattus indicates that its systematics should be re-evaluated.","This work was supported by the FIPA 2010-17, the CONICYT doctoral Internship, the FONDECYT 11180897, 1201506 and by ANID –Millennium Science Initiative –NCN16_034.

The human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, have a preference to invade reticulocytes during blood-stage infection. Rodent malaria parasites that also prefer reticulocytes could be useful tools to study human malaria reticulocyte invasion. However, previous tropism studies of rodent malaria are inconsistent from one another, making it difficult to compare cell preference of different parasite species and strains. In vivo measurements of cell tropism are also subjected to many confounding factors. Here we developed an ex vivo tropism assay for rodent malaria with highly purified fractions of murine reticulocytes and normocytes. We measured invasion into the different erythrocyte populations using flow cytometry and evaluated the tropism index of the parasite strains. We found that P. berghei ANKA displayed the strongest reticulocyte preference, followed by P. yoelii 17X1.1, whereas P. chabaudi AS and P. vinckei S67 showed mixed tropism. These preferences are intrinsic and were maintained at different reticulocyte and normocyte availabilities. Our study shed light on the true erythrocyte preference of the parasites and paves the way for future investigations on the receptor-ligand interactions mediating erythrocyte tropism.",The authors would like to thank SIgN Flow Cytometry Core for technical assistance with flow cytometry and SIgN Mouse Core for support in animal husbandry.

A broad approach to characterization initially controlled by UV-vis spectrophotometry has been directed, the formation mechanism was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the magnetic properties by characterization by Physical Property Measurement System (PPSM), in addition to a large number of techniques such as X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (DRX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and Z potential to confirm the formation of FeO NP. The results suggest better characteristics for FeO NP synthesized using 96% alcoholic solvent extract. The successful synthesis was directly proven in the removal of metals (Cr-VI, Cd, and Pb) as a potential alternative in the remediation of agricultural soils.","The authors would like to thank LABNANO/CBPF for the technical support during the electron microscopy work.

The stress intensity factor is estimated by means of four different methods, the accuracy is assessed for each approach and the fracture toughness is estimated. The proposed methodology is also applied to estimate the fracture toughness for graphene and diamond using published data from other scientific articles. The obtained fracture toughness for the single-crystal aluminum is compared with other nanomaterials that have similar microstructures. Dislocation emission during the fracture simulation of the cracked nano-crystal of aluminum is analyzed to study the fracture behavior.

Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study as part of the Quality of Life in Menopause and Colombian Ethnic Groups research project [CAVIMEC+COVID STUDY]. The population consisted of women born and residing in Colombia, 40 to 59 years of age, who signed an informed consent and agreed to participate by completing an online form, freely and anonymously, in the first five days of June 2020. Sleep disorders were identified using the third item on the Menopause Rating Scale. Sociodemographic characteristics, presence and severity of sleep disorders and menopause status were explored. Descriptive statistics are provided.
Results: Overall, 984 women aged 47.0 [IQR: 42.0-53.5] years were included: 84.5% mestizo, 13.7% Afro-Colombian, 1.7% indigenous; 39.3% were postmenopausal; 70% lived in the Caribbean region of Colombia. Sleep disorders were reported by 637 women (64.7%), and 112 (11.3%) had severe sleep disorders. Among postmenopausal women, 65.1% reported sleep disorders with 10.1% reporting severe disorders, while 64.5% of premenopausal reported sleep disorders, and 12.2% severe disorders.
Conclusions: Sleep disorders could be a frequent problem among premenopausal as well as postmenopausal women in the pandemic time. This issue should be explored during gynecological visits in order to offer solutions.

We observed extensive fields of filamentous cyanobacteria-like mats covering sandy substrates and mostly dead mesophotic Leptoseris spp. reefs. These mats covered up to 100% of the seafloor off Hanga Roa, the main village on the island, located on its western side. The highest mortality of corals was observed at depths between 70 and 95 m in this area. Healthy Leptoseris reefs were documented off the northern and southeastern sides of the island, which are also the least populated. A preliminary morphologic analysis of samples of the mats indicated that the assemblage is composed of at least four filamentous taxa, including two cyanobacteria (cf. Lyngbya sp. and Pseudoanabaena sp.), a brown alga (Ectocarpus sp.), and a green alga (Cladophora sp.). An ongoing eutrophication process is suggested as a potential driver of the proliferation of these filamentous mats off Hanga Roa village.","This work was supported by grants FONDECYT 1180694 and 1181153, as well as funding from the ANID- Millennium Science Initiative ESMOI.

This study also included the evaluation of specificity and sensitivity of VBGs values for the identification of abnormal ABG values.
METHOD: It was a retrospective, observational study conducted at the Indus Hospital and Health Network, Karachi, Pakistan. All VBG and ABG values in the same patient which were collected at the same time from April 2020 to May 2021 were included in the study.  Results: The study involved 377 patients; 52.8% of patients were female, while 47.2% were male. The mean age of patients was 53.4 years (±17.2). There is an acceptable agreement between the arterial and venous values of pH, bicarbonate (mEq/l), and lactate (mEq/l), respectively, and poor agreement in PCO2 (mmHg) and PO2.
CONCLUSION: The study found that analysis of VBG has the potential to be used in the emergency setting in general. Blood gas values of Lactate, HCO3, and pH have shown acceptable association and significant correlation, and they can be considered clinically interchangeable with ABGs values. However, venous PCO2 and PO2 were found to be different between the two.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-09-30,2021,2021-09-30,2021-09-30,13,9,e18401,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tousif, Sohaib; Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo A.; Shamim, Khizer; Shah, Huzaifa; Wali, Sher; Barkat, Rahil; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño; Shah, Syed Muhammad Huzaifa","Tousif, Sohaib (); Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo A.

Specimens of the new species were collected in the summit (∼200 m depth) of one seamount and observed by ROV at two nearby ones. This species is characterized by the presence of distinct carinae on the thoracic sternites 6 and 7. Furthermore, it is not related with any species from the continental shelf nor the slope of America, while it is closely related to species of Munida from French Polynesia and the West-Pacific Ocean (i.e., M. ommata, M. psylla and M. rufiantennulata). In situ observations indicate that the species lives among the tentacles of ceriantarid anemones and preys on small crustaceans. The discovery of this new species adds to the knowledge of the highly endemic benthic fauna of seamounts of the newly created Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park, emphasizing the relevance of this area for marine conservation.","This work was supported by grants (CONA C22 16-09, FONDECYT 1181153, FONDEQUIP EQM 150109) and ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-ESMOI.

Seed availability from commercial hatcheries is critical due to recurrent massive mortalities associated with bacterial infections, especially during the veliger larval stage. The immune response plays a crucial role in counteracting the effects of such infections, but being energetically costly, it potentially competes with the physiological and morphological changes that occur during early development, which are equally expensive. Consequently, in this study, energy metabolism parameters at the individual and cellular levels, under routine-basal status and after the exposure to the pathogenic strain bacteria (Vibrio splendidus VPAP18), were evaluated during early ontogeny (trochophore, D-veliger, veliger, pediveliger, and early juveniles) of A. purpuratus. The parameters measured were as follows: (1) metabolic demand, determined as oxygen consumption rate and (2) ATP supplying capacity measured by key mitochondrial enzymes activities [citrate synthase (CS), electron transport system (ETS), and ETS/CS ratio, indicative of ATP supplying efficiency], mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and mitochondrial density (ρ m) using an in vivo image analysis. Data revealed that metabolic demand/capacity varies significantly throughout early development, with trochophores being the most efficient in terms of energy supplying capacity under basal conditions. ATP supplying efficiency decreased linearly with larval development, attaining its lowest level at the pediveliger stage, and increasing markedly in early juveniles. Veliger larvae at basal conditions were inefficient in terms of energy production vs. energy demand (with low ρ m, ΔΨm, enzyme activities, and ETS:CS). Post-challenged results suggest that both trochophore and D-veliger would have the necessary energy to support the immune response. However, due to an immature immune system, the immunity of these stages would rely mainly on molecules of parental origin, as suggested by previous studies. On the other hand, post-challenged veliger maintained their metabolic demand but decreased their ATP supplying capacity, whereas pediveliger increased CS activity. Overall, results suggest that veliger larvae exhibit the lowest metabolic capacity to overcome a bacterial challenge, coinciding with previous works, showing a reduced capacity to express immune-related genes. This would result in a higher susceptibility to pathogen infection, potentially explaining the higher mortality rates occurring during A. purpuratus farming.","The authors would like to thank Laboratorio Central de Cultivos Marinos of the UCN for providing the infrastructure for carrying out the experiments, especially German Lira and Daniel Gonzalez for animal maintenance.

Ciliates, a group of microbial eukaryotes, exhibit germline-somatic nuclear dimorphism within a single cell with two different genomes. The ciliate Oxytricha trifallax undergoes massive RNA-guided DNA elimination and genome rearrangement to produce a new somatic macronucleus (MAC) from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC). This process eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt genes and also deletes hundreds of germline-limited open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed during genome rearrangement. Here, we update the set of transcribed germline-limited ORFs (TGLOs) in O. trifallax. We show that TGLOs tend to be expressed during nuclear development and then are absent from the somatic MAC. We also demonstrate that exposure to synthetic RNA can reprogram TGLO retention in the somatic MAC and that TGLO retention leads to transcription outside the normal developmental program. These data suggest that TGLOs represent a group of developmentally regulated protein-coding sequences whose gene expression is terminated by DNA elimination.","The authors thank Virginia A.

However, an accurate biomarker for ccRCC is lacking. This study identified 356 differentially expressed genes in ccRCC tissues compared with normal kidney tissues by integrative analysis of eight ccRCC datasets. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes unveiled improved adaptation to hypoxia and metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells. Aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene was identified as a biomarker for ccRCC among all the differentially expressed genes. ccRCC tissues expressed significantly lower AOX1 than normal kidney tissues, which was further validated by immunohistochemistry at the protein level and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data mining at the mRNA level. Higher AOX1 expression predicted better overall survival in ccRCC patients. Furthermore, AOX1 DNA copy number deletion and hypermethylation were negatively correlated with AOX1 expression, which might be the potential mechanism for its dysregulation in ccRCC. Finally, we illustrated that the effect of AOX1 as a tumor suppressor gene is not restricted to ccRCC but universally exists in many other cancer types. Hence, AOX1 may act as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for ccRCC.","We thank the people who devoted their own tissue samples to the databases (TCGA, GTEx, and so on), which makes it possible for scientists to investigate and unveil the mechanisms of cancers.

There is considerable variability among neonates, children, and adults in the incidence of infection and severe disease following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In our study, we analyzed the transcriptome data of primate animal model of Rhesus monkeys to evaluate the expression levels of possible SARS-CoV-2 receptors and proteases and immunologic features in the lungs, colons, livers, and brains at different developmental stages. Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in neonates compared with other populations, which imply the high incidence of infection. Other potential receptors and Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) and cathepsin of endosomal proteases also exhibited dynamic and differential expression patterns. The expression of receptors (ACE2, BSG, and DPP4) and proteases (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS9, CTSL, and CTSB) were highly correlated during lung development, suggesting the high susceptibility of the lungs. TMPRSS9 was specifically highly expressed in the lungs and reached the highest level in neonates, similar to TMPRSS2.

Here, we aimed to develop an m6A-related risk signature to improve prognostic and immunotherapy responder prediction performance in the context of melanoma. We comprehensively analyzed the m6A cluster and immune infiltration phenotypes of public datasets. The TCGA (n = 457) and eleven independent melanoma cohorts (n = 758) were used as the training and validation datasets, respectively. We identified two m6A clusters (m6A-clusterA and m6A-clusterB) based on the expression pattern of m6A regulators via unsupervised consensus clustering. IGF2BP1 (7.49%), KIAA1429 (7.06%), and YTHDC1 (4.28%) were the three most frequently mutated genes. There was a correlation between driver genes mutation statuses and the expression of m6A regulators. A significant difference in tumor-associated immune infiltration between two m6A clusters was detected. Compared with m6A-clusterA, the m6A-clusterB was characterized by a lower immune score and immune cell infiltration but higher mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi). An m6A-related risk signature consisting of 12 genes was determined via Cox regression analysis and divided the patients into low- and high-risk groups (IL6ST, MBNL1, NXT2, EIF2A, CSGALNACT1, C11orf58, CD14, SPI1, NCCRP1, BOK, CD74, PAEP). A nomogram was developed for the prediction of the survival rate. Compared with the high-risk group, the low-risk group was characterized by high expression of immune checkpoints and immunophenoscore (IPS), activation of immune-related pathways, and more enriched in immune cell infiltrations. The low-risk group had a favorable prognosis and contained the potential beneficiaries of the immune checkpoint blockade therapy and verified by the IMvigor210 cohort (n = 298). The m6A-related signature we have determined in melanoma highlights the relationships between m6A regulators and immune cell infiltration. The established risk signature was identified as a promising clinical biomarker of melanoma.",We would like to thank Dr. Xiangchun Li for his helpful discussion and advice.,This work was supported by the Tianjin Municipal Education Commission (No. 2016YD21).,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,,,2021-11-25,2021,2021-11-25,,9,,718912,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wu, Liuxing; Hu, Xin; Dai, Hongji; Chen, Kexin; Liu, Ben","Wu, Liuxing (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Hu, Xin (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Dai, Hongji (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Chen, Kexin (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China); Liu, Ben (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy of Tianjin, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cancer Epidemiology, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin’s Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China)","Liu, Ben (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital)","Wu, Liuxing (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Hu, Xin (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Dai, Hongji (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Chen, Kexin (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital); Liu, Ben (Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital)",8,4,0.43,2.05,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.718912/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143507025,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Combining brief socio-cognitive and behavioral evaluations with standard cognitive testing could better discriminate bvFTD from AD patients. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of brief socio-cognitive tests that may differentiate bvFTD and AD patients with low educational levels. Methods: A prospective study was performed on 51 individuals over the age of 50 with low educational levels, with bvFTD or AD diagnosed using published criteria, and who were receiving neurological care at a multidisciplinary neurology clinic in Lima, Peru, between July 2017 and December 2020. All patients had a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including a full neurocognitive battery and brief tests of cognition (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination version III, ACE-III), social cognition (Mini-social Cognition and Emotional Assessment, Mini-SEA), and behavioral assessments (Frontal Behavioral Inventory, FBI; Interpersonal Reactivity Index-Emphatic Concern, IRI-EC; IRI-Perspective Taking, IRI-PT; and Self-Monitoring Scale-revised version, r-SMS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) was performed to compare the brief screening tests individually and combined to the gold standard of bvFTD and AD diagnoses. Results: The AD group was significantly older than the bvFTD group (p < 0.001). An analysis of the discriminatory ability of the ACE-III to distinguish between patients with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.85) and the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS; AUC = 0.78) shows that the former has greater discriminatory ability. Social and behavioral cognition tasks were able to appropriately discriminate bvFTD from AD. The Mini-SEA had high sensitivity and high moderate specificity (83%) for discriminating bvFTD from AD, which increased when combined with the brief screening tests ACE-III and IFS. The FBI was ideal with high sensitivity (83%), as well as the IRI-EC and IRI-PT that also were adequate for distinguishing bvFTD from AD. Conclusions: Our study supports the integration of socio-behavioral measures to the standard global cognitive and social cognition measures utilized for screening for bvFTD in a population with low levels of education.",,Funding.

Given that the highest viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found in the airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk of infection. As a result, multiple recommendations have emerged regarding protective measures for surgical teams, including suspending non-urgent procedures and surgeries.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology residency training programs nationwide.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey-based study was completed in April 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey, sent by email to all Chilean otolaryngology residents. Demographics, clinical activities, on-call shifts, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to COVID-19 patients, deployment to other specialties, diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and surgeries performed were analyzed. Self-reported surgical data logs from previous years were used to compare results.
RESULTS: Forty-seven residents completed the survey (84% response rate); 64% of residents refer seeing patients ten days or less during April 2020. Commonly performed procedures such as flexible nasolaryngoscopy, rigid nasal endoscopy, and peritonsillar abscess drainage were not performed by over 40% of the residents in that month. Only 38% participated in surgeries, with an average of 0.6 surgeries as a first surgeon, a dramatic decrease in surgical exposure when comparing the data logs from previous years. Most residents refer the following measures taken by their residency program to improve residency training: bibliographic videoconferences (87%), online clinical case seminars (60%), weekly journal clubs (38%), among others.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and surgical opportunities decreased dramatically during April 2020. Adjustments to the regular academic curricula should be considered to decrease the negative impact of this pandemic on residency training.",,,Medwave,,,Adult; COVID-19; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Otolaryngology,2021-02-28,2021,2021-02-28,,21,01,e8097-e8097,All OA; Gold,Article,"Álvarez, Matías L; Waissbluth, Sofia; González, Claudia; Napolitano, Carla; Torrente, Mariela; Délano, Paul H; Alarcón, Ricardo; Fernández, Francisca; Bitrán, Roger","Álvarez, Matías L (Departamento Otorrinolaringología, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

The sparse information available, mainly for seamounts outside Chilean jurisdiction and shallow-water fauna of the Desventuradas Islands, suggests that the area is a hotspot of endemism. This apparent uniqueness of the fauna motivated the creation of the large Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park (NDMP, ~ 300,000 km2) around the small islands San Felix and San Ambrosio in 2015. We report for the first time a detailed description of benthic microhabitats (i.e., centimeter to meter scale), macrohabitats (i.e., meter to kilometer-scale) and associated megafauna within the NDMP. Descriptions were based on analysis of fauna collected by trawling and ROV video observations from ~ 50 to 370 m depth. Rocky, coarse sand and silty sediment bottom habitats were observed at island slopes. In contrast, rocky and coarse sandy bottom habitats with a predominance of rhodoliths, thanatocoenosis, and other biogenic components were observed at seamounts. Mobile fauna and predators dominated the oceanic islands and nearby seamounts, whereas seamounts farther from the islands were dominated by sessile and hemisessile fauna that were mainly suspension and deposit feeders. Based on the register of 118 taxonomic units, our results provide an expanded and updated baseline for the benthic biodiversity of NDMP habitats, which seemed pristine, without evidence of trawling or anthropogenic debris.","We are indebted to the Captain and crew of R/V Cabo de Hornos of the Chilean Navy, and the scientific personnel participating in the CIMAR 22 cruise.

Our study is to identify a robust prognostic marker for bladder cancer.
METHODS: The transcriptome and clinical data of bladder cancer were downloaded from multiple databases. We searched for genes with robust prognosis by Kaplan-Meier analysis of the whole genome. CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithm was used to calculate the degree of immune cell infiltration.
RESULTS: We identified OLFML2B as a robust prognostic marker for bladder cancer in five cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a high level of OLFML2B expression had a poor prognosis. The expression of OLFML2B increased with the increase of stage and grade. We found that patients with high expression of OLFML2B still had a poor prognosis in two small bladder cancer cohorts. OLFML2B also has the prognostic ability in ten other tumors, and the prognosis is poor in high expression. The correlation analysis between OLFML2B and immune cells showed that it was positively correlated with the degree of macrophage infiltration and highly co-expressed with tumor-associated macrophage markers. Finally, the Wound-healing assay and Colony formation assay results showed that the migration and proliferation ability of bladder cancer cell lines decreased after the knockdown of OLFML2B.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, OLFML2B is a robust risk prognostic marker, and it can help patients with bladder cancer improve individualized treatment.","We appreciate the free use of TCGA, GEO, ArrayExpress databases.",,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-11-15,2021,2021-11-15,,11,,650678,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lin, Jiaxing; Xu, Xiao; Li, Tianren; Yao, Jihang; Yu, Meng; Zhu, Yuyan; Sun, Dan","Lin, Jiaxing (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Xu, Xiao (Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, The Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Li, Tianren (Department of Gynaecology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Yao, Jihang (Department of Gynaecology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Yu, Meng (Department of Reproductive Biology and Transgenic Animal, China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Zhu, Yuyan (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China); Sun, Dan (Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China)","Sun, Dan (First Hospital of China Medical University)","Lin, Jiaxing (First Hospital of China Medical University); Xu, Xiao (Sheng Jing Hospital); Li, Tianren (First Hospital of China Medical University); Yao, Jihang (First Hospital of China Medical University); Yu, Meng (China Medical University); Zhu, Yuyan (First Hospital of China Medical University); Sun, Dan (First Hospital of China Medical University)",5,4,0.41,1.28,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.650678/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142580058,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Here we evaluate TP measures as potential endophenotypes in Caribbean families ascertained from probands affected by ADHD. A total of 232 individuals were recruited and clinically evaluated using an extensive battery of neuropsychological tasks and reaction time (RT)-based task paradigms. Further, the heritability (genetic variance underpinning phenotype) was estimated as a measure of the genetics apportionment. A predictive framework for ADHD diagnosis was derived using these tasks. We found that individuals with ADHD differed from controls in neuropsychological tasks assessing mental control, visual-verbal memory, verbal fluency, verbal, and semantic fluency. In addition, TP measures such as RT, errors, and variability were also affected in individuals with ADHD. Moreover, we determined that only omission and commission errors had significant heritability. In conclusion, we have disentangled omission and commission errors as possible TP endophenotypes in ADHD, which can be suitable to assess the neurobiological and genetic basis of ADHD. A predictive model using these endophenotypes led to remarkable sensitivity, specificity, precision and classification rate for ADHD diagnosis, and may be a useful tool for patients' diagnosis, follow-up, and longitudinal assessment in the clinical setting.","We express our highest appreciation to the families enrolled in this study.

However, it is important to assess differences between urban and rural areas. This study aimed to analyze the associations between the risk of developing T2D and setting in the Colombian north coast in 2017.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1,005 subjects. Data was collected by interviewing self-identified members of an urban community and a rural-indigenous population. The interaction terms were evaluated as well as the confounders. Then, adjusted binary logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).
RESULTS: subjects with a high risk of T2D are more likely to belong to the urban setting (OR = 1.908; 95%CI = 1.201-2.01) compared with those with lower T2D after adjusting for age, Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity, history of high levels of glycemia, and diabetes in relatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Urban communities are more likely to have T2D compared with rural-indigenous populations. These populations have differences from the cultural context, including personal, and lifestyle factors.",,"This work was supported by the Colombian research support program, Colciencias, and Empresa Promigas.",Heliyon,,,,2021-12-30,2021,2021-12-30,2022-01,8,1,e08653,All OA; Gold,Article,"Molina, Rafael Tuesca; García, Ana Liliana Ríos; Vergara, Tania Acosta; Florez-Garcia, Victor Alfonso; Gutierrez, Víctor Rodríguez; Lozano, Karen Florez; Barengo, Noël C.","Molina, Rafael Tuesca (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Centro Universitario CIFE, Interdisciplinary Research Department, Cuernavaca, Mexico); García, Ana Liliana Ríos (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vergara, Tania Acosta (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Florez-Garcia, Victor Alfonso (Department of Public Health, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Joseph J.

Objective: We sought to determine if thyroid dysfunction and vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are associated with cognitive disorders among older adults with memory complaints in Lima, Peru. Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients who presented for cognitive evaluations to a multidisciplinary neurology clinic in Lima, Peru from January 2014 to February 2020. We included individuals aged ≥60 years, native Spanish-speakers, with at least a primary school educational level and a complete clinical assessment. Patients had either subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, or dementia. One-way ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: We included 720 patients (330 SCD, 154 MCI, and 236 dementia); the dementia group was significantly older [mean age SCD 69.7 ± 4.1, dementia 72.4 ± 3.7 (p = 0.000)] and had lower folate levels than SCD patients. The MCI group had higher free T3 levels compared with SCD patients. Those with lower TSH had greater dementia risk (OR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.15-6.86) but not MCI risk in unadjusted models. B12 deficiency or borderline B12 deficiency was present in 34% of the dementia group, yet no clear correlation was seen between neuropsychological test results and B12 levels in our study. There was no association between MCI or dementia and thyroid hormone, B12 nor folate levels in adjusted models. Conclusion: Our findings do not support an association between metabolic and endocrine disorders and cognitive impairment in older Peruvians from Lima despite a high prevalence of B12 deficiency. Future work may determine if cognitive decline is associated with metabolic or endocrine changes in Latin America.",,"Funding.

Various authors have proposed changes in lipid metabolism (total cholesterol decrease) as a possible biological marker for suicidal behavior. The objective of this study was to review the studies that have demonstrated a relationship between serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior and to describe the possible pathophysiological mechanisms that associate changes in cholesterol concentration and suicidal behavior. Relevant literature related to serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior was identified through various database searches. The data from the existing literature present the findings that relate low cholesterol levels and possible pathophysiological mechanisms (neuroinflammation, serotonergic neurotransmission), genes related to cholesterol synthesis, pharmacological treatments that alter lipid metabolism and the possible participation in suicidal behavior. Nevertheless, future research is required to describe how serum cholesterol affects cholesterol metabolism in the CNS to establish and understand the role of cholesterol in suicidal behavior.",,This research received no external funding.,Biomedicines,,"Marta Rodríguez-Arias, Carmen Ferrer-Perez",,2021-10-28,2021,2021-10-28,,9,11,1559,All OA; Gold,Article,"González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz; Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia; León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia; Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín; Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther; Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso; López-Narváez, María Lilia; Marín-Medina, Alejandro; Nicolini, Humberto; Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina; Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel","González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Jalpa de Méndez, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Jalpa de Méndez 86205, Tabasco, Mexico;, thelma.glez.castro@gmail.com, (T.B.G.-C.);, yazmin.hdez.diaz@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.)); Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia (Departamento de Genética Psiquiátrica, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México 14610, Mexico;, adgenis@inmegen.gob.mx); León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Comalcalco, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Comalcalco 86650, Tabasco, Mexico;, ivanniaescalante10@gmail.com); Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Jalpa de Méndez, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Jalpa de Méndez 86205, Tabasco, Mexico;, thelma.glez.castro@gmail.com, (T.B.G.-C.);, yazmin.hdez.diaz@gmail.com, (Y.H.-D.)); Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.)); Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (División Académica Multidisciplinaria de Comalcalco, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Comalcalco 86650, Tabasco, Mexico;, ivanniaescalante10@gmail.com); López-Narváez, María Lilia (Secretaría de Salud de Chiapas, Hospital Chiapas Nos Une “Dr. Gilberto Gómez Maza”, Tuxtla Gutiérrez 29045, Chiapas, Mexico;, dralilialonar@yahoo.com.mx); Marín-Medina, Alejandro (Universidad de Guadalajara, CUCS, Guadalajara 44340, Jalisco, Mexico;, stat5A@hotmail.com); Nicolini, Humberto (Departamento de Genética Psiquiátrica, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México 14610, Mexico;, adgenis@inmegen.gob.mx); Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.)); Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel (División Académica de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco, Villahermosa 86100, Tabasco, Mexico;, iselajuarezrojop@hotmail.com, (I.E.J.-R.);, gianninaavila2012@hotmail.com, (R.G.C.-A.);, angel_mar@live.com.mx, (M.Á.R.-M.))","Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Nicolini, Humberto (National Institute of Genomic Medicine)","González-Castro, Thelma Beatriz (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia (National Institute of Genomic Medicine); León-Escalante, Dulce Ivannia (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Hernández-Díaz, Yazmín (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos Alfonso (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); López-Narváez, María Lilia (Secretaría de Salud de Chiapas, Hospital Chiapas Nos Une “Dr. Gilberto Gómez Maza”, Tuxtla Gutiérrez 29045, Chiapas, Mexico;, dralilialonar@yahoo.com.mx); Marín-Medina, Alejandro (University of Guadalajara); Nicolini, Humberto (National Institute of Genomic Medicine); Castillo-Avila, Rosa Giannina (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco); Ramos-Méndez, Miguel Ángel (Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco)",7,6,0.39,1.46,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/9/11/1559/pdf?version=1635416974,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143007229,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,3 Good Health and Well Being

Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) age of onset (ADAOO) is crucial to investigate potential treatments, follow-up, and therapeutic interventions. Although genetic and non-genetic factors affecting ADAOO were elucidated by other research groups and ours, the comprehensive and sequential application of ML to provide an exact estimation of the actual ADAOO, instead of a high-confidence-interval ADAOO that may fall, remains to be explored. Here, we assessed the performance of ML algorithms for predicting ADAOO using two AD cohorts with early-onset familial AD and with late-onset sporadic AD, combining genetic and demographic variables. Performance of ML algorithms was assessed using the root mean squared error (RMSE), the R-squared (R2), and the mean absolute error (MAE) with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. For predicting ADAOO in familial AD, boosting-based ML algorithms performed the best. In the sporadic cohort, boosting-based ML algorithms performed best in the training data set, while regularization methods best performed for unseen data. ML algorithms represent a feasible alternative to accurately predict ADAOO with little human intervention. Future studies may include predicting the speed of cognitive decline in our cohorts using ML.",We express our highest appreciation to all patients and their relatives enrolled in this study for more than 30 years.,"L.A.S. was financed by COLCIENCIAS and the Department of Atlántico, project “Desarrollo, Implementación y Comparación de Modelos Genómicos de Predicción para la Edad de Inicio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer”, grant #809-2018.

In this retrospective study, for the first time, PSCC resection specimens (N = 103) were annotated into the following compartments: intratumoral tumor (IT Tumor), intratumoral stroma (IT Stroma), peritumoral tumor (PT Tumor) and peritumoral stroma (PT Stroma) compartments. We then quantified CD14+, CD68+ and CD163+ myeloid cells within these compartments using an image analysis software and assessed their association with various clinical parameters, including high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) status. In the total cohort, hrHPV status, grade of differentiation, age and tumor size were associated with myeloid cell densities. hrHPV+ tumors had higher infiltration rates of CD14+, CD68+ and CD163+ myeloid cells in the IT tumor compartment (p < 0.001, for all) compared to hrHPV- tumors. Furthermore, when examining the association between compartment-specific infiltration and differentiation grade, increased myeloid cell densities in the IT tumor compartment were associated with a more advanced histological grade (p < 0.001, for all). This association remained significant when the hrHPV- cohort (N = 60) was analyzed (CD14+ p = 0.001; CD68+ p < 0.001; CD163+ p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis in the hrHPV+ group (N = 43) showed that high infiltration rates of CD68+ and CD163+ cells in the PT tumor compartment were associated with lymph node (LN) metastasis (p = 0.031 and p = 0.026, respectively). Regarding the association between myeloid cell densities and disease-specific survival, the risk of death was found to decrease slightly as the number of myeloid cells in the IT tumor compartment increased (CD14+ p = 0.04; CD68+ p = 0.05; CD163+ p = 0.02). However, after adjusting for hrHPV, no independent association between myeloid densities and disease-specific survival were found. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of assessing myeloid cell densities within the spatial context of the tumor. Further studies are needed to unravel the specific phenotype of myeloid cells residing in the different compartments, their effect on clinical parameters and the impact of hrHPV on the recruitment of myeloid cell populations in PSCC.",,,Frontiers in Immunology,,,"Biomarkers; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Disease Susceptibility; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myeloid Cells; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Papillomavirus Infections; Penile Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment",2021-06-14,2021,2021-06-14,,12,,682030,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rafael, Tynisha S.; de Vries, Hielke M.; Ottenhof, Sarah R.; Hofland, Ingrid; Broeks, Annegien; de Jong, Jeroen; Bekers, Elise; Horenblas, Simon; de Menezes, Renée X.; Jordanova, Ekaterina S.; Brouwer, Oscar R.","Rafael, Tynisha S.

Evidence shows that ED and INTP are associated with comorbidities. The relationship between these variables has not been the focus of studies on young people from Northern Chile. Children and adolescents are considered as an at-risk group, since they have been found to experience greater vulnerability to psychological problems than other age groups within the population and given the scarcity of studies in Chile, it is necessary to study the relationship between these variables.MethodsThis study analyzed the relationship between ED and INTP in Chilean high school students aged 12 to 18 years using Pearson's correlation. This is a non-experimental and transactional correlational study. We included 2277 students belonging to the public, government-subsidized, and private educational establishments in Northern Chile. The Child and Adolescent Evaluation System [Sistema de Evaluación de Niños y Adolescentes (SENA)] was used to detect a range of INTP, as well as ED. The Brief Self-Control Scale was used in this study.ResultsA strong and direct correlation of the eating disorder variable with depression and anxiety was found. Additionally, significant differences were observed with sex, highlighting females with a higher presence of INTP and ED.ConclusionsThere is a need to establish strategies in the school setting for detecting frequent symptomatology in adolescents with INTP and ED to achieve a timely and accessible intervention.Plain English SummarySince the symptomatology of ED is more prevalent in adolescents, this research evaluated relationships between ED and INTP in young people from Northern Chile. This research is relevant because the evidence on this topic in Chile is scarce and the relationships found could be the first research on the subject and serve to design an intervention plan at the school level in the medium and long terms. It is a non-experimental and transactional correlational study because all variables were measured at a single moment, and it sought to establish relationships between variables without assuming causality. The sample of secondary school students consisted of 2277 students, belonging to the public, subsidized, and private schools. Strong relationships were observed between INTP and ED, the strongest correlations being with the variables depression and anxiety. In addition, female participants presented greater problems in ED and INTP.",This research was funded by the ANID PIA CIE160007.,,Journal of Eating Disorders,,,,2021-09-26,2021,2021-09-26,2021-12,9,1,118,All OA; Gold,Article,"Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Urzúa, Alfonso; Flores, Jerome; Acevedo, Daniel; Lorca, Jessica Herrera; Casanova, Jenifer","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Calle Antofagasta n°1520, 1000000, Arica, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Acevedo, Daniel (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Lorca, Jessica Herrera (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Casanova, Jenifer (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá)","Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Flores, Jerome (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Acevedo, Daniel (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Lorca, Jessica Herrera (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile); Casanova, Jenifer (Escuela de Psicología Y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá & Centro Justicia Educacional CJE, Santiago, Chile)",2,1,0.38,0.75,https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40337-021-00474-w,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141405562,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

It included 2330 students between 12 and 20 years of age from educational establishments in the city of Arica. To evaluate substance use, specifically alcohol and marijuana, the Child and Adolescent Evaluation System (SENA) was used. The Everyday Discrimination scale was used to evaluate discrimination. Age and everyday discrimination can predict up to 11% of the variance in substance use. Reducing the incidence of everyday discrimination may help reduce heavy alcohol and marijuana consumption among adolescents.",,This research was funded by the ANID PIA CIE160007.

It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","We thank students of “Colegio Inglés de Talca” for their help in the fieldwork.

As an example, the relation between perceived discrimination and contextual problems-which include family, school and peer problems-among children and adolescents in Latin America has received little attention from previous studies. Further, the mediating role of ethnic identification and collective self-esteem in this relation also needs to be considered as they could be proven as protective factors for discriminatory behavior and its outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to, first, establish the relationship between perceived discrimination and contextual problems in inter-ethnic students aged 8-19 years living in Arica, Chile; and second, to identify the role that ethnic identification and collective self-esteem play within this relation. In order to investigate this matter, a cross-sectional study was carried out with 3700 students in 29 schools between the fourth year of primary education and the last year of secondary education, aged between 9-18 years, with 48.4% men and 51.6% women. The sample was divided into primary and secondary school groups. The scales utilized were the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Multi-Group Ethnic Identity Measure-Revised Scale, Collective Self-Esteem Scale and the dimensions of contextual family, school and peer problems, as well as the general index of contextual problems of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System. For data analysis, we tested a path analytic model at both the within and between levels to account for the relations between variables. In each group the models obtained an optimal fit. We found that perceived discrimination and ethnic identification were directly related to contextual problems (.23-.39), and collective self-esteem had only a mediating role. This study showed that strategized interventions focusing on ethnic identification and perceived discrimination should be utilized by schools to create a better developing environment.",This research was funded by ANID PIA CIE160007.,This research was funded by ANID PIA CIE160007.,PLOS ONE,,Daniel Romer,Adolescent; Child; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Social Discrimination,2021-02-19,2021,2021-02-19,,16,2,e0246998,All OA; Gold,Article,"Flores, Jerome; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; Quintana, Lirna; Urzúa, Alfonso; Irarrázaval, Matías","Flores, Jerome (Centro de Justicia Educacional y Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Arica y Parinacota, Chile); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Arica y Parinacota, Chile); Quintana, Lirna (Centro de Justicia Educacional y Escuela de Psicología y Filosofía, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Arica y Parinacota, Chile); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Irarrázaval, Matías (Departamento de Psiquiatría, Facultad de Medicina, Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Región Metropolitana, Chile)","Flores, Jerome (University of Tarapacá)","Flores, Jerome (University of Tarapacá); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); Quintana, Lirna (University of Tarapacá); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Irarrázaval, Matías (Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile)",5,4,0.36,1.63,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246998&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135470971,39 Education; 52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

Currently only little information on toxicity and drug interaction potential of the extracts is available. This study now evaluated the effects of two Salix cortex extracts on human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells, in view of clinically relevant CYP450 enzyme activity modulation, cytotoxicity and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Drug metabolism via the CYP450 enzyme system is considered an important parameter for the occurrence of drug-drug interactions, which can lead to toxicity, decreased pharmacological activity, and adverse drug reactions. We evaluated two different bark extracts standardized to 10 mg/ml phenolic content. Herein, extract S6 (S. pentandra, containing 8.15 mg/ml total salicylates and 0.08 mg/ml salicin) and extract B (industrial reference, containing 5.35 mg/ml total salicylates and 2.26 mg/ml salicin) were tested. Both Salix cortex extracts showed no relevant reduction in cell viability or increase in ROS production in hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells. However, they reduced CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzyme activity after 48 h at ≥25 μg/ml, this was statistically significant only for S6. CYP2C19 activity inhibition (0.5 h) was also observed at ≥25 μg/ml, mRNA expression inhibition by 48 h treatment with S6 at 25 μg/ml. In conclusion, at higher concentrations, the tested Salix cortex extracts showed a drug interaction potential, but with different potency. Given the high prevalence of polypharmacy, particularly in the elderly with chronic pain, further systematic studies of Salix species of medical interest should be conducted in the future to more accurately determine the risk of potential drug interactions.","The authors are grateful to Monika Phillip for experimental support.

This defect may allow abdominal contents to abnormally occupy the thoracic cavity, resulting in most cases in the compression of the developing lungs. Signs are typically shown during early childhood since the defect is usually present during development. In exceptional cases, however, Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia can be observed in asymptomatic adult patients, or in those whose initial diagnosis may include common respiratory pathologies such as asthma.Case presentationHere we describe the case of a 31-year-old Mestizo female patient admitted to the emergency room owing to sudden onset of pain in the left hypochondrium and in epigastrium, as well as signs of respiratory distress. Soon after admission, the patient entered cardiorespiratory arrest, and advanced cardiac life support was provided for 45 minutes without success. The patient was declared dead 1 hour 40 minutes after admission. Clinical autopsy concluded that cause of death was respiratory failure as a complication of a previously undiagnosed Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia.ConclusionsWe report an exceptional case of Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia as the cause of rapid-onset respiratory failure and death in an adult. Unfortunately, due to its unusual presentation, Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia is rarely considered among the list of differential diagnoses when admitting an adult patient with respiratory symptoms. By reporting this case, we encourage the medical community and trainees to consider diaphragmatic defects when approaching a patient with sudden onset of abdominal pain with concomitant respiratory symptoms.",Not applicable.,All funding for the analysis and report of this clinical case was provided by Universidad del Norte and Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte,Journal of Medical Case Reports,,,"Adult; Autopsy; Child, Preschool; Diaphragm; Dyspnea; Female; Hernia, Hiatal; Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital; Humans",2021-08-05,2021,2021-08-05,2021-12,15,1,424,All OA; Gold,Article,"Machado Contreras, Luis Alfonso; Retamoso Díaz, Stephanie Paola; Valencia, Gerardo; Morales, Luis Carlos; Herrera Bedoya, María José","Machado Contreras, Luis Alfonso (Medical Student, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Retamoso Díaz, Stephanie Paola (Emergency Doctor, Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Valencia, Gerardo (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Morales, Luis Carlos (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Herrera Bedoya, María José (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Pathology, Fundación Hospital Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Herrera Bedoya, María José (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)","Machado Contreras, Luis Alfonso (Universidad del Norte); Retamoso Díaz, Stephanie Paola (Universidad del Norte); Valencia, Gerardo (Universidad del Norte); Morales, Luis Carlos (Universidad del Norte); Herrera Bedoya, María José (Universidad del Norte; Universidad del Norte)",2,1,0.33,0.9,https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13256-021-02907-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140220524,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In low visibility areas, systematic subsurface testing is required, most often in the form of shovel test pits or ""STPs"". Decisions about the interval between STPs, and the size of such units, impact significantly both the effectiveness of survey for site location and the efficiency of such prospection efforts, and yet ""cookie-cutter"" survey strategies are often employed without a thorough examination of their costs and benefits. In this work, we present a simulation-based method (DIGSS, Determination of Intervals using Georeferenced Survey Simulation) by which archaeologists can simulate the effectiveness and efficiency of different survey strategies for both prospective and retrospective applications. Beyond permitting the design and implementation of survey strategies that both maximize the possibility of site detection in a given region and that husband precious resources (money and time), this method permits the generation of post hoc correction factors that make direct comparison of previous surveys possible. While DIGSS was designed with archaeological applications (artifacts and sites) in mind, it has potential ramifications in other fields of study where discrete spatial sampling is used as a means of determining the presence, absence, or abundance of discontinuous assemblages materials of interest in a survey region.

Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects.

The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners.","This research was funded by Universidad de Antioquia (CODI 2015-7857; sostenibilidad), Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia (INV2732) and Corporación Universitaria Remington.

Solid complexes were separated from water by vacuum filtration, and factors such as lime/sodium carbonate ratio, kaolin content, flocculation time, and flocculant dose are evaluated. The growth of the aggregates was captured in situ by a focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) probe. Solid magnesium and calcium complexes are formed in raw seawater at pH 11, impairing the performance of flocculant polymers based on polyacrylamides. The results show that the settling rate improved when the treatment's lime/sodium carbonate ratio increased. That is, when a greater removal of magnesium is prioritized over calcium. The amount of magnesium required to be removed depends on the mineralogy of the system: more clay will require more significant removal of magnesium. These results respond to the structural changes of the flocs, achieving that the more magnesium is removed, the greater the size and density of the aggregates. In contrast, calcium removal does not significantly influence flocculant performance. The study suggests the necessary conditions for each type of tailing to maximize water recovery, contributing to the effective closure of the water cycle in processes that use seawater with magnesium control.","Ricardo I.

METHODS: We made a cross-sectional study of psychometric evaluation conducted between January 2019 and February 2020. It involved the voluntary and anonymous participation of 316 health professionals and administrative workers from 17 health centers in Peru, who were administered the 22-item psychological violence scale. In addition, three other instruments were used to assess convergent and discriminative validity.
RESULTS: In contrast to other findings using similar instruments, the item composition of the abbreviated psychological violence scale converges on three components that assess isolation, intimidation, and belittling violence. This validation provides evidence of good fit in criterion and construct, explaining 66.7% of the accumulated variance and up to 54.3% when the final version is reduced to 13 items and three factors. The data reflect a high inverse association between psychological violence and intrinsic job satisfaction.

This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the survival of teeth treated with a non-restorative cavity control (NRCC) compared to resin composite restorations (RCR) on proximal carious lesion in anterior primary teeth, as well as the impact of these treatments on patient-centered outcomes.MethodsA randomized clinical trial with two parallels arms (1:1) will be conducted. Children between 3 and 6 years old will be selected from the Center of Clinic Research of Pediatric Dentistry of Ibirapuera University (UNIB), a dental trailer (FOUSP) located on Educational Complex Professor Carlos Osmarinho de Lima, the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of Santa Cecília University and from the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of University Center UNINOVAFAPI. One hundred and forty-eight teeth will be randomly distributed in two experimental groups: (1) Selective removal of carious tissue and RCR; or (2) NRCC through cavity enlargement using a metallic sandpaper. The primary outcome will be tooth survival after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The duration and the cost of dental treatments will be considered for the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the evaluated treatments. The discomfort reported by the participants will be measured after each treatment using the FIS scale. The participants’ satisfaction and perception of the parents/legal guardians will be evaluated through questionnaires. For the primary outcome, Kaplan–Meier’s survival and Long-Rank test will be used for comparison between the two groups. All the variables will be modeled by Cox regression with shared fragility. Significance will be considered at 5%.DiscussionThe NRCC could be an option to manage carious lesions on proximal surfaces of primary teeth, and the approach could be well accepted by the children and parents/legal guardians.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT03785730, Registered on December 18th 2018, first participant recruited 30/04/2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03785730.Ethics Reference No: 91569118.8.0000.5597.Trial Sponsor: Universidade Ibirapuera.The Trial was prospectively registered.","The authors would like to thank the CEPECO Collaborative Group, Pediatric dental clinic of Uninorte and UNINOVAFAPI, and pediatric dentists of dental care trailer of FOUSP for all support to perform of the study.",FundingNone.

However, data regarding the impact of chronic gestational hypobaric hypoxia on α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in the neonatal life has not been studied. We evaluated if gestation under chronic hypobaric hypoxia modifies α1-adrenergic vasoconstrictor function in NBLL and NBSH. We compared the vasoconstrictor response induced by potassium and α-adrenergic stimuli in isolated small femoral arteries of NBLL and NBSH gestated at high altitude (HA; 3,600 m) or low altitude (LA; 580 m). The maximal contraction (R MAX) and potency (EC50) to potassium, noradrenaline (NA), and phenylephrine (PHE) were larger in HA-NBLL than LA-NBLL. R MAX to potassium, NA, and PHE were lower in HA-NBSH when compared with LA-NBSH and potency results were similar. Competitive blockade with prazosin showed that RNLL LA/HA have a similar pA2. In contrast, NBSH had increased pA2 values in HA when compared with LA. Finally, small femoral arteries denudated or treated with LNAME in LA and HA lacked NO or endothelium participation in response to PHE stimulation. In contrast, NBSH displayed that denudation or blockade with LNAME support NO or endothelium participation in response to PHE activation. In conclusion, HA chronic hypoxia enhances α1 adrenergic receptor activity in small femoral arteries in NBLL to a higher degree than NBSH, implying a higher vasoconstriction function.",The authors thank Dr. César E.

The San Gregorio Formation, the younger unit of the Urumaco Sequence, preserves a fauna that documents this critical transition. We report stingrays, freshwater bony fishes, amphibians, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, aquatic and terrestrial turtles, and mammals. A total of 49 taxa are reported from the Vergel Member (late Pliocene) and nine taxa from the Cocuiza Member (Early Pleistocene), with 28 and 18 taxa reported for the first time in the Urumaco sequence and Venezuela, respectively. Our findings include the first fossil record of the freshwater fishes Megaleporinus, Schizodon, Amblydoras, Scorpiodoras, and the pipesnake Anilius scytale, all from Pliocene strata. The late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene ages proposed here for the Vergel and Cocuiza members, respectively, are supported by their stratigraphic position, palynology, nannoplankton, and 86Sr/88Sr dating. Mammals from the Vergel Member are associated with the first major pulse of the Great American Biotic Interchange. In contrast to the dry conditions prevailing today, the San Gregorio Formation documents mixed open grassland/forest areas surrounding permanent freshwater systems, following the isolation of the northern South American basin from western Amazonia. These findings support the hypothesis that range contraction of many taxa to their current distribution in northern South America occurred rapidly during at least the last 1.5 million years.","The authors thank all the institutions mentioned in the methods section for their valuable support and access to study fossil and extant comparative collections.

However, paraffin particles have been observed to escape from the silica matrix when water is added. There are only limited data on how the use of such PCM affects the behaviour of mortars. To evaluate the effect of this PCM addition, Portland mortar mixtures were elaborated with 5%, 10% and 15% of PCM content, and using CEM 42.5 I R and CEM I 52.5 R cement types. Physical properties such as density, open porosity, air content and water absorption were analysed for fresh and dry samples. The results obtained show that the PCM-added mixtures require greater water and cement amounts than the standard mortar mixtures to achieve similar compressive strengths. Compared to non-PCM mixtures the PCM-added mortars present a density lowering of 37% for fresh mixtures and near 45% for dry state forms. A maximum compressive strength of 15.9 MPa was reached for 15% PCM mixtures, while values beyond 40 MPa were achieved for 5% PCM mixtures. Thus, the proposed study contributes to broad the available knowledge of PCM cement mortar mixtures behaviour and their mix design.",,"The research of Vicente Zetola Vargas was partially supported by the Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT) through the Programa Becas Chile, Ministerio de Educación, Gobierno de Chile.",Materials,,,,2021-02-15,2021,2021-02-15,,14,4,921,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zetola, Vicente; Claros-Marfil, Luis J.; Santos, Alfonso García; González, Fco.

We use present-day relationships between fecal pellet diameters from ashy chinchilla rats (Abrocoma cinerea) and mean annual rainfall to reconstruct the timing and magnitude of pluvials (wet episodes) spanning the past 16,000 years in the Atacama Desert based on 81 14C-dated A. cinerea paleomiddens. A transient climate simulation shows that pluvials identified at 15.9 to 14.8, 13.0 to 8.6, and 8.1 to 7.6 ka B.P. can be linked to North Atlantic (high-latitude) forcing (e.g., Heinrich Stadial 1, Younger Dryas, and Bond cold events). Holocene pluvials at 5.0 to 4.6, 3.2 to 2.1, and 1.4 to 0.7 ka B.P. are not simulated, implying low-latitude internal variability forcing (i.e., ENSO regime shifts). These results help constrain future central Andean hydroclimatic variability and hold promise for reconstructing past climates from rodent middens in desert ecosystems worldwide.","We thank the many colleagues, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as laboratory technicians who helped collect middens in the field, prepared samples in the laboratory, and helped to measure rodent pellets.

Educational System versus Associations","This article analyzes health mediation among equals as an educational strategy against risk behaviors in young people from both the educational and associative systems in Seville (Spain), based on qualitative research, with the aim of assessing and comparing its impact in those areas. To this end, interviews with 49 professionals and 427 adolescents were conducted in discussion groups. Results acknowledge mediation as individual or group intervention accepted by young people as advice and information on health issues and conflict resolution, but also as a method for data collection in order to obtain a community health diagnosis. The educational system implements this strategy, but in associations it seems to work better, particularly in the psycho-emotional and sexual spheres. Unfortunately, intervention programs are usually discontinuous due to lack of resources and territorial variability. And this is why mediators' support is highly valued by the target users, with preference for a male figure in the case of boys, and larger predisposition towards a female mediator in girls, except in cases where this agent has a special social relevance.",The authors would like to thank all the participants who took part in this study.,The APC was partially funded by financial support for the consolidation of research groups by the Andalusia Regional Government.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Negotiating; Qualitative Research; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Spain,2021-01-30,2021,2021-01-30,2021-02-01,18,3,1249,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barbero-Radío, Antonio Manuel; Muñoz, María Ángeles García-Carpintero; González-López, José Rafael","Barbero-Radío, Antonio Manuel (Servicio de Salud del Ayuntamiento de Sevilla, Calle Fray Isidoro de Sevilla 1, 41009 Sevilla, Spain;, abarbero@sevilla.org; Department of Nursing, Faculty of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Podiatry, Universidad de Sevilla, C/Avenzoar nº6, 41009 Seville, Spain;, joserafael@us.es); Muñoz, María Ángeles García-Carpintero (Department of Nursing, Faculty of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Podiatry, Universidad de Sevilla, C/Avenzoar nº6, 41009 Seville, Spain;, joserafael@us.es); González-López, José Rafael (Department of Nursing, Faculty of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Podiatry, Universidad de Sevilla, C/Avenzoar nº6, 41009 Seville, Spain;, joserafael@us.es)","Muñoz, María Ángeles García-Carpintero (University of Seville)","Barbero-Radío, Antonio Manuel (Ayuntamiento de Sevilla; University of Seville); Muñoz, María Ángeles García-Carpintero (University of Seville); González-López, José Rafael (University of Seville)",1,0,0.28,0.32,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/3/1249/pdf?version=1612443439,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135012989,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

In this framework, the research aimed to assess the mediating effect of ethnic identity and collective self-esteem on the inverse relationship between mental health problems and quality of life. Data were collected from 908 first-generation Colombian migrants living in Chile, of whom 50.2% were women and with an average age of 35 years. They were assessed with The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQoL)-Bref, Smith's ethnic identity questionnaire, Basabe's collective self-esteem, and Beck's Anxiety and Depression questionnaires. The results provide evidence that both collective self-esteem and ethnic identity exert a partial mediation effect on the relationship between anxiety and depression on quality of life. The study provides evidence of the protective role that the maintenance and reinforcement of ethnic identity and collective self-esteem can have, with a view to strengthening the planning of interventions both in the field of prevention of mental health problems and in the improvement of quality of life based on evidence.",,"This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, grant number FONDECYT 1180315.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Aristomenis Exadaktylos, Paul B.

Meanwhile, little is known on the role of insects in spreading foodborne pathogenic bacteria and on the impact of these pathogens on the overall insects and feeding substrate microbiome composition. Here, we provide the first characterization of the bacterial communities harbored in adult and immature stages of Lucilia sericata, one of the first colonizers of decomposed human remains, in the presence of the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica using 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing and qPCR. The pathogen transmission from the wild adults to the second generation was observed, with a 101.25× quantitative increase. The microbial patterns from both insect and liver samples were not influenced by the artificial introduction of this pathogenic foodborne bacteria, being dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Overall, our results provided a first detailed overview of the insect and decomposed substrate microbiome in the presence of a human pathogen, advancing the knowledge on the role of microbes as postmortem interval estimators and the transmission of pathogenic bacteria.","This research received partially financial support from Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (ERANET-MARTERA-MOBILTOX-2-224/2021) and Academia Româna (RO1567-IBB05/2021) Grants.",,Scientific Reports,,,Animals; Diptera; Feeding Behavior; Microbiota; Salmonella enterica,2021-07-27,2021,2021-07-27,,11,1,15296,All OA; Gold,Article,"Iancu, Lavinia; Angelescu, Iulia Roxana; Paun, Victoria Ioana; Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos; Lavin, Paris; Purcarea, Cristina","Iancu, Lavinia (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biology Bucharest of Romanian Academy, Splaiul Independentei, 296, 060031, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Criminal Justice, University of North Dakota, 58202, Grand Forks, ND, USA); Angelescu, Iulia Roxana (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biology Bucharest of Romanian Academy, Splaiul Independentei, 296, 060031, Bucharest, Romania); Paun, Victoria Ioana (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biology Bucharest of Romanian Academy, Splaiul Independentei, 296, 060031, Bucharest, Romania); Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, 1781421, Coquimbo, Chile; Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1781421, Coquimbo, Chile); Lavin, Paris (Departamento de Biotecnología, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar y Recursos Biológicos, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile; Laboratorio de Complejidad Microbiana y Ecología Funcional, Instituto Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Purcarea, Cristina (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biology Bucharest of Romanian Academy, Splaiul Independentei, 296, 060031, Bucharest, Romania)","Iancu, Lavinia (Romanian Academy; University of North Dakota)","Iancu, Lavinia (Romanian Academy; University of North Dakota); Angelescu, Iulia Roxana (Romanian Academy); Paun, Victoria Ioana (Romanian Academy); Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina, Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, 1781421, Coquimbo, Chile; Catholic University of the North); Lavin, Paris (University of Antofagasta; Laboratorio de Complejidad Microbiana y Ecología Funcional, Instituto Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Purcarea, Cristina (Romanian Academy)",4,3,0.28,0.79,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94761-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139967690,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology",

METHODS: Analytic cross-sectional study conducted with 51 patients hospitalized in the Hemato-Oncology Unit at Hospital Base Valdivia, Chile. A survey containing sociodemographic and clinical information was applied together with the questionnaire on Perception of Behaviors of Humanized Nursing Care 3rd version"" -PBHNC 3v (32 items distributed in the categories: Qualities of nursing work, Openness to nurse-patient communication, and Willingness to care).
RESULTS: Of the participants, 51% were women, with mean age of 46.5±16.6 years; 54.9% were diagnosed with Lymphoma and 78.4% were in the treatment induction stage. In 30 of the 32 items of the instrument, > 90% of the participants evaluated compliance with the behavior of caring at level of ""always"". By categories, it was observed that for ""Willingness to care"" there was significantly lower score among patients from 18 to 49 years of age (p=0.0455). For the category ""Openness to nurse-patient communication"" lower median score existed in patients with Myeloma (p=0.0043) and in patients in the Remission-Consolidation stage (p=0.0084). Days of hospitalization were associated significantly with the category ""Willingness to care"", being lower with 16 days and more (p=0.0242).

KS type 1 is caused by mutations in KMT2D (OMIM: #147920) and is more common. KS type 2 is caused by mutations in KDM6A (OMIM: #300867). Both genes encode proteins that modify histones and are involved in epigenetic regulation. The enzyme histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D, the product of KMT2D, is expressed in most adult tissues and is essential for early embryonic development. The main clinical manifestations of KS include dysmorphic facial features, such as elongated palpebral fissures, eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelids, and short nasal columella with a broad and depressed nasal tip. Additionally, patients also present with skeletal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic features, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, hearing loss, and postnatal growth deficiency. We describe an 11-year-old girl from Colombia, who presented with characteristic clinical signs of KS. Genetic studies showed a KMT2D intronic variant (KMT2D NM_003482.3: c.511-2A> T) as a cause of KS.","All forms of support and funding for study design, data collection, data analysis and manuscript writing were provided by the employers of the authors (Universidad Icesi and Fundación Valle del Lili).

METHODS: Data of 207 patients referred to endodontic treatment at undergraduate Dental Schools of Brazil were collected over a period of 8 months. Patient-related data included age, gender, first dental visit, tooth brushing frequency, number of remaining teeth, and previous endodontic treatment, and tooth-related information regarding number, type, and location in the mouth of teeth that need RCT, waiting time for the endodontic treatment, endodontic diagnosis, pain report, and dental crown condition was collected for each participant. Bivariate analysis (Chi-square test; p < 0.05) associated gender and tooth/patient-related conditions. Poisson regression analysis compared multiple endodontic need and exposure variables.
RESULTS: Patients were mainly comprised of women (65.2%), aged 18-39 years (69.6%). Previous RCT was significantly more prevalent in women when compared to men (p=0.005). First dental visit at later moment (after 20 years of age) demonstrated 400% greater prevalence of multiple RCT demand when compared to patients that attended the dental office at age below seven years (p=0.032). Most of the patients presented only one tooth needing RCT (80.2%), mainly premolars (44.9%). Interestingly, women underwent more RCT in maxillary teeth (p=0.016) and significantly contributed with their report to the diagnosis process when compared to men (p=0.014). Regarding dental crown condition, 45.4% of all teeth registered unsatisfactory restorations, which were more pronounced in female patients (p=0.018). Unsatisfactory restorations or dental caries had 75% and 82%, respectively, less prevalence of multiple RCT indication when compared to sound dental crown (p=0.001).

Mortality scores are important as they can help health care professionals to plan treatment as per the patients' condition for proper resource allocation. When it comes to patients, it provides invaluable information for implementing advance directives. The aim of the study is to validate mortality scores for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methodology This was a retrospective cohort study that included data from three tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Data of patients diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 infection and hospitalized in Ziauddin Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, and Liaquat National Hospital were enrolled in the study from November 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. Data was extracted from the hospital management information system (HMIS) using a structured questionnaire. Results Overall, 835 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients was 53.29 (SD ± 15.17) years, and 675 patients (80.72%) were males. The sensitivity of the CALL score is highest among all four scores, i.e., 77.25%, and the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score has the lowest sensitivity (59.79%). However, CALL has the lowest specificity (58.04%), while qSOFA has the highest specificity (73.91%). However, MulBSTA and CRB-65 have a sensitivity of 70.11% and 64.96%, respectively. Conclusion The current study showed that the CALL score had better sensitivity as compared to other mortality scores.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-12-27,2021,2021-12-27,2021-12-27,13,12,e20751,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jilanee, Daniyal; Khan, Shamshad; Shah, Syed Muhammad Huzaifa; Capriles, Natalia M.

Assays of the expression profiles of multiple genes increase the probability of overexpression of certain genes and thus can potentially characterize the risk of metastasis.
METHODS: We propose a 20-gene classifier for predicting patients with high/low risk of recurrence within 5 years. Gene expression levels from a quantitative PCR assay were used to screen 473 luminal breast cancer patients treated at Taiwan Hospital (positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Gene expression scores, along with clinical information (age, tumor stage, and nodal stage), were evaluated for risk prediction. The classifier could correctly predict patients with and without relapse (logistic regression, P<0.05).
RESULTS: A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the 20-gene panel was prognostic with hazard ratios of 5.63 (95% confidence interval 2.77-11.5, univariate) and 5.56 (2.62-11.8, multivariate) for the ""genetic"" model, and of 8.02 (3.52-18.3, univariate) and 19.8 (5.96-65.87, multivariate) for the ""clinicogenetic"" model during a 5-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 20-gene classifier can successfully separate the patients into two risk groups, and the two risk group had significantly different relapse rate and prognosis. This 20-gene classifier can provide better estimation of prognosis, which can help physicians to make better personalized treatment plans.",,The research grants were from the Amwise Diagnostics Pte.

An important assumption when comparing values across gender in dyadic research is that both partners conceptualize the construct under investigation in the same way. Thus, issues of measurement invariance should be considered when working with dyadic data. The aim of the present study was to test the dyadic invariance of the Positive Sexuality Scale (PSS) to assess an individual's sense of happiness and fulfillment with his/her sexual expression. The PSS was completed by 166 Chilean heterosexual couples, and measurement invariance was tested using confirmatory factor analysis within a dyadic framework. Configural, metric, scalar, and partial strict measurement invariance were supported for the PSS original one-factor model. No between-partner difference was found in the PSS latent factor mean. The functioning of the PSS and the meaning attributed to positive sexuality were the same for both partners. Hence, variations in the PSS levels between both partners in heterosexual couples can be interpreted as true mean differences rather than measurement artifacts.",,"This research was funded by the National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development of Chile, FONDECYT 1190240.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Chile; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Happiness; Heterosexuality; Male; Personal Satisfaction",2021-01-29,2021,2021-01-29,2021-02-01,18,3,1190,All OA; Gold,Article,"Casu, Giulia; Guzmán-González, Mónica; Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo; Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia; Barrientos, Jaime; Gómez, Fabiola","Casu, Giulia (Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, 40127 Bologna, Italy;, giulia.casu3@unibo.it); Guzmán-González, Mónica (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile;, respinoza@ucn.cl); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile;, respinoza@ucn.cl); Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia (Department of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Maule, 3460000 Talca, Chile;, lgarrido@ucm.cl); Barrientos, Jaime (Faculty of Psychology, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, 8340575 Santiago, Chile;, jbarrientos@uahurtado.cl); Gómez, Fabiola (School of Psychology, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, 7691043 Santiago, Chile;, fagomez3@uc.cl)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)","Casu, Giulia (University of Bologna); Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Espinoza-Tapia, Ricardo (Catholic University of the North); Garrido-Rojas, Lusmenia (Catholic University of the Maule); Barrientos, Jaime (Alberto Hurtado University); Gómez, Fabiola (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)",3,2,0.25,2.57,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/3/1190/pdf?version=1612166467,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134999492,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are common in individuals with HIV-1 Infection, and represent a recent public health problem. Here we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed short protocol for detecting HAND by studying 60 individuals with HIV-1-Infection and 60 seronegative controls from a Caribbean community in Barranquilla, Colombia. The short evaluation protocol used significant neuropsychological tests from a previous study of asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients and a group of seronegative controls. Brief screening instruments, i.e., the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), were also applied. Using machine-learning techniques, we derived predictive models of HAND status, and evaluated their performance with the ROC curves. The proposed short protocol performs exceptionally well yielding sensitivity, specificity, and overall prediction values >90%, and better predictive capacity than that of the MMSE and IHDS. Community-specific cut-off values for HAND diagnosis, based on the MMSE and IHDS, make this protocol suitable for HAND screening in individuals from this Caribbean community. This study shows the effectivity of a recently proposed short protocol to detect HAND in individuals with asymptomatic HIV-1-Infection. The application of community-specific cut-off values for HAND diagnosis in the clinical setting may improve HAND screening accuracy and facilitate patients' treatment and follow-up. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of this protocol in other Latin American populations.","We express our highest sentiment of appreciation to all patients and their families who voluntarily participated.

ABC1,"Members of the genus Pseudomonas inhabit diverse environments, such as soil, water, plants and humans. The variability of habitats is reflected in the diversity of the structure and composition of their genomes. This cosmopolitan bacterial genus includes species of biotechnological, medical and environmental importance. In this study, we report on the most relevant genomic characteristics of Pseudomonas sp. strain ABC1, a siderophore-producing fluorescent strain recently isolated from soil. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that this strain corresponds to a novel species forming a sister clade of the recently proposed Pseudomonas kirkiae. The genomic information reveals an overrepresented repertoire of mechanisms to hoard iron when compared to related strains, including a high representation of fecI-fecR family genes related to iron regulation and acquisition. The genome of the Pseudomonas sp. ABC1 contains the genes for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) of a novel putative Azotobacter-related pyoverdine-type siderophore, a yersiniabactin-type siderophore and an antimicrobial betalactone; the last two are found only in a limited number of Pseudomonas genomes. Strain ABC1 can produce siderophores in a low-cost medium, and the supernatants from cultures of this strain promote plant growth, highlighting their biotechnological potential as a sustainable industrial microorganism.","Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation of Chile under the grant ANID FONDECYT/POSTDOCTORADO 3180762 and ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

It is foreseen that bioleaching will play a complementary role in either concentration-as it does in Minera Escondida Ltd. (MEL)-or chloride main leaching plants. In that way, it will be possible to maximize mines with installed solvent-extraction and electrowinning capacities that have not been operative since the depletion of their oxide ores. One of the main obstacles for widening bioleaching technology applications is the lack of knowledge about the key events and the attributes of the technology's critical events at the industrial level and mainly in ROM copper bioleaching industrial operations. It is relevant to assess the bed environment where the bacteria-mineral interaction occurs to learn about the limiting factors determining the leaching rate. Thus, due to inability to accurately determine in-situ key variables, their indirect assessment was evaluated by quantifying microbial metabolic-associated responses. Several candidate marker genes were selected to represent the predominant components of the microbial community inhabiting the industrial heap and the metabolisms involved in microbial responses to changes in the heap environment that affect the process performance. The microbial community's predominant components were Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, At. thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus sp. Oxygen reduction, CO2 and N2 fixation/uptake, iron and sulfur oxidation, and response to osmotic stress were the metabolisms selected regarding research results previously reported in the system. After that, qPCR primers for each candidate gene were designed and validated. The expression profile of the selected genes vs. environmental key variables in pure cultures, column-leaching tests, and the industrial bioleaching heap was defined. We presented the results obtained from the industrial validation of the marker genes selected for assessing CO2 and N2 availability, osmotic stress response, as well as ferrous iron and sulfur oxidation activity in the bioleaching heap process of MEL. We demonstrated that molecular markers are useful for assessing limiting factors like nutrients and air supply, and the impact of the quality of recycled solutions. We also learned about the attributes of variables like CO2, ammonium, and sulfate levels that affect the industrial ROM-scale operation.","We acknowledge Minera Escondida Ltd. for providing the data and the samples for this research, Víctor Zepeda, Pedro Galleguillos, and Ing.

The best description of the CHIKV transmission during pregnancy can be found in a well-documented epidemic in 2005, in the ""La Reunion"" island, a French territory located in the Indian Ocean, in which about one-third of the population was infected. Reports of arbovirus infections in pregnancy are increasing over time, but the spectrum of clinical findings remains an incognita among researchers, including CHIKV.
PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, it was possible to verify 2 cases exposed to CHIKV during foetal period and the possible implications of the infection on gestational structures and exposed children after the birth.
DIAGNOSIS: In both cases, the mothers were positive by laboratory tests in serologic analysis for CHIKV, as ezyme-linked immunossorbent assay (ELISA), plaque reduction neutralisation testing (PRNT) and immunofluorescence (IF); but there were no positive tests in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for mothers or children.
INTERVENTIONS: The exposed children were followed up in a paediatrics clinic in order not only to provide the medical assistance, but also to verify child development and the possible implications and neurocognitive changes caused by gestational infection.
OUTCOMES: There were neurological and developmental changes in one of the children followed up on an outpatient basis. There was an improvement in the neurological situation and symptoms only 3 years and 1 month after birth.
LESSONS: Based on the cases presented, we can conclude that clinical symptoms of CHIKV maternal infection may occur late in new-borns and can affect their development.",,,Medicine,,,"Antibodies, Viral; Chikungunya Fever; Chikungunya virus; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Continuity of Patient Care; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Psychomotor Disorders; Serologic Tests; Time",2021-04-30,2021,2021-04-30,2021-04-30,100,17,e25695,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fajardo, Thamirys Cosmo Grillo; Gazeta, Rosa Estela; Catalan, Daniel Thome; Mello, Alexandra Siqueira; da Silva, Andrea Cristina Botelho; Bertozzi, Ana Paula Antunes Pascalicchio; Dos Santos, Geovane Ribeiro; Pinto, Clóvis Antonio Lopes; Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira; Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Passos, Saulo Duarte","Fajardo, Thamirys Cosmo Grillo (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Gazeta, Rosa Estela (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Catalan, Daniel Thome (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Mello, Alexandra Siqueira (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); da Silva, Andrea Cristina Botelho (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Bertozzi, Ana Paula Antunes Pascalicchio (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Dos Santos, Geovane Ribeiro (Department of Morphology and Pathology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Pinto, Clóvis Antonio Lopes (Pathology Department, AC Camargo Cancer Center); Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Durigon, Edison Luiz (Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.); Passos, Saulo Duarte (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine; Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine)","Passos, Saulo Duarte (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine; Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine)","Fajardo, Thamirys Cosmo Grillo (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Gazeta, Rosa Estela (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Catalan, Daniel Thome (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Mello, Alexandra Siqueira (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); da Silva, Andrea Cristina Botelho (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Bertozzi, Ana Paula Antunes Pascalicchio (Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Dos Santos, Geovane Ribeiro (Department of Morphology and Pathology, Jundiaí School of Medicine); Pinto, Clóvis Antonio Lopes (Pathology Department, AC Camargo Cancer Center); Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira (Universidade de São Paulo); Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna (Universidade de São Paulo); Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal (Universidade de São Paulo); Durigon, Edison Luiz (Universidade de São Paulo); Passos, Saulo Duarte (Laboratory of Paediatric Infectology, Jundiaí School of Medicine; Department of Paediatric, Jundiaí School of Medicine)",2,1,0.23,1.17,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025695,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137544495,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

Estudio multicéntrico de pruebas diagnósticas.,"Introduction: There are no sensitive or specific tests available to diagnose systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).
Objective: To assess the utility as diagnostic tests of total ferritin (TF) levels greater than 5 times the normal value (TF>5N) and the decreased percentage (less than or equal to 20% of TF) of glycosylated ferritin (GF≤20%) for the diagnosis of sJIA in patients with fever of unknown origin evaluated by pediatric rheumatology.
Materials and methods: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of diagnostic tests in children under 16 years of age hospitalized between 2010 and 2014. The reference diagnostic standard was the fulfillment of the classification criteria or confirmed diagnosis at follow-up. We determined the measures of utility of the tests.
Results: We included 40 patients with fever of unknown origin, 11 with sJIA, and 29 with other diagnoses. The median TF was higher in sAIJ (3992 ng/ml) versus other causes of fever of unknown origin (155 ng/ml) (p=0.0027), as well as TF>5N (90.91% versus 51.72%) (p=0.023). The percentage of GF≤20% was higher in patients with other causes of fever of unknown origin (96.5%) compared to sJIA (81.8%) (p=0.178). TF>5N had a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 48%, positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.76, and negative LR of 0.19 demonstrating greater utility for the diagnosis of sJIA than the combination of FT> 5N with GFR <20%, with a sensitivity of 81.8%, specificity of 48.3%, positive LR of 1.58, and negative LR of 0.38.
Conclusion: In patients with FUO evaluated by pediatric rheumatology, TF> 5N proved useful as a screening test for the diagnosis of sJIA.",Al Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe por el apoyo para el desarrollo de la investigación.,,Biomédica,,,"Arthritis, Juvenile; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Ferritins; Fever of Unknown Origin; Humans",2021-12-15,2021,2021-12-15,,41,4,787-804,All OA; Gold,Article,"Eraso, Ruth; Benitez, Claudia Patricia; Jaramillo, Sergio; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena; Quevedo, Augusto","Eraso, Ruth (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia); Benitez, Claudia Patricia (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia); Jaramillo, Sergio (Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Colombia); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (División Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte, División Ciencias de la Salud, Departamento de Salud Pública, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Laboratorio, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Colombia); Quevedo, Augusto (Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, Universidad de Antioquia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatría, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación, Medellin, Colombia, Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundación, Medellin, Colombia)","Eraso, Ruth (University of Antioquia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe)","Eraso, Ruth (University of Antioquia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Benitez, Claudia Patricia (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia); Jaramillo, Sergio (Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Acosta-Reyes, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Aristizábal, Beatriz Helena (Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia, Unidad de Investigación Genética Molecular, UNIGEM-Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe); Quevedo, Augusto (University of Antioquia; Hospital Universitario de San Vicente Fundación)",3,2,0.23,1.35,https://revistabiomedica.org/index.php/biomedica/article/download/5849/4897,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140860567,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

In order to determine the nutritional status of elderly populations and ensure nutritional support based on an individual approach, the implementation of the increasingly used foodomics approach is available; this approach plays a key role in personalized diets and in the optimization of diets for a population group, such as an elderly population. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) method and the Nottingham Screening Tool (NST) form were used on 50 users in a home for the elderly in northwest Croatia. A loss of body mass (BM) was statistically significantly higher for those who had the following: decreased food intake in the last week and users who had complete and partial feeding autonomy. Additionally, the obtained data on drug intake, fluid, individual nutrients, and physical activity are based on an individual approach.

We analyzed testimonies from men and women living in Antofagasta, which is considered to be one of the world's three largest mining regions. Among the main findings, power relations based on the hegemonic gender model supported by the sexual division of labor were identified, which persist in this mining area, despite progress in gender equality issues in Chile. Although there are differences between the discourses of men and women and their subjective positioning, we propose that both actively collaborate with the reproduction of social gender relations marked by male domination. We propose that the way in which couples live is associated with the organization of mining work and especially the shift system, which is central to the reproduction of the gender order with a heteropatriarchal tone.",The authors acknowledge FONDECYT 1180079.,"This research was funded by the National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development of Chile, FONDECYT 1180079.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Pasquale Caponnetto, Albert Nienhaus",Chile; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners,2021-02-01,2021,2021-02-19,2021-02-01,18,4,2027,All OA; Gold,Article,"Segovia, Jimena Silva; Pastor, Pablo Zuleta; Ravanal, Estefany Castillo; Segovia-Chinga, Tarut","Segovia, Jimena Silva (Escuela de Psicología, Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Av.

The identification of dependencies within these systems requires the analysis and assimilation of the underlying interaction patterns between all the variables that make up that system. However, this task poses a challenge when considering the compositional nature of the data coming from DNA-sequencing experiments because traditional interaction metrics (e.g., correlation) produce unreliable results when analyzing relative fractions instead of absolute abundances. The compositionality-associated challenges extend to the classification task, as it usually involves the characterization of the interactions between the principal descriptive variables of the datasets. The classification of new samples/patients into binary categories corresponding to dissimilar biological settings or phenotypes (e.g., control and cases) could help researchers in the development of treatments/drugs.ResultsHere, we develop and exemplify a new approach, applicable to compositional data, for the classification of new samples into two groups with different biological settings. We propose a new metric to characterize and quantify the overall correlation structure deviation between these groups and a technique for dimensionality reduction to facilitate graphical representation. We conduct simulation experiments with synthetic data to assess the proposed method’s classification accuracy. Moreover, we illustrate the performance of the proposed approach using Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) count tables obtained through 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from two microbiota experiments. Also, compare our method’s performance with that of two state-of-the-art methods.ConclusionsSimulation experiments show that our method achieves a classification accuracy equal to or greater than 98% when using synthetic data. Finally, our method outperforms the other classification methods with real datasets from gene sequencing experiments.","This study was financed by COLCIENCIAS grant No. 1215-5693-4635, contract 0770-2013.

However, the antioxidant behavior of its derivatives has not been well explored. In the present work, the antioxidant activity of 10 dapsone derivatives 4-substituted was determined by an evaluation in two in vitro models (DPPH radical scavenging assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power). These imine derivatives 1-10 were obtained through condensation between DDS and the corresponding aromatic aldehydes 4-substuited. Three derivatives presented better results than DDS in the determination of DPPH (2, 9, and 10). Likewise, we have three compounds with better reducing activity than dapsone (4, 9, and 10). In order to be more insight, the redox process, a conceptual DFT analysis was carried out. Molecular descriptors such as electronic distribution, the total charge accepting/donating capacity (I/A), and the partial charge accepting/donating capacity (ω+/ω-) were calculated to analyze the relative donor-acceptor capacity through employing a donor acceptor map (DAM). The DFT calculation allowed us to establish a relationship between GAPHOMO-LUMO and DAM with the observed antioxidant effects. According to the results, we concluded that compounds 2 and 3 have the lowest Ra values, representing a good antioxidant behavior observed experimentally in DPPH radical capturing. On the other hand, derivatives 4, 9, and 10 display the best reducing capacity activity with the highest ω- and Rd values. Consequently, we propose these compounds as the best antireductants in our DDS imine derivative series.","The authors thank the Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos, and CONACyT for the facilities to develop this work.","R.G.-A. thanks CONACYT for the scholarship, grant numbers 473085 and PEI-231815.

To allow its broad use by family practice physicians (FPs), it was translated from English into nine European languages (Greek, Polish, Bulgarian, Croatian, Catalan, Galician, Spanish, Italian, and French) and the translation homogeneity was confirmed. This study describes this process. Methods: First, two translators (an academic translator and an FP researcher) were recruited for the forward translation (FT). A panel of English-speaking FPs that included at least 15 experts (researchers, teachers, and practitioners) was organized in each country to finalize the FT using a Delphi procedure. Results: One or two Delphi procedure rounds were sufficient for each translation. Then, a different translator, who did not know the original version of the HSCL-25, performed a backward translation in English. An expert panel of linguists compared the two English versions. Differences were listed and a multicultural consensus group determined whether they were due to linguistic problems or to cultural differences. All versions underwent cultural check. Conclusion: All nine translations were finalized without altering the original meaning.",We would like to thank all FPs who participated in the research process throughout Europe and all trainees in Family Medicine from Brest University who participated in the research process and our proof-reader Mrs. Alex Gillman for her accurate translations.,"Funding.

It is a native Brazilian species of great economic and social importance, particularly in the Amazon region. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is the main challenge for this crop. Therefore, the present study verified whether C. siamense, an endophytic fungus infected with a mycovirus, could protect the seedlings and reduce or eliminate the characteristic symptoms. Total proteins and enzymatic activities of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs), including peroxidase (POX), chitinase (CHI), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), were quantified. Guarana seedlings of cultivar Maués were sprayed with a C. siamense conidia suspension (5.0 × 103 conidia/mL). After ten days, the seedlings were sprayed with a suspension of the phytopathogen's conidia (1.0 × 106 conidia/mL). One group of these seedlings received the fungicide indicated for this crop. The fungicide was applied twice with an interval of 15 days between applications. Negative control seedlings did not receive any treatment (except water and fertilization), and positive control seedlings were treated only with the phytopathogen. The experiment was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 in a greenhouse. The treatments were applied at an average temperature of 25°C and 85% relative humidity. Leaflets were randomly collected from each treatment group at 0, 48, 72, and 96 hours after pathogen inoculation and analyzed for total protein and enzyme production (POX, PAL, and CHI). After 28 days, the percentage of leaf lesions on the seedlings was evaluated. C. siamense inoculation reduced lesions. There were differences in total proteins and PRPs at different timepoints after inoculation, except for CHI activity, among treatments.

A new species is described from egg masses of two commercial crabs, Cancer porteri and Romaleon setosum, inhabiting the central-north Chilean coast. This is the first species of Carcinonemertes described from the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Total body length of Carcinonemertes camanchaco sp. nov. ranged from 2.38 to 4.93 and from 4.29 to 8.92 mm, in males and females, respectively. Among others, traits that distinguish this new species from other previously described congeneric species include: presence of two gonad rows on each side of the intestine, a simple (not decorated) mucus sheath, and a relatively wide stylet basis. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses distinguished this new species from all other species of Carcinonemertes with available cox1 sequences in GenBank. Prevalence and mean (± SD) intensity of C. camanchaco sp. nov. was 24% and 2.6 (± 2.07) worms per egg mass in C. porteri and 38.1% and 3.8 (± 2.4) worms per egg mass in R. setosum. The formal description of this new species represents the first step towards the understanding of this worm's impact on the health of crab fisheries in the southeastern Pacific Ocean.",Project Puente FPI-18-04 and Project Semillero 5303 of VRIIP of University of Antofagasta granted to MTG.

We hypothesized that the neurocognitive dysfunction present in KS relies on an imbalance in X-chromosome gene expression. Thus, the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern and neurocognitive X-linked gene expression were tested and correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. We evaluated 11 KS patients by (a) IQ assessment, (b) analyzing the XCI patterns using both HUMARA and ZDHHC15 gene assays, and (c) blood RT-qPCR to investigate seven X-linked genes related to neurocognitive development (GTPBP6, EIF2S3, ITM2A, HUWE1, KDM5C, GDI1, and VAMP7) and XIST in comparison with 14 (male and female) controls. Considering IQ 80 as the standard minimum reference, we verified that the variability in IQ scores in KS patients seemed to be associated with the XCI pattern. Seven individuals in the KS group presented a random X-inactivation (RXI) and lower average IQ than the four individuals who presented a skewed X-inactivation (SXI) pattern. The evaluation of gene expression showed higher GTPBP6 expression in KS patients with RXI than in controls (p = 0.0059). Interestingly, the expression of GTPBP6 in KS patients with SXI did not differ from that observed in controls. Therefore, our data suggest for the first time that GTPBP6 expression is negatively associated with full-scale IQ under the regulation of the type of XCI pattern. The SXI pattern may regulate GTPBP6 expression, thereby dampening the impairment in cognitive performance and playing a role in intelligence variability in individuals with KS, which warrants further mechanistic investigations.","We thank reported patient and their mothers for their cooperation in this study, Patricia Monteagudo, Andrea Mathez, Joao Ferro, and Julia Oliveira for the clinical follow-up of patients; Janete Cerutti and Rui Maciel for lab support.

Material and methods: Qualitative study from the focused ethnography perspective that included pregnant women over the age of 18 years, with overweight or obesity or excess weight gain during pregnancy, who attended the pre-natal care program at two public healthcare institutions belonging to the government-subsidized regime under the General Social Security System in two municipalities of the Department of Antioquia (Colombia). Thirteen individual semi-structured and three group interviews were carried out. Analysis was based on triangulation and open and axial coding.
Results: Overall, 22 pregnant women participated in the study. Five determinants of eating behavior in this population were found: low socioeconomic level that limits access to a variety of foods, social support network, health condition during previous pregnancies or during the current gestation, generic dietary and nutritional recommendations provided by healthcare staff and, finally, knowledge of the participants regarding diet and the implications of maternal overweight for the health of the mother and the child.
Conclusion: It is imperative to provide dietary and nutritional education and care based on the particular characteristics that influence the adoption of changes in eating behaviors among overweight pregnant women; prenatal care professionals must be trained to promote standardized criteria and care that is tailored to the social reality of the pregnant woman.","A las mujeres gestantes y el personal de salud que participaron en la investigación.

We determined the Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn levels in C. quitensis roots, leaves, and soils of origin using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. In January 2017, we collected samples from four geographical zones on the longitudinal gradient along which C. quitensis is distributed, starting from Punta Arenas (PAR) at the extreme south of mainland Chile and moving southwards to the Antarctic territory from King George Island (KGI) to Hannah Point Peninsula (PHA) and finally Lagotellerie Island (LAT). We used certified reference material to validate the plant tissues and soil samples we collected. The highest concentrations of metals that we measured in the soils and in the C. quitensis roots and leaves were in samples we collected at the KGI station, the zone with the greatest human activity. The lowest concentrations we measured were at the LAT station, an island with little human intervention and scarce fauna. The mean concentrations of metals in the roots and leaves of C. quitensis followed a similar order at all sampling locations: Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cd. In contrast, in soil, they followed the following order: Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cd. The concentration levels obtained for the different metals in the soil and plants tissue samples in this region of Antarctica indicated that the area was non-polluted. However, the metallic trace element (MTE) concentrations may be at an early stage of contamination, as described in other areas of the Antarctic, being a new threat to this continent.","The authors thanks the Environmental Chemistry Laboratory of the Natural Resources Chemistry Institute of the University of Talca, Talca, Chile, and INACH.","This research was funded by ANID-PIA-Anillo INACH ACT 192057 and by FONDAP-IDEAL, grant number 15150003.",Plants,,,,2021-11-26,2021,2021-11-26,,10,12,2593,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tapia, Jaime; Molina-Montenegro, Marco; Sandoval, Camila; Rivas, Natalia; Espinoza, Jessica; Basualto, Silvia; Fierro, Pablo; Vargas-Chacoff, Luis","Tapia, Jaime (Institute of Natural Resources Chemistry, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, j.espinoza@utalca.cl); Molina-Montenegro, Marco (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.); Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas, CEAZA, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile); Sandoval, Camila (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Rivas, Natalia (Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Espinoza, Jessica (Institute of Natural Resources Chemistry, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, j.espinoza@utalca.cl); Basualto, Silvia (EULA Center, University of Concepción, Concepción 4030000, Chile;, sbasualt@udec.cl); Fierro, Pablo (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile); Vargas-Chacoff, Luis (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Centro Fondap de Investigación de Altas Latitudes, FONDAP-IDEAL Center, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems, BASE, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile)","Tapia, Jaime (University of Talca); Fierro, Pablo (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile); Vargas-Chacoff, Luis (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Centro Fondap de Investigación de Altas Latitudes, FONDAP-IDEAL Center, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems, BASE, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile)","Tapia, Jaime (University of Talca); Molina-Montenegro, Marco (University of Talca; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.); Catholic University of the North); Sandoval, Camila (University of Talca; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Rivas, Natalia (University of Talca; Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Talca, Talca 3460000, Chile;, marco.molina@utalca.cl, (M.M.-M.);, camisando28@gmail.com, (C.S.);, natalirivasj@gmail.com, (N.R.)); Espinoza, Jessica (University of Talca); Basualto, Silvia (University of Concepción); Fierro, Pablo (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile); Vargas-Chacoff, Luis (Institute of Marine Science and Limnology, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Centro Fondap de Investigación de Altas Latitudes, FONDAP-IDEAL Center, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems, BASE, University Austral of Chile, Valdivia 5090000, Chile)",6,4,0.18,,https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/10/12/2593/pdf?version=1637913684,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143559361,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences",

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of diabetes, describe its correlates and its associated dietary intake in urban adults from Colombia.
SETTING: The Colombian Study of Nutritional Profiles was a population-based, cross-sectional, multi-stage probabilistic sampling survey designed to represent the five main Colombian cities.
PARTICIPANTS: Between June and November 2018, we studied 736 non-pregnant participants aged 18 or older. Diabetes was defined as a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL, self-reported prior diagnosis of diabetes or use of any oral or injectable antidiabetic medication(s). Participants also fulfilled a detailed 157-item food-frequency questionnaire.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of diabetes, dietary intake of key nutrients, achievement of dietary goals among individuals with diabetes.
RESULTS: The overall estimated prevalence of diabetes was 10.1%, with no difference by sex (9.6% in women, 10.8% in men, p=0.43). The association between diabetes and education level depended on sex, diabetes was more prevalent among more educated men and less educated women. Abdominal obesity was associated with a 65% increase in diabetes prevalence among men, and a 163% increase in women. Individuals with diabetes reported lower mean consumption of all nutrients, but after adjustment by sex, age, socioeconomic level (SEL) and body mass index, only their lower sodium consumption remained significant (p=0.013). The proportion of non-achievement of dietary intake goals among participants with diabetes was 94.4% for saturated fats, 86.7% for sodium, 84.4% for fibre and 80% for trans fats. In multivariate logistic regression models, age was the strongest independent correlate of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes by self-report, random plasma glucose or medication use was highly prevalent among Colombian adults. There were large differences by abdominal obesity status, region of residence, SEL and educational level. The proportion of individuals with diabetes meeting dietary recommendations was alarmingly low.",,This study was funded by Team Foods Colombia (068-2018).,BMJ Open,,,Adult; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Eating; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Male,2021-06-17,2021,2021-06-17,2021-06,11,6,e042050,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mendivil, Carlos O; Romero, Sebastián A Gutiérrez; Peláez-Jaramillo, María J; Nieves-Barreto, Luz D; Montaño-Rodríguez, Angélica; Betancourt-Villamizar, Eddy","Mendivil, Carlos O (School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; Endocrinology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota, Bogota, Colombia); Romero, Sebastián A Gutiérrez (School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Peláez-Jaramillo, María J (School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Nieves-Barreto, Luz D (School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Montaño-Rodríguez, Angélica (School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, Colombia); Betancourt-Villamizar, Eddy (Research Department, Team Foods Colombia, Bogota, Colombia)","Mendivil, Carlos O (Universidad de Los Andes; Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá)","Mendivil, Carlos O (Universidad de Los Andes; Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá); Romero, Sebastián A Gutiérrez (Universidad de Los Andes); Peláez-Jaramillo, María J (Universidad de Los Andes); Nieves-Barreto, Luz D (Universidad de Los Andes); Montaño-Rodríguez, Angélica (Universidad de Los Andes); Betancourt-Villamizar, Eddy (Research Department, Team Foods Colombia, Bogota, Colombia)",3,2,0.17,0.93,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/11/6/e042050.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138956238,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,4 Quality Education

To assess the effects of seasonal androgenic action on territorial behavior, we analyzed vocal and non-vocal territorial behavior in response to simulated territorial intrusions (STIs) during three life-cycle stages in free-living male black redstarts: breeding, molt and nonbreeding. Concurrently, we measured changes in circulating testosterone levels, as well as the mRNA expression of androgen and estrogen receptors and aromatase in the preoptic, hypothalamic and song control brain areas that are associated with social and vocal behaviors.ResultsTerritorial behavior and estrogen receptor expression in hypothalamic areas did not differ between stages. But plasma testosterone was higher during breeding than during the other stages, similar to androgen receptor and aromatase expression in the preoptic area. The expression of androgen receptors in the song control nucleus HVC was lower during molt when birds do not sing or sing rarely, but similar between the breeding and the nonbreeding stage. Nevertheless, some song spectral features and the song repertoire differed between breeding and nonbreeding. Territorial behavior and song rate correlated with the expression of steroid receptors in hypothalamic areas, and in the song control nucleus lMAN.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate seasonal modulation of song, circulating testosterone levels, and brain sensitivity to androgens, but a year-round persistency of territorial behavior and estrogen receptor expression in all life-cycle stages. This suggests that seasonal variations in circulating testosterone concentrations and brain sensitivity to androgens is widely uncoupled from territorial behavior and song activity but might still affect song pattern. Our study contributes to the understanding of the complex comparative neuroendocrinology of song birds in the wild.","We thank Monika Trappschuh for her assistance in the hormone analysis and Christina Reusch for conducting the in-situ hybridization.

This topology was structured based on two main stages: (i) Green-based synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles based on lemongrass oil extraction and titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) hydrolysis, and (ii) Chitosan gelation and modification with nanoparticles. Stage (i) is divided into two subprocesses for accomplishing TiO2 synthesis, lemongrass oil extraction and TiO2 production. The plant was designed to produce 2033 t/year of chitosan microbeads, taking crude chitosan, lemongrass, and TTIP as the primary raw materials. The process was evaluated through the ISI methodology to identify improvement opportunity areas based on a diagnosis of process risks. This work used industrial-scale process inventory data of the analyzed production process from mass and energy balances and the process operating conditions. The ISI method comprises the Chemical Inherent Safety Index (CSI) and Process Inherent Safety Index (PSI) to assess a whole chemical process from a holistic perspective, and for this process, it reflected a global score of 28. Specifically, CSI and PSI delivered scores of 16 and 12, respectively. The analysis showed that the most significant risks are related to TTIP handling and its physical-chemical properties due to its toxicity and flammability. Insights about this process's safety performance were obtained, indicating higher risks than those from recommended standards.","The authors thank the Universidad de Cartagena, Universidad del Norte and Universidad EAN for the support in the development of this research.","This research was funded by the EAN University, Universidad del Norte and the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation MINCIENCIAS.",Biomolecules,,Joseph Erlichman,Chemical Safety; Chitosan; Drug Industry; Green Chemistry Technology; Metal Nanoparticles; Microspheres; Plant Oils; Safety Management; Terpenes; Titanium,2021-04-13,2021,2021-04-13,,11,4,568,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meramo-Hurtado, Samir; Ceballos-Arrieta, Nicolas; Cortes-Caballero, Jose; Leon-Pulido, Jeffrey; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Gonzalez-Delgado, Ángel Dario","Meramo-Hurtado, Samir (Chemical Engineering Program, Universidad EAN, Bogotá 110221, Colombia;, jleonp@universidadean.edu.co); Ceballos-Arrieta, Nicolas (Chemical Engineering Program, Universidad de Cartagena, Bolivar 24120, Colombia;, nceballosa@unicartagena.edu.co, (N.C.-A.);, jcortesc@unicartagena.edu.co, (J.C.-C.);, agonzalezd1@unicartagena.edu.co, (Á.D.G.-D.)); Cortes-Caballero, Jose (Chemical Engineering Program, Universidad de Cartagena, Bolivar 24120, Colombia;, nceballosa@unicartagena.edu.co, (N.C.-A.);, jcortesc@unicartagena.edu.co, (J.C.-C.);, agonzalezd1@unicartagena.edu.co, (Á.D.G.-D.)); Leon-Pulido, Jeffrey (Chemical Engineering Program, Universidad EAN, Bogotá 110221, Colombia;, jleonp@universidadean.edu.co); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Mechanical Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 25138, Colombia;, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co); Gonzalez-Delgado, Ángel Dario (Chemical Engineering Program, Universidad de Cartagena, Bolivar 24120, Colombia;, nceballosa@unicartagena.edu.co, (N.C.-A.);, jcortesc@unicartagena.edu.co, (J.C.-C.);, agonzalezd1@unicartagena.edu.co, (Á.D.G.-D.))","Meramo-Hurtado, Samir (Universidad EAN)","Meramo-Hurtado, Samir (Universidad EAN); Ceballos-Arrieta, Nicolas (University of Cartagena); Cortes-Caballero, Jose (University of Cartagena); Leon-Pulido, Jeffrey (Universidad EAN); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte); Gonzalez-Delgado, Ángel Dario (University of Cartagena)",5,3,0.14,0.9,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/11/4/568/pdf?version=1618280420,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137179026,31 Biological Sciences; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology,

Explorations of deep-water ecosystems have been limited in this region, and elsewhere globally. To characterize community composition of mesophotic and deep-sea demersal fauna at seamounts in the region, we conducted expeditions to Rapa Nui (RN) and Salas y Gómez (SyG) islands in 2011 and Desventuradas Islands in 2013. Remote autonomous baited-cameras were used to conduct stationary video surveys between 150-1,850 m at RN/SyG (N = 20) and 75-2,363 m at Desventuradas (N = 27). Individual organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and relative abundance was quantified with the maximum number of individuals per frame. Deployments were attributed with associated environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, seamount age, and bathymetric position index [BPI]). We identified 55 unique invertebrate taxa and 66 unique fish taxa. Faunal community structure was highly dissimilar between and within subregions both for invertebrate (p < 0.001) and fish taxa (p = 0.022). For fishes, dogfish sharks (Squalidae) accounted for the greatest dissimilarity between subregions (18.27%), with mean abundances of 2.26 ± 2.49 at Desventuradas, an order of magnitude greater than at RN/SyG (0.21 ± 0.54). Depth, seamount age, broad-scale BPI, and nitrate explained most of the variation in both invertebrate (R2 = 0.475) and fish (R2 = 0.419) assemblages. Slightly more than half the deployments at Desventuradas (N = 14) recorded vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa such as corals and sponges. Our study supports mounting evidence that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are areas of high biodiversity and high conservation value. While Chile and Peru have recently established or proposed marine protected areas in this region, the majority of these ridges lie outside of national jurisdictions and are under threat from overfishing, plastic pollution, climate change, and potential deep-sea mining. Given its intrinsic value, this region should be comprehensively protected using the best available conservation measures to ensure that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges remain a globally unique biodiversity hotspot.","The expeditions were funded by the National Geographic Society and Pristine Seas donors with support to AMF.

However, there is little information regarding prognostic factors and mortality in COVID-19 from Latin American countries. Objectives To determine prognostic factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the impact of tocilizumab use in patients with hyperinflammatory syndrome and severe disease defined by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) with a value greater than or equal to seven points. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized COVID-19 patients from May to July 2020. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors associated with mortality. Results A total of 136 patients required hospital admission. In-hospital mortality was 39.7%. Mortality was observed to be potentiated by older age, LDH serum levels and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lymphopenia and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio were more common in these patients. Similarly, patients who died were classified more frequently with severe disease. The independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age greater than 65 years, type 2 diabetes mellitus, NEWS2 greater than or equal to seven points and LDH greater than 400U/L. The use of Tocilizumab alone was not related with decreased in-hospital mortality. Subgroup analysis performed in patients with hyperinflammation and severe disease showed similar results. Conclusions COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients was high and mainly related with older age, comorbidities, LDH and the severity of disease at hospital admission.",The authors wish to thank Universidad del Norte and Hospital Universidad del Norte for supporting this project,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-05-06,2021,2021-05-06,2021-05-06,13,5,e14865,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nuñez-Ramos, Jose A.; Illera, Elias Forero; Barrios, Jorge Luis Quintero; Arroyo, Hugo Andres Macareno; Sanjuan, Didier Johanna Larios; Barbur, Maria Carolina Manzur; Sanjuanelo, Ana Milena Mejia; Quevedo, Mauro Duvan Mendoza; Viasus-Perez, Diego Fernando; Illera, Elias Forero; Quintero, Jorge Luis L.; Arroyo, Hugo Andres Macareno; Quevedo, Mauro D.

In this work, we explore model-based paleodietary reconstruction of the results of stable isotope analysis of human bone collagen and hydroxyapatite. The results of this modeling are used to explore local phenomena, the nature of the Middle Period, and the interaction between local situations and the larger world in which the oases were enmeshed by identifying the temporal, spatial, and biocultural correlates and dimensions of dietary difference. Our analyses revealed that: 1) over the 600-year period represented by our sample, there were significant changes in consumption patterns that may evince broad diachronic changes in the structure of Atacameño society, and 2) at/near 600 calAD, there was a possible episode of social discontinuity that manifested in significant changes in consumption practices. Additionally, while there were some differences in the level of internal dietary variability among the ayllus, once time was fully considered, none of the ayllus stood out for having a more (or less) clearly internally differentiated cuisine. Finally, sex does not appear to have been a particularly salient driver of observed dietary differences here. While we do not see any de facto evidence for complete dietary differentiation (as there is always overlap in consumption among individuals, ayllus, and time periods, and as isotopic analysis is not capable of pinpointing different foods items or preparations), there are broad aspects of dietary composition changing over time that are potentially linked to status, and foreignness. Ultimately, these stand as the clearest example of what has been termed ""gastro-politics,"" potentially tied to the emergence of social inequality in the San Pedro oases.","WJP received National Science Foundation Grant BCS-1358753, https://www.nsf.gov/.

During the Pisagua earthquake, the TEC changes were detected at the GPS sites located to the north and south of the earthquake epicenter, whereas during the Illapel earthquake, we registered the changes only in the northward direction. Tide-gauge sites mimicked the propagation direction of tsunami waves similar to the TEC change pattern during both earthquakes. The TEC changes were represented by three signals. The initial weaker signal correlated well with Acoustic Rayleigh wave (AWRayleigh), while the following stronger perturbation was interpreted to be caused by Acoustic Gravity wave (AGWepi) and Internal Gravity wave (IGWtsuna) induced by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis respectively. Inevitably, TEC changes can be utilized to evaluate earthquake occurrence and tsunami propagation within a framework of multi-parameter early warning systems.","We thank the one anonymous reviewer and the second reviewer Dr. Giovanni Occhipinti for their constructive comments to improve the quality of the manuscript.

At the chronic stage, cardiomyopathy occurs in about 20-30% of infested people. Most prevalence studies have focused on young to adult people due to the drastic consequences of acquiring the pathogen and the possibility to cure the disease at this age; the prevalence of this disease, the effect of patients' sex and the consequences to senescent people have been largely neglected. This study looks to characterize the seroprevalence of Chagas disease and its relation with occurrence of electrocardiographic anomalies associated with sex and age, and to compare rural and urban populations in Bolivia.
METHODOLOGY: Seroprevalence of Chagas disease was determined in blood samples and electrocardiograms were performed on seropositive individuals.
RESULTS: The rural population showed higher seroprevalence than the urban population (92% and 40%, respectively). The proportion of Chagasic cardiac anomalies in seropositive persons was highest in patients of the 50-59 age group (36%) as compared with the 40-49 (8%) and the ≥60 (17%) age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher seroprevalence in rural population was attributable to a higher probability to encounter the vector in rural areas. Increased exposure to infection and to development of the disease symptoms together with increased lethality of the disease as patients age explains the age-related Chagasic electrocardiographic anomalies. Since rural and urban populations showed different reactions under Chagas disease and the rural population was mainly of guaraní stock, the genetic and environmental determinants of the results should be further explored.","Authors thank Universidad Mayor Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca and Guaraní Council of Chuquisaca Captains for support.

Dextral strikes-slip is expressed in NW–SE striking faults of the Atacama Fault System, and reverse displacement dominates in E–W faults. This deformation results of the convergence in a concave-seaward continental margin. On September 11th, 2020, a Mw 6.3 earthquake and its subsequent aftershocks took place in the coastal region of northern Chile, revealing the reactivation of the deepest segment of a WNW–ESE striking upper plate fault. The reactivation of this fault occurred after the Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake, and it seems to be connected to a N–S interplate locking segmentation of the plate margin, which is clearly shown by the locking pattern before the Iquique earthquake. This poses the question of how heterogeneous locking influences upper plate seismicity and how it relates to trench-parallel shortening.","This work was supported by the FONDECYT project 1200170 and the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN) CONICYT/FONDAP project 15110017.

In order to inform the development of such policies, data on the healthcare needs and healthcare spending for immigrants is required. The objective of this article is to compare the clinical characteristics and healthcare-related expenditures of Venezuelan immigrants and non-migrants living with HIV in Colombia. We analysed data from the Colombian High-cost Diseases Fund from February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019, identifying the hospital and non-hospital expenditures per patient for Venezuelan immigrants and non-migrant patients, in both the state-subsidised and the contributory coverage schemes. We employed binomial negative regression models to compare expenditures between the two groups. In the contributory scheme, the average annual per-capita expenditure for immigrants was USD $ 859.07 (SD: ± $793.37) for non-hospital care. For non-migrants, the average costs were 1,796.53. In the state-subsidised scheme expenditures were higher on average, but still lower for immigrants than for non-migrants. After adjusting by clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, non-hospital per capita expenditures were lower for immigrants as compared with non-migrants (25,37% lower in the state-subsidised scheme, and 33,75% lower in the contributory scheme). Hospital expenditures were also lower, but the small sample size limited analysis. To conclude, Venezuelan immigrants living with HIV do not represent a major economic burden to the health system in Colombia. Further studies are required in order to understand if the lower healthcare expenditures of this population are the result of limitations in healthcare access, of clinical characteristics that were not assessed in this study, or of other unmeasured aspects.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the health payers and providers for data report.

METHODS: IHC was performed on tumor specimens from 366 patients with transitional cell bladder cancer. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to develop a multi-marker classifier for predicting DFS of patients with bladder cancer. The Kaplan-Meier estimate was performed to assess DFS, and unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression models were used to identify independent risk factors to predict DFS of patients with bladder cancer.
RESULTS: Based on the LASSO Cox regression model, nine prognostic markers were identified in the training cohort. Patients were stratified into low- and high-risk groups using the IHC-based classifier. In the training cohort, the 10-year DFS was significantly better in low-risk patients (71%) compared with high-risk patients (18%) (p < 0.001); in the validation cohort, the 10-year DFS was 86% for the low-risk group and 20% for the high-risk group (p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that the high-risk group based on the classifier was associated with poorer DFS adjusted by clinicopathological characteristics. Finally, a nomogram comprising the classifier and clinicopathological factors was developed for clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The nine-IHC-based classifier is a reliable prognostic tool, which can eventually guide clinical decision making regarding treatment strategy and follow-up scheduling of bladder cancer.",,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 81772706).,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2021-03-25,2021,2021-03-25,,11,,641385,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wu, Jie; Wen, Jun-Miao; Wang, Yu-Chen; Luo, Wen-Jie; Wang, Qi-Feng; Lv, Hong; Dai, Bo; Ye, Ding-Wei; Su, Heng-Chuan; Zhu, Yi-Ping","Wu, Jie (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Wen, Jun-Miao (Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Radiation Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China); Wang, Yu-Chen (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Luo, Wen-Jie (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Wang, Qi-Feng (Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China); Lv, Hong (Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China); Dai, Bo (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Ye, Ding-Wei (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Su, Heng-Chuan (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Zhu, Yi-Ping (Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China)","Ye, Ding-Wei (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Su, Heng-Chuan (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Zhu, Yi-Ping (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University)","Wu, Jie (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Wen, Jun-Miao (Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center); Wang, Yu-Chen (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Luo, Wen-Jie (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Wang, Qi-Feng (Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center); Lv, Hong (Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University; Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center); Dai, Bo (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Ye, Ding-Wei (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Su, Heng-Chuan (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University); Zhu, Yi-Ping (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University)",2,2,0.08,0.63,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.641385/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136648824,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

METHODOLOGY: It was a retrospective study, and the data was acquired at Ziauddin Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. All patients admitted between February and May 2021 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal samples were included in the study, including those who received at least five-day treatment of remdesivir and who did not receive even a single dose of remdesivir.
RESULTS: Data of overall 174 patients were used, out of which 71 (40.80%) received remdesivir. After propensity score matching, 71 patients in the remdesivir group were successfully matched with the non-remdesivir patients on the basis of age, gender, and disease severity. Results of multivariable logistic regression showed that there is no significant difference in deaths between patients who received remdesivir and patients who did not receive remdesivir (p-value=0.122). However, the length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the remdesivir group than in the control group (p-value=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Results of this study can provide evidence that remdesivir can be efficient in reducing the duration of COVID-19 illness, and a five-day course of treatment is sufficient for patients to get clinical benefits.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-11-11,2021,2021-11-11,2021-11-11,13,11,e19487,All OA; Gold,Article,"Butt, Ahmad G.; Ahmed, Jahanzeb; Shah, Syed Muhammad Huzaifa; Capriles, Camilo Andrés Avendaño; Al-Rihani, Hady; Ahmed, Bilal; Salman, Muhammad; Devi, Arti; Wali, Sher; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño","Butt, Ahmad G.

Both countries have a long history of scientific collaboration that dates to the 1800s. Both scientific communities also share geographical proximity and common scientific research interests mainly in Biotechnology, Meteorology, and Public Health research. Despite these facts, scientists from both nations face serious barriers to cooperation raised by the U.S. embargo established in 1961 that prohibits exchanges with Cuba. The study aims to analyze the effects of U.S. policy on scientific collaboration with Cuban scientific institutions. The results of the bibliometric analysis of Cuba-U.S. joint publications in the Web of Science, and Scopus databases between 1980 to 2020 indicate sustained growth of scientific collaboration between scientists of both nations over the past forty years. The results also show that after the 1980 Smithsonian Institution and the Cuba's Academy of Sciences agreement significantly increased scientific collaboration between U.S. scientists with their Cuban peers. President Barack Obama's approach to normalizing the U.S. Cuba relations in 2015 enhanced Cuban scientific production with U.S. scientists by exceeding the number of collaborative papers published during any preceding U.S. Presidential administration. By 2020, Cuba had expanded its scientific links to 80% of the countries in the world. Cuban and U.S. scientists converted from adversaries into partners, showing that science is an effective diplomatic channel.

In this work, a hybrid strategy based on process integration is proposed to minimize freshwater consumption while reusing wastewater. As a novelty, the strategy included a heuristic approach for identifying the minimum consumption of freshwater with a preliminary design of the water network, considering the concept of reuse and multiple pollutants. Then, mathematical programming techniques were applied to evaluate the possibilities of regeneration of the source streams through the inclusion of intercept units and establish the optimal design of the network. This strategy was used in the shrimp shell waste process to obtain chitosan, where a minimum freshwater consumption of 277 t/h was identified, with a reuse strategy and an optimal value of US $5.5 million for the design of the water network.",The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology Colombia and Universidad de Cartagena for their financial support with project “Diseño y aplicacion de estrategias de integracion de proceso a las biorefinerias de exoesqueleto de camaron y racimo de palma en el departamento de Bolivar”.,"This work was financially supported by the Project “Diseño y aplicacion de estrategias de integracion de proceso a las biorefinerias de exoesqueleto de camaron y racimo de palma en el departamento de Bolivar”, funded by the call 848-2019.

Colombia is a South American country where the differences between socioeconomic statuses (SES) are huge. In this study, through the ECSP-E Scale, translated to Spanish and validated for linguistic and cultural equivalence, the development of three communicative functions was evaluated through an interactive sociopragmatic approach. The participants comprised 36 24-month-old children, raised in three different social contexts in Colombia, with the goal of comparing them across groups of SES. The lowest SES group sample subjects were representative of extreme poverty and members of an ethnic group, the Wayuú. Results for the communicative functions, namely social interaction (SI), joint attention (JA), and behavior regulation (BR), showed that the only function with no significant differences across SES was joint attention. This supports the hypothesis that the development of this function may be universal, in light of the fact that the Wayuú not only differed from other subjects in terms of their socioeconomic status but also in their culture. Higher SES was related to better social interaction, while Low SES was associated with better behavior regulation than their High SES peers. Consequently, results are discussed considering socioeconomic and cultural differences in the development of communication and social interactions, leading us to reexamine the paradigms, theories, and practices that are used when observing children raised in very poor environments.",We gratefully acknowledge the parents of the children as well as the directors of the kindergartens and nurseries where most of the children were evaluated. We are also especially grateful to the Wayuu community for allowing them to learn a little more about their culture.,"Funding.

The incidence of penile intraepithelial neoplasia in Asian males is rare. We report the clinical characteristics and treatment process of a case of penile intraepithelial neoplasia in a Chinese man. We treated the disease of this patient by surgical excision of the penile lesion and scrotal flap plastic surgery. After surgery, the shape of the penis was satisfactory, and there was no adverse effect on erection. The pathological results confirmed the diagnosis of penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The pathological features showed that the lesion tissue was covered with squamous epithelium and that there was severe atypical hyperplasia of the lesion epithelium, disordered arrangement of polarity, and an intact basement membrane. The removal of the lesions of penile intraepithelial neoplasia through a wider surgical resection range, combined with the stretchability of a scrotal flap, can achieve a good healing effect of the surgical wound and reduce the possibility of recurrence of penile intraepithelial neoplasia.",,,Frontiers in Surgery,,,,2021-06-28,2021,2021-06-28,,8,,667417,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huang, Kai; Lu, Shuai; Wang, Yehua; Tu, Xiangan","Huang, Kai (Department of Urology, College of Clinical Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China); Lu, Shuai (Department of Urology, College of Clinical Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China); Wang, Yehua (Department of Urology, College of Clinical Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China); Tu, Xiangan (Department of Urology and Andrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China)","Huang, Kai (Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital; Yangzhou University); Tu, Xiangan (First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University)","Huang, Kai (Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital; Yangzhou University); Lu, Shuai (Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital; Yangzhou University); Wang, Yehua (Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital; Yangzhou University); Tu, Xiangan (First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University)",1,1,,0.51,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2021.667417/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139186419,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,

To fill this gap, our cross-sectional study assessed the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the CBQ-VSF version in a sample of 315 low-income and low-educated parents with preschool children living in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. While our findings revealed problems that were similar to those identified in previous assessments of the CBQ-VSF Spanish version, they also showed unique problems related to the sociodemographic characteristics of our sample, containing many individuals with a low income and low educational level. Most of the participants gave extreme responses, resulting in a notable kurtosis and skewness of the data. This article describes how we addressed these problems by dichotomizing the variables into binary categories. Additionally, it demonstrates that merely translating the CBQ-VSF is insufficient to be able to capture many of the underlying latent constructs associated with low-income and low-educated Latino/Hispanic populations.","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Fossils from the Caribbean region are few and include of a couple of findings from Panama and Venezuela. Here, we report a partly complete skull from the Caujarao Formation (middle Miocene), Falcon State, Caribbean region of Venezuela. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Caujarao specimen is a ‘stem delphinidan’, a group that includes several taxa of early diverging odontocetes whose phylogenetic affinities remain a matter of debate. The fossil record has shown that this group of stem delphinidans was taxonomically diverse, but displayed a somewhat homogeneous cranial patterning, with most of the variations being found within the mandible or tympanoperiotic characters. As other stem delphinidans the Caujarao odontocete displays an enlarged temporal fossa and a fairly symmetrical cranium. Because the skull is missing several key diagnostic characters due to the preservation state of the specimen, a more precise taxonomic identification is not possible. Despite this, the finding of this specimen highlights the importance of the fossil record from the Neogene of Venezuela, and the importance of the area to understand cetacean evolution in the proto-Caribbean.","We thank all the institutions mentioned in the methods section for their valuable support and access to study fossil and extant comparative collections.

Patients were followed-up in the outpatient department (OPD) after 3 months, and a lipid profile at follow-up was obtained. The percentage of LDL change was determined on 3 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 590 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of all participants enrolled, 334 (80.48%) completed the 3-month follow-up. The mean age of participants was 58.08 (+12.06) years. High-intensity statin therapy is positively associated with positive LDL change (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.45, P-value=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our data implies that high-intensity statin medication may be an initial therapeutic option to decrease LDL. However, future randomized clinical trials should corroborate these findings.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-12-26,2021,2021-12-26,2021-12-26,13,12,e20710,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rupasinghe, Chamithra D.; Kantas, Theodosios; Sani, Rohail; Capriles, Natalia M.

It is related to enhanced rates of disability and mortality, enhanced disease burden, decreased function levels, and it can affect the wellbeing and daily activities of people, including loss of autonomy and independence. The aim of the current study is to determine the predictors of quality of life among patients with multimorbidity in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology It was a cross-sectional study conducted in 12 health care facilities of six districts in Karachi, Pakistan. Two health care facilities were selected from each district using a convenient sampling technique. The total sample size of this study was 690, equally distributed among 12 health care facilities. Results The majority of participants (33.47%) belonged to the age group of 40 to 49 years, while 29.85% of participants had an age between 30 to 39 years. More than half of the participants were females (50.87%). Overall, the multivariate analysis showed being male, married, younger, high educational status and employed were positively associated with quality of life. While having lower family income is negatively associated with quality of life. Conclusion The findings of this study had important implications for identifying distinct multimorbidity individuals who were at risk of a lower quality of life, and they emphasized the need for disease detection and treatment at an early stage. The study can also give important evidence for decision-makers when it comes to allocating health resources more efficiently, and health administrative departments can improve chronic disease management.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2021-10-15,2021,2021-10-15,2021-10-15,13,10,e18803,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hussain, Malik Hatim; Jilanee, Daniyal A.; Aziz, Safa; Tariq, Sheharyar; Devi, Arti; Avendaño-Capriles, Camilo A.; Tousif, Sohaib; Barkat, Rahil; Jilanee, Daniyal; Capriles, Camilo Andres Avendaño","Hussain, Malik Hatim (); Jilanee, Daniyal A.

The study aimed to examine how individual and group factors influence the exchange of information among the implementers of a psychosocial intervention program targeted to victims of the war in Colombia. A cross-sectional exploratory design was developed. Interviews were held with 18 psychologists, 22 social workers, 10 community promoters, and a nurse. The study used the E-i index and the visualization of interclass and intraclass links. There is no homophilic tendency in the exchange of information among the three professional categories. Empowerment predicts the nominations received in the request for information network (β = 0.296, p < 0.006). To be central in the preference network is the principal predictor of receiving requests for information (β = 0.562, p < 0.0001). Empowered professionals and those who exchange information on the implementation process are considered key informants that can improve the program's effectiveness.","Al Centro para la Innovación en Desarrollo y la Investigación, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana.",,Cadernos de Saúde Pública,,,Brazil; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mental Health,2021,2021,2021,,37,6,e00045420,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramos-Vidal, Ignacio; Palacio, Jorge; Uribe, Alicia; Villamil, Ilse C","Ramos-Vidal, Ignacio (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, España.); Palacio, Jorge (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Uribe, Alicia (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia.); Villamil, Ilse C (Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Montería, Colombia.)",,"Ramos-Vidal, Ignacio (University of Seville); Palacio, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Uribe, Alicia (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Villamil, Ilse C (Pontifical Bolivarian University)",1,0,,0.42,https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/5wHgbkhqS3L5f7q49Pq9sbT/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139437251,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Here, we describe details of the eyes of the Cretaceous brachyuran Callichimaera perplexa, which possessed remarkably large eyes and a highly disparate body form among brachyurans. The eyes of C. perplexa preserve internal optic neuropils and external corneal elements, and it is the first known post-Paleozoic arthropod to preserve both. Additionally, a series of specimens of C. perplexa preserve both the eyes and carapace, allowing for the calculation of the optical growth rate. C. perplexa shows the fastest optical growth rate compared with a sample of 14 species of extant brachyurans. The growth series of C. perplexa, in combination with the calculation of the interommatidial angle and eye parameter, demonstrates that it was a highly visual predator that inhabited well-lit environments.","We thank E.A.

Several studies have detected the presence of leptospiral antibodies in captive Neotropical primates, suggesting that they are asymptomatic carriers. However, the presence of antibodies in free-ranging primates and their potential role as reservoirs for this pathogen is not known. In this study, we used the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to screen two species of free-ranging tamarins for the presence of Leptospira antibodies using a panel of 21 serogroups. A total of 56 primates (26 Leontocebus weddelli and 30 Saguinus imperator) were screened at the Estación Biológica Río Los Amigos in Madre de Dios, Peru. MAT results with titres of ≥100 in single samples were considered seropositive. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated for age group, sex and host species identity. Overall, 51.8% (29/56) of animals were reactive for at least one Leptospira serogroup. Serogroups were distributed as follows: Iquitos (41.1%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (14.3%), Sejroe (3.6%), Autumnalis (1.8%) and Bataviae (1.8%). No significant differences (p > .05) were found for seropositivity frequencies among categories within assessed variables. These results suggest that free-ranging L. weddelli and S. imperator might serve as reservoirs for pathogenic Leptospira serogroups. Given increasing human-wildlife contact, future studies that test for active infection are required to determine potential transmission risks to humans.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was financially supported by the EROL Scholarship 2017‐II provided by Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica and the Undergraduate Thesis Student Fund code A18080254 granted by Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

We also aimed to explore differences in body composition (BC), physical fitness (PF), and physical activity (PA) between satisfied and dissatisfied adolescents and to find the associations between BD and these parameters.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study carried out in Jalisco (Mexico) in which 451 adolescents (43.68% males, 43.90% rural) aged 13-17 years were evaluated. BD and self-perceived PF and PA were assessed with validated questionnaires, while objectively measured PF (strength, explosive strength, speed-agility, and cardiovascular fitness) was assessed using field tests. To evaluate BC, anthropometric measures and bioelectric impedance analysis were carried out. Regression analysis was used to ascertain the associations between health-related factors and body dissatisfaction.
RESULTS: Girls obtained higher scores on the BD questionnaire than boys (11.12 ± 3.13 vs. 10.33 ± 2.73; p < 0.05), whereas no geographical differences between rural and urban adolescents were found. BD was positively associated with higher fat mass (β = 0.15; p < 0.001), and negatively associated with muscle mass and PF (β = -0.24 and β = -0.23; p < 0.001). However, PA was not associated with any of the measured parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: selected parameters of BC, PF, and sex have an impact on the Mexican adolescent's body satisfaction levels and should be considered when designing future health policies.","The authors would like to thank the North School (CUNORTE) and the School of Health Sciences (CUCS) of the University of Guadalajara, Mexico and the professionals and the students who collaborated making this study possible.",This study received funding from CONACYT (CVU 22064) and from the Program to Strengthen Research and Graduate Studies of the University of Guadalajara.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Mexico; Physical Fitness,2021-11-20,2021,2021-11-20,,18,22,12215,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rivera-Ochoa, María; Arroyo-Bello, Marta; Mañas, Asier; Quesada-González, Carlos; Vizmanos-Lamotte, Barbara; González-Gross, Marcela; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia","Rivera-Ochoa, María (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.); North University Center, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara 44430, Mexico); Arroyo-Bello, Marta (Department of Psychology, University of Westminster, London W1B 2HW, UK;, m.arroyobello@hotmail.com; Department of Psychology, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), 28040 Madrid, Spain); Mañas, Asier (Deapartment of Physical Activity and Sports Sciences, GENUD Toledo Research Group, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 45071 Toledo, Spain;, asier.manas@uclm.es; Carlos III Health Institute, CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), 28029 Madrid, Spain); Quesada-González, Carlos (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.); Department of Applied Mathematics to Information and Communication Technologies, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain); Vizmanos-Lamotte, Barbara (Institute of Nutrigenetics and Translational Nutrigenomics, University Center for Health Sciences, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara 44430, Mexico;, bvizmanos@yahoo.com.mx); González-Gross, Marcela (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.)); Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia (Department of Health and Human Performance, ImFINE Research Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain;, mariariveraochoa@gmail.com, (M.R.-O.);, carlos.quesada@upm.es, (C.Q.-G.);, marcela.gonzalez.gross@upm.es, (M.G.-G.); Carlos III Health Institute, CIBER of Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), 28029 Madrid, Spain)","Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia (Technical University of Madrid; Instituto de Salud Carlos III)","Rivera-Ochoa, María (Technical University of Madrid; University of Guadalajara); Arroyo-Bello, Marta (University of Westminster; National University of Distance Education); Mañas, Asier (University of Castilla-La Mancha; Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Quesada-González, Carlos (Technical University of Madrid; Technical University of Madrid); Vizmanos-Lamotte, Barbara (University of Guadalajara); González-Gross, Marcela (Technical University of Madrid); Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia (Technical University of Madrid; Instituto de Salud Carlos III)",2,2,,0.83,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/22/12215/pdf?version=1637646724,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143321931,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3213 Paediatrics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and reliability of an instrument to measure medical students' lifestyles.
METHODS: A lifestyle questionnaire was developed using the Delphi technique by a group of experts. The final questionnaire was applied to 332 students of the School of Medicine of the Ricardo Palma University in 2017. A preliminary examination was carried out to assess preconditions for construct validityincluding the correlation matrix, the Kaiser Meyer Olkin statistic, and the Bartlett sphericity test. Factor analysis was used for construct validity, and the possible resulting factors were extracted through the principal component analysis. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated to assess the instrument reliability.
RESULTS: In this study, 41.6% of participants were men with a mean age of 20 years (standard deviation = 3). The preconditions for the factor analysis were a Kaiser Meyer Olkin coefficient = 0.773 and a significant Bartlett sphericity test. For the 47 items of the final questionnaire, the factor analysis showed an explained variance of 56.7% with eigenvalues greater than one. Cronbach's alpha was 0.78. The final questionnaire could assume values between -23 to 151 points. Based on a cut point of 71 points, the prevalence of students with an unhealthy lifestyle was 73.6%.
CONCLUSION: The developed instrument has acceptable validity and reliability to measure lifestyle in medical students.

Therefore, glycerol prices dropped significantly worldwide in recent years; the more significant biodiesel production is, the more glycerol exists as a byproduct. glycerol prices also impact the biodiesel manufacturing business, as it could be sold according to its refinement grade. The primary objective of this work was to evaluate the economic potential of the production of 1,2-propanediol derived from the biodiesel produced in Colombia. A plant to produce 1,2-propanediol via catalytic hydrogenation of glycerol in a trickle-bed reactor was designed. The plant comprised a reaction scheme where non-converted excess hydrogen was recycled, and the heat generated in the reactor was recovered. The reactor effluent was sent to a separation train where 98% m/m purity 1,2-propanediol was attained. Capital and operational costs were estimated from the process simulation. The net present value (NPV) and the modified internal return rate (MIRR) of the plant were used to assess the viability of the process. Their sensitivity to key input variables was evaluated to find the viability limits of the project. The economic potential of the 1,2-propanediol was calculated in USD 1.2/kg; for the base case, the NPV and the MIRR were USD 54.805 million and 22.56%, respectively, showing that, for moderate variations in products and raw material prices, the process is economically viable.",Especial thanks to the Universidad del Atlántico in Barranquilla for the ongoing support and funding of Juan B.

This practice can place patients at risk and increase antibiotic resistance in the community.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate individuals' preferences regarding the use of antibiotics. The study also assessed the likely effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Bogotá, Colombia. The attributes were determined by a systematic literature review and four focus group sessions. The DCE included nine factors - cost, time to get attention, level of symptoms, efficacy, safety, among others- and one label -using or not antibiotics. Data analysis was carried out using a generalized multinomial logit (GMNL) model. Marginal probabilities of different sets of attributes' levels were compared to estimate the likely effectiveness of interventions.
RESULTS: The survey was administered to 222 participants from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The results suggest that participants preferred not taking antibiotics and having a physician as an advisor, but the probability of inappropriate antibiotic use increased as the waiting time or the cost of receiving advice rose. The pharmacy was the preferred source of antibiotics, and participants chose the pharmacy worker (nonprofessional) as an advisor over the nurse on the phone. In the absence of any interventions aimed at reducing the use of antibiotics, approximately 47.3% of people would misuse antibiotics. This reduces to 26.5% when people perceive the efficacy of the antibiotics as low and the potential risks of self-medicating as high. An alternative model using a nursing service would likely lower inappropriate use of antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though people prefer not using antibiotics or visiting a physician in case of disease rather than self-medicating, current access conditions might discourage them from appropriately use antibiotics. The results suggest that interventions that informing people about the risks of self-medication and the low efficacy might significantly reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Our results also suggest that programs that empower other health professionals to provide access to antibiotics would likely further lower inappropriate use.","Authors thank Jonathan Boyajian, PhD for his valuable contributions to statistical analysis and to the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation COLCIENCIAS and the University of California, Merced for funding.",,Pharmacy Practice,,,,2021-09-11,2021,2021-09-11,2021,19,3,2401-2401,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-González, Johanna; Brown, Paul; Eslava-Schmalbach, Javier","Aponte-González, Johanna (Pharm, PhD.

The RPL protocol (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power a Lossy Networks) arises for the management of this type of network restricted by their physical capabilities through different rules and operations that simplify the communications and constructions of the WSN. Although RPL is an efficient and standardized protocol, it does not consider high traffic handling and presents severe problems regarding load balancing, which leads to service disruption. In this article, WRF-RPL is proposed as a protocol for considering load balancing over RPL to distribute communications and messages into a network topology to avoid one preferred parent’s congestions. The proposed protocol aims to improve the network’s lifetime and the packet delivery through source nodes to the sink in an energy-efficient manner. Different simulated scenarios were conducted over the Cooja simulator. The results show that WRF-RPL protocols outperform the standard RPL protocol over Network Lifetime, PDR, control message overhead, and energy consumption compared with other existing protocols.","This work was supported in part by the Research, Development, and Innovation Management (DIDI), Universidad del Norte.",,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-04-20,2021-01-01,9,,60163-60174,All OA; Gold,Article,"Acevedo, Pedro David; Jabba, Daladier; Sanmartín, Paul; Valle, Sebastián; Nino-Ruiz, Elías D.","Acevedo, Pedro David (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Jabba, Daladier (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Sanmartín, Paul (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Valle, Sebastián (System and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 080001, Colombia); Nino-Ruiz, Elías D.

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and symptomatology of anxiety and Burnout, as well as to identify their impact on the academic performance of students at the end of their medical degree.
Method: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on medical students at the end of their degree, using the Trait and State Anxiety inventory, the Maslach Burnout scale, and the grade point average through the Academic Secretary. Results: A prevalence of state anxiety (SA) of 40. 6% and trait anxiety (TA) of 31. 2% was observed, both with similar proportions between a medium and high level (75-25%), with an association between them. The prevalence of BS was 15. 6%, of which 17. 2% and 23. 4% respectively showed high levels of fatigue and depersonalization, moreover, 18. 8% showed low levels of personal fulfillment.
Conclusion: At the end of the career, students show symptoms of SA and TA with a high association between them. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that transitory anxiety can become part of an anxious response as a personality trait.

The notion of ""planning-doing"" is deployed as an inventive form of planning that is only narrated a posteriori, as an imperative act, a live government in action that depends on the movement of desire oriented by life, and that only takes place in collective spaces of management practices and health care.",,,Salud Colectiva,,,Brazil; COVID-19; Community Health Planning; Community-Based Participatory Research; Health Policy; Humans; Intersectoral Collaboration; Local Government; Pandemics; Universities,2021-05-28,2021,2021-05-28,,17,,e3341-e3341,All OA; Gold,Article,"Slomp Junior, Helvo; Coelho, Karla Santa Cruz; Barros, Delba Machado; Franco, Tulio Batista; Cruz, Kathleen Tereza da","Slomp Junior, Helvo (Doctor en Medicina.

It is therefore necessary for these administrations to provide quality information that the media can use as sources for their news stories. At the same time, these media outlets have to compare and report while taking into account the plurality of their audiences. However, in local settings, collusion exists between political power and media owners that restricts the plurality of news, favoring the dominant political interests and hiding the demands, interests and protagonism of other social actors. We study this problem in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. We analyze the information that the town halls of the main cities in the region provide to the media and how the largest print newspapers and main regional television news broadcasters report on local politics. We compare these news stories to establish whether there is a plurality of news reports. In addition, we analyze the key elements of the news items disseminated by private media outlets to establish whether they report a limited vision of reality: the topics covered, the protagonists referred to in headlines and news stories, and the sources against which the news and images are compared. The results reveal shortcomings that result in similar information between public information and private media content, thus limiting the plurality of news reports and the social protagonism of other social agents.

It is considered a public health problem in Colombia that requires a baseline to face this pathology.  Objective: To identify knowledge, attitudes and practices of the inhabitants of the municipality of Aguazul-Casanare to handle Chagas disease. Materials and methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 389 families of the municipality. Sociodemographic and epidemiologic factors as well as knowledge, attitudes and practices were investigated. Results: 221 women (56.8%) and 168 men (43.2) participated in the study. 31.4% and 31.6% of participants have optimal and appropriate knowledge, respectively. Optimal attitudes were observed in 85.9% of people, whereas 56.3% show improper practices, and 43.3% have good and regular practices. Conclusions: Even though, the community has positive attitudes towards prevention of the infection, there is a reduced percentage of people showing optimal knowledge, which is reflected in unhealthy practices.

Higher diversity in the composition of new cohorts of students, generated mainly in countries where public and institutional policies have enabled access to students from low socioeconomic conditions and races who unusually attend postsecondary education, make these effects even more relevant. This research estimates and analyzes the effect of peers’ academic performance and course composition by socioeconomic origin on students’ academic achievement at a private Colombian university between 2008 and 2019. The estimates, by Ordinary Least Squares and Multilevel models, support the existence of significant peer effects. There was a positive effect of peers’ performance on Calculus I academic results, principally of medium and high-performance peers, and a null effect of the socioeconomic level in Calculus I, but a significant effect in Communication Skills I, although with a limited impact. By introducing heterogeneities, it is evident that students perceived a greater benefit from performance improvements from peers who are in the same performance category or socioeconomic level. These results provide evidence of the existence, direction, and magnitude of peer effects in Colombian higher education. Additionally, they suggest that the most relevant characteristic of classmates is their academic performance and not their socioeconomic origin.","The authors thank the Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education-Icfes for providing access to the results of the national test Saber11 and for linking this database with the institutional records of the Universidad del Norte that allowed the realization of this work.

At the end, a comparison between SBR (SDN-RPL with SIGMA) and SDN-RPL (without SIGMA) was included. The simulations show that SBR has a better performance concerning packet loss, latency, and energy consumption over an architecture based on IoT without SIGMA.

This work aims to present a methodology to evaluate three demand response models to reduce frequency variations in the system. The method starts with the modeling of the system load and the demand response strategies. The power loads are modeled through active power and reactive power measurements in the system’s different buses. A data-driven methodology is proposed to obtain three profiles that simulate residential, commercial, and industrial users’ behavior. Mathematical modeling is proposed for demand response strategies. Time of Use tariff, Solar PV Distributed Generation, and Load Curtailment are the strategies used for residential, commercial, and industrial users, respectively. A brand-new combination of scenarios is developed in this paper with different penetration levels of the demand response strategy. Besides, a novel analysis of the frequency profile is performed for the proposed scenarios. A modified IEEE-39 power system is proposed, adjusting generation and demand using the Colombian demand profile and the generating units’ energy mix. The results indicate that the implementation of demand response strategies improves the system’s frequency profile. The frequency drop was reduced by 11.4 %, and power generator units released up to 2.1 GWh through the day with the implementation of the DR strategies.","This work was supported in part by the Directorate of Research, Development and Innovation-DIDI through the Project “Internal Agenda 2019 Code 2019-10” and in part by the Colombian Institute for the Development of Science and Technology Francisco José de Caldas-Colciencias Code (57598) under Grant 037-2018.",,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-03-26,2021-01-01,9,,50332-50343,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arango-Manrique, Adriana; Lopez, Luis; Ramirez-Ortiz, Juan; Oliveros, Ingrid","Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Lopez, Luis (Center for Energy Science and Technology (CEST), Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 143026, Moscow, Russia); Ramirez-Ortiz, Juan (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia); Oliveros, Ingrid (Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 081007, Colombia)","Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte)","Arango-Manrique, Adriana (Universidad del Norte); Lopez, Luis (Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology); Ramirez-Ortiz, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Oliveros, Ingrid (Universidad del Norte)",3,3,,1.08,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09387328.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136701566,40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,

Therefore, it is necessary to make the right decisions to carry out these activities, such as increasing the profit of businesses, improving the commercial strategies, and analyzing the industrial processes performance to produce better goods and services. This work proposes an intelligent system approach to prescribe actions and reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in an equalizer tank of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using machine learning models and genetic algorithms. There are three main objectives of this data-driven decision-making proposal. The first is to characterize and adapt a proper prediction model for the decision-making scheme. The second is to develop a prescriptive intelligent system based on expert’s rules and the selected prediction model’s outcomes. The last is to evaluate the system performance. As a novelty, this research proposes the use of long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks (ANN) with genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization in the WWTP area.","This work was supported by the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS, Investment Tax Benefits, Call No. 786.",Sustainability,,,,2021-04-13,2021,2021-04-13,,13,8,4311,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arismendy, Luis; Cárdenas, Carlos; Gómez, Diego; Maturana, Aymer; Mejía, Ricardo; M., Christian G.

Goal In this sense, this paper analyses the relationship between self-esteem in NNA and factors related to school, family, and peer relationships. Method and techniques The data are from secondary sources, provided by the United Nations Development Program (PNUD for its abbreviation in Spanish) that corresponds to the First Survey of Human Development in Children and Adolescents carried out, from a quantitative perspective, in Chile in 2017. A descriptive analysis with Decision Trees techniques will be presented and it will allow the identification of different subgroups in the sample according to their relationship with the variables of interest. Results It was found that the “satisfaction with life” is the most significant variable to outline the self-esteem of NNA, followed by the “perception of educational quality” and “self-image”. The positive evaluation of family and school-life experiences favorably conditions the feeling of self-esteem, even in contexts of low educational quality.

The prevalence is on the rise worldwide, with a current frequency of 200 per 10 000 children. There is no established prevalence in Colombia, according to the Colombian Autism League. The incidence rate is on the rise, unclear if the increase is related to changes in the diagnostic criteria, the study methodology, an actual increase in the incidence of autism, or a combination of these factors. Objective: to characterize a group of patients with autism spectrum disorder and to recognize socio-environmental changes related to the population described. Methods: A descriptive observational study. Patients between 1 and 18 years of age, clinically diagnosed by neurology and child psychiatry, with autism spectrum disorder, between 2011 and 2017, in a reference center for pediatric neurological rehabilitation. Results: Data were obtained from 253 patients with autism spectrum disorders, with a mean age of symptom onset of 22.4 months (SD = 9.72) and an age at diagnosis of 43.2 months. The most frequent autism spectrum disorder was grade 1 or mild (39.5 %), the most common symptom being motor stereotypies (78.3 %), followed by interaction and social communication deficit (75.5 %).

It seeks to: 1) show how clientelism works, taking the municipality of Barranquilla, Colombia, as a reference; 2) propose explanations to grasp the clientelist rationale; and 3) investigate its effects on the democratic regime. From a historical-institutional perspective, we argue that clientelism in Barranquilla has a personalistic rather than a partisan nature, as a result of political arrangements and institutional changes that have taken place in Colombia since the mid-20 century.

Service infrastructure support for e-learning has moved to the cloud. For this reason, the efficient provisioning of resources for such platforms, which is achieved through prediction, is very relevant. The existing techniques for predicting the use of resources in the cloud are not designed with e-learning’s specific requirements. This paper presents a neural network-based model for predicting the usage of computational resources for e-learning platforms. This model consists of a series of interconnected neural networks used to predict values for variables of interest, such as Random Access Memory (RAM) usage and Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage. Using data collected from a high school real scenario, we analyzed and used it to train and validate our neural network-based model. This scenario consisted of a Moodle server deployed in a Google Virtual Machine with a configured course and its contents. Each student performed a series of activities while connected to it. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy. The obtained results are promising, paving the way towards constructing software tools for provisioning computational resources on demand for e-learning platforms.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-06-18,2021-01-01,9,,89798-89811,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ariza, Jorge; Jimeno, Miguel; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Capacho, Jose","Ariza, Jorge (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 08001, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 08001, Colombia); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 08001, Colombia); Capacho, Jose (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, 08001, Colombia)","Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte)","Ariza, Jorge (Universidad del Norte); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Capacho, Jose (Universidad del Norte)",8,4,,2.99,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09459736.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138987710,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

University teaching is increasingly utilizing these audiovisual, digital and multimedia resources to provide a better learning experience. For the production of these materials, designated spaces have been created, however, there is a lack of consensus regarding the name attributed to them. In this study, we carried out a bibliographical review of the production of educational audiovisual content and the spaces devoted to this end in order to contextualise it prior to the in-depth interviews. With the aim of getting to know and delve deeper into the audiovisual proposals that are taking place in the Ibero-American sphere, we interviewed the people responsible for these innovative spaces in three universities. We concluded that the three institutions dedicated human resources, equipment and specialised spaces for video development; pedagogical support is necessary to outline the educational intention of the materials to be created; and it is necessary to empower both teachers and students in the development and curation of materials. The results may be useful for other universities and centres interested in venturing into video production, as well as for collaboration opportunities to enrich the learning experience and teacher training.",,,RIED Revista Iberoamericana de Educación a Distancia,,,,2021-10-06,2021,2021-10-06,,25,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Toscano-Alonso, María; Aguaded, Ignacio; Salcedo, Edna M.

Most of these applications trust that the blockchain will prevent issues like fraud, thanks to the built-in cryptographic mechanisms provided by the data structure and the consensus protocol. However, blockchains suffer from what is called a 51% attack or majority attack, which is considered a high risk for the integrity of these blockchains, where if a miner, or a group of them, has more than half the computing capability of the network, it can rewrite the blockchain. Even though this attack is possible in theory, it is regarded as hard-achievable in practice, due to the assumption that, with enough active members, it is very complicated to have that much computing power; however, this assumption has not been studied with enough detail. In this work, a detailed characterization of the miners in the Bitcoin and Crypto Ethereum blockchains is presented, with the aim of proving the computing distribution assumption and creating profiles that may allow the detection of anomalous behaviors and prevent 51% attacks. The results of the analysis show that, in the last years, there has been an increasing concentration of hash rate power in a very small set of miners, which generates a real risk for current blockchains. Also, that there is a pattern in mining among the main miners, which makes it possible to identify out-of-normal behavior.",,"This work was supported in part by the Program “Convocatoria 779 de 2017—Doctorado Nacional Convocatoria para la Formación de Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Boyacá–2017,” and in part by the Universidad del Norte.",IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-10-11,2021-01-01,9,,140549-140564,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres; Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval; Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo; Wightman, Pedro","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia; Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Santo Tomás, Tunja, 150009, Colombia); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia; Group of Analysis, Security and Systems (GASS), Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (DISIA), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Office 431, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), 28040, Madrid, Spain); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, 081001, Colombia); Wightman, Pedro (Escuela de Ingeniería, Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, 111711, Colombia)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás)","Aponte-Novoa, Fredy Andres (Universidad del Norte; Universidad Santo Tomás); Orozco, Ana Lucila Sandoval (Universidad del Norte; Complutense University of Madrid); Villanueva-Polanco, Ricardo (Universidad del Norte); Wightman, Pedro (Universidad del Rosario)",63,50,,22.43,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09567686.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141793811,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

However, the migratory process and assimilation of behaviors after extended exposure to the host country could increase the consumption of these substances. The aim of this study was to compare cigarette and alcohol consumption among Colombian migrants and Chileans residing in Chile.
METHODS: In 2019, data were collected from 963 Colombian migrants and 909 Chileans in three cities in Chile. The chi-squared test was used to analyze significant differences in cigarette and alcohol consumption between the groups. Subsequently, the relative risk (RR) and corresponding p-values were obtained.
RESULTS: Colombian migrants had a significantly lower consumption of cigarettes than Chileans (16.6% and 25.1%, respectively). Regarding alcohol consumption, Colombian migrants reported lower consumption than Chileans (43.3% and 48.4 %, respectively ).
CONCLUSIONS: The lower consumption of cigarettes and alcohol by Colombian migrants compared to Chileans is positive for the health of migrants. However, it is advisable to promote health interventions to avoid an increase in the consumption of these substances, especially considering that migrants could assimilate the consumption habits of Chileans.","This research was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo -ANID (Ex CONICYT), through the project FONDECYT (Grants: 1140843 and 1180315).",,Tobacco Induced Diseases,,,,2021-12-07,2021,2021-12-07,2021-12-07,19,December,1-5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hun, Nelson; Urzúa, Alfonso; Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra; López-Espinoza, Antonio; Aragón, Diego","Hun, Nelson (Escuela de Nutrición y Dietética, Facultad de Salud, Universidad Santo Tomás, Antofagasta, Chile; Instituto de Investigaciones en Comportamiento Alimentario y Nutrición, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ciudad Guzmán, México); Urzúa, Alfonso (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile); López-Espinoza, Antonio (Instituto de Investigaciones en Comportamiento Alimentario y Nutrición, Universidad de Guadalajara, Ciudad Guzmán, México); Aragón, Diego (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile)","Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North)","Hun, Nelson (Universidad Santo Tomás; University of Guadalajara); Urzúa, Alfonso (Catholic University of the North); Caqueo-Urízar, Alejandra (University of Tarapacá); López-Espinoza, Antonio (University of Guadalajara); Aragón, Diego (University of Valparaíso)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/pdf-143088-70304?filename=Cigarette and alcohol.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143696576,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Results and discussion: It was found that changes in the organizational structure, service management practices, and patterns of significance of the subjects in the hospital are mediated by institutionalized precepts in the health field. Nevertheless, the hospital focuses its attention on aligning itself with the institutionalized arrangements in the health field, thus achieving legitimacy and permanence, but distancing itself from the mission.

Aims: To present relevant and updated information about genetic, pathophysiological and clinical processes  related to Intracranial Germ Cell Tumors. Development: Systematic research of scientific publications, by using the PICO strategy, in electronic databases. Conclusions: Intracranial germ cell tumors are classified into Germinoma and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors. These subgroups are very different. The genetic changes that explain the origin of both tumors are completely opposite: Germinomas have DNA hypomethylation while non germinomas have hypermethylation. Histologically, non germinomatous tumors show atipical cells with a high mitotic rate, which confers a poor prognosis, on the contrary to Germinoma, which is less aggressive. The diagnosis involves the measurement of Biomarkers, which are usually negative for the germinoma and positive for non germinomas; neuroimaging does not offer enough differential information, and the confirmation is histological.

The main objective was to deepen the social and ritual aspects of the prehispanic religious system in Atacama (500-1500 AD), based on the archaeological evidence of the hallucinogenic paraphernalia to elucidate the identity of the individuals carrying it and verify the hypothesis about their status as members of the Atacamenian elite. Databases with the information transcribed from the Le Paige Notes for these cemeteries served as a basic instrument; from them, the statistical analysis was structured according to artifact categories that allowed us to establish correlations between the different components of the mortuary offerings, comparing those that included elements of the psychotropic equipment with those that lacked them. Thus, differences emerged in the management of certain goods that made up the “circle of materializing objects” of the Atacamenian elite.

However, in some cases data have dissimilar behaviors that can vary depending on such exogenous variables as the type of day, weather conditions, and geographical area, among others. Commonly, computational intelligence techniques (e.g., artificial neural networks) are used due to their generalization capabilities. In spite of the above, they do not have a unique way to reach optimal performance. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the data’s behavior and their statistical features in order to identify those significant factors in the training process to guarantee a better performance. In this paper is proposed an experimental method for identifying those significant factors in the forecasting model for time series data and measure their effects on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Additionally, we seek to establish optimal parameters for the proper selection of the artificial neural network model.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla–Colombia.","This research was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science and Technology, MINCIENCIAS.

The methodology consists of four variables: type of leader, acquired legitimacy, duration of leadership and the role of the leader after his death. This methodological proposal is used for the stuydy of the rebellion of the Pueblo indians of 1680, wich was led by Popé (Po’pay). The investigation concluded that Popé legitimized his project, mainly in the supernatural forces (he was a Pueblo healer). Although his platform included historical and sociopolitical aspects, the greater weigh that Popé gave to the magical forces caused popular discontent not seeing ther problems solved, despite having returned to the ancestral cult of the Katsina and having “erased” all memories of hispanic colonization. This magical legitimacy of Popé also caused his leadership to last less tan a year, and even possibly caused his death, wich happened in approximately 1690, after several years living in exile.",,,Res Publica Revista de Historia de las Ideas Políticas,,,,2021-06-21,2021,2021-06-21,,24,2,153-160,All OA; Gold,Article,"Martínez, Marco Antonio Gutiérrez","Martínez, Marco Antonio Gutiérrez (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México)",,"Martínez, Marco Antonio Gutiérrez (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México)",0,0,,0.0,https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RPUB/article/download/68990/4564456558160,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139360665,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 43 History, Heritage and Archaeology",

We analyze the duality for $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ -linear matrix codes in the ambient space $(\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}})_{n,m}$ and for both $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ -additive codes and $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}$ -linear codes in the ambient space $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}^{n}$ . Similarly, as in the Euclidean case we establish a relationship between the duality of these families of codes. For this we introduce the concept of $q^{m}$ -duality between bases of $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ and prove that a $q^{m}$ -self dual basis exists if and only if $m$ is an odd integer. We obtain connections on the dual codes in $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}^{n}$ and $(\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}})_{n,m}$ with the corresponding inner products. In particular, we study Hermitian linear complementary dual, Hermitian self-dual and Hermitian self-orthogonal codes in $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}^{n}$ and $(\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}})_{n,m}$ . Furthermore, we present connections between Hermitian $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ -additive codes and Euclidean $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$ -additive codes in $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2m}}^{n}$ .",Javier de la Cruz was with the University of Magdeburg.

The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between Polyvictimization (PV) and Social Welfare (BS). An analytical observational study was designed. First semester students from a public university in the city of Santa Marta, Colombia, participated, who filled out the Trauma Symptoms Verification List (LVST) and the Keyes Social Well-being Scales. 590 students participated, aged between 18 to 57 years (M = 19.83 years; SD = 3.48), 55.3% male and 95.6% residing in socioeconomic stratum 1, 2 and 3. The multivariate analysis was estimated using opportunity ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The PV was related to the dimensions of BS integration (OR = 1,832 95% CI 1,221-2,747), acceptance (OR = 1,663 95% CI 1,125-2,460) and social contribution OR = 1,715 95% CI 1,055-2,789).

                    In autoimmune vasculitis, autoantibodies to Human Proteinase 3 (PR3), a human serine protease, seems to have a role on the inception of c-ANCA associated vasculitis. The origin of this autoreactive response remains unclear. However, for several autoreactive responses, molecular mimicry between environmental antigens and human proteins is key to trigger autoantibodies and finally autoimmunity manifestations. Considering that PR3 is a serine protease and house dust mite (HDM) group 3 allergens share this biochemical activity, the aim of this study was to identify cross-reactive epitopes between serine proteases from human and mites using an
                    in silico
                    approach.
                  
                  
                    Methods:
                    Multi alignment among amino acid sequences of PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens was performed to explore identity and structural homology. ElliPro and BepiPred

                    Results:
                    PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens shared moderate identity and structural homology (root mean square deviation < 1). One B cell cross reactive epitope among serine proteases was identified (29I, 30V, 31G, 32G, 34E, 36K, 37A, 38L, 39A and 54C) and two T cell epitopes.

El cambio climático, la intensificación de desastres ambientales a escala planetaria y la pandemia del Covid-19 son algunos de los principales fenómenos que, al amenazar nuestra existencia, nos recuerdan también la ambivalencia de las fuerzas vitales. Por un lado, se reafirma la idea del Antropoceno, una reificación del dominio de los humanos sobre la tierra que los ha convertido en una fuerza geológica. Esta idea ya ha sido suficientemente criticada por desdibujar las diferencias sociales (Biermann et al., 2016), subestimar el lugar del capitalismo y su historicidad en la naturaleza (Moore, 2017), y por estar marcada por enfoques masculinistas y tecnonormativos (Grusin, 2017). Aun así, existe un consenso sobre el origen antrópico de la crisis ambiental global actual. Por otro lado, la intensidad y frecuencia crecientes en la ocurrencia de desastres ambientales nos muestra que las transformaciones antrópicas del entorno pueden llevar a un escalamiento de fuerzas que se vuelcan sobre los humanos y que superan cualquier intento de control.

We find that expansionary policies are desirable but that they alone cannot prevent the acceleration of the pandemic. We also model supplementary policies, especially public health policies, and find that in their presence expansionary economic policies can put the economy on track while simultaneously addressing the pandemic. Our analysis’s implications are straightforward: countercyclical economic policies are desirable when there are other supplementary policies. A limitation of our analysis is that it is circumscribed to the Mexican context. The paper is a novel contribution to the burgeoning literature on Covid-19 in Mexico because it is the first which formally examines the issue of expansionary policies during the pandemic.

Para ello el estudio se enfocó en una revisión documental cuyos autores hicieron énfasis en el uso de las TICS para fortalecer las competencias comunicativas de los estudiantes, como Cariaga (2018), Chao (2014), Hernández (2017), entre otros. En este orden, la investigación, inscrita en el paradigma cualitativo, tuvo entre sus resultados que las TIC´S permiten tanto al docente como al estudiante, tener acceso a diversos materiales y niveles de interacción, ya sea docente- estudiante o estudiantes – estudiantes, lo que sin duda fortalece el proceso de enseñanza – aprendizaje. Asimismo, durante la revisión de la literatura se pudo constatar que el estudio de las herramientas TIC´S a nivel universitario amerita una investigación mucho más detallada y rigurosa, puesto que es un tema con una gran cantidad de matices.

Specifically, we add to previous literature by considering not only product innovation, but also exploratory (long-term) and exploitative (short-term) results. We administer a tailored survey to firms collaborating with the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and data was completed with secondary sources. Results based on a sample of 756 firms suggest that firms consider all types of result as moderately important to them.

However, reanalysis datasets require detailed validation to determine their accuracy and reliability. This paper evaluates the performance of MERRA2 and ERA5 regarding their monthly rainfall products, comparing their areal precipitation averages with estimates based on ground measurement records from 49 rain gauges managed by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) and the Thiessen polygons method in the Sinu River basin, Colombia. The performance metrics employed in this research are the correlation coefficient, the bias, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results show that ERA5 generally outperforms MERRA2 in the study area. However, both reanalyses consistently overestimate the monthly averages calculated from IDEAM records at all time and spatial scales. The negative NSE values indicate that historical monthly averages from IDEAM records are better predictors than both MERRA2 and ERA5 rainfall products.",,,Atmosphere,,,,2021-10-29,2021,2021-10-29,,12,11,1430,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vega-Durán, Jean; Escalante-Castro, Brigitte; Canales, Fausto A.; Acuña, Guillermo J.; Kaźmierczak, Bartosz","Vega-Durán, Jean (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 #55-66, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Escalante-Castro, Brigitte (Department of Civil and Environmental, Universidad de la Costa, Calle 58 #55-66, Barranquilla 080002, Colombia); Canales, Fausto A.

Los resultados indicaron tres temas maestros: la persona en la esquizofrenia, las experiencias previas a la hospitalización, y la hospitalización como una experiencia compleja. El análisis permite considerar la importancia del ingreso voluntario o involuntario en la experiencia de admisión, la angustia e incertidumbre por falta de información, la escasa participación en el proceso de tratamiento, y la percepción de inseguridad dentro de las instituciones de internación. Por otra parte, se hizo mención al rechazo al uso de la contención o aislamiento, la falta de actividades, el énfasis en la medicación, el diagnóstico y los síntomas, así como la actitud deshumanizada de algunos profesionales de la salud mental.

Hence, Lacan modifies the Freudian idea of a remainder not expelled from the death drive that remains inside the individual, understanding this idea as the pain through which the subject apprehends the pain of existing by recognizing himself merely as a link of the signifying chain—the incorporation of the signifier, the jouissance, is fundamentally masochistic. It is difficult, however, to delimit the difference between his notion of the neurotic's masochistic phantasy or the perverse masochism, and the masochism inherent to the genesis of the subject as presented by Lacan, that is, as a remainder of the subjective division.

De este modo, la idea freudiana de un resto no expulsado de la pulsión de muerte que permanece en el interior del individuo es modificada por Lacan entendiéndola como el dolor a través del cual el sujeto aprehende el dolor de existir al reconocerse como solo un eslabón de la cadena significante.

Cogeneration improves fuel utilization by taking advantage of the energy discharged as waste heat in the exhaust gases. This case study assesses the effects of high ambient temperature on the performance of a natural gas-based cogeneration plant in Barranquilla, Colombia, a location with a hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year with an annual average temperature of 27.4 °C. The cogeneration plant encompasses gas and vapor turbine generation, supplementary fire, waste heat recovery, and process heat exchange. Validated ASPENHYSYS® simulation allows comparing gas-turbine-alone indicators with those at ISO conditions, i.e., 15 °C and 101.3 kPa. Ambient temperature reduces gas turbine power output by up to 22% and decreases thermal efficiency by around 0.06% for every °C rise above ISO conditions. Cogeneration with and without supplementary fire increases power output by 17% and 5% compared to gas-turbine-alone operation. The energy utilization factor increases by 27–37% without supplementary fire and above 37% with supplementary fire. Results give insight into the challenges of cogeneration plants in a tropical climate. Further studies should include the effects of high humidity on power plant performance and the potential benefits of cooling inlet air.","The authors acknowledge the support from UNIVERSIDAD DEL NORTE.

ABSTRACT: The final objective of this work is the analysis of discursive regularities present in commercials regarding Distance Education (DE), considering the legal formalization process of the modality in Brazil. Therefore, we selected the “Inspiring Stories” campaign, composed of five videos and produced by the University of Northern Paraná (Unopar) - Higher Education Institution (HEI) of private initiative that has more than 300 thousand students spread across the country. Before the analytical process, made with contributions from the French Discourse Analysis (DA), we explored historical and political aspects related to the formalization and expansion of the modality in Brazil, as well its relationship with higher education. As conclusion, we understand that, in the search for an increasingly large number of students, the speeches are not always faithful to the initial ideals aimed at the regulation of distance education, linked to the democratization of access to higher education, and start to explore discursive paths such as the ease of obtaining an undergraduate degree.

This approach is compared with that of ontological personalism and the results of the so-called ""post-metaphysical"" attempt to achieve a philosophy of communion that overcomes humanism.

The proposal uses a controller that can provide the system with accurate power sharing among distributed generators installed in the microgrid once some load variations are presented in the network. The methodology uses a virtual current loop introduced into the current controller of the inverter to optimize the output signal, which goes directly to the PWM. This virtual current is obtained by using a virtual impedance loop. Furthermore, a small-signal model of the system is used to check stability of the proposed control strategy, which was developed for island mode operation of the microgrid. Simulations were performed for a microgrid with two generators and a load with five households and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink software. The results show that the model provides a wide margin of stability and a rapid response when electrical loads change, thus fulfilling the reactive power sharing among generators. The proposed method shows a large margin of stability and a rapid transient response of the system.",,,International Journal of Power Electronics and Drive Systems (IJPEDS),,,,2021-03-01,2021,2021-03-01,,12,1,99-111,All OA; Gold,Article,"Molina-Viloria, Eder A.; Becerra, John Edwin Candelo; Velasco, Fredy Edimer Hoyos","Molina-Viloria, Eder A.

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a frequent threat to computer networks because of its disruption to the services they cause. This disruption results in the instability and/or inoperability of the network. There are different classes of DDoS attacks, each with a different mode of operation, so detecting them has become a difficult task for network monitoring and control systems. The objective of this work is based on the exploration and choice of a set of data that represents DDoS attack events, on their treatment in a preprocessing phase, and later, the generation of a model of sequential neural networks of multi-class classification. This is done to identify and classify the various types of DDoS attacks. The result was compared with previous works treating the same dataset used herein. We compared their classification method, against ours. During this research, the CIC DDoS2019 dataset was used. Previous works carried out with this dataset proposed a binary classification approach, our approach is based on multi-classification.

1638,pub.1138128866,10.3390/electronics10101191,,,A Simple WiFi Harvester with a Switching-Based Power Management Scheme to Collect Energy from Ordinary Routers,"This paper shows the design process of a simplified harvesting circuit for WiFi at the 2.4 GHz frequency band based on the analysis of the environment available signals. Those signals and their power level define an antenna design to maximize captured energy and select the proper number of stages for a voltage multiplier so that an impedance matching network is no longer required. With this, it is possible to maintain the harvester architecture simple without sacrificing performance. The use of supercapacitors is preferred over batteries due to their high-power capacity, the ability to deliver high peak currents, long-life cycle size, and low cost. Hence, supercapacitor availability allows to devise a novel switching scheme that employs two units that favor energy use and speed up the recharging process. The built harvester exhibits a power conversion efficiency greater than 50% under an incident signal of 0 dBm in the rectenna. The tests are carried out in an academic environment using a multi SSID router, collecting 494 mJ without requiring special modifications in the router used as an energy source.","This work was supported by Universidad del Norte, and by the College of Engineering, Institución Universitaria ITSA Barranquilla—Colombia.",This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2021-05-17,2021,2021-05-17,,10,10,1191,All OA; Gold,Article,"Angulo, Fernando; Navarro, Loraine; M., Christian G.

A partir de esto, analizamos dos conflictos armados que tienen lugar en el Caribe: el de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta y el del sur de Córdoba.

This study aims to evaluate some factors that facilitate and hinder the pedagogical use of ICT in the context of learning English as a second language (L2) at preschool education levels. Through the methodology of Design Thinking, it is possible to structure the characteristics that a playful interface should have in order to support this educational process and, especially, to satisfy the needs of an environment that intends to make the most of the technological resources it has. To this end, this methodology takes into account the experience of direct users (children), indirect users (teachers) and the socio-economic dimension of educational centres, headed by managers. In this sense, two ad hoc questionnaires were completed by the school executives and teachers, respectively, in a specific educational context of Barranquilla, Colombia. The questionnaires were administered to 25 schools. Data analysis showed the importance of ICT in improving the teaching and assessment process. At the same time, it shows the levels of frustration of some teachers who use technologies with low levels of training or with self-generated content that limit the use of ICT in an appropriate way.

1562,pub.1138676027,10.3390/app11115282,,,Combustion and Performance Evaluation of a Spark Ignition Engine Operating with Acetone–Butanol–Ethanol and Hydroxy,"Alternative fuels for internal combustion engines (ICE) emerge as a promising solution for a more sustainable operation. This work assesses combustion and performance of the dual-fuel operation in the spark ignition (SI) engine that simultaneously integrates acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) and hydroxy (HHO) doping. The study evaluates four fuel blends that combine ABE 5, ABE 10, and an HHO volumetric flow rate of 0.4 LPM. The standalone gasoline operation served as the baseline for comparison. We constructed an experimental test bench to assess operation conditions, fuel mode, and emissions characteristics of a 3.5 kW-YAMAHA engine coupled to an alkaline electrolyzer. The study proposes thermodynamic and combustion models to evaluate the performance of the dual-fuel operation based on in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion temperature, fuel properties, energy distribution, and emissions levels. Results indicate that ABE in the fuel blends reduces in-cylinder pressure by 10–15% compared to the baseline fuel. In contrast, HHO boosted in-cylinder pressure up to 20%. The heat release rate and combustion temperature follow the same trend, corroborating that oxygen enrichment enhances gasoline combustion. The standalone ABE operation raises fuel consumption by around 10–25 g∙kWh−1 compared to gasoline depending on the load, whereas HHO decreases fuel consumption by around 25%. The dual-fuel operation shows potential for mitigating CO, HC, and smoke emissions, although NOx emissions increased. The implementation of dual-fuel operation in SI engines represents a valuable tool for controlling emissions and reducing fuel consumption while maintaining combustion performance and thermal efficiency.","Acknowledgments to Universidad del Atlántico through the project ING81-CII2019 “Estudio experimental de la sustitución parcial de combustible con HIDROXY (HHO) en motores térmicos de encendido por compresión y la influencia sobre sus prestaciones”, Universidad del Norte, Sphere Energy Company for the support provided for the investigative internship of Daniel Maestre, and Colombian Institute for Scientific and Technological Development (COLCIENCIAS) through the “Convocatoria 809 Minciencias, Formación de capital humano de alto nivel para las regiones- Atlántico” for the support provided.",This research received no external funding.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-06-07,2021,2021-06-07,,11,11,5282,All OA; Gold,Article,"Guillin-Estrada, Wilson; Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel; Bula-Silvera, Antonio; Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo; Duarte-Forero, Jorge","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson (UREMA Research Unit, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@uninorte.edu.co, (W.G.-E.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.-S.);, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co, (A.G.-Q.)); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (KAÍ Research Unit, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, dmaestre@est.uniatlantico.edu.co); Bula-Silvera, Antonio (UREMA Research Unit, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@uninorte.edu.co, (W.G.-E.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.-S.);, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co, (A.G.-Q.)); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (UREMA Research Unit, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 Vía Puerto Colombia, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, wguillin@uninorte.edu.co, (W.G.-E.);, abula@uninorte.edu.co, (A.B.-S.);, arturoq@uninorte.edu.co, (A.G.-Q.)); Duarte-Forero, Jorge (KAÍ Research Unit, Universidad del Atlántico, Carrera 30 Número 8-49, Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 080007, Colombia;, dmaestre@est.uniatlantico.edu.co)","Duarte-Forero, Jorge (University of Atlántico)","Guillin-Estrada, Wilson (Universidad del Norte); Maestre-Cambronel, Daniel (University of Atlántico); Bula-Silvera, Antonio (Universidad del Norte); Gonzalez-Quiroga, Arturo (Universidad del Norte); Duarte-Forero, Jorge (University of Atlántico)",8,5,,1.89,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/5282/pdf?version=1623060818,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138676027,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

1558,pub.1140791644,10.3390/app11178092,,,QoS-Based Pattern Recognition Approach for Web Service Discovery: Ar_WSDS,"Web service composition requires high levels of integration and reliability of the services involved in its operation, which must meet specific quality criteria to ensure their proper execution and deployment. The discovery and selection of web services currently face optimization problems. Many services might satisfy a requirement with similar quality criteria. Because of this, software developers have to choose the most appropriate services for a given composition, complicated by the rapid increase in providers and services available in the cloud. Service composition also implies coupling according to a composition flow and non-functional requirement criteria. Such requirements make selection and composition a complex task not previously solved in the literature. This paper presents Ar_WSDS, a computational approach for web services discovery and selection in cloud environments, which bases its implementation on the brain’s pattern recognition systematic functioning. This process allows classifying web services through recognition modules created dynamically based on their quality parameters, resulting in a set of web services suitable for a web service composition. This approach allows a solution to the selection problem using less complex tasks. This paper introduces an architectural and procedural definition that provides the web service description with a pattern to recognize and select services using different recognition levels. We simulated our approach and evaluated it using a dataset from the QWS project that offers a set of quality criteria collected from different providers. The web services are recognized and classified using different quality criteria for the composition and each of their services. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovery and selection process compared to other approaches. Furthermore, Ar_WSDS allows us to recognize and filter out web services with ambiguity and similarity in their provider information, a process that minimizes the discovery space for services.",The first author expresses his deep thanks to the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander and Universidad del Norte for their academic support.,The first author received a Doctoral scholarship from the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander of Colombia.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-08-31,2021,2021-08-31,,11,17,8092,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adarme, Marco; Jimeno, Miguel","Adarme, Marco (Department of Systems and Informatics, Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta 540003, Colombia); Jimeno, Miguel (Systems Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia;, majimeno@uninorte.edu.co)","Adarme, Marco (Francisco de Paula Santander University)","Adarme, Marco (Francisco de Paula Santander University); Jimeno, Miguel (Universidad del Norte)",3,2,,1.3,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/17/8092/pdf?version=1631065283,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140791644,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4612 Software Engineering,

Textual analyses of the depositions of five former German prisoners of the Polish concentration camp show that German native speakers use both tenses in their spoken interactions. These results widely contradict their depiction in DAF materials, textbooks, and grammars. Furthermore, the types of Präteritum found are far more diverse than is traditionally held by scholars, who claimed that the use of this tense in spoken language is limited to verbs such as sein (to be), haben (to have) and modals, such as können (can), müssen (must), sollen (should), etc. The outcome of this study shows how the difference between Perfekt and Präteritum is determined by the subjective attitude of the speakers in relation to the information they want to convey.",,,Linguistic Frontiers,,,,2021-09-01,2021,2021-10-14,2021-09-01,4,2,31-37,All OA; Gold,Article,"Concu, Valentina","Concu, Valentina (Assistant Professor.

Furthermore, the types of Präteritum found are far more diverse than is traditionally held by scholars, who claimed that the use of this tense in spoken language is limited to verbs such as sein (to be), haben (to have) and modals, such as können (can), müssen (must), sollen (should), etc. The outcome of this study shows how the difference between Perfekt and Präteritum is determined by the subjective attitude of the speakers in relation to the information they want to convey.",,,Linguistic Frontiers,,,,2021-05-29,2021,2021-05-29,,0,0,000010247820210002,All OA; Gold,Article,"Concu, Valentina","Concu, Valentina (Assistant Professor.

Además, enfrentan problemas ambientales propios de las grandes aglomeraciones urbanas, tales como desequilibrios en la disponibilidad y demanda de agua potable, sobregeneración de residuos sólidos y deficiencias en su tratamiento. En este artículo nos preguntamos por la relación entre la segregación espacial, la satisfacción con el entorno y los comportamientos responsables con el medio ambiente, con base en un análisis multivariado de los datos de la Encuesta de Percepción Ciudadana 2017 aplicada en la ciudad de Barranquilla, Colombia. Los resultados sustentan la existencia de una relación entre los segregación, satisfacción y comportamientos y sugieren dos matices importantes relacionados con los comportamientos que suceden en los espacios privados o públicos, de un lado y con la relación de propiedad o arriendo de las viviendas, de otro.
Resumo As urbes latino-americanas são segregadas espacialmente, os cidadãos de ingressos altos costumam habitar nos entornos com maior segurança, melhor urbanizados e com melhor acesso a serviços. Além do mais, enfrentam problemas ambientais próprios das grandes aglomerações urbanas, tais como desequilíbrios na disponibilidade e demanda de água potável, superprodução de resíduos sólidos e deficiências no seu tratamento. Este artigo nos perguntamos pela relação entre segregação espacial, satisfação com o entorno e os comportamentos responsáveis com o meio ambiente, com base em uma análise multivariada dos dados da Enquete de Perceção Cidadã 2017, para a cidade de Barranquilla na Colômbia.

Abstract Latin American cities are segregated in space in ways that high-income citizens tend to live in safer, better-urbanized neighborhoods, with better access to services. Also, they face environmental problems that are typical of large cities, such as imbalances in the availability and demand of drinking water, over-generation of solid waste, and deficiencies in their treatment. In this article we ask about the relationship between spatial segregation, satisfaction with the neighborhood and responsible behavior with the environment, based on a multivariate analysis of the data of the Survey of Citizen Perception 2017, for Barranquilla city in Colombia. The results support the existence of a relationship between segregation, satisfaction and behaviors and suggest two important nuances related to the behaviors that occur in private or public spaces, on the one hand, and with the relationship of ownership or rental of homes, on the other.",,,urbe Revista Brasileira de Gestão Urbana,,,,2021,2021,2021,,13,,e20210043,All OA; Gold,Article,"Reyes, Paola García; Vargas, Natalia Andrea Hernández; Lenis, Ciro David Murillo","Reyes, Paola García (Universidad del Norte de Colombia, Colombia); Vargas, Natalia Andrea Hernández (Universidad del Norte de Colombia, Colombia); Lenis, Ciro David Murillo (Universidad del Norte de Colombia, Colombia)",,"Reyes, Paola García (Universidad del Norte de Colombia, Colombia); Vargas, Natalia Andrea Hernández (Universidad del Norte de Colombia, Colombia); Lenis, Ciro David Murillo (Universidad del Norte de Colombia, Colombia)",1,1,,,https://www.scielo.br/j/urbe/a/9GyfTbG4sCVQ5wFk4SmwFkB/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143465831,,

Esta es una investigación cualitativa, con diseño fenomenológico-hermenéutico y teoría de representaciones sociales, que empleó como técnicas entrevistas a profundidad y análisis de contenido. Los hallazgos mostraron que la violencia para regular comportamiento, validación por celotipia, medidas conciliatorias y el supuesto agrado de las mujeres son formas legitimadoras de violencia en parejas heterosexuales. Se concluye que esta violencia se ha legitimado y naturalizado por el anclaje de representaciones, estereotipos y creencias, que ratifican el control de los hombres sobre las mujeres, en especial de su sexualidad y su cuerpo, como cosas de propiedad para el deleite y formas de autoridad, poder, control y desigualdad, que, a su vez, son permeadas por el modelo patriarcal.
Abstract This study aimed to show the social representations related to female victims, aggressors and services providers as great legitimizers of violence against women, considering their gender and social practice in Barranquilla, Colombia. This is a qualitative research, with a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach and the theory of social representations, which used in depth interviews and content analysis as data collection technique. Findings suggest violence used to regulate behavior, passionate jealousy, conciliatory strategies and the assumed women satisfaction are legal means of violence in heterosexual couples. We conclude this type of violence has been established due to social representations, stereotypes and beliefs that reinforce male dominance, especially over female sexuality and body as properties for their pleasure and forms of authority, power, control and inequality, which are imposed by the patriarchal model.",,,Saúde e Sociedade,,,,2021,2021,2021,,30,1,e190417,All OA; Gold,Article,"Idárraga, Angélica Orozco; Caro, Aura Aguilar; Macías, María Amarís","Idárraga, Angélica Orozco (Corporación Universitaria Rafael Núñez.

In Pakistan, the concept becomes even more foreign and muddled with certain stubborn biases which needs to be accessed. Therefore, we conducted a study to identify the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with behaviors regarding health and general well-being. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural health centers (RHCs) of five districts of Sindh, Pakistan, from October 2020 to December 2020. A survey questionnaire was designed to collect data on socio-economic and demographic factors and their impacts on behavior towards health and general well-being. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA Version 16.0. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the extent of association between predictor variables and outcome variables. Results: A total of 969 respondents participated in the study. The mean age of the respondents was 35.70 (±13.17) years. Majority of the participants (82.77%) had limited access to the required health care facility and only (3.61%) of respondents reported that they regularly consult with disease specialists. Multivariable logistic regression revealed the ability to bear disease expenses (OR=0.55, p=0.009), level of education (OR=1.81, p=0.026), female gender (OR=0.30, p=0.048), access to required health facilities (OR=0.58, p=0.012) were significantly associated with positive behavior towards health and general well-being. Conclusions: The study shows that ease of access to healthcare facilities would encourage the population to seek more healthy behaviors.

The topological, physicochemical, thermodynamic, electronic, and charge descriptors were evaluated to cover a wide range of properties that frequently encode biological activity. A model with high predictive value was obtained based on geometrical descriptors and descriptors encoding hydrophobicity and London dispersion forces as necessary for the inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi-CYP51.

State of the Art Review","The use of renewable energy sources, especially wind energy, has been widely developed, mostly during the last decade. The main objective of the present study is to conduct a literature review focused on the evaluation under uncertainty of wind energy investment using the real options approach to find out whether public opposition (NIMBY projects) has been contemplated, and if so, what have been the flexible strategies applied for its intervention. Overall, 97 publications were analyzed, identifying 20 different models or approaches, which were grouped into eight categories: 1. Real options, 2. Optimization, 3. Stochastics, 4. Financial evaluation, 5. Probabilistic, 6. Estimation, 7. Numerical prediction, and 8. Others. The real options approach, present in 32% of the studies, was the most popular. Twenty-eight types of uncertainties were identified, which were grouped, for better analysis, into nine categories. In total, 62.5% of the studies included the price of electricity as a source of uncertainty; 18.8%, the velocity of wind; and 15.6%, the feed-in rates-subsidy. Both random and non-random techniques were applied to assess the real options and to model the uncertainties. When evaluating real options, the Monte Carlo simulation technique was the most preferred, with 16 (51.6%) applications, followed by non-randomized techniques, decision tree, and dynamic programming, with eight (25.8%) applications each. There is a marked tendency to use stochastic processes to model uncertainty, particularly geometric Brownian motion, which was used in 61.3% (19) of the studies in the sample. When searching for “real options AND (nimby OR public opposition)”, no study was found, which shows the possibility of developing research on this aspect to determine its impact on investments in wind energy projects.",,"This research was funded by the departmento de La Guajira-Colombia, through the project: Master’s and Doctoral Studies inside and outside the Country for Professionals in the departamento de La Guajira- BPIN 2013000100032, with resources of Direct Allocation of Royalties, granted through the agreement of Condonable Educational Credit PFAN 019 of 2015, executed by the “Universidad de La Guajira”; and the “Universidad del Norte”.",Applied Sciences,,,,2021-10-31,2021,2021-10-31,,11,21,10213,All OA; Gold,Article,"Murgas, Benjamin; Henao, Alvin; Guzman, Luceny","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.)); Guzman, Luceny (Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.))","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia)","Murgas, Benjamin (Administrative Planning Department, Gobernación de La Guajira, Riohacha 440001, Colombia); Henao, Alvin (Universidad del Norte; Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.)); Guzman, Luceny (Universidad del Norte; Industrial Engineering Department, Universidad del Norte, Puerto Colombia 081007, Colombia;, henaoa@uninorte.edu.co, (A.H.);, lguzman@uninorte.edu.co, (L.G.))",9,9,,5.27,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/21/10213/pdf?version=1635928759,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143006869,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 40 Engineering",13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Most research in this field describes measurements and signal processing methods to determine the effect of some design modifications. However, the number of investigations that try to solve the problem from the design stage is much smaller. The following study presents a review of the trends in the analysis of vibrations of power transmission elements and their relationship to the use of systematic design methodologies in the principal power transmission elements. A revision is shown in design considerations to prevent mechanical vibrations or reduce them to acceptable levels. The effects in terms of improvement in reducing vibrations of the most important works that have taken into account the vibrations in design stages are shown. The results show the importance of considering the mechanical vibrations in the design of power transmission elements. Moreover, the analysis of the state of the art shows the areas to be investigated that contemplate the development or application of formal design methodologies that take into account mechanical vibrations.","The authors would like to thank the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Universidad del Norte, and Universidad de Magallanes for their academic support in this research.",The research was supported by MINCIENCIAS through the Ph.D. National Scholarship Program No 785.,Machines,,,,2021-09-25,2021,2021-09-25,,9,10,212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Villalba, Rafael Tuirán; Ramírez, Heriberto Maury; Estrada, Héctor Águila","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Seccional Montería, Cra 6 #97A-99, Montería 230002, Colombia); Ramírez, Heriberto Maury (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Km. 5 vía Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla 081007, Colombia;, hmaury@uninorte.edu.co); Estrada, Héctor Águila (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universidad de Magallanes, Avenida Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas 6200000, Chile;, hector.aguila@umag.cl)","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Pontifical Bolivarian University)","Villalba, Rafael Tuirán (Pontifical Bolivarian University); Ramírez, Heriberto Maury (Universidad del Norte); Estrada, Héctor Águila (University of Magallanes)",5,2,,1.59,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/9/10/212/pdf?version=1632713647,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141438685,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",

La pesquisa se ha centrado en los pobladores locales que regularmente asisten a la posta sanitaria, los enfermeros, los agentes sanitarios y los miembros del equipo de salud itinerante. Resultados: Se ha constatado que los procesos de salud, enfermedad y cura no se limitan al cuerpo humano, sino que también en ellos intervienen el paisaje y los seres que lo pueblan. Se ha identificado que en la resolución de numerosas patologías resulta central la figura del especialista ritual. Se ha determinado la gente valora y utiliza la biomedicina, aunque la asistencia a la institución hospitalaria suele ser rehuida. Conclusión: Se ha identificado un uso combinado de ambos sistemas.

La infección por ésta bacteria incrementa el riesgo de padecer cáncer gástrico hasta 6 veces más que los individuos que no presentan la infección. Colombia tiene una prevalencia de infección por Helicobacter pylori del 86% en adultos mayores de 20 años y del 80% en niños mayores de 8 años. La infección persistente y recidivante de la mucosa gástrica puede generar una respuesta inflamatoria, o procesos silentes, que en el peor de los casos puede progresar a un adenocarcinoma gástrico tipo difuso o intestinal. Existen múltiples factores que influyen en las consecuencias clínicas de la infección por Helicobacter pylori, en mención: predisposición genética del huésped, inmunorregulación genética del paciente infectado, factores ambientales y heterogeneidad de los factores de virulencia de las diversas cepas. Por lo anterior se infiere que las patologías gástricas, en especial la gastritis y el adenocarcinoma, son padecimientos de etiología multifactorial que pueden originarse por diversas causas o condiciones.

Materials and methods: systematic review of experimental and observational studies pu- blished up to August 2015 in Pubmed, Embase and Lilacs. Two researchers selected studies that measured the occurrence of asthma in individuals exposed to different environmen- tal temperatures. A meta-analysis used RevMan 5.3’s random effects model to calculate a summary weighted Odds Ratio with 95% confidence intervals, and a sensitivity analysis identified the influence of each study. Subsequent subgroup analyses identified summary measures by type of cold exposure and study design. Additional analysis measured hetero- geneity and risk of bias. Results: we found 86 studies measuring the relation between cold exposure and asthma. We included 11.6% (10/86) of the studies in the meta-analysis and found an association between cold exposure and asthma with all the studies (ORw 2.0 95%CI 1.28-3.14), with the subgroup of experimental studies (ORw 3.8 IC95% 1.70-8.86), and with cold environmental air (ORw 1.59 IC95% 1.10-2.30).

Se incluyeron artículos originales y artículos de revisión. También se incluyeron actualizaciones de las entidades internacionales y nacionales acerca de la situación actual de la infección por SARS-CoV-2 y el manejo de la vía aérea en pacientes con diagnóstico de COVID-19.Resultados: Para el manejo de la vía aérea en pacientes con diagnóstico de COVID-19 es imprescindible el uso del equipo de protección completa. El profesional de la salud debe estar capacitado para la realización de los procedimientos necesarios para llevar a cabo dicho tópico. Se debe tener presente que aplicarlos de forma ordenada, rápida y eficaz reducirá la exposición al SARS-CoV-2.Conclusiones: Se considera que al realizar todos los pasos adecuados para el manejo de la vía aérea en este tipo de pacientes se reducirá notablemente la posibilidad de contagio de un profesional de la salud.

La transmisión de la ACF es autosómica dominante. Los homocigotos (SS), no sintetizan Hb A y poseen eritrocitos con un 90% de Hb S. El portador o heterocigoto (AS) tiene hematíes con Hb A mayor al 50% y Hb S de 20 – 40% y son usualmente asintomáticos. La Hb S se debe a una mutación en el gen de la cadena beta de globina, lo que conlleva a la polimerización de la Hb en condiciones de baja oxigenación, originándose un cambio en la morfología del eritrocito adquiriendo la forma falciforme. La sintomatología es secundaria a la anemia hemolítica crónica, la vaso–oclusión en los diferentes órganos y la asplenia funcional la cual predispone a la infección. Otras manifestaciones asociadas son el secuestro esplénico, la aplasia eritroide y las complicaciones órgano – especificas, que disminuyen la calidad de vida y predisponen a mayor mortalidad.

Comparing the distributional effects of Bus Rapid Transit on commute times in Cape Town, South Africa, and Barranquilla, Colombia","Bus rapid transit has become an increasingly popular investment in cities in the Global South, where policy discourse often positions BRT as a pro-poor investment. Planners usually expect BRT to reduce commute times in urban areas, particularly for economically disadvantaged populations, thus reducing mobility gaps between transit users across different socioeconomic population groups. Despite increased interest in BRT, there is surprisingly limited research testing these assumptions. Using data from a retrospective survey administered in Barranquilla, Colombia, and Cape Town, South Africa, we investigated whether BRT contributes to reducing commute time gaps between socioeconomic populations. Our comparative and distributional analyses indicate that, while BRT narrowed the gap in commute times in Cape Town, it did not contribute to closing the gap in Barranquilla. We argue that this contradiction may, in part, be explained by the degree to which BRT route configuration responded to the urban form and pre-BRT transit conditions in each city—two factors often overlooked in academic literature and discussions surrounding BRT planning. We close by providing policy recommendations that promote more equitable planning practices and recognize the links between transport and land uses in the Global South urban context.",,,Journal of Transport and Land Use,,,,2021-06-20,2021,2021-06-20,,14,1,647-667,All OA; Gold,Article,"Palacios, Manuel Santana; Rayle, Lisa","Palacios, Manuel Santana (University of California berkeley); Rayle, Lisa ()",,"Palacios, Manuel Santana (University of California, Berkeley); Rayle, Lisa ()",1,0,,0.42,https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/download/1907/1565,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139023694,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",15 Life on Land
1507,pub.1137513775,10.1590/1808-057x202112330,,,The impact of MILA market-maker facility on volatility of the Colombian stock market,"ABSTRACT In 2014, the Colombian Stock Exchange commenced the implementation of its market-maker facility (MMF), aiming at improving market efficiency. This paper examines the impact of the MMF program on three volatility-related aspects: volatility persistence, risk premium, and information asymmetry. This paper provides new insights about the anticipated outcomes of Mercados Integrados Latinoamericanos (MILA) reforms, specifically the MMF on the volatility of the Colombian stock market. This topic has not been fully addressed in the existing literature. This study, therefore, provides useful information for regulators and policy makers, in endeavors to address key issues raised during the World Economic Forum (WEF) of 2016. This paper poses a challenge to policy makers and stock market regulators in Colombia to revisit the reform program and address the factors limiting the effectiveness of market reforms. This paper provides justification for replicating the study to cover other MILA countries due to existing differences in some domestic market policies and structures. The paper employs conditional variance models for measuring volatility persistence, risk premia, and information asymmetry. The models are employed on the COLCAP stock index (Colombia) observed from January 17, 2008 to May 30, 2019. Observations are divided into two samples - pre- and post-MMF. This paper provides evidence of the impacts of the MMF reforms in the Colombian stock market. Specifically, the MMF seems to have an impact on the following aspects: (i) the magnitude in which current returns depend on previous returns has increased; (ii) investment portfolio returns, which are generally low, have declined after the MMF, leading to less risk compensation; (iii) the MMF does not seem to have affected the volatility of market returns and information asymmetry; (iv) volatility persistence increased in magnitude.
RESUMO Em 2014, a Bolsa de Valores da Colômbia iniciou a implementação de seu mecanismo de market-maker (MMF), com o objetivo de melhorar a eficiência do mercado. Este artigo examina o impacto do programa MMF em três aspectos relacionados à volatilidade: persistência da volatilidade, prêmio de risco e assimetria de informação. Este artigo fornece novos insights sobre os resultados esperados das reformas dos Mercados Integrados Latinoamericanos (MILA), especificamente do MMF sobre a volatilidade do mercado de ações colombiano, tópico este que não foi totalmente abordado na literatura existente. Este estudo, portanto, fornece informações úteis para reguladores e formuladores de políticas, buscando abordar as principais questões levantadas durante o Fórum Econômico Mundial (WEF) de 2016. Este artigo desafia os formuladores de políticas e reguladores do mercado de ações na Colômbia a revisitarem o programa de reforma e a abordarem os fatores que limitam a eficácia das reformas de mercado. Este artigo fornece justificativas para replicar o estudo para cobrir outros países do MILA devido às diferenças existentes em algumas políticas e estruturas de mercado nacional. O artigo emprega modelos de variância condicional para medir a persistência da volatilidade, prêmios de risco e assimetria de informação. Os modelos são empregados no índice de ações COLCAP (Colômbia), observado de 17 de janeiro de 2008 a 30 de maio de 2019. As observações são divididas em duas amostras - pré- e pós-MMF. Este artigo fornece evidências dos impactos das reformas do MMF no mercado de ações colombiano. Especificamente, o MMF parece ter impacto nos seguintes aspectos: (i) aumentou a magnitude na qual os retornos atuais dependem dos retornos anteriores; (ii) os retornos da carteira de investimentos, que geralmente são baixos, diminuíram após o MMF, levando a uma menor compensação de risco; (iii) o MMF não parece ter afetado a volatilidade dos retornos de mercado e a assimetria de informação; (iv) a persistência da volatilidade aumentou em magnitude.",,,Revista Contabilidade & Finanças,,,,2021-08,2021,2021-08,,32,86,345-358,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lukanima, Benedicto Kulwizira; Gómez-Bravo, Yuli Paola; Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier","Lukanima, Benedicto Kulwizira (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Gómez-Bravo, Yuli Paola (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte, Colombia)",,"Lukanima, Benedicto Kulwizira (Universidad del Norte); Gómez-Bravo, Yuli Paola (Universidad del Norte); Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte)",1,1,,0.59,https://www.scielo.br/j/rcf/a/c45nHwfcdDQkFWJRfww6gGf/?lang=en&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137513775,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",

Although the functional mechanisms that determine the species tolerance to water deficit have been extensively studied in adult individuals, the responses of early ontogenetic stages have been less explored. Objective: To identify functional strategies and trait correlations between different seedlings' dimensions (leaf, stem, and root). We expect limited coordination between above and below-ground functional traits due to a single conservation-acquisition trade-off cannot capture the variability of functions and environmental pressures to which the root system is subjected. Methods: We measured 12 functional traits belonging to 38 seedling species in a tropical dry forest in Colombia. We explored the relationships between pairs of traits using Pearson correlations, and to obtain an integrated view of the functional traits, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Results: The results showed limited evidence of linkage between above- and below-ground traits, but we did find significant correlations between traits for the continuum of conservative and acquisitive strategies. Root traits related to water and nutrient take capacity formed an orthogonal axis to the acquisitive-conservative continuum. Conclusions: Our results showed that dry forest seedlings have different functional strategies to cope with water deficit. The incorporation of root traits helps to explain new functional strategies not reported for leaf and stem traits. This study contributes to understanding the mechanisms that explain species coexistence and is particularly relevant for predicting future forest trajectories.",,,Revista de Biología Tropical,,,,2021-07-06,2021,2021-07-06,,69,2,763-771,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arrieta-González, Rosa; Paez, Juan; Dominguez-Haydar, Yamileth; Negret, Beatriz Salgado","Arrieta-González, Rosa (Universidad Nacional de Colombia); Paez, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Dominguez-Haydar, Yamileth (Universidad del Atlántico); Negret, Beatriz Salgado (Universidad Nacional de Colombia)",,"Arrieta-González, Rosa (National University of Colombia); Paez, Juan (Universidad del Norte); Dominguez-Haydar, Yamileth (Universidad del Atlántico); Negret, Beatriz Salgado (National University of Colombia)",4,1,,1.09,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/46549/47305,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144394884,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,

Volcanism and crustal shortening built up relief in the southernmost Central and Eastern Cordilleras of Colombia, closing this lowland gap. Independent lines of evidence consist first, of field mapping in the Tatacoa Desert with a coverage area of ∼381 km2, 1,165 km of geological contact traces, 164 structural data points, and 3D aerial digital mapping models. This map documents the beginning of southward propagation of the southernmost tip of the Eastern Cordillera’s west-verging, fold-and-thrust belt between ∼12.2 and 13.7 Ma. Second, a compilation of new and published detrital zircon geochronology in middle Miocene strata of the Tatacoa Desert shows three distinctive age populations: middle Miocene, middle Eocene, and Jurassic; the first two sourced west of the Central Cordillera, the latter in the Magdalena Valley. Similar populations with the three distinctive peaks have now been recovered in western Amazonian middle Miocene strata. These observations, along with published molecular and fossil fish data, suggest that by Serravallian times (∼13 Ma), the Northern Andes were separated from the Central Andes at ∼3°N by a fluvial system that flowed into the Amazon Basin through the Tatacoa Desert. This paleogeographic configuration would be similar to a Western Andean, or Marañon Portal. Late Miocene flattening of the subducting Nazca slab caused the eastward migration of the Miocene volcanic arc, so that starting at ∼4 Ma, large composite volcanoes were built up along the axis of today's Central Cordillera, closing this lowland Andean portal and altering the drainage patterns to resemble a modern configuration.",,"The authors would like to thank Carlos Rosero, doña Orfanda, Natalia Pardo, DIDI (Dirección de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación) of Universidad del Norte-Alianza 4U, Semillero Paleontología EAFIT, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Uniandes P12 160422.002/001, Anders Foundation, 1923 Fund, Gregory D. and Jennifer Walston Johnson, and Uniandes field students 2013 to 2017 for their enthusiastic help.

This study focused on assessing the diversity of sand flies in a rural area of El Carmen de Bolívar Municipality, northern Colombia, employing rarefaction curves and Hill numbers to understand potential vector communities and inform environmental management. From January 2018 to April 2019 (five samplings), sand flies were collected using CDC light traps with blue LED in domestic/peridomestic/sylvatic ecotopes, identifying species per Young and Duncan (1994) and Galati (2003). Hill numbers provided diversity estimates across samples, while Principal Component Analysis correlated with environmental factors with phlebotomine species presence and abundance. 8,784 phlebotomine individuals were collected; 56.4 % females and 43.6% males (ratio 3:2). These individuals belonged to eight species: Pintomyia evansi, Psychodopygus panamensis, Lutzomyia gomezi, Micropygomyia cayennensis, Evandromyia dubitans, Psathyromyia aclydifera, Pintomyia serrana, and Pintomyia rangeliana; with Pi. evansi being the most abundant species (74.39 %; 6,530 exemplars). The ANOVA showed no significant differences between phlebotomine sand flies abundances across ecotopes (p = 0.018). Species of epidemiological relevance as Pi. evansi and Lu. gomezi not show a positive correlation with environmental variables evaluated, only Ps. panamensis was positively correlated with precipitation. However, the study emphasizes the need for a continuous sand fly monitoring and research to enhance leishmaniasis control strategies, highlighting the necessity to expand knowledge on phlebotomine diversity and environmental interactions to understand vector ecology and disease dynamics better.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) has been one of the most explored strategies to develop potential drugs against this condition. A diverse dataset of molecules with known experimental inhibitory activity against DPP-4 was constructed and used to develop predictive models using different machine-learning algorithms. Model M36 is the most promising one based on the internal and external performance showing values of Q2CV = 0.813, and Q2EXT = 0.803. The applicability domain evaluation and Tropsha's analysis were conducted to validate M36, indicating its robustness and accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for organic molecules within the established domain. The physicochemical properties of the ligands, including electronegativity, polarizability, and van der Waals volume were relevant to predict the inhibition process. The model was then employed in the virtual screening of potential DPP4 inhibitors, finding 448 compounds from the DrugBank and 9 from DiaNat with potential inhibitory activity. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to get insight into the ligand-protein interaction. From the screening and the favorable molecular dynamic results, several compounds including Skimmin (pIC50 = 3.54, Binding energy = -8.86 kcal/mol), bergenin (pIC50 = 2.69, Binding energy = -13.90 kcal/mol), and DB07272 (pIC50 = 3.97, Binding energy = -25.28 kcal/mol) seem to be promising hits to be tested and optimized in the treatment of T2DM. This results imply a important reduction in cost and time on the application of this drugs because all the information about the its metabolism is already available.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Methods: In April 2021, the National Institute for Food and Drug Surveillance (INVIMA) reported an outbreak of R. pickettii infection associated with contaminated intravenous medications. The Municipal Health Department began collecting data for all cases identified by the hospitals and the results of microbiological studies. Medical records and death certificates of included cases were reviewed.
Results: Between March and May 2021, 66 cases of R. pickettii bloodstream infections from nine hospitals were documented. The median age of the patients was 60 years (IQR 51-72), and most of them had comorbidities (78.8%), mainly arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. At the time of the R. pickettii bloodstream infection, 89.4% had COVID-19, 86.4% were on mechanical ventilation, and 98.5% were receiving corticosteroids. The overall mortality was 81.8%. Nearly 60% of the deaths were related to R. pickettii bloodstream infections. R. pickettii was identified in the cultures from intravenous medications.
Conclusions: This large multicenter outbreak caused by intravenous medications contaminated with R. pickettii mainly affected critically ill COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the PREDICOL Study. Participants with a FINDRISC ≥ 12 who underwent an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) were included in the study (n=1166). The final analytical sample size was 1101 participants. Those with missing data were excluded from the analysis (n=65). The main outcome was body mass index (BMI), which was categorized as normal, overweight, and obese. We utilized unadjusted and adjusted ordinal logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 41 % (n=449) and 47 % (n=517), respectively. Participants with a 2-hour glucose ≥139 mg/dl had 1.71 times higher odds of being overweight or obese (regarding normal weight) than participants with normal 2-hour glucose values. In addition, being a woman, waist circumference altered, and blood pressure >120/80 mmHg were statistically significantly associated with a higher BMI.
CONCLUSION: Strategies to control glycemia, blood pressure, and central adiposity are needed in people at risk of T2D.

This study examined hantavirus preventive practices and their relationship with personal and social factors, lifestyle, and cultural beliefs.
METHOD: An explanatory sequential mixed methods design, guided by Leininger's Theory of Culture Care Diversity and Universality, was used in two phases: (a) a cross-sectional relational design (n = 109) and (b) ethnonursing research (n = 30), in an endemic community in Panama. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to analyze the quantitative data, whereas the Leininger's analysis model was used to analyze the qualitative data.
RESULTS: In the quantitative phase, the most frequent preventive practice was household hygiene, and the least frequent was vector control. Two of the eight preventive practices were associated with personal factors and two were associated with social factors. In the qualitative phase, lifestyle, beliefs, and context were found to influence the adoption of hantavirus preventive practices and help explain the quantitative findings.

METHODS: The patient was subjected to physical examinations, multimodal images (fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography), hemoglobin electrophoresis, and peripheral blood smear, documenting sickle cell trait. The management included laser treatment to target non-perfusion areas, along with a single dose of anti-VEGF.
RESULTS: A 45-year-old male patient with diagnosis of pachychoroid neovascularization treated for 6 years with multiple anti VEGF injections in the left eye. A detailed clinical evaluation included hypochromic conjunctiva, peripheral vascular occlusion with non-perfusion areas led us to suspect sickle cell disease retinopathy. The images of fluorescein angiography showed peripheral arteriovenous anastomosis with non-perfusion areas; the optical coherence tomography revealed a thinner neuroepithelium with a thicker choroid; also, hemoglobin electrophoresis and peripheral blood smear documenting sickle cell trait. The chosen management was photocoagulation of the peripheral retina on the non-perfusion areas and anti VEGF without neovascular activity recurrence in the follow up period.
CONCLUSION: Although sickle cell trait is considered a mild form of this pathology without serious retinal manifestations, it has to be noted that in the context of pachychoroid spectrum diseases is a trigger that could perpetuate retinal ischemia and neovascular activity.",,,European Journal of Ophthalmology,,,,2024-08-28,2024,2024-08-28,2024-08-28,,,11206721241278392,Closed,Article,"Córdoba-Ortega, Carlos Miguel; Arias Aristizabal, Juan D; Suta Figueroa, María; Pérez-Vergara, Valentina; Pulgarin, Dayron Martínez","Córdoba-Ortega, Carlos Miguel (Foscal Internacional.

WBCs detection and classification in blood smears offers insights to pathologists, aiding diagnosis across medical conditions. Traditional techniques, including manual counting, detection, classification, and visual inspection of microscopic images by medical professionals, pose challenges due to their labor-intensive nature. However, traditional methods are time consuming and sometimes susceptible to errors. Here, we propose a high-performance convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a dual-attention network that efficiently detects and classifies WBCs in microscopic thick smear images. The main aim of this study was to enhance clinical hematology systems and expedite medical diagnostic processes. In the proposed technique, we utilized a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to overcome the limitations imposed by limited training data and employed a dual attention mechanism to improve accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. The proposed technique achieved overall accuracy rates of 99.83%, 99.35%, and 99.60% for the peripheral blood cell (PBC), leukocyte images for segmentation and classification (LISC), and Raabin-WBC benchmark datasets, respectively. Our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the strategies employed and their potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities and advance real-world healthcare practices and diagnostic systems.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,,"Humans; Leukocytes; Neural Networks, Computer; Microscopy; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Deep Learning",2024-02-13,2024,2024-02-13,2024-05,174,,108146,Closed,Article,"Khan, Siraj; Sajjad, Muhammad; Abbas, Naveed; Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Gamarra, Margarita; Muhammad, Khan","Khan, Siraj (Digital Image Processing Laboratory (DIP Lab), Department of Computer Science, Islamia College University, Peshawar, 25120, Pakistan.); Sajjad, Muhammad (Digital Image Processing Laboratory (DIP Lab), Department of Computer Science, Islamia College University, Peshawar, 25120, Pakistan.

Nevertheless, toxic effects, such as hemolysis, have hampered the development of such promising drugs. Hence, a reliable computational tool to predict peptide hemolytic toxicity is enormously useful before synthesis and experimental evaluation. Currently, four web servers that predict hemolytic activity using machine learning (ML) algorithms are available; however, they exhibit some limitations, such as the need for a reliable negative set and limited application domain. Hence, we developed a robust model based on a novel theoretical approach that combines network science and a multiquery similarity searching (MQSS) method. A total of 1152 initial models were constructed from 144 scaffolds generated in a previous report. These were evaluated on external data sets, and the best models were fused and improved. Our best MQSS model I1 outperformed all state-of-the-art ML-based models and was used to characterize the prevalence of hemolytic toxicity on therapeutic peptides.

Several studies have confirmed the pervasive presence of these antibiotics in wastewater treatment plants and aquatic environments. However, the effects of these substances on non-target organisms, such as plants, have not been adequately monitored. Thus, this study aimed to assess the short-term impact of meropenem on the growth, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and enzyme activity of the macrophyte plant Lemna minor. The methods involved exposing the plant to meropenem under controlled conditions and assessing physiological and biochemical parameters to determine the impact on photosynthetic activity and oxidative stress. These analyses included growth rate, antioxidant enzyme activity, and photosynthetic capacity. The findings suggest that the growth rate of Lemna minor remained unaffected by meropenem at concentrations <200000 μgL-1. However, plants exposed to concentrations >20 μgL-1showed physiological alterations, such as decreased net photosynthesis rate (17%) and chlorophyll concentration (57%), compared to the control group. For acute toxicity assays, the calculated EC50 7-day and EC20 7-day were 1135 μgL-1and 33 μgL-1, respectively. In addition, in most treatments tested, meropenem caused an increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress. Our results suggest that meropenem affects photosynthetic processes and induces oxidative stress in the macrophyte plant Lemna minor. Further studies are needed to assess the physiological and metabolic interactions between antibiotics and primary producers at different long-term trophic levels.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparative efficacy of acetaminophen, ibuprofen alone, alternating, or combined through a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL from inception to September 20, 2023.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials comparing acetaminophen, ibuprofen, both alternating, and both combined, for treating children with fever.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis using the random-effects model.
RESULTS: We included 31 trials (5009 children). We found that combined (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.42) and alternating therapies (OR, 0.20; CI, 0.06-0.63) may be superior to acetaminophen, whereas ibuprofen at a high dose may be comparable (OR, 0.98; CI, 0.63-1.59) in terms of proportion of afebrile children at the fourth hour. These results were similar at the sixth hour. There were no differences between ibuprofen (low or high dose), or alternating, or combined with acetaminophen in terms of adverse events.
LIMITATIONS: We only evaluated the efficacy and safety during the first 6 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual may be superior to single therapies for treating fever in children. Acetaminophen may be inferior to combined or alternating therapies to get children afebrile at 4 and 6 hours. Compared with ibuprofen, acetaminophen was also inferior to ibuprofen alone at 4 hours, but similar at 6 hours.

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of bloodstream infections due to MDRGNB is high, and they pose a significant risk in critically ill patients. Recently, novel antimicrobial agents, including new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and cefiderocol, have been introduced for treating these infections. Concurrently, updated guidelines have been issued to aid in treatment decisions. Prompt diagnosis and identification of resistance patterns are crucial for initiating effective antibiotic therapy. Current studies, especially with observational design, and with limited sample sizes and patients with bacteremia, suggest that the use of these new antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes in critically ill patients with MDRGNB bloodstream infections.

Their demographic characteristics were evaluated, as well as their clinical characteristics on admission, type of reduction (closed/open), presence of interposition in open reductions, type of implant, complications, and functional range of movement according to two shoulder functional scores.ResultsMean age was 11.2 years (8–15), there was a predominance of males, who accounted for 70% of the cases, and sports accidents were the cause of injury in 44% of the cases. Anatomical location was balanced between patients, including 55% of physeal fractures and 45% of metaphyseal ones. Overall, 81.5% of patients required open reduction to achieve axis correction, and that 55.5% of fractures were fixed with Kirschner wires, and 44, 4% with elastic titanium nails. Mean QuickDASH score was 0.58 (0–1.7), and Constant score was 9 (3–24). There were no major complications, but 27% of cases subjected to open reduction presented a hypertrophic scar.ConclusionSurgical treatment of severely displaced proximal humerus fractures is successful, both with closed and open reduction; type of implant does not play a key role and should be selected based on the characteristics of each case. Surgical training should prevail at the time of decision-making. When these recommendations are followed, results can be excellent and sequelae are infrequent.","We would like to thank the Research Support Group (GAI) of AO Trauma Latin America, for its constant support.",No funding was received for conducting this study.,European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology,,,,2024-05-15,2024,2024-05-15,2024-05-15,,,1-8,Closed,Article,"Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro; Fretes, Alberto Navarro","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Coronel Ángel López, 1161, 1419, Asunción, Paraguay; Hospital Central del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, Paraguay; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, Paraguay); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Coronel Ángel López, 1161, 1419, Asunción, Paraguay; Hospital Central del Instituto de Previsión Social, Asunción, Paraguay; Orthopedics and Traumatology, Universidad del Norte, Asunción, Paraguay)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Coronel Ángel López, 1161, 1419, Asunción, Paraguay; IPS Central; Universidad del Norte)","Vergara, Alberto Daniel Navarro (Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Coronel Ángel López, 1161, 1419, Asunción, Paraguay; IPS Central; Universidad del Norte); Fretes, Alberto Navarro (Hospital de Trauma “Manuel Giagni”, Coronel Ángel López, 1161, 1419, Asunción, Paraguay; IPS Central; Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171648183,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

In this study, we investigate the intriguing properties of room-temperature antiferromagneticMnC4and its nodal-line features both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the absence of SOC, we identify a doubly degenerate Dirac-nodal line, robustly protected by a combination of time-reversal, mirror, and partial-translation symmetries. Remarkably, this nodal line withstands various external perturbations, including isotropic and anisotropic strain, and torsional deformations, due to the ionic-like bonding between Mn atoms and C clusters. With the inclusion of SOC, we observe a distinctive quasi-Dirac-nodal line that emerges due to the interplay between antiferromagnetism and SOC-induced spin-rotation symmetry breaking. Finally, we observed a robust spin Hall conductivity that aligns with the energy range where the quasi-nodal line appears. This study presents a compelling example of a robust symmetry-protected Dirac-nodal line antiferromagnetic monolayer, which has potential for applications in next-generation spintronic devices.",We thank DGAPA-UNAM Projects IA100822 and IN101523 for partial financial support.

Of these OECD principles, the applicability domain (AD) estimation has been recognized in several reports in the literature to be one of the most challenging, implying that the actual reliability measures of model predictions are often unreliable. Applying tree-based error analysis workflows on 5 QSAR models reported in the literature and available in the QsarDB repository, i.e., androgen receptor bioactivity (agonists, antagonists, and binders, respectively) and membrane permeability (highest membrane permeability and the intrinsic permeability), we demonstrate that predictions erroneously tagged as reliable (AD prediction errors) overwhelmingly correspond to instances in subspaces (cohorts) with the highest prediction error rates, highlighting the inhomogeneity of the AD space. In this sense, we call for more stringent AD analysis guidelines which require the incorporation of model error analysis schemes, to provide critical insight on the reliability of underlying AD algorithms. Additionally, any selected AD method should be rigorously validated to demonstrate its suitability for the model space over which it is applied. These steps will ultimately contribute to more accurate estimations of the reliability of model predictions. Finally, error analysis may also be useful in “rational” model refinement in that data expansion efforts and model retraining are focused on cohorts with the highest error rates.",,Not applicable.,Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design,,,Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Reproducibility of Results; Algorithms,2024-02-14,2024,2024-02-14,2024-12,38,1,9,Closed,Article,"Mora, Jose R.; Marquez, Edgar A.; Pérez-Pérez, Noel; Contreras-Torres, Ernesto; Perez-Castillo, Yunierkis; Agüero-Chapin, Guillermin; Martinez-Rios, Felix; Marrero-Ponce, Yovani; Barigye, Stephen J.","Mora, Jose R.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a comparative policy analysis based on COVID-19 NVPs.
METHODS: We conducted a search strategy in three stages to identify NVPs for COVID-19 across 41 countries/territories in the LAC region. Sources included official governmental repositories, complementary Google searches, and less formal documentation. We extracted key variables and conducted a comparative policy analysis based on the prioritization criteria and specific prioritization groups.
RESULTS: The study identified 52 NVPs for COVID-19, corresponding to 27 (65.8 %) out of 41 countries/territories in the LAC region. Official national websites yielded documents for 12 countries. All NVPs included frontline healthcare personnel in the first prioritization phase/stage, whilst some included residents of long-term healthcare facilities, adults aged 60 years or more, and people with disabilities. The decision criteria for prioritization were declared in 14 countries/territories. Ethical considerations declared in five NVPs included human welfare, equality, solidarity, equity, and social justice as values.
CONCLUSION: The early stages of vaccination rollout in LAC countries prioritized protection of the healthcare system and epidemiological risk for severe disease. Few countries included ethical considerations in their NVPs, and global inequities in vaccine access and distribution led to varied protections for vulnerable populations across LAC. This analysis highlights the need for improved emergency-response capacity, planning, and enhanced multilateral cooperation in the LAC region for future public health emergencies.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Public Health,,,Adult; Humans; Latin America; COVID-19 Vaccines; COVID-19; Caribbean Region; Public Health,2024-02-15,2024,2024-02-15,2024-03,228,,162-170,Closed,Article,"Woodbine, M.J.

METHODS: We examined the prevalence of comorbidities in IIM patients, other autoimmune rheumatic diseases (oAIRDs), and healthy controls (HCs), using data from the self-reported COVAD-2 survey. We defined Basic Multimorbidity (BM) as the presence of ≥ 2 non-rheumatic chronic conditions and Complex Multimorbidity (CM) as the presence of ≥ 3 non-rheumatic chronic conditions affecting ≥3 organ systems. Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components was performed for grouping.
RESULTS: Among the COVAD respondents, 1558 IIMs, 4591 oAIRDs, and 3652 HCs were analysed. IIMs exhibited a high burden of comorbidities (OR: 1.62 vs oAIRDs and 2.95 vs HCs, p< 0.01), BM (OR 1.66 vs oAIRDs and 3.52 vs HCs, p< 0.01), CM (OR: 1.69 vs AIRDs and 6.23 vs HCs, p< 0.01), and mental health disorders (MHDs) (OR 1.33 vs oAIRDs and 2.63 vs HCs, p< 0.01). Among the IIM patients, those with comorbidities or MHDs had lower PROMIS Global Physical (PGP), PROMIS Global Mental (PGM), and PROMIS Physical Function (SF10) scores, and higher fatigue (F4a) scores (all p< 0.001). PGP, PGM, SF10a and F4a were influenced by age, active disease, BM, and MHDs. Four distinct clusters were identified among the IIMs according to comorbidities and PROMIS scores.

The role of salivary immunological components in the development of candidiasis can provide insights for the development of new methodologies aiming to control this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of two salivary components, histatin 5 and lactoferrin on C. albicans viability and virulence using a fluconazole resistant C. albicans clinical strain. Results showed that histatin 5 and lactoferrin decreased cell viability, and the cell surface hydrophobicity was increased by 18% in presence of 151 µg/mL of histatin 5 but was not altered by lactoferrin. It was observed the reduction of 69.3% in the expression of mannoproteins on C. albicans surface in the presence of 151 µg/mL of histatin, but proteolytic activity of serine proteinases was not inhibited by any of the proteins. Histatin 5 altered cell ultrastructure predominantly in the cytoplasmic compartment. However, this peptide does not interfere with mitochondrial function neither in membrane permeability of the yeasts. The association index between C. albicans and epithelial cells was increased by 51% in presence of 151 µg/mL of histatin. Results suggest that histatin 5 and lactoferrin affects viability and virulence of C. albicans at physiological levels, and the maintenance of these levels may be essential in the prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Exogenous administration of these proteins may become a therapeutic alternative for resistant strains of C. albicans, circumventing toxicity issues, considering their constitutive features.",,,Brazilian Journal of Microbiology,,,,2024-09-25,2024,2024-09-25,2024-09-25,,,1-15,Closed,Article,"Curvelo, Jose Alexandre da Rocha; Barreto, Anna Lea Silva; Bayona-Pacheco, Brayan Leonardo; de Moraes, Daniel Clemente; Portela, Maristela Barbosa; Ferreira-Pereira, Antônio; Adade, Camila Marques; Souto-Padrón, Thaïs; Soares, Rosangela Maria de Araújo","Curvelo, Jose Alexandre da Rocha (Divisão de Pesquisa clínica, Instituto Nacional do Câncer Marcelo Alencar, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Barreto, Anna Lea Silva (Grande Área Ciências Biológicas e da Saúde, Centro Universitário IBMR, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Bayona-Pacheco, Brayan Leonardo (Departamento de Medicina, División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Km 5, via Puerto Colombia, 081007, Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia); de Moraes, Daniel Clemente (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Portela, Maristela Barbosa (Faculdade de Odontologia, Centro de Ciências Médicas, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil); Ferreira-Pereira, Antônio (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Adade, Camila Marques (NanoOnco3D, Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil); Souto-Padrón, Thaïs (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Soares, Rosangela Maria de Araújo (Laboratório de Bioquímica Microbiana, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","Barreto, Anna Lea Silva (Grande Área Ciências Biológicas e da Saúde, Centro Universitário IBMR, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)","Curvelo, Jose Alexandre da Rocha (Instituto Nacional do Câncer); Barreto, Anna Lea Silva (Grande Área Ciências Biológicas e da Saúde, Centro Universitário IBMR, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil); Bayona-Pacheco, Brayan Leonardo (Universidad del Norte); de Moraes, Daniel Clemente (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); Portela, Maristela Barbosa (Fluminense Federal University); Ferreira-Pereira, Antônio (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); Adade, Camila Marques (Fluminense Federal University; Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro); Souto-Padrón, Thaïs (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro; National Institute of Science and Technology for Structural Biology and Bioimaging); Soares, Rosangela Maria de Araújo (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175931934,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology,

However, factors associated with disease flares remain unknown. This study aimed to identify factors associated with breakthrough infection (BIs) and disease flares in patients with RA following COVID-19. We analysed data from RA patients who participated in the COVID-19 vaccination in autoimmune diseases (COVAD) study. Demographic data, patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities, pharmacologic treatment and details regarding disease flares were extracted from the COVAD database. Factors associated with disease flare-ups were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The analysis comprised 1928 patients with RA who participated in the COVAD study. Younger age, Caucasian ethnicity, comorbidities with obstructive chronic pulmonary disease and asthma were associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infection. Moreover, younger age (odds ratio (OR): 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–0.99, p < 0.001), ethnicity other than Asian, past history of tuberculosis (OR: 3.80, 95% CI 1.12–12.94, p = 0.033), treatment with methotrexate (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.56–4.17, p < 0.001), poor global physical health (OR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.15, p = 0.044) and mental health (OR: 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.95, p < 0.001) were independent factors associated disease flares in patients with RA. Our study highlights the impact of socio-demographic factors, clinical characteristics and mental health on disease flares in patients with RA. These insights may help determine relevant strategies to proactively manage RA patients at risk of flares.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

6369,pub.1171111487,10.1089/neu.2023.0440,38666734,,A Four-Country Study of Strangulation-Related Alterations in Consciousness in Women Who Have Experienced Intimate Partner Violence: Co-Occurrence with Traumatic Brain Injuries and Measures of Psychological Distress,"At least one in three women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime. The most commonly sustained IPV-related brain injuries include strangulation-related alterations in consciousness (S-AICs) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Moreover, survivors of IPV-related S-AICs and/or TBIs often demonstrate psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. However, the co-occurrence of S-AICs and TBIs, and whether such TBIs may be moderate to severe, has not been systematically examined, and most data have been collected from women in North America. The purpose of this study was to examine the co-occurrence of IPV-related S-AICs and TBIs across a range of geographical locations and to determine the extent to which these S-AICs are related to psychological distress. Women who had experienced physical IPV (n = 213) were included in this secondary analysis of retrospectively collected data across four countries (Canada, the United States, Spain, and Colombia). The Brain Injury Severity Assessment (BISA) was used to assess IPV-related BI across all sites. Because various questionnaires were employed to assess levels of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at each site, we created a standardized composite score by converting raw scores into Z-scores for analysis. Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square tests were conducted to examine differences between women with and without experience of S-AICs and to discover if there was a relationship between the occurrence of S-AICs and TBIs. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance (to control for the potential confounding effects of age, education, and non IPV-related TBI) were used to compare levels of psychological distress in women who had or had not experienced S-AICs. Approximately, 67% of women sustained at least one IPV-related BI (i.e., TBI and/or S-AIC). In a subsample of women who sustained at least one IPV-related BI, approximately 37% sustained both S-AICs and TBIs, 2% sustained only S-AICs (with no TBIs), and 61% sustained TBIs exclusively (with no S-AICs). Furthermore, women who had sustained S-AICs (with or without a TBI) were more likely to have experienced a moderate-to-severe BI than those who had not sustained an S-AIC (BISA severity subscale: U = 3939, p = 0.006). In addition, women who experienced S-AICs (with or without a TBI) reported higher levels of psychological distress compared with women who never experienced S-AICs, irrespective of whether they occurred once or multiple times. These data underscore the importance of assessing for S-AIC in women who have experienced IPV and when present, to also assess for TBIs and the presence of psychological distress. Unfortunately, there were methodological differences across sites precluding cross-site comparisons. Nonetheless, data were collected across four culturally and geographically diverse countries and, therefore, highlight IPV-related BIs as a global issue that needs to be aggressively studied with policies established and then implemented to address findings.",The authors would like to show our deepest gratitude to all of the women who participated in this study.

Qualitative analysis and meta-analysis were conducted. This study was previously registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023451844).
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1,439 patients and 1,040 eyes summarized in qualitative analysis. Twenty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Ages included ranged from 60.4 to 75 years. Women were reported with more frequency. The mean time for diagnosis was 55.1 months, usually with bilateral ocular disease in 90% (95% CI 78%; 96%). Trichiasis and entropion were the most frequent manifestations in up to 92%, followed by symblepharon and punctate keratitis. Ankyloblepharon, persistent epithelial defects, and visual impairment were less frequent complications. Direct immunofluorescence positivity in conjunctival biopsies was 54% (95% CI 43%; 64%). Extraocular involvement was highly frequent, being oral and skin involvement the most frequently reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis evidenced that patients around 60 years of age are the most affected population with a female preponderance, usually with bilateral ocular involvement. Trichiasis and entropion were the most frequent findings; although visual impairment and persistent epithelial defects were less reported, they should not be overlooked in suspected OMMP.",,The author(s) reported that there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.,Ocular Immunology and Inflammation,,,,2024-07-29,2024,2024-07-29,2024-07-29,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-17,Closed,Article,"Bocanegra-Oyola, Natalia; Pardo-Pizza, Daniella; Cifuentes-González, Carlos; Oliver-Hernández, María Valentina; Romero-Osorio, María Juliana; Romero-Santos, Sofía; Parra-Tanoux, Daniela; Barragán, Ana M.; de-la-Torre, Alejandra","Bocanegra-Oyola, Natalia (Epidemiology Specialization Program, Universidad CES, Medellín, Colombia and Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia; Neuroscience (NEUROS) Research Group, Neurovitae Research Center, Institute of Translational Medicine (IMT), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia); Pardo-Pizza, Daniella (Neuroscience (NEUROS) Research Group, Neurovitae Research Center, Institute of Translational Medicine (IMT), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia); Cifuentes-González, Carlos (Neuroscience (NEUROS) Research Group, Neurovitae Research Center, Institute of Translational Medicine (IMT), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia); Oliver-Hernández, María Valentina (Neuroscience (NEUROS) Research Group, Neurovitae Research Center, Institute of Translational Medicine (IMT), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia); Romero-Osorio, María Juliana (Department of Medicine, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Romero-Santos, Sofía (Neuroscience (NEUROS) Research Group, Neurovitae Research Center, Institute of Translational Medicine (IMT), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia); Parra-Tanoux, Daniela (Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia); Barragán, Ana M.

This exposure has been linked to health effects that may be triggered by genotoxic events. Genetic polymorphisms play a role in the risk associated with Hg exposure. This study evaluated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in metabolic and DNA repair genes on genetic instability and total hair Hg (T-Hg) levels in 78 individuals from ""La Mojana"" in northern Colombia and 34 individuals from a reference area. Genetic instability was assessed by the frequency of micronuclei (MNBN), nuclear buds (NBUDS), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB). We used a Poisson regression to assess the influence of SNPs on T-Hg levels and genetic instability, and a Bayesian regression to examine the interaction between Hg detoxification and DNA repair. Among exposed individuals, carriers of XRCC1Arg399Gln had a significantly higher frequency of MNBN. Conversely, the XRCC1Arg194Trp and OGG1Ser326Cys polymorphisms were associated with lower frequencies of MNBN. XRCC1Arg399Gln, XRCC1Arg280His, and GSTM1Null carriers showed lower NPB frequencies. Our results also indicated that individuals with the GSTM1Nulland GSTT1null polymorphisms had a 1.6-fold risk for higher T-Hg levels. The Bayesian model showed increased MNBN frequencies in carriers of the GSTM1Null polymorphism in combination with XRCC1Arg399Gln and increased NBUDS frequencies in the GSTM1Null carriers with the XRCC3Thr241Met and OGG1Ser326Cys alleles. The GSTM1+ variant was found to be a protective factor in individuals carrying OGG1Ser326Cys (MNBN) and XRCC1Arg280His (NPB); the GSTT1+ polymorphism combined with XRCCArg194Trp also modulated lower MNBN frequencies, while GSTT1+ carriers with the XRCC1Arg399Gln allele showed lower NPB frequencies. Consistent with GSTM1, GSTT1Null carriers with XRCC3Thr241Met showed increased NBUDS frequency. With the rise of gold mining activities, these approaches are vital to identify and safeguard populations vulnerable to Hg's toxic effects.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted structured and free-text data from electronic health records (EHRs) of all office visits (2015-2019) of children aged 4-6 years in a community-based primary healthcare network in California, who had ≥1 visits with an ICD-10 diagnosis of ADHD. Two pediatricians annotated clinical notes of the first ADHD visit for 423 patients. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was assessed for the recommendation for the first-line behavioral treatment (F-measure = 0.89). Four pre-trained language models, including BioClinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BioClinicalBERT), were used to identify behavioral treatment recommendations using a 70/30 train/test split. For temporal validation, we deployed BioClinicalBERT on 1,020 unannotated notes from other ADHD visits and well-care visits; all positively classified notes (n = 53) and 5% of negatively classified notes (n = 50) were manually reviewed.
RESULTS: Of 423 patients, 313 (74%) were male; 298 (70%) were privately insured; 138 (33%) were White; 61 (14%) were Hispanic. The BioClinicalBERT model trained on the first ADHD visits achieved F1 = 0.76, precision = 0.81, recall = 0.72, and AUC = 0.81 [0.72-0.89]. Temporal validation achieved F1 = 0.77, precision = 0.68, and recall = 0.88. Fairness analysis revealed low model performance in publicly insured patients (F1 = 0.53).
CONCLUSION: Deploying pre-trained language models on a variable set of clinical notes accurately captured pediatrician adherence to guidelines in the treatment of children with ADHD. Validating this approach in other patient populations is needed to achieve equitable measurement of quality of care at scale and improve clinical care for mental health conditions.","We thank Packard Children’s Health Alliance and Stanford Research Information Technology for their support and assistance in data acquisition and extraction.

Objective: The aim is to identify methodologies and ToM instruments employed in HD, alongside relevant findings, within the scientific literature of the past two decades.
Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search for relevant papers in the SCOPUS, PubMed, APA-PsyArticles, Web of Science, Redalyc, and SciELO databases. In the selection process, we specifically focused on studies that included individuals with a confirmed genetic status of HD and investigated ToM functioning in patients with and without motor symptoms. The systematic review followed the PRISMA protocol.
Results: A total of 27 papers were selected for this systematic review, covering the period from 2003 to 2023. The findings consistently indicate that ToM is globally affected in patients with manifest motor symptoms. In individuals without motor symptoms, impairments are focused on the affective dimensions of ToM.
Conclusions: Based on our analysis, affective ToM could be considered a potential biomarker for HD. Therefore, it is recommended that ToM assessment be included as part of neuropsychological evaluation protocols in clinical settings. Suchinclusion could aid in the identification of early stages of the disease and provide new opportunities for treatment, particularly with emerging drugs like antisense oligomers.

METHODS: A validated patient self-reporting e-survey was circulated by the COVAD study group to collect data on COVID-19 infection and vaccination in 2022. BIs were defined as COVID-19 occurring ≥14 days after 2 vaccine doses. We compared BIs characteristics and severity among IIMs, other autoimmune rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases (AIRD, nrAID), and healthy controls (HC). Multivariable Cox regression models assessed the risk factors for BI, severe BI and hospitalisations among IIMs.
RESULTS: Among 9449 included response, BIs occurred in 1447 (15.3%) respondents, median age 44 years (IQR 21), 77.4% female, and 182 BIs (12.9%) occurred among 1406 IIMs. Multivariable Cox regression among IIMs showed age as a protective factor for BIs [Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.98, 95%CI = 0.97-0.99], hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were risk factors (HR = 1.81, 95%CI = 1.24-2.64, and HR = 3.79, 95%CI = 1.69-8.42, respectively). Glucocorticoid use was a risk factor for severe BI (HR = 3.61, 95%CI = 1.09-11.8). Non-White ethnicity (HR = 2.61, 95%CI = 1.03-6.59) was a risk factor for hospitalisation. Compared with other groups, patients with IIMs required more supplemental oxygen therapy (IIM = 6.0% vs AIRD = 1.8%, nrAID = 2.2%, and HC = 0.9%), intensive care unit admission (IIM = 2.2% vs AIRD = 0.6%, nrAID, and HC = 0%), advanced treatment with antiviral or monoclonal antibodies (IIM = 34.1% vs AIRD = 25.8%, nrAID = 14.6%, and HC = 12.8%), and had more hospitalisation (IIM = 7.7% vs AIRD = 4.6%, nrAID = 1.1%, and HC = 1.5%).
CONCLUSION: Patients with IIMs are susceptible to severe COVID-19 BI. Age and immunosuppressive treatments were related to the risk of BIs.","The authors are grateful to all respondents for completing the questionnaire.

This study aimed to assess the impact of sex on sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters in patients with HF who were included in the Colombian Heart Failure Registry (RECOLFACA).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analytical research. All 2528 patients included in RECOLFACA were analysed. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare median values as well as first and third quartiles (Q1-Q3). The age-related trend of NT-proBNP levels for both men and women groups was statistically evaluated.
RESULTS: The study included 2528 patients with HF (1072 women and 1456 men). The echocardiographic evidence showed that men presented reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (79.63 vs. 69.75%, respectively; p < 0.001) more often than women, which had a significantly higher proportion of preserved LVEF (20.46 vs.11.24%, respectively; p < 0.001). Women displayed a higher value of systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) and heart rate (p = 0.014) compared to men. Haemoglobin, creatinine, and sodium levels were significantly higher in men. Men had a considerably lower glomerular filtration rate value, with the median reaching a G3a value for chronic renal failure. According to age, the levels of NT-proBNP in each sex increased equivalently with age.
CONCLUSION: Sex differences presented in this study are comparable to those discovered in other nations. However, certain variations show that these sex differences may differ by geographical area, which should encourage further investigations to describe them.","No funding agency had any role in study design, data collection, and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,Acta Cardiologica,,,,2024-08-15,2024,2024-08-15,2024-08-15,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-8,Closed,Article,"Saldarriaga, Clara; Rivera-Toquica, Alex; Echeverry-Navarrete, Eduardo José; Lugo-Peña, Julián Rodrigo; Cerón, Juan Alberto; Rincón-Peña, Oscar Sveins; Silva-Diazgranados, Luis Eduardo; Osorio-Carmona, Hugo Ernesto; Posada-Bastidas, Alejandro; García, Juan Camilo; Ochoa-Morón, Alejandro David; Rolong, Balkis; Manzur-Jatin, Fernando; Echeverría, Luis Eduardo; Gómez-Mesa, Juan Esteban; Investigators, RECOLFACA","Saldarriaga, Clara (Department of Cardiology, Clínica Cardio VID, Medellín, Colombia); Rivera-Toquica, Alex (Department of Cardiology, Centro Médico para el Corazón, Pereira, Colombia; Department of Cardiology, Clínica los Rosales, Pereira, Colombia; Department of Cardiology, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, Colombia); Echeverry-Navarrete, Eduardo José (Department of Cardiology, Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia, Floridablanca, Colombia); Lugo-Peña, Julián Rodrigo (Department of Cardiology, Clínicos IPS, Bogotá, Colombia); Cerón, Juan Alberto (Department of Cardiology, Hospital Universitario Departamental de Nariño, Pasto, Colombia); Rincón-Peña, Oscar Sveins (Department of Cardiology, Hospital Regional de Duitama, Duitama, Colombia); Silva-Diazgranados, Luis Eduardo (Department of Cardiology, Hospital de la Policía, Bogotá, Colombia); Osorio-Carmona, Hugo Ernesto (Department of Cardiology, Clínica Medilaser, Neiva, Colombia); Posada-Bastidas, Alejandro (Department of Cardiology, Centro Cardiovascular Somer Incare, Rionegro, Colombia); García, Juan Camilo (Clínica Iberoamérica, Department of Cardiology, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ochoa-Morón, Alejandro David (Department of Cardiology, Clínica Las Vegas, Medellín, Colombia); Rolong, Balkis (Department of Cardiology, Cardiología Integral, Barranquilla, Colombia); Manzur-Jatin, Fernando (Department of Cardiology, Hospital Universitario del Caribe, Cartagena, Colombia); Echeverría, Luis Eduardo (Department of Cardiology, Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia, Floridablanca, Colombia); Gómez-Mesa, Juan Esteban (Department of Cardiology, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia; Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia); Investigators, RECOLFACA ()","Gómez-Mesa, Juan Esteban (Fundación Valle del Lili; Icesi University)","Saldarriaga, Clara (Department of Cardiology, Clínica Cardio VID, Medellín, Colombia); Rivera-Toquica, Alex (Department of Cardiology, Centro Médico para el Corazón, Pereira, Colombia; Department of Cardiology, Clínica los Rosales, Pereira, Colombia; Technological University of Pereira); Echeverry-Navarrete, Eduardo José (Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia); Lugo-Peña, Julián Rodrigo (Department of Cardiology, Clínicos IPS, Bogotá, Colombia); Cerón, Juan Alberto (Department of Cardiology, Hospital Universitario Departamental de Nariño, Pasto, Colombia); Rincón-Peña, Oscar Sveins (Department of Cardiology, Hospital Regional de Duitama, Duitama, Colombia); Silva-Diazgranados, Luis Eduardo (Department of Cardiology, Hospital de la Policía, Bogotá, Colombia); Osorio-Carmona, Hugo Ernesto (Department of Cardiology, Clínica Medilaser, Neiva, Colombia); Posada-Bastidas, Alejandro (Department of Cardiology, Centro Cardiovascular Somer Incare, Rionegro, Colombia); García, Juan Camilo (Clínica Iberoamérica, Department of Cardiology, Barranquilla, Colombia); Ochoa-Morón, Alejandro David (Department of Cardiology, Clínica Las Vegas, Medellín, Colombia); Rolong, Balkis (Department of Cardiology, Cardiología Integral, Barranquilla, Colombia); Manzur-Jatin, Fernando (Department of Cardiology, Hospital Universitario del Caribe, Cartagena, Colombia); Echeverría, Luis Eduardo (Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia); Gómez-Mesa, Juan Esteban (Fundación Valle del Lili; Icesi University); Investigators, RECOLFACA ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174771120,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

It is rich in proteins, fibers, minerals, and has a residual oil content of 7–11%, which is rich in omega 3 linolenic acid (ALA). However, this byproduct has been historically undervalued. Thus, the aim of current work was to study the effects of consuming of a rich in chia expeller diet on a rabbit model of metabolically unhealthy normal weight to validate their use as a functional food. Rabbits were fed different diets for a period of 6 weeks: a standard diet (CD), a high-fat diet (HFD), a rich in expeller CD (Exp-CD) and a rich in expeller HFD (Exp-HFD). The Exp-HFD attenuated the rise in basal glucose, TyG index, triglycerides, cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol induced by the HFD. Both rich in expeller diets reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and increase liver and fat ALA levels compared to their respective controls. Furthermore, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was lower in the lungs of animals fed on rich in expeller diets compared to their respective controls. In vitro studies showed that ALA inhibited ACE activity. The evaluation of vascular reactivity revealed that rich in expeller diets improved angiotensin II affinity and reduced contractile response to noradrenaline. In conclusion, the consumption of rich in expeller diets showed beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and MAP. Therefore, its use as functional ingredient holds significant promise.",The authors thank Agustina Gonzalez Colombres for technical support.,"This research was supported by: PICT 2015/1164 (ANCyT-Argentina); PIUNT G728 (SCAIT, Argentina), and by institutional funds from Instituto Superior de Investigaciones Biológicas (INSIBIO).",Plant Foods for Human Nutrition,,,"Animals; Rabbits; Seeds; Plant Oils; Diet, High-Fat; Male; Salvia hispanica; Blood Pressure; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Triglycerides; Cardiovascular Diseases; alpha-Linolenic Acid; Disease Models, Animal; Functional Food; Liver; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol; Salvia; Nutritive Value",2024-05-22,2024,2024-05-22,2024-06,79,2,292-299,Closed,Article,"Alarcón, Gabriela; Valoy, Agostina; Alzogaray, Florencia Martin; Medina, Analía; Van Nieuwenhove, Carina; Medina, Mirta; Jerez, Susana","Alarcón, Gabriela (Instituto Superior de Investigaciones Biológicas (INSIBIO, UNT-CONICET), Av.

5076,pub.1171206154,,38683507,,Evaluation of PD-L1 expression and intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration in triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma.,"INTRODUCTION: Triple negative breast cancer endophenotype (TNBC) is one of the least frequent and without therapeutic target; therefore we propose to study the correlation of PD-L1 immune checkpoint with the establishment of tumor microenvironment assessed by intratumoral stromal lymphocyte infiltration (TILS) and its importance in clinical practice.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed, with 31 cases of triple-negative infiltrating breast carcinoma and 57 unmatched controls of Luminal A, Luminal B and HER-2 endophenotype seen in one year. The following variables were evaluated: histologic type and grade, PD-L1 expression with clone 22C3, TILS, lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, lymph node involvement and metastasis. Statistical analysis was performed with the chi-square test and Spearman correlation coefficient test.
RESULTS: a statistically significant negative correlation was found between TILS and PD-L1 (rho - 0.106, p 0.025), indicating that the higher the expression of PD-L1, the lower the intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration. In the TILS B (10-40% TILS) and C (40-90% TILS) groups where there was a marked intratumoral inflammatory infiltrate, a greater number of patients were negative for PD-L1 (CPS <10) with 16 and 10 cases, respectively. For TNBC cases a negative association coefficient was identified (rho -0.378) with statistical significance (p 0.01).
DISCUSSION: The association between TNBC, TILS and PDL1 expression was established, which is important for the establishment of target therapies and the development of precision medicine.",,,Medicina,,,"Aged; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; B7-H1 Antigen; Case-Control Studies; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Retrospective Studies; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment",2024,2024,,2024,84,2,227-235,Closed,Article,"Barrios Barreto, Rina; Silvera Redondo, Carlos; Garavito, María Del Pilar; Ardila Pereira, Laura","Barrios Barreto, Rina (División Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

U1-SCTRX-lg1a is a peptide isolated from a phospholipase D extracted from the spider venom of Loxosceles gaucho with antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (between 1.15 and 4.6 μM). The aim of this study was to suggest potential receptors associated with the antimicrobial activity of U1-SCTRX-lg1a using in silico bioinformatics tools. The search for potential targets of U1-SCRTX-lg1a was performed using the PharmMapper server. Molecular docking between U1-SCRTX-lg1a and the receptor was performed using PatchDock software. The prediction of ligand sites for each receptor was conducted using the PDBSum server. Chimera 1.6 software was used to perform molecular dynamics simulations only for the best dock score receptor. In addition, U1-SCRTX-lg1a and native ligand interactions were compared using AutoDock Vina software. Finally, predicted interactions were compared with the ligand site previously described in the literature. The bioprospecting of U1-SCRTX-lg1a resulted in the identification of three hundred (300) diverse targets (Table S1), forty-nine (49) of which were intracellular proteins originating from Gram-negative microorganisms (Table S2). Docking results indicate Scores (10,702 to 6066), Areas (1498.70 to 728.40) and ACEs (417.90 to – 152.8) values. Among these, NAD + NH3-dependent synthetase (PDB ID: 1wxi) showed a dock score of 9742, area of 1223.6 and ACE of 38.38 in addition to presenting a Normalized Fit score of 8812 on PharmMapper server. Analysis of the interaction of ligands and receptors suggests that the peptide derived from brown spider venom can interact with residues SER48 and THR160.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective study using our IRF's data from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation from 2013-2019. FIM scores and discharge destination were compared between race, language, and ethnic groups, with adjustment for patient characteristics.
SETTING: An urban hospital with a level 1 trauma center, comprehensive stroke center, and IRF with Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) certification.
PARTICIPANTS: 2518 patients admitted to the IRF from 2013-2019 (N=2518).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in FIM score and discharge destination.
RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, non-White patients and patients with limited English proficiency had significantly lower functional recovery, as measured by smaller changes in FIM scores from IRF admission to discharge. Additionally, both groups were more likely to be discharged home with home health care than to a skilled nursing facility, compared with White and English-speaking patients. Disparities in discharge destination persisted within patients with noncommercial insurance (Medicaid or Medicare) and a stroke diagnosis but not within those who had commercial insurance or a nonstroke diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial and linguistic disparities were identified within our CARF certified IRF; however, the organization is committed to reducing health care disparities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative, nonexperimental, descriptive research with associative scope. A total of 316 adolescents were assessed using five scales to evaluate mental health conditions: the Perceived Stress Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Penn Alcohol Craving Scale and The Substance Dependence Severity Scale. Univariate and bivariate analysis was performed, Chi square and Odds Ratio were tested.
RESULTS: The findings indicated that being female is a risk factor for high levels of perceived stress, depressive episodes and anxiety. Additionally, adolescents who are not attending school are at higher risk for dependence and abuse of psychoactive substances. Conversely, being female acts as a protective factor against dependence on psychoactive substances.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a higher tendency among the participants towards experiencing depressive episodes. Regarding perceived stress, 71.5% of the participants fell into the low category, while 70.6% experienced a current episode of generalized anxiety.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Effect of relapse prevention intervention based on Mindfulness (Full Attention) on drug use in adolescents with substance use disorder participating in an addiction therapeutic program, Manizales, Colombia: controlled and randomized clinical trial” enrolled in the Vice‐Rector&#x27;s Office of Research and Graduates of the University of Caldas with code 0314922 and co‐financed by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Contract 717‐2021 project 84524.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Peruvian Demographic and Family Health Survey from 2014 to 2019. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to determine the factors associated with poor medication adherence.
RESULTS: We included 15,184 participants with a known diagnosis of DM and HTN. The frequency of poor medication adherence was 37.1%, with 36.7% among individuals with HTN and 29.2% among individuals with DM. Those belonging to age groups above 30 years (aPR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.74-0.80, for the group ≥ 60 years) had a lower frequency of poor medication adherence. Meanwhile, being male (aPR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05), lacking health insurance (aPR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.05-1.10), belonging to lower wealth quintiles (aPR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.08-1.17, for the first quintile), and living in the mountain region (aPR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.06-1.12) were associated with a higher frequency of poor medication adherence. These findings were consistent when stratifying by the type of disease.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that poor medication adherence is common in patients with HTN and DM in Peru and is associated with sociodemographic factors, highlighting the importance of public health approaches to improve adherence.",,"No funding was received for conducting this study.

3220,pub.1171636613,10.1002/cae.22757,,,Risk‐based student performance prediction model for engineering courses,"Abstract High academic failure and dropout rates in engineering courses are significant worldwide concerns attributed to various factors, with academic performance being a critical variable. This article provides a methodology to estimate the performance risk of students in engineering schools. Risk analysis is a strategy to evaluate academic success, which provides a set of methods to analyze, understand, and predict student outcomes before enrolling in specific majors or challenging college courses. This article develops a methodology to estimate fragility curves for students entering an engineering course. The fragility function concept, borrowed from the earthquake engineering field, estimates the likelihood of success in a course, given relevant student metadata, such as the grade point average, thus comprehensively addressing student performance variability. A student academic success prediction model enables instructional designers to make informed decisions. For example, fragility curves can help achieve two goals: (i) assessing the population at risk for a course to take actions to improve student success rates and (ii) assessing a course's relative difficulty based on its fragility function parameters. We demonstrate this methodology through a case study comparing the relative difficulty of two engineering courses, Statics and Solid Mechanics, at a university in Colombia. Given that Statics serves as a prerequisite for Solid Mechanics, deficiencies in the former can significantly impact student performance in the latter. The case study results reveal that Solid Mechanics poses a higher risk of academic failure than Statics, underscoring the importance of a strong foundation in prerequisite courses.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,,,,2024-05-15,2024,2024-05-15,2024-09,32,5,,Closed,Article,"Abuchar, Verónica J.; Arteta, Carlos A.; De La Hoz, Jose L.; Vieira, Camilo","Abuchar, Verónica J.

The purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore the operational domains of HA in Peruvian older adults.
METHOD: The approach adopted was fundamental qualitative descriptive. A purposive sampling was used and 26 participants attending senior centers belonging to the municipal commune of Lima were recruited (Medad=67.9; SD=6.64). Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the content analysis was carried out using an inductive method identifying the units of meaning of the HA.
RESULTS: The content analysis showed 11 sub-themes and 4 main themes. The identified themes were as follows: ""functional health"", ""psychological well-being"", ""active engagement with life"" and ""religion"". Given this, the results demonstrate the multidimensionality of HA in Peruvian older adults.
CONCLUSION: The operational domains of HA indicate the importance of individual perceptions considering functional health, psychological well-being, active engagement with life, and religion.

2884,pub.1171919577,10.1002/cae.22749,,,Beyond analytics: Using computer‐aided methods in educational research to extend qualitative data analysis,"Abstract This study proposes and demonstrates how computer‐aided methods can be used to extend qualitative data analysis by quantifying qualitative data, and then through exploration, categorization, grouping, and validation. Computer‐aided approaches to inquiry have gained important ground in educational research, mostly through data analytics and large data set processing. We argue that qualitative data analysis methods can also be supported and extended by computer‐aided methods. In particular, we posit that computing capacities rationally applied can expand the innate human ability to recognize patterns and group qualitative information based on similarities. We propose a principled approach to using machine learning in qualitative education research based on the three interrelated elements of the assessment triangle: cognition, observation, and interpretation. Through the lens of the assessment triangle, the study presents three examples of qualitative studies in engineering education that have used computer‐aided methods for visualization and grouping. The first study focuses on characterizing students' written explanations of programming code, using tile plots and hierarchical clustering with binary distances to identify the different approaches that students used to self‐explain. The second study looks into students' modeling and simulation process and elicits the types of knowledge that they used in each step through a think‐aloud protocol. For this purpose, we used a bubble plot and a k‐means clustering algorithm. The third and final study explores engineering faculty's conceptions of teaching, using data from semi‐structured interviews. We grouped these conceptions based on coding similarities, using Jaccard's similarity coefficient, and visualized them using a treemap. We conclude this manuscript by discussing some implications for engineering education qualitative research.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under awards No. DGE‐2219271 and EEC‐1826099.

Antimicrobial resistance is exacerbated by the widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture, aquaculture, and human medicine, leading to their accumulation in various environmental compartments such as soil, water, and sediments. The presence of ARGs in the environment, particularly in municipal water, animal husbandry, and hospital environments, poses significant risks to human health, as they can be transferred to potential human pathogens. Current remediation strategies, including the use of pyroligneous acid, coagulants, advanced oxidation, and bioelectrochemical systems, have shown promising results in reducing ARGs and ARBs from soil and water. However, these methods come with their own set of challenges, such as the need for elevated base levels in UV-activated persulfate and the long residence period required for photocatalysts. The future of combating antibiotic resistance lies in the development of standardized monitoring techniques, global collaboration, and the exploration of innovative remediation methods. Emphasis on combination therapies, advanced oxidation processes, and monitoring horizontal gene transfer can pave the way for a comprehensive approach to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Restoration and Remediation",2024-09-01,2024,2024-09-01,2024-11,952,,175906,Closed,Article,"Cedeño-Muñoz, Jeffrey Saúl; Aransiola, Sesan Abiodun; Reddy, Kondakindi Venkateswar; Ranjit, Pabbati; Victor-Ekwebelem, Munachimso Odenakachi; Oyedele, Olusegun Julius; Pérez-Almeida, Iris B; Maddela, Naga Raju; Rodríguez-Díaz, Joan Manuel","Cedeño-Muñoz, Jeffrey Saúl (Departamento de Procesos Químicos, Biotecnología y Alimentos, Facultad de Ingenierías y Ciencias Aplicadas, Universidad Técnica de Manabí, Portoviejo, Ecuador.); Aransiola, Sesan Abiodun (Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, University of Abuja, PMB 117, Abuja, Nigeria.); Reddy, Kondakindi Venkateswar (Center for Biotechnology, University College of Engineering Science and Technology, Hyderabad, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad, Kukatpally, Hyderabad 500085, Telangana, India.); Ranjit, Pabbati (Center for Biotechnology, University College of Engineering Science and Technology, Hyderabad, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad, Kukatpally, Hyderabad 500085, Telangana, India.); Victor-Ekwebelem, Munachimso Odenakachi (Department of Microbiology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike, PMB 1010, Abakaliki, Nigeria.); Oyedele, Olusegun Julius (Bioresources Development Centre, National Biotechnology Development Agency, Ogbomoso, Nigeria.); Pérez-Almeida, Iris B (Center for Sustainable Development Studies (CEDS), Ecotec University, Samborondón, Ecuador.

2660,pub.1173614654,10.1002/suco.202400024,,,ANN‐based analysis of the effect of SCM on recycled aggregate concrete,"Abstract  Rising environmental awareness has prompted in‐depth studies on how the concrete industry affects the environment. Using recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete manufacturing provides advantages for sustainability. However, the broader chemical composition of SCMs and the inferior qualities of RCAs compared with natural aggregates (NAs) often lead to a decrease in concrete mechanical strength. The difficulty lies in foreseeing how the inclusion of SCMs and RCAs will affect the concrete compressive strength. The artificial neural network (ANN) approach presented herein can precisely forecast the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) compressive strength, even when incorporates SCMs. The analysis employing the connection weight approach (CWA) determines how input variables influence compressive strength. Results indicate silica fume contributes most to compressive strength, followed by cement content, silica modulus, fine natural aggregate dosage, and coarse natural aggregate. Additionally, the amount of water utilized, the water/cement ratio, and the presence of RCA are all detrimental to compressive strength. The adverse effect of the cementitious materials' alumina modulus can be attributed to increased water demand during their reaction. Performance metrics of the final ANN model on the testing data subset include R 2 = 0.94, and RMSE = 3.11, utilizing 834 data observations after outlier treatment for training and validation purposes. In summary, the ANN‐based approach demonstrates its efficacy in predicting concrete compressive strength when incorporating SCMs and RCAs, shedding light on the influential factors in concrete performance.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors extend their sincere gratitude for the invaluable support received from the Office of the Vice Rector for Research, Creation, and Innovation Directorate at the Universidad del Norte, particularly through the Research Agendas with the codes 2021‐007 and 2022‐007.

2506,pub.1175809106,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2024.138353,,,Fracture characteristics of SMA mixtures with hydrated lime through the semi-circular bending approach,"Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) is a composite mixture made up of high-quality crushed stone, fine aggregates, an asphalt binder, and a significant percentage of mineral filler in contrast to conventional mixtures. Renowned for its durability and rolling resistance, it is predominantly employed as a surface “wearing” course on main roads subjected to heavy traffic, but it can also be used as a binder course under specific project requirements. In this study, we investigated the effect of hydrated lime as a partial replacement of limestone filler at various concentrations on the mechanical and cracking resistance characteristics of 10-mm SMA mixtures. The semi-circular bending (SCB) test, which is pivotal for understanding the cracking mechanism was used to assess the mixtures performance-related response to this distress type. The mixture cores were produced with granite aggregates, limestone filler as natural filler, hydrated lime as natural filler replacement, and a 30/45 penetration asphalt type. Mixtures containing 1.1 %, 2.2 %, and 3.4 % of hydrated lime by weight of aggregates were evaluated, in addition to a control mixture without hydrated lime. The factors considered for comparing the mixtures included: load and deformation curves, stiffness, fracture toughness, fracture energy, and flexibility index of the mixtures. The experimental program also comprised a set of various test temperatures (0°C, 10°C, and 20°C) to better understand the cracking mechanism. Experimental results indicated a significant performance-dependency on the HL concentration and the test temperature. Precisely, it was found that the mixture with the highest hydrated lime content (3.4 %) exhibited the best cracking performance at 0°C and 20°C, making it a suitable filler replacement concentration. However, at 10°C, the mixture containing 2.2 % hydrated lime showed the most consistent performance overall, suggesting and important improvement in asphalt mixtures’ cracking resistance. Overall, these findings obtained from the SCB test approach substantiate the potential benefit of hydrated lime filler replacement in optimizing the cracking performance and durability of SMA mixtures under varying temperature conditions and loading regimes.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of specific exercises in general population with non-specific low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google scholar from January 1990 to June 2021. Initially, 47,740 records were identified. Following the removal of duplicates, 32,138 records were left. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 262 papers were chosen for thorough assessment. Among these, 208 studies were excluded, resulting in 54 trials meeting the inclusion criteria for this study. Additionally, 46 of these trials were randomized controlled trials and were further evaluated for the meta-analysis. We included trials investigating the effectiveness of exercise therapy, including isometric activation of deep trunk muscles, strengthening exercises, stabilization exercises, stretching exercises, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises (PNF) in LBP patients. The primary outcome was pain intensity, measured using tools such as the visual analogue scale (VAS) and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). The secondary outcome was disability, assessed through instruments such as the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The quality of the eligible studies was assessed using the Verhagen tool, and the level of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach.
RESULTS: Based on the Verhagen tool, 46 trials (85.2%) were categorized as having low methodological quality, while 8 studies (14.8%) were considered to have medium methodological quality. The meta-analysis indicated a small efficacy in favor of isometric activation of deep trunk muscles (-0.37, 95% CI: -0.88 to 0.13), a moderate efficacy in favor of stabilization exercises (-0.53, 95% CI: -1.13 to 0.08), and a large efficacy in favor of PNF exercises (-0.91, 95% CI: -1.62 to -0.2) for reducing pain intensity as assessed by VAS or NPRS tools. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed a moderate efficacy for isometric activation of deep trunk muscles (-0.61, CI: -1.02 to -0.19), and a large efficacy for PNF exercises (-1.26, 95% CI: -1.81 to -0.72) in improving disability, assessed using RMDQ or ODI questionnaires. The level of certainty in the evidence, as determined by the GRADE approach, was very low to low.
CONCLUSION: These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating localized therapeutic exercises as a fundamental aspect of managing non-specific LBP. Clinicians should consider utilizing localized therapeutic exercise tailored to individual patient needs. Furthermore, further research investigating optimal exercise therapy, optimal dose of the exercises, durations, and long-term adherence is warranted to enhance the precision and efficacy of exercise-based interventions for non-specific LBP.",Declaration of Competing interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to this systematic review and meta-analysis.

It occurs within healthcare settings in the context of gynecological care, and despite its prevalence, there's a dearth of research exploring strategies to combat it. This qualitative study aimed to investigate the coping mechanisms adopted by women and individuals assigned female at birth (cisgender, gender nonconforming, and transgender) following experiences of violence in Chile. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore their coping strategies. The transcriptions were analyzed employing thematic analysis, which revealed that individuals primarily coped with gynecological violence by seeking interpersonal interactions that provided emotional and instrumental support.

Not only classic producers of secondary metabolites such as Streptomyces and other members of the phylum Actinobacteria but also numerous bacteria from the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and an impressive array of fungi (usually pathogenic) serve as the source of a structurally diverse number of small molecules with important biological activities including antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiparasitic and specific enzyme inhibitors. The insect niche is often the exclusive provider of microbes producing unique types of biologically active compounds such as gerumycins, pederin, dinactin, and formicamycins. However, numerous insects still have not been described taxonomically, and in most cases, the study of their microbiota is completely unexplored. In this review, we present a comprehensive survey of 553 natural products produced by microorganisms isolated from insects by collating and classifying all the data according to the type of compound (rather than the insect or microbial source). The analysis of the correlations among the metadata related to insects, microbial partners, and their produced compounds provides valuable insights into the intricate dynamics between insects and their symbionts as well as the impact of their metabolites on these relationships.

Los signos y síntomas oftálmicos de la fístula carotídeo-cavernosa son inespecíficos, por lo que pueden surgir dificultades en el diagnóstico, ya que inicialmente puede identificarse erróneamente como una patología orbitaria primaria. Caso clínico Varón sano de 39 años que desarrolló diplopía, lagrimeo ipsilateral y cefalea hemicraneal izquierda pulsátil. Cambios inflamatorios periorbitarios, diplopía y oftalmoplejía dolorosa sin alteración de la agudeza visual. Tras estudios paraclínicos donde se investigaron enfermedades infecciosas y no infecciosas, se identificó finalmente una fístula carotídeo-cavernosa. El paciente fue sometido a embolización endovascular transarterial, para su corrección. Logró recuperación completa de la movilidad ocular, con resolución del edema y del dolor. Conclusiones La fístula carotídeo-cavernosa es una entidad con múltiples formas de presentación, y se debe tener una alta sospecha clínica para su diagnóstico. Un diagnóstico oportuno y el tratamiento adecuado pueden llevar a una recuperación completa y prevenir complicaciones graves. Introduction A carotid-cavernous fistula is an abnormal connection between a branch of the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus that can result in severe ocular complications. Ophthalmic signs and symptoms of carotid-cavernous fistula are unspecific, thus difficulties in diagnosis may arise since it can initially be misidentified as primary orbital pathology. Clinical case A healthy 39-year-old male who developed diplopia, ipsilateral lacrimation and a pulsating left hemi-cranial headache. Periorbital inflammatory changes, diplopia, and painful ophthalmoplegia without alteration of visual acuity. A thorough diagnostic and imaging process where infectious and non-infectious diseases were investigated, finally identifying a carotid-cavernous fistula. The patient underwent endovascular transarterial embolization, for correction of the carotid-cavernous fistula. He achieved complete recovery of ocular mobility, with edema and pain resolution. Conclusions Carotid-cavernous fistula is an entity with multiple forms of presentation, and a high clinical suspicion is necessary for its diagnosis.

Pandemic grief and suicidal ideation were measured using the Pandemic Grief Scale and a single item, respectively. Network analysis provides an in-depth characterization of symptom-symptom interactions within mental disorders. The results indicated that, ""desire to die,"" ""apathy"" and ""absence of sense of life"" are the most central symptoms in a pandemic grief symptom network; therefore, these symptoms could be focal elements for preventive and treatment efforts. Suicidal ideation, the wish to die, and the absence of meaning in life had the strongest relationship. In general, the network structure did not differ among the participating countries. It identifies specific symptoms within the network that may increase the likelihood of their co-occurrence and is useful at the therapeutic level.",,,Psychological Reports,,,,2024-02-06,2024,2024-02-06,2024-02-06,,,332941241231209,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás;

This study investigates the relationship between mental health, posttraumatic cognition, emotional intelligence (EI), and PS among women victims of IPV with ongoing legal proceedings at the Center for Comprehensive Assistance and Investigation on Domestic Violence in the District Attorney's Office 16 of Barranquilla, Colombia. The study focuses on participants (N = 128) who filed charges against their current or former intimate partners and it employs logistic regression analysis to predict participants who develop moderate to severe PS. Four of every five women do not consider themselves victims of violence, suggesting a notable lack of perception regarding their traumatic experiences as instances of victimization. The results reveal a complex interplay between PS and high psychological and social well-being scores. Despite the traumatic experiences and negative indicators affecting the mental health of IPV victims, this research identifies elements of well-being and a positive life appraisal that aid their coping strategies. A high level of EI is found among participants and associated with the odds of 2.7 to perceive severe stress, which may suggest that a high level increases emotional awareness in victims of this type of adversity. These findings emphasize the need for tailored intervention programs to address coping mechanisms and they contribute to an understanding of the challenges faced by IPV victims and advocate for holistic support mechanisms.","The authors extend their sincere gratitude to all individuals and institutions that supported and contributed to the completion of this research.

1947,pub.1170117341,10.1016/j.soildyn.2024.108608,,,Practical considerations in liquefaction numerical simulations calibrated with historical data,"The paper details some practical considerations associated with the numerical simulation of liquefaction in Wildlife site in Southern California. Two material constitutive models are implemented in the simulations: a pressure-dependent multi-yield-surface model (PDMY) and PM4Sand, both available in the OpenSees finite elements platform. Both uniaxial as well as biaxial simulations are presented in the paper. The uniaxial simulations only include the predominant horizontal shaking component while the biaxial simulations include both orthogonal horizontal shaking components. Two historical major earthquake events were simulated: the 1987 Superstition Hills and the 2010 El Mayor Cucapah earthquakes. Laboratory experimental data used for calibration of the material models was obtained from historical data published in the 1980's. This data is particularly valuable since they correspond to intact (undisturbed) samples extracted from Wildlife site about two years before occurrence of the 1987 earthquake. In all the simulations, the models were able to capture salient features of the deposit's behavior, such as the magnitude of surface accelerations, and dilative behavior of the soil. However, the excess pore water pressure rises earlier than what the site recordings indicates. This may be attributed to the fact that the constitutive models do not consider the concept of volumetric threshold shear strain below which no excess pore water pressure is generated during cyclic shear loading. It was also found that there was a significant overestimation of the excess pore pressure for the 2010 El Mayor Cucapah earthquake simulations. This may be attributed to the effect of the site shaking history which increased the site resistance to liquefaction. This added resistance was not reflected by the numerical model since it was calibrated with samples extracted about 25 years before the 2010 earthquake.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Using data from the International Sex Survey (N = 82,243), confirmatory factor analyses and measurement invariance analyses were performed on the preestablished five-factor structure of the 20-item short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale to examine whether (a) psychometric validity and reliability and (b) psychometric equivalence hold across 34 country-of-residence-related, 22 language-related, and three gender-identity-related groups. The results of the present study extend the latter psychometric instrument's well-established relevance to 26 countries, 13 languages, and three gender identities. Most notably, psychometric validity and reliability were evidenced across nine novel translations included in the present study (i.e., Croatian, English, German, Hebrew, Korean, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese-Portugal, and Spanish-Latin American) and psychometric equivalence was evidenced across all three gender identities included in the present study (i.e., women, men, and gender-diverse individuals).",,,Assessment,,,,2024-07-26,2024,2024-07-26,2024-07-26,,,10731911241259560,Closed,Article,"Fournier, Loïs;

Introduction The Colombian armed conflict has caused psychological damage, and collective wounds in social relationship networks and scenarios. Martín-Baró defined this damage as psychosocial trauma, which led to the definition of its theoretical dimensions and the development of the Psychosocial Trauma Scale (ETAPS). Objective To validate the ETAPS in a sample of victims of the Colombian armed conflict. Methods Instrumental study to assess the construct validity and internal consistency of the ETAPS (composed of 61 items) in a sample of 380 adults (80% women and 20% men) who have been victims of the Colombian armed conflict, mostly of internal displacement (91.1%). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out, and the discriminatory power of the items, the correlation between factors and the reliability of the scale were analyzed. Results We propose a new version ETAPS 0.2 composed of 39 items grouped into 4 dimensions: Repression and abuse, Threat and fear, Negative intergroup emotions, and Destruction of sociality. The scale shows good levels of reliability, with a range between α=0.80 and α=0.84.

Materials and methods A case–control study nested in a cohort was chosen. Patients with SLE with renal involvement were included. Measurement of antibodies against C1q, levels of adiponectin, and HLA expression DRB1 and DQB1 were evaluated. We searched for possible associations between the measured biomarkers and allelic HLA types found. Results One hundred and six patients were recruited with LN with a mean age of 35 years. Mean adiponectin levels were 16.9μg/mL, and 60% of patients presented anti-C1q positivity. HLA DRB1*0404 and DRB1*1101 are protective factors for LN (OR: .42, p =.0030 and OR: 0.49, p =.046 respectively). HLA DRB1*0701 (OR: 3.15, p =.0452) and DRB1*0802 (OR: 8.3, p =.020) are susceptibility factors for LN.

Tests of concrete and reinforcing bars taken from collapsed buildings aided at assessing the impact of materials properties on the behavior of buildings. The paper describes the statistics of damage sustained by schools following the ATC-20 scheme. A set of statistics are developed describing the scaling of damage with distance and PGA. The analyses showed that 30% of the buildings surrounding schools performed “Better” than them, and approximately 33% performed “Worse” than them. For those schools tagged under RESTRICTED USE and with UNSAFE placards, 44% of the surrounding buildings behave “Better” than them, and only 16% behaved “Worse”, indicating the need for a strong public policy to reduce vulnerability of school in Ecuador. Georeferenced data allow a spatial cross-correlation of different levels of damage observed with the ground motion intensity. This information may serve as benchmark for calibration of seismic risk models, and for post-earthquake risk comparison. Furthermore, regional seismic risk assessment may be calibrated with the results of the spatial cross-correlation analyses presented.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Voluntary participants, through surveys, focus groups, and interviews, perceived that students developed IC, although somewhat unintentionally. This result cannot be solely associated with the EMI approach, but other classroom-related factors such as the international/intercultural nature of the course, teacher pedagogy, and/or the international/intercultural profile of the professor played a decisive role in this development. This study strengthens the research on the EMI-intercultural competence connection. Esta investigación de método-mixto explora si la instrucción mediada en inglés (EMI) fomenta el desarrollo de la competencia intercultural en estudiantes (n=91) en ocho cursos de dos universidades colombianas. A través de encuestas, grupos focales y entrevistas, se percibieron que los estudiantes desarrollaron dicha competencia, aunque de manera no intencional. Este resultado no puede asociarse únicamente con el enfoque EMI, sino con otros factores en el aula, como el carácter internacional/intercultural del curso, la pedagogía del profesor y/o el perfil internacional/intercultural del profesor que juegan un papel en este desarrollo.

1840,pub.1170091173,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2024.123032,,,Dynamic modeling of a centrifugal chiller with hybrid falling film evaporator including pressure drop computation,"Over the last decade, the introduction of new technologies such as falling film evaporators and advanced control techniques has significantly enhanced chiller efficiency while reducing refrigerant charges. However, the complexity of the involved transport phenomena poses significant challenges in simulating the behavior of these devices, resulting in very few validated models that encompass such advances. This study introduces a novel dynamic model for centrifugal liquid chillers with a hybrid evaporator (one that combines features of falling film and flooded designs). Employing the moving boundary method, the model incorporates the intricacies of the transport phenomena, including the pressure drop across the tube bank, with relatively low computational requirements. Implemented in OpenModelica, the model was validated using performance data from a 550 TR centrifugal chiller, yielding normalized residual errors of less than 0.5% for values of supply water temperature and power consumption. This provides a comprehensive tool suitable for analyzing chiller performance as a function of the evaporator geometric characteristics and enabling optimal dynamic control of central cooling systems incorporating this kind of chillers, as long as contributes to the development of dynamic and steady state models of vapor compression centrifugal chillers with falling film evaporators.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Pickard-Cambridge, 1898, Gephyrellula Strand, 1932, Petrichus Simon, 1886, and Tibelloides Mello-Leito, 1939. The genus Gephyrellula is recorded based on the newly described G. lavidabonita sp. nov., known from females from the department of Magdalena, constituting the northernmost known locality for the genus, at Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. This new species can be differentiated from the (previously monotypic) type species G. violacea (Mello-Leito, 1918), known from southeastern region of Brazil, by the longer than wide epiginal plates (wider than long in G. violacea), with narrower and shorter ducts of the glandular heads (thicker and longer in G. violacea), and by their more posteriorly placed fertilization ducts. The genus Apollophanes is here firstly recorded from males and females of A. punctipes (O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1891) from the Atlntico, Magdalena, Cesar, Cundinamarca, and Boyac departments. Tibelloides is recorded from males and females of T. bryantae (Gertsch, 1933), from the departments of Magdalena and Meta, also representing northernmost known localities for the genus. Finally, new faunistic and taxonomic data is presented for Petrichus. Our examination of the holotype of Thanatus granadensis Keyserling, 1880 demonstrates this species is conspecific with more recently collected and better-preserved specimens of Petrichus griseus Berland, 1913, from the department of Santander. Therefore, we propose the new combination Petrichus granadensis comb. nov., regard P. griseus as its junior synonym syn. nov., and update knowledge of its distribution.","We thank William Galvis Peuela (father of WG) and Lina Jimnez Torres (Universidad de Buenos Aires), for their help and time during collecting times of WG in the Caribbean region of Colombia.

The purpose of this study is to assess the QualEnv Consortium's contributions (QualEnv, a cooperative network of 16 universities across several countries, aimed to promote sustainability within HEIs). This paper focuses on three key objectives: illustrating QualEnv's successful, replicable sustainability strategies, highlighting their application and outcomes and contributing to the discourse on sustainable practices in HEIs.   Design/methodology/approach This research uses qualitative and exploratory methods to provide an in-depth view of sustainability practices and strategies within universities. This study relies on documentation, specifically the “Sustainability Handbooks” of the QualEnv project, as a source of evidence.   Findings This study reveals that the QualEnv Consortium's strategies have significantly improved the environmental and social performance of participating HEIs. Notably, this research identifies substantial enhancements in key sustainability metrics, including reduced carbon emissions, increased adoption of eco-friendly practices and stronger community engagement.   Research limitations/implications This study has some limitations. First, the choice of a qualitative methodological approach may constrain the generalizability of the findings. Another relevant limitation is related to the uniformity in adopting sustainable practices. The effectiveness of actions linked to the Sustainable Development Goals may depend on consistency in implementation among participating universities, and variations in this aspect can affect the direct comparison of adopted strategies.   Originality/value This research contributes to the sustainability in higher education field by comprehensively examining the QualEnv Consortium's innovative approach. By focusing on QualEnv's experiences and outcomes, this research offers valuable insights and serves as a model for HEIs worldwide seeking to align their academic, research and community engagement efforts with sustainable development goals.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of several institutions in the successful completion of this study.

However, these factors vary according to the socioeconomic context. We estimate a discrete choice model to investigate the determinants of career preferences using a survey of high school students (n = 1,658) in Santiago, Chile. Results show that gender, academic performance, type of school, parents’ occupation, and high school track are significant, but their influences vary among career categories.

We frame this examination both through recent feminist geographic scholarship on displacement, trauma, and the body, as well as through the concept of territorio cuerpo-tierra, which has recently emerged from Latin American feminist communitarianism. These narratives used in this research were produced through the process of body mapping conducted as a part of an eight-day workshop in which research participants engaged in multiple arts-based methodologies. The results of this research underscore how the concept of territorio cuerpo-tierra is materialized in the experiences of displaced women through a sustained connection of self and place. They also highlight the ways that displacement and trauma connect the body/territory; refuse to be spatially or temporally contained; and provide the resources for healing, emplacement, and spatial repossession.",,,Cultural Geographies,,,,2024-08-13,2024,2024-08-13,,,,,Closed,Article,"Whitson, Risa; Gómez, Nancy R; Pérez Quintero, Camilo","Whitson, Risa (Ohio University, USA); Gómez, Nancy R (Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Pérez Quintero, Camilo (Regis University, USA)",,"Whitson, Risa (Ohio University); Gómez, Nancy R (Universidad del Norte); Pérez Quintero, Camilo (Regis University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174772985,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,5 Gender Equality

More specifically, it focuses on the use of statements, commands, modality, comment assessment, and positive and negative lexis, in early and late career papers from 30 linguists born between 1905 and 1960. These linguists were grouped into three cohorts based on year of birth and studied in terms of variation along developmental and cross-generational timescales. Within the developmental timescale, scholars were found to use more evaluation in early career writing than in late career writing. Cohort-specific developmental changes are identified in the frequency of modality and comment assessment. Developmental and cohort-specific trends are found to occur within the backdrop of an overall decrease in the use of evaluative language within the discipline. Results point to a complex diachronic model of academic identity enactment in writing, whereby evaluative features pattern in similar or different ways depending on the timescale considered.",,,Journal of Historical Sociolinguistics,,,,2024-04-01,2024,2024-04-10,2024-04-01,10,1,93-125,Closed,Article,"Lyons, Jesús David Guerra; Concu, Valentina","Lyons, Jesús David Guerra (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)","Lyons, Jesús David Guerra (Universidad del Norte); Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170559305,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

The approach reduces the failure rate in the course. In addition, the approach helped students understand the application of programming to different engineering professional areas. Background: Programming courses in engineering develop abilities required for professional practice, such as applying concepts to solve complex problems using critical thinking analysis. However, a considerable body of research shows that these courses have significant failure rates because students perceive a high complexity in the topics. Different studies show the effectiveness of using active learning methods such as TBL to improve student performance and perception of the course. Nonetheless, there are few studies regarding active learning with TD in programming courses. Intended Outcomes: The use of TBL with a TD approach can improve student performance through teamwork and discussions including different perspectives. Application Design: The method creates teams of students from different programs and assigns real-life problems related to diverse engineering disciplines. Findings: TBL with TD allows for improving student performance and decreases failure rates. Additionally, a survey shows that students favor the methodology and are committed to developing different activities that integrate several areas of knowledge. Furthermore, the method allows students to visualize the usefulness of the course concepts in their professional field. The students also favor the dynamics of the class and the teamwork.",,,IEEE Transactions on Education,,,,2024-03-07,2024,2024-03-07,2024-04-01,67,2,317-326,Closed,Article,"Ramos-Rodriguez, Rocio; Calle, Maria; Coronell, Garis; Becerra, John E.

We present three novel formulations for this problem, which are the first suitable for column generation and branch-and-price (BP) algorithms. Specifically, our first formulation is based on enumerating crew schedules and routes while explicitly defining the relief paths. The second formulation relies on enumerating the schedules, routes, and relief paths. Finally, the third formulation builds upon the second one by including additional constraints and variables related to relief path decisions. Considering each formulation, we propose BP algorithms that rely on several enhancements, including a new dynamic programming labeling algorithm to efficiently solve the subproblems. Extensive computational results based on 648 benchmark instances reveal that our BP algorithms significantly outperform existing exact approaches, solving 450 instances to optimality, and remarkably 118 instances for the first time. Our framework is also very effective in improving the lower bounds, upper bounds, and optimality gaps that have been reported in the literature.

A workforce management optimization approach for retailers,"This research examines the economic viability of night shelf stocking in the retail industry. By analyzing real data on the costs and benefits of both night and day stocking, we propose a novel integer linear optimization model to determine the optimal structure of shelf stocker shifts for individual stores. The model is tested on a standard Chilean supermarket, with a sensitivity analysis performed on key parameters including product demands, shelf capacity, and cost factors. The results reveal that a daytime shelf stocking system is impractical and costly for high-demand outlets. We recommend combining day and night stockings, as night stocking proves to be more efficient, reducing stockouts and salary costs. Additionally, an analysis incorporating semi-night shifts as an alternative to traditional shift patterns demonstrates that combining day, night, and semi-night shift structures is the most cost-effective solution, minimizing labor and stocking expenses without compromising service quality. This study highlights the economic advantages of night shelf stocking and provides valuable insights for retailers seeking to optimize their operations.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, it faces challenges such as interlaminar weaknesses and reduced strength because of product anisotropy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology that integrates design for additive manufacturing (AM) principles with fused filament fabrication (FFF) to address these challenges, thereby enhancing product reliability and strength.   Design/methodology/approach Developed through case analysis and literature review, this methodology focuses on design methodology for AM (DFAM) principles applied to FFF for high mechanical performance applications. A DFAM database is constructed to identify common requirements and establish design rules, validated through a case study.   Findings Existing DFAM approaches often lack failure theory integration, especially in FFF, emphasizing mechanical characterizations over predictive failure analysis in functional parts. This methodology addresses this gap by enhancing product reliability through failure prediction in high-performance FFF applications.   Originality/value While some DFAM methods exist for high-performance FFF, they are often specific cases. Existing DFAM methodologies typically apply broadly across AM processes without a specific focus on failure theories in functional parts. This methodology integrates FFF with a failure theory approach to strengthen product reliability in high-performance applications.","This work was supported by Universidad del Atlantico calls RES001735 13 OCT. 2016 and RES002087 22 DEC. 2016, the experimental data was obtained in the Universidad del Norte, Universidad del Atlantico and 3D Ingenieria Bq SAS.",,Rapid Prototyping Journal,,,,2024-08-27,2024,2024-08-27,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,Closed,Article,"Taborda, Luis Lisandro Lopez; Maury, Heriberto; Esparragoza, Ivan E.","Taborda, Luis Lisandro Lopez (Facultad de Ingeniería, Programa de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Atlántico, Barranquilla, Colombia, ; Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia and Departamento de Desarrollo, Investigacion e Innovacion, 3D Ingeniería BQ SAS, Barranquilla, Colombia); Maury, Heriberto (Departamento de Ingeniería Mecánica, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Esparragoza, Ivan E.

To them, the lake and surrounding forest were places used for diverse of activities including religious rituals. In this study we produced a multi-proxy paleolimnological reconstruction using diatoms, isotopes, and geochemistry, to try to understand the lake’s pathways of change in response to natural climatic variations and anthropogenic activities. The diatom record is dominated by tychoplanktonic Staurosirella dubia and planktonic Aulacoseira species including species A. cf lirata, A. granulata, A. distans, and A. ambigua.

Privatization, poor infrastructural maintenance, and intermittence have made access to water a matter of concern. In this context, the Committee for the Defense of Water and Life came into being in 2014, as an urban grassroots organization, making calls on the city’s population to mobilize for their right to clean water. In this article, however, we argue that the acts of defending water are not limited to the realm of collective action and overt activism against national and local governmental decisions. Rather, defending water in places such as Buenaventura is also an everyday gendered practice where water is secured and protected against other beings such as microbes and/or mosquitoes. Drawing on collaborative work, we document how women protect water in less visible scenarios such as the home. These women engage in a repertoire of domestic activities and techniques in order to obtain, store and keep water clean, as stored (and therefore stagnant) waters are never only water but are also home to large and threatening communities of organisms such as microbes and mosquitoes on their water stages. We bring political ecology indoors to reflect on how gendered domestic spaces become a dynamic and crucial ecological and political arena for the defense of water and life.","The research project upon which this article is based was funded by the DUPC2 Water and Development Partnership Programme, project number 109356. The authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to the people of Buenaventura.

Undoped ZnO nanopowders underwent calcination in O2-rich and H2-rich atmospheres at 600 °C. Samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman, photoluminescence (PL) and UV–vis absorbance spectroscopies. The doping and calcinations led to a reduction of the optical bandgap of the nanopowders, while their structure remained hexagonal wurtzite with some changes in lattice parameters and average nanoparticle sizes. The Cu2+ doping led to a BET surface area and violet PL component increase. Samples were also examined for environmental related applications, namely as photocatalyzers for dye degradation and as ethanol optical sensors. For photocatalytic activity in methylene blue degradation under UV, H2-rich calcined powders excelled, with a rate constant of −0.076 min−1, surpassing −0.057 min−1 (ZnO:Cu), −0.056 min−1 (O2-rich calcination), and −0.041 min−1 (as-grown ZnO). We propose that this improvement can be attributed to the formation of ZnO/Zn interfaces stemming from the reduction of surface interstitial zinc by H2 during calcination, in addition to the observed reduction of the ZnO bandgap. The doped nanopowders PL also showed excellent response when exposed to ethanol vapor.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The TLRCW system comprises slender walls with a thickness lower than 150 mm, a high aspect ratio, limited or no confinement at the edges of the walls, and web reinforcement with limited ductility. This paper describes and discusses the main geometric and mechanical characteristics of 207 TLRCW buildings constructed in intermediate- and high-seismicity regions. Variables considered in the study are the number of stories, wall-area index, axial load ratio, slenderness, aspect ratio, and the type of reinforcement at wall edges. Statistical analyses of the database and global performance indices are correlated with the expected seismic performance of TLRCW buildings. The results of the analyses aided at developing a useful toolbox for rapid assessment of design and structural configuration to prioritize intervention strategies for existing TLRCW buildings.","The authors gratefully acknowledge to university members of the Colombian Earthquake Engineering Research Network – CEER (Universidad de Medellín, Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, Universidad EIA and Universidad del Norte Colombia).

Here we predict the presence of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and current-induced spin polarization (CISP) within chiral selenium crystals, employing symmetry analysis and first-principles computational techniques. Notably, band structure calculations unveiled the presence of Rashba splitting, a manifestation of spin-orbit coupling, in these noninversion-symmetric materials. Moreover, our findings reveal that bulk selenium holds promise as a thermoelectric material by adjusting the carrier concentration accordingly. The ZT value we have obtained for t-Se is similar to that of the layered thermoelectric material SnSe and higher than its t-Te counterpart. The unique properties of chiral Se crystals, such as the Rashba splitting and the emergence of spin-related phenomena, together with their thermoelectric features, hold promise for potential applications of this chiral crystal in emerging technologies.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the computing time granted on the GRANADO and HPC facilities at the Universidad del Norte.

1638,pub.1175125878,10.1016/j.enpol.2024.114300,,,Assessment of Colombian renewable energy auctions policy: Enabler or barrier for concentrating solar power plants,"Auctions are an alternative for introducing renewable energy (RE) projects into electricity markets at competitive prices. Colombia added 2.2 GW capacity of RE through this mechanism. Nevertheless, 94% of the awarded generation is allocated between 12 a.m. and 5 p.m. because of a lack of low-cost storage. Integrating concentrating solar power plants (CSP) could be relevant in tackling this issue. Therefore, a preliminary step is to determine if Colombian instruments benefit the deployment of CSP and trigger the discussion about its future in the country. In this work, we evaluate how auction mechanisms and fiscal incentives (FI) influence the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for two CSP configurations. The results indicate that FIs reduce capital expenditures between 17.11% and 19.45%, reaching similar LCOEs to those reported internationally. However, energy prices higher than USD 150/MWh are required to achieve an adequate IRR. Regarding the auction design, it is observed that a “security criterion” leads to a significant loss of competitiveness for CSP as it neglects its possibility to support demand at night. Policy suggestions are provided for a level playing field where low-cost solutions can coexist with dispatchable renewable power generation.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this paper, data are collected in Colombia and Ecuador to estimate DCFs for water and food, considering the influence of individuals' attitudes on preparedness, risk perception, and trust in response agents. Hybrid Choice Models are used to analyze and compare the estimated DCFs. The analyses confirm that DCFs differ by commodity. Additionally, socioeconomic characteristics of individuals influence their willingness to pay for critical supplies to reduce their own suffering. Preparedness, risk perceptions and trust in response agents impact individuals' behavior in disaster situations. The results also show that community and religious groups are considered the most trusted response agents in both countries. As a result, their involvement in official relief efforts should be more articulated. Colombia and Ecuador show significant differences in their estimated DCFs, confirming that deprivation costs are context-specific by nature. As such, DCFs should not be directly transferred among disaster locations. The findings from this study will support decision-makers in designing effective preparedness and response plans that are based on trust relationships that serve as foundations for community resilience.","Acknowledgement Victor Cantillo acknowledges the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation for the support in the STIC-AMSUD 22-STIC-09 project.

This qualitative study aimed to understand the social beliefs of citizens of nine urban centers in Colombia regarding the Peace Process between the Colombian State and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP). There were 256 subjects, 127 women and 129 men, who participated in a semistructured and in-depth interview during the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2020. The results were organized according to four categories that emerged in the analysis: (a) An idealized conception of peace that opposes a concrete and real political negotiation of the armed conflict; (b) delegitimization of the adversary, which turns them into an absolute enemy to be eliminated; (c) polarization, which was exacerbated by politics; and (d) fatalism that expresses impotence in the face of a naturalized violence.

Oral hypoglycemic agents are a fundamental pillar in obtaining adequate glucose control in diabetic individuals and, recently, the high prevalence of these two pathologies in the same patient have led clinical studies to focus on analyzing the effect of oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetics. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and depressive disorder. Objective To carry out a review of the available literature on hypoglycemic medication in the context of patients with diabetes mellitus and depressive disorder. Conclusions Although oral antidiabetics have been shown to have an antidepressant effect in certain experimental models, in clinical practice the evidence is scarce, but the lower risk of depression with certain antidiabetics is particularly noteworthy, leaving open the possibilities of future studies with the adequate nature that allows clarifying the effect of oral hypoglycemic agents in the population with diabetes mellitus and depressive disorder.",,,Psiquiatría Biológica,,,,2024-01,2024,,2024-01,31,1,100441,Closed,Article,"Raad-Sarabia, Maria; Cardona-Blanco, Maria; Mendoza-Paternina, Carmen; Correa-Guerrero, José; Rico-Fontalvo, Jorge; Daza-Arnedo, Rodrigo; Mondol-Almeida, Zulay; Llinas-Rincon, Jhonny; Sierra-Torres, Liseth; Marrugo-Yunda, Juan","Raad-Sarabia, Maria (Departamento de Medicina Interna, Universidad del Sinu, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia; Maestría Epidemiologia Clínica, Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Cardona-Blanco, Maria (Departamento de Nefrología, Asociacion Colombiana de Nefrología e Hipertensión Arterial, Bogotá, Colombia); Mendoza-Paternina, Carmen (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad del Sinu, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia; Clínica CEMIC, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia); Correa-Guerrero, José (Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia); Rico-Fontalvo, Jorge (Departamento de Nefrología, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia; Asociación Colombiana de Nefrología e Hipertensión Arterial, Bogotá, Colombia); Daza-Arnedo, Rodrigo (Departamento de Nefrología, Asociación Colombiana de Nefrología e Hipertensión Arterial, Bogotá, Colombia); Mondol-Almeida, Zulay (Departamento de Medicina Interna, Universidad del Sinu, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia); Llinas-Rincon, Jhonny (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia); Sierra-Torres, Liseth (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia); Marrugo-Yunda, Juan (Escuela de Medicina, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia)","Raad-Sarabia, Maria (Universidad del Sinú; Universidad del Norte)","Raad-Sarabia, Maria (Universidad del Sinú; Universidad del Norte); Cardona-Blanco, Maria (Asociación Colombiana de Nefrología e Hipertensión Arterial); Mendoza-Paternina, Carmen (Universidad del Sinú; Clínica CEMIC, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia); Correa-Guerrero, José (University of Cartagena); Rico-Fontalvo, Jorge (Universidad Simón Bolívar; Asociación Colombiana de Nefrología e Hipertensión Arterial); Daza-Arnedo, Rodrigo (Asociación Colombiana de Nefrología e Hipertensión Arterial); Mondol-Almeida, Zulay (Universidad del Sinú); Llinas-Rincon, Jhonny (Universidad Simón Bolívar); Sierra-Torres, Liseth (Cooperative University of Colombia); Marrugo-Yunda, Juan (Cooperative University of Colombia)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167831046,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

These parameters require precise laboratory control, which makes routine testing and consistent reporting in the literature challenging. Therefore, in some developing countries, numerical modeling for RC structural analysis relies on results or equations proposed by international building codes as reference values, ignoring the mechanical contribution of locally available materials. This study used five gravel sources from different mineralogical origins in Colombia to evaluate the mechanical properties of twenty concrete mixtures at four water-cement ratios (0.60, 0.55, 0.49, 0.35). Analyses and comparisons of aggregate properties, including mineralogical origins, unit weight, aggregate surface, absorption, and Los Angeles Abrasion Loss (LAAL), are conducted in relation to E c , f cr ' , and ε c0 and are contrasted against existing literature. Two groups of concrete were defined as normal and high-strength (NS- and HS-concrete), and compressive stress-strain curves were recorded during the tests of 220 cylinders, from which E c , f cr ' , and ε c0 were obtained. A statistical analysis was conducted to study the main effects and interactions of the aggregate type and water-cement ratio on the modulus of elasticity. It was found that the aggregate type had a significant impact on E c with no interaction with the water-cement ratio. It led to the development of new expressions to account for the different available aggregates, potentially improving future local building code provisions for E c . Values of f cr ' ranged from 20 MPa to 95 MPa, with the corresponding E c / √f cr ' ratio varying from 4870 to 6140 MPa for the NS-group, while being approximately 25% smaller, on average, for the HS-group. The greatest E c values are produced by an igneous aggregate type exhibiting the lowest LAAL, while a metamorphic aggregate with 40% LAAL produces the lowest Ec values. However, both aggregates had 100% fractured faces, resulting in the highest f cr ' values at 56 days (42 ≤ f cr ' ≤ 44 MPa), with the fractured faces of the aggregate being the critical parameter for compressive strength. The ε c0 results showed negligible median variations among the aggregate types, except for the aggregate with a smooth surface with fewer fractured faces. Median ε c0 values are 0.0019 and 0.0026 for the NS- and HS-group, respectively.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Daniel Alfonso reports financial support was provided by ARGOS.

A simple approach to the risk assessment of strategic infrastructure on the Colombian Caribbean coast. Journal of Coastal Research, 40(4), 749767. Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208. Strategic infrastructure at risk was identified on the Colombian Caribbean coast. The risk approach consisted of an estimation of the main coastal hazards (coastal erosion, mean sea-level rise, and changes in wave energy flux) and the exposure level, as one of the most significant components of vulnerability, through multicriteria analysis and GISs. It identified 88 strategic coastal infrastructures that are at risk, located less than 250 m from the coastline, and belong to the energy, health, education, and transportation sectors. Of these, 34.1% are at a medium-high risk level, and 20.5% are classified as high-risk critical infrastructure. The analysis also revealed that anthropogenic interventions, such as sand mining, poorly designed hard coastal protection structures (groins, seawalls, and breakwaters), or damage to marine ecosystems, might have a relevant weight on the risk degree of critical infrastructure, highlighting the relevance of appropriate coastal protection measures for strategic infrastructure. This simplified approach aimed to contribute to the risk management of such essential elements and guarantee compliance with the predisaster stage of disaster risk management.",,,Journal of Coastal Research,,,,2024-04-15,2024,2024-04-15,,40,4,749-767,Closed,Article,"Oate, Valeria; Orejarena-Rondn, Andrs F.; Restrepo, Juan C.","Oate, Valeria (Grupo de Investigaci, n en Geociencias GEO4 Departamento de F, sica y Geociencias Universidad del Norte Barranquilla 081007, Colombia); Orejarena-Rondn, Andrs F.

Although critiques throughout the years from education scholars have pointed to the detrimental effects of this experimental approach on education practice and values, RCTs are considered the gold standard for assessing the impact of education policies and interventions. By drawing on the approach of immanent critique, we elucidate substantial argumentative gaps between the assumptions and applications – that is, between the theory and reality – of RCTs in empirical research. This kind of analytic exercise complements existing critiques from outside the experimental discourse based on moral and epistemic principles. The present paper, in contrast, contributes to the literature by highlighting internal limitations and contradictions that can be seen by probing the logic espoused by those who are proponents of RCTs. In fleshing out our argument, we seek to encourage more informed and critical engagement by educators, policymakers, and researchers, among other stakeholders, when they are confronted with proposals for education programmes and reforms supported by findings from RCTs.","We thank Steve Klees, Hikaru Komatsu and anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of our manuscript.

This study is rooted in our intention to contribute to peace education in early childhood educational environments by fostering critical thinking and empathy, a predictor of prosocial behavior in children. The aim of this study is, first, that young children develop empathy by recognizing situations of oppression and injustice in children’s literature using critical literacy practices; and second, to contribute to young children’s development of critical thinking. Utilizing Critical Discourse Analysis, we suggest that critical literacy practices enhance empathy and critical thinking in young children through three strategies: reading selected children’s literature aloud, responding through multimodal texts, and having an open dialogue about critical issues that affect children in local communities.

Current methods for computing validation metrics like Aiken's coefficients are often complex and error-prone, highlighting the need for a standardized computational tool to simplify and enhance this process.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop AikenCalc, a tool created to automate the calculation of Aiken coefficients. This tool provides a quantitative method for examining the validity and reliability of consensus among expert judges.
METHOD: AikenCalc was developed with Shiny app, an R library that allows an easy-to-use interface and improved computational efficiency. It was validated using a convergence method by comparing the manual calculations with those obtained using AikenCalc. Additionally, to examine usability and interface, six experts evaluated their experience using AikenCalc and provided improvement feedback.
RESULTS: AikenCalc demonstrated good convergent validity, closely aligning with the results obtained manually, and the six experts gave favorable ratings regarding the usability and interface of AikenCalc. Finally, it was shown that AikenCalc significantly reduced the time required for calculations, thanks to its user-friendly interface.
CONCLUSION: AikenCalc represents a significant improvement in the validation of measurement instruments by automating and simplifying the calculation of Aiken's coefficients through a Shiny web application. Additionally, it fills a knowledge gap, as there is currently no similar calculator available in the field of research.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice,,,,2024-09-19,2024,2024-09-19,2024-09-19,,,,Closed,Article,"Ventura‐León, José; Lluncor‐Vasquez, Ariana; Chuquillanqui‐Silva, Marco","Ventura‐León, José (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú); Lluncor‐Vasquez, Ariana (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú); Chuquillanqui‐Silva, Marco (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Perú)","Ventura‐León, José (Private University of the North)","Ventura‐León, José (Private University of the North); Lluncor‐Vasquez, Ariana (Private University of the North); Chuquillanqui‐Silva, Marco (Private University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175821368,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,

Design/methodology/approach The methodological design was quantitative, explanatory and cross-sectional, where a sample of banana producers from Magdalena (Colombia) was selected. A structural equation model (SEM) was developed to evaluate the hypotheses. The SEM goodness-of-fit and fit indices were all acceptable.   Findings There is a strong and statistically significant correlation between SS criteria and the social dimension of CS. In particular, local development is the most influential factor in shaping CS in the context of banana agribusinesses in Magdalena, Colombia, operating as rural entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, working conditions and human rights show moderate effects, while labor rights do not have a perceptible impact.   Research limitations/implications Only the SS criteria that ensure the social dimension of CS in the banana agribusinesses of Magdalena (Colombia) were considered. It is important to note that other variables may be involved in ensuring CS. Future research to identify these possible variables is recommended.   Originality/value This investigation explores an understudied issue within the CS sphere, explicitly focusing on rural entrepreneurship in developing countries, notably Colombia. The study scrutinizes the impact of SS on the social dimension of CS in rural environments, using banana cooperatives as a case study and highlighting the value of developing strategies to help improve the CS performance of this type of organization.

In a few mollusk species, these bacteria have been associated with mortality events and production losses. The type of relationship between the RLOs and the pleasure oyster is largely unknown and further investigations are needed to determine if these bacteria warrant management concern in C. corteziensis. In this study, the morphological characteristics of the RLOs were studied by histology and SEM, and the taxonomic affiliations of the bacteria were evaluated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the prevalence and intensity of the RLOs was recorded from 2007 to 2017 by histology. The RLOs were observed inside circular basophilic cytoplasmic membrane bound vacuoles (MBVs) that had an average length and width of 15.70 ± 15.24 µm and 15.42 ± 14.95 µm respectively. Apart from cellular hypertrophy, no tissue alterations were observed in the areas adjacent to the RLOs. Individual bacteria within the MBVs were coccoid in shape with an average length of 0.65 ± 0.12 µm and an average width of 0.38 ± 0.09 µm. The bacterial microbiota of a selected number of samples (one sample without RLOs and two samples with RLOs) showed the presence of intracellular parasite OTUs corresponding to the families Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae, suggesting that the RLOs from the pleasure oyster is associated with the order Rickettsiales. A mean prevalence of 5 % was observed throughout the study period and the majority of the organisms (89 %) presented low intensity of Grade 1 (30-61 RLOs) of the MBVs. A higher prevalence of the RLOs was observed during warmer months. The lack of tissue alterations, the low prevalence and the low intensity of the MBVs suggest that the RLOs from C. corteziensis is a commensal endosymbiont that presents little risk for oyster production in Nayarit, México. However, regular monitoring is needed to detect if any variation in this relationship occurs, mainly in a scenario where extreme environmental fluctuations may occur.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this work, we investigated the high-temperature behavior of La1–xSrxCrO3, La1–xCaxCrO3 and La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-x MnxO3 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) through a combination of computational modeling and physical characterization up to 1500 °C. Crystalline structural properties were determined and compared with ab-initio calculations, which demonstrated excellent agreement with experimental findings. High-temperature electrical conductivity measurements were performed under different atmospheres. Calcium and strontium/manganese co-doped lanthanum chromites exhibited typical semiconductor exponential trends and conductivity showed proportional correlation with substitutions levels up to 30%. The DFT modelling was completed up to 1500 °C, including low and high temperature chromite phases and oxygen vacancies insertion. Calculations were correlated with experimental electrical properties. This work expands the understanding of doped lanthanum chromites and paves the way for the development of materials suitable for demanding high-temperature applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Edward M.

A set of undrained cyclic triaxial tests on clean Ottawa C778 sand and on the same sand with additions of bentonite or laponite were simulated to evaluate the model’s capabilities. The comparison between experiments and element test simulation results suggest that the proposed extended model is able to accurately describe the behavior of clean Ottawa C778 sand and the significant influence of plastic fines in the response of the mixtures, such as the reduction in the accumulation rates of strains and pore water pressure under cyclic loading, and therefore, the improvement in the liquefaction resistance with increasing fines content.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research examines engagement behaviors quantitatively and categorically. The participant pool consists of 183 students from four public schools in Barranquilla, Colombia, who were divided into two groups: an experimental cohort exposed to Sociopolis and a control group. The results of an independent-samples t-test indicate that the experimental group achieved significantly higher engagement scores, affirming the positive effect of the intervention. Additionally, analysis across engagement categories – active participation, sustained interest, and enthusiasm – reveals distinct patterns, reinforcing the efficacy of the intervention. These findings underscore gamified learning's potential to heighten student engagement and contribute substantially to discussions on effective pedagogical approaches.

A cross-sectional study was designed with the participation of high-school students (10th and 11th grade in Colombia) under 18 years of age. The crude and adjusted relationship (odds ratios) between internal forced displacement and cigarette consumption during the last month was established. It was adjusted for covariates (age, gender, educational level, and income) and confounding variables (depression and family dysfunction). 1,462 students between the ages of 13 and 17 participated (M = 15.98; SD = 0.83); 60.33% were women, 55.34% were in tenth grade, and 49.59% lived in low-income neighborhoods. A total of 113 (7.73%) students reported forced displacement, 103 (7.05%) reported depression, 1,112 (76.06%) scored for family dysfunction, and 149 (10.19%) students reported last-month cigarette consumption. After adjusting for covariates and confounding variables, forced internal displacement and cigarette smoking showed a statistically significant association (OR = 2.48, 95%CI 1.47–4.21). A statistically significant relationship between forced displacement and last-month cigarette smoking among Colombian adolescents is observed.

1356,pub.1168483640,10.1017/s0959270923000369,,,Population estimates and sex ratio of the Critically Endangered Antioquia Brushfinch Atlapetes blancae,"Summary  Antioquia Brushfinch Atlapetes blancae is a recently rediscovered Colombian microendemic species with a restricted distribution. Although the species might use a variety of habitats, current information suggests that it is a shrubland specialist. It is categorised as “Critically Endangered” because due to habitat loss its population has been estimated to be smaller than 50 individuals. Such estimates are based on indirect measurements of its population and assumptions regarding its restricted range/habitat. We provide the first direct population estimates and adult sex ratio for seven localities, using mark-resighting techniques. Individuals were captured using mist-nets, bled, and colour banded. Subsequently, we performed censuses along transects to record banded and non-banded individuals. Population estimates were obtained using the classic closed population mark-resighting model. In addition, we used the abundance–area relationship to estimate population size at other sites where the species has been previously recorded. Finally, individuals were sexed by amplifying the Z and W-linked Chromo-Helicase DNA-binding gene (CHD) genes. In total, we banded 55 individuals at four locations. Summarising across the seven sampled localities, we found that the population is most likely composed of 109 individuals in the 122 ha sampled. Based on the abundance–area relationship, we estimated that the population of Antioquia Brushfinch could be as large as 405 individuals in 322 ha of suitable habitat. We found that male/female sex ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–0.6) and that it was not significantly biased. Our results suggest that the population of Antioquia Brushfinch is at least eight times larger than suggested by secondary information. We found that populations are properly structured at least regarding sex ratio, although we caution for further research on sex biases of immature and juvenile individuals. We recommend that future studies should focus on population trends and the impact of habitat transformation on the demography of this iconic species. 
Resumen  El Gorrión-Montés Paisa Atlapetes blancae es una especie endémica de Colombia recientemente redescubierta con una distribución restringida. A pesar de que la especie puede utilizar una gran variedad de hábitats, la información disponible sobre la historia natural sugiere que es un especialista de matorrales. Ha sido categorizado como En Peligro Crítico principalmente porque se ha estimado que su población consta de menos de 50 individuos y por la pérdida de hábitat. Tales estimaciones, sin embargo, se basan en mediciones indirectas de su población y suposiciones dado su rango restringido. Aquí proporcionamos las primeras estimaciones utilizando técnicas de marcaje-recaptura. Los individuos fueron capturados usando redes de niebla. Cada individuo fue anillado con anillos de colores utilizando una combinación única por sitio y se tomó una muestra de sangre antes de su liberación. Después de anillar a los individuos, realizamos censos a través de transectos estandarizados que registraron individuos anillados y no anillados para ajustar una distribución hipergeométrica para estimar el tamaño total de la población por sitio. Luego realizamos una estimación bruta de la población presente en sitios con presencia confirmada de esta especie. En total, anillamos a 55 individuos en cuatro localidades. Sumando las siete localidades muestreadas, encontramos que la población probablemente esté compuesta por 109 individuos en 122 ha muestreadas. Con base en una relación individuos-área, estimamos que la población del Gorrión-Montés Paisa podría ser tan grande como 405 individuos en 322 hectáreas de hábitat adecuado. Al agrupar a los individuos en todos los sitios, encontramos que la proporción de sexos macho/hembra era de 0.45 (95% CI 0.32 – 0.6) y no estaba significativamente sesgada. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la población del Gorrión-Montés Paisa es al menos ocho veces mayor que lo sugerido por información secundaria. Además, mostramos que las poblaciones están adecuadamente estructuradas, al menos con base en la proporción de machos y hembras, pero sugerimos que estudios futuros investiguen los sesgos en los sexos en individuos inmaduros y juveniles. Recomendamos que los estudios futuros deben enfocarse en las tendencias poblacionales y el impacto de la degradación del hábitat sobre la demografía de esta especie icónica.","We thank Corporación CuencaVerde, Atlapetes Project, Neotropical Bird Club (NBC), the Association of Field Ornithologists (AFO), and Fundación Haceb for financial support to Proyecto Atlapetes.

Secondly, it empirically investigates the pass-through of monetary policy rates (MPR) changes into the consumer and commercial loans interest rates set by commercial banks in four Latin American countries with inflation targeting (IT) schemes, namely (in alphabetic order) Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, over a homogeneous period. To do so, it estimates Non-Linear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) models for each country. Then, we find two types of important asymmetric responses in the interest rate channel of IT monetary policy. The first is that the long-run response of the consumer loans interest rates following increases in the MPR is greater than that of the commercial loans interest rates. The second is that, in general, when the demand is relatively more elastic (as in the case of commercial loans) then the banks interest rates tend to exhibit a greater response when the central bank lowers the MPR than when it raises it.",Declaration of competing interest None.,,The Journal of Economic Asymmetries,,,,2024-11,2024,,2024-11,30,,e00370,Closed,Article,"Otero, Jorge David Quintero; Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo; Restrepo, Luis Eduardo Otero","Otero, Jorge David Quintero (Universidad Del Norte, Colombia); Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo (Pontificia Universidad Católica Del Perú, Peru); Restrepo, Luis Eduardo Otero (Ernst Young SAS, Consulting, Colombia)","Otero, Jorge David Quintero (Universidad del Norte)","Otero, Jorge David Quintero (Universidad del Norte); Gómez-Ramírez, Leopoldo (Pontifical Catholic University of Peru); Restrepo, Luis Eduardo Otero (Ernst Young SAS, Consulting, Colombia)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172527345,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,

We document the process of providing this narrative to ChatGPT and further prompting the chatbot to generate model code to represent the narrative and to make it executable. We test ChatGPT’s ability to use prose descriptions of a phenomenon to generate simulation models using three paradigms: discrete event system, system dynamics, and agent-based modeling. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT could not produce concise or executable models, facing higher difficulty when asked to do so in programming languages it was less familiar with. This analysis underscores the strengths and limitations of the current state of this technology for modeling and simulation.

1332,pub.1167989029,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.134832,,,Influence of recycled rice husk ash filler on the mechanical performance of asphalt mixtures: A mortar scale analysis,"Using industrial or agro-industrial wastes as alternative raw materials to manufacture asphalt mixtures brings advantages such as conserving natural resources and reducing environmental problems. Among these wastes are (a) rice husk ash (RHA) and (b) recycled rice husk ash (RRHA), obtained by controlled and uncontrolled combustion of rice husks, respectively. Previous studies have shown a high potential for RHA to be used as a filler in asphalt mixtures. However, the existing literature on RRHA usage and its corresponding applications is limited. Based on this background, the main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of RRHA when used as a filler on the mechanical properties of asphalt mortars/mixtures. For this purpose, the behavior of asphalt mortars (a combination of asphalt binder blended with sand and RRHA filler) was evaluated using the dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) with the three-point bending test. The test results suggest that RRHA reduces the workability and ductility of asphalt mortars. Furthermore, while RRHA indicated superior moisture-damage tolerance, brittle RRHA asphalt mortars with reduced fatigue strength were also produced. The optimum RRHA dosage for optimizing the asphalt mortar's mechanical properties/performance should not exceed 13.5% on the total weight of the mortar for the materials and test conditions. As a supplement to this study's findings, further research involving the combination of RRHA with conventional fillers and different materials (i.e., asphalt binders and aggregate types) is suggested to quantitatively assess the scaled-up mechanical performance of the asphalt mortars and their subsequent validation in asphalt mixtures.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Design/methodology/approach The authors use panel data models with fixed-effects and distributed lags.   Findings The authors disclosed that sub-national synchronization increased national cycle amplitudes during expansion and recession phases. The authors also noticed that South Korea exhibited a more pronounced effect compared to Latin American countries, and this seemed to be associated with differences in the homogeneity of the production structures in the regions of these countries.

Particularly, the species Deltochilum guildingii is notable for its large size and greater capacity to bury organic matter, thus facilitating the recycling of soil nutrients and seed germination. The current degradation of the TDF, however, may have adverse effects on its population genetics. In this study, based on 2,587 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated by restriction-site associated DNA sequencing in 60 individuals of D. guildingii in six TDF fragments in the Colombian Caribbean (departments of Guajira, Magdalena, Cesar, Atlántico, Bolívar, and Sucre), we aimed to estimate genetic diversity and its relationship with fragmentation. Moreover, we evaluated spatial patterns of genetic structure, and inferred D. guildingii  demography history. Our results showed reduced heterozygosity in all populations with the lowest for the Magdalena fragment. There was no relationship between genetic diversity and fragment area, perimeter, or degree of insularization. Multivariate and Bayesian clustering analyses of genetic structure identified two genetic groups of biogeographic affinity: one pertains to the northern departments (Guajira, Magdalena, and Cesar) and the other to the south (Montes de María and Piojó). In addition, a population expansion was estimated 2.5 million years ago during the Pleistocene, which coincided with the time of TDF diversification in Colombia and of the genus Alouatta, the primates that provide the principal source of excrement to D. guildingii.","Thanks to Universidad del Atlántico, Ministry of Science and Technology of Colombia, National Natural Parks of Colombia, Corporación Autónoma Regional de Sucre, and Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA).

1328,pub.1169414996,10.1145/3648477,,,Professional Development in Computational Thinking: A Systematic Literature Review,"This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.",,,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,,,,2024-05-10,2024,2024-05-10,2024-06-30,24,2,1-24,Closed,Article,"Espinal, Alejandro; Vieira, Camilo; Magana, Alejandra J.","Espinal, Alejandro (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Magana, Alejandra J.

However, knowledge of the species’ distribution and habitat use during the nonbreeding season is limited. Here, we explore how stationary nonbreeding season (December to April) occupancy probabilities vary across regional and landscape scales, and with vegetation structure for S. striata in eastern Colombia. By running single-species, single-season hierarchical occupancy models and N-mixture models, we evaluated how regional (annual precipitation, nonbreeding season precipitation, driest month, elevation, and net primary productivity), landscape (habitat type and % forest in the landscape), and vegetation structure variables influenced occupancy by S. striata. In the regional analysis, occupancy was positively influenced by stationary nonbreeding precipitation and net primary productivity, and was predicted to peak at elevations between 500 and 1,000 m. At the landscape scale, occupancy and abundance were higher in agroforestry systems (in order of magnitude: shade-grown cacao, citrus plantations and silvopastures) than in forested habitats. In relation to vegetation structure, occupancy was negatively correlated with a principal component containing shrub density, canopy height, and canopy cover. Within the Orinoco region, a spatial prediction based on our results supported high occupancy rates in moister areas along and close to the Andean foothills and where the Orinoco grasslands transition into Amazonian forests. Our results highlight the importance of landscapes containing agroforestry systems as stationary nonbreeding habitats for S. striata in Colombia’s Orinoco region and the importance of promoting agroforestry systems, like shade-grown cacao, in areas with higher nonbreeding season precipitation and net primary productivity values in order to increase habitat availability for the species.",,,Ornithological Applications,,,,2024-09-25,2024,2024-09-25,,,,duae051,Closed,Article,"Morales-Rozo, Andrea; Bayly, Nicholas J; Taylor, Philip D; Hobson, Keith A; Z, Gabriel J Colorado; Gómez, Juan Pablo","Morales-Rozo, Andrea (Grupo en Ecología y Conservación de Fauna y Flora Silvestre, Universidad Nacional de, Colombia; Grupo de Investigación ECOTONOS, Universidad de los Llanos, Colombia); Bayly, Nicholas J (SELVA Investigación para la conservación del Neotrópico, Bogotá D.C., Colombia); Taylor, Philip D (Biology Department, Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada); Hobson, Keith A (Environment and Climate Change Canada, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada; Department of Biology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada); Z, Gabriel J Colorado (Grupo en Ecología y Conservación de Fauna y Flora Silvestre, Universidad Nacional de, Colombia; Departamento de Ciencias Forestales, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The effect on the kinetics parameters of the Fick and Page models were evaluated, as well as on the content of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity. For AC drying, samples of spent ground coffee were prepared in the form of fixed rectangular beds 0.7 cm high, which were placed on polyester sheets and pretreated up to 10 times sprayed with ethanol, then dried by AC at 80 °C and 0.8 m/s. For RW drying, the samples prepared in the same way as for AC were used. For this case, the application of ethanol as pretreatment and the use of ultrasound during process were tested. As results, regardless of the conditions applied, drying by RW was up to 50 % faster, evidenced in the highest values of effective diffusivity (from the Fick model) and the kinetic parameter (from the Page model). Regarding the treatments applied and their effect on the drying kinetics, any treatment had a significant effect on AC drying. On the contrary, the strategies applied in RW drying had significant effects, both the application of pretreatment with ethanol as well as the application of ultrasound assisting the process accelerated the drying kinetics. However, the treatment with ethanol and RW drying was the one that best preserved the phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity in the samples. Therefore, these strategies could be a good option to improve RW drying by accelerating the process and preserving the bioactive compounds in the spent coffee grounds for subsequent utilization.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Food Research International,,,Antioxidants; Coffee; Desiccation; Phenols; Ethanol,2024-01-11,2024,2024-01-11,2024-02,178,,114007,Closed,Article,"Miano, Alberto Claudio; Rojas, Meliza Lindsay","Miano, Alberto Claudio (Centro de Investigación Avanzada en Agroingeniería, Universidad Privada del Norte (UPN), Peru.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted in 162 adult patients with diabetic foot. The outcome was amputation, defined as ""primary amputation in patients' clinical history after their first hospitalization due to foot ulcer."". The cutoff point was determined using Youden's J statistic. The relative risk (RR) was presented as an association measure.
RESULTS: A TyG index of >9.4 [RR: 1.64 (1.10-2.45)] was associated with a high risk of amputation after 1-year in adults with diabetic foot. However, while a TC/HDL ratio of >4.69 [RR: 1.38 (0.94-2.03)] and a TG/HDL-C ratio > 3.57 [RR: 1.35 (0.89-2.06)] did not show associations with risk of amputation after 1-year.
CONCLUSIONS: Only a TyG index of >9.4 was associated with an increased risk of 1-year amputation in adults with diabetic foot.

To achieve this, we use data from the official National Survey of Health and Nutrition, which gathered information on 26,532 individuals aged between 19 and 59 between 2011 and 2013. Employing a probit regression to assess the likelihood of buying food based on TLL, we identify a positive association between income level and the probability of buying food based on TLL; indeed, our model suggests that a 1% increase in monthly income increases by 0.008 the probability of buying food based on TLL. We infer that people with higher levels of income are more aware of the benefits of TLL and healthy food habits. Our results also suggest that the probability of basing purchasing decisions on TLL is higher for overweight people compared to those of normal weight, that is, overweight people buy their processed food paying more attention to TLL compared to normal weight people.",Juan Pablo Díaz-Sánchez is deeply appreciative of the Escuela Politécnica Nacional for providing the necessary resources and conducive environment for conducting this study.

An additional concern is the proper management of industrial process residues that could be used in mortar mixes to avoid their disposal in landfills or water bodies. This work investigated the potential of using calcined water treatment plant sludge (CWTPS) and nitrophosphogypsum (NPG) - a byproduct of the fertilizer industry - as partial replacements of OPC in mortar mixtures. For this purpose, this research evaluates the crystallographic, chemical, and physical properties of NPG and CWTPS through X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). XRF and XRD findings strongly suggests that CWTPS qualifies as supplementary cementitious materials, due to its high content of silicon and aluminum oxides in a non-crystalline state. On the other hand, NPG could be used as a mineral admixture. The design of mixtures was based on the workability of 85% flow. The evaluation of properties encompasses the measurement of density, compressive strength, durability (pH and sulfate environments), and water absorption. The results demonstrate that incorporating of NPG and CWTPS to mortar mixes, each at a 5% inclusion rate (with a total replacement of 10% of OPC), increase compressive strength by up to 6.65% at 90 days compared to the control group in mortar mixes. However, the inclusion of NPG and CWTPS significantly decreases the workability of mortar mixes by up to 51.49%. The utilization of NPG as a partial replacement for OPC increases the water-to-cement ratio proportionally compared to the control sample, which can be explained by the anhydrite content of this byproduct. For its part, replacing 10% of OPC with NPG and CWTPS results in a 1.99% decrease in resistance after 28 days in sulfated environments compared to specimens cured in lime water. This protection of NPG against sulfate attack on mortars is based on the fact that SO3 saturation hinders the phase change from AFt to AFm during curing, as demonstrated by the XRD results. Additionally, the inclusion of NPG in mortar mixes increases capillary water absorption by up to 19.8%, while CWTPS, due to its pozzolanic nature, reduces it by up to 5.75%. Finally, this study explores the potential combined use of NPG and CWTPS in mortar mixes as a partial replacement for cement, presenting a viable and sustainable alternative for these cementitious-based construction materials.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

For that purpose, the experimental results of three centrifuge tests performed at different centrifuge facilities are considered. The corresponding dynamic coupled predictions were carried out using the finite element software Abaqus Standard. The material parameters of the adopted constitutive model were determined based on a detailed laboratory characterization of the tested Ottawa F-65 sand, which included drained monotonic triaxial and undrained cyclic triaxial tests considering a wide range of initial conditions and testing characteristics. The comparison between measured and computed sloping ground accelerations and spectral response suggests reasonable predictions by the model.

De la muestra total, 26 participantes cumplieron con el criterio clínico para enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) inicial y 25, para deterioro cognitivo leve, según la escala de deterioro global. Los restantes 31 participantes figuraron como grupo control. Resultados Los resultados mostraron una buena consistencia interna (alfa de Cronbach=.81) y una alta correlación bivariada de Pearson con el MMSE (r=.85; p<.001). Conclusiones Finalmente, se observaron diferencias entre los tres grupos en la puntuación total de la escala. En conclusión, el NEUROBEL se muestra como una herramienta útil para detectar dificultades de lenguaje en los pacientes con sospecha de EA y deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL). Background and objective The NEUROBEL is a short test for the psycholinguistic evaluation of language comprehension and production impairment in older adults. The utility of this instrument has been primarily tested in the Spanish population. The NEUROBEL consists of tasks that assess comprehension through phoneme discrimination tasks, auditory lexical decision, spoken word-picture matching, and sentence comprehension. Additionally, it evaluates language production through repetition tasks, object naming, action naming, and sentence completion. This study aims to investigate the utility of the NEUROBEL in detecting oral language deficits related to cognitive impairment in the Colombian population. Method Eighty-two monolingual older adults, aged 59 to 92 years, participated, including 23 men. Of the total sample, 26 participants met the clinical criteria for early Alzheimer's disease, and 25 for mild cognitive impairment, according to the Global Deterioration Scale. The remaining 31 participants served as the control group. Results The results showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha=.81) and a high bivariate Pearson correlation with the MMSE (r=.85; P<.001). Conclusion Differences were observed among the three groups in the total scale score. In conclusion, the NEUROBEL proves to be a useful tool for detecting language difficulties in patients with suspected AD (Alzheimer Dessease) and MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment).",,,Revista de Logopedia Foniatría y Audiología,,,,2024-10,2024,,2024-10,44,4,100498,Closed,Article,"De los Reyes-Aragón, Carlos José; Adrián, José A.; Rodríguez-Parra, María José; Santis, Karina Cantillo; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos","De los Reyes-Aragón, Carlos José (Departamento de Psicología, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Adrián, José A.

Implications for policy planning,"Electric scooters have been a rapidly growing mode of transport in recent years. This massive proliferation has brought issues frequently addressed without sufficient technical or scientific support, especially in cities of the Global South. This study seeks to identify latent and socioeconomic factors influencing e-scooter usage and their implications for policy planning. For this purpose, we applied a survey (n = 1073) to users and non-users in Bogota, Colombia. We estimated MIMIC model to assess the influence of individuals’ perceptions. The results show that perceptions of crash risk and fear of crime negatively influence usage, while environmental awareness and pro-technology attitudes have a positive influence. On the other hand, e-scooter use decreases with the age of individuals, while it is higher in men, car owners, high-income and college-educated individuals. Finally, using the modelling results, we study the implications for policy planning and propose measures to reduce concerns related to e-scooter usage.",,"This research was funded by the FCT, Portugal through the Ph.D. [grant number UI/BD/153578/2022] and by the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada through the project INV-3187.

However, understanding how individuals allocate this saved time after implementing transport projects is crucial, as time is a finite resource and performing more pleasant activities may impact their well-being. Large urban interventions, such as the implementation of the first cable car line in a deprived community in Bogotá (Colombia), impact how residents around the project allocate their time. We studied their time-use allocation by estimating a discrete–continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, by combining data collected before and one year after the project implementation, to represent time-use decision changes in the study area. The results show participation and duration of different activities changed after the project implementation. The cable car increased the probability of participating in work, study, and carrying/collecting activities. It also decreased the duration of travel activities. The cable car also increased women’s time allocation to education and paid work. Overall, reduced travel time allows for more time for leisure and recreational activities. Understanding how individuals allocate their time is particularly relevant for policymakers to inform policies related to transport. This study offers valuable insights into both model development and data collection methods and the understanding of the mechanisms of time-use decisions.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to express their gratitude to the MSc student Andrea Dominguez for her support in the early modeling stage.

1231,pub.1169860075,10.1515/eujal-2022-0034,,,Vocabulary Instruction in Textbooks of Italian as a Foreign Language: A Descriptive Analysis,"Abstract Research in second language acquisition has shown that vocabulary growth is beneficial for reading (Qian 1999, 2000), listening comprehension (Staehr 2009), and has a positive influence on writing and speaking performances (Johnson et al. 2016; Levelt 1995). Vocabulary learning is hence a central pillar in the second language classroom. The activities used to enable the acquisition of new vocabulary play a crucial role in the learners’ path to proficiency. In this regard, the textbooks used are important since they can largely influence what types of vocabulary activities are used by the teachers in the classroom (Allen 2008; Tavakoli and Wright 2020; Woodward 1989). Nation (2013) provides a useful framework to analyze such activities. He identifies four strands that should be used in a balanced way to provide students with a comprehensive variety of tools to learn and apply new vocabulary. This study explores to what extent the four strands of activities are present in mainstream textbooks of Italian as a Foreign Language. This study also bridges a gap in the literature, since little research on vocabulary instruction has been done on the textbooks used for languages other than English. The result of our analysis shows that the Italian textbooks mostly focus on vocabulary aspects such as form-meaning mapping and grammar, leaving less room for meaning focused input and output. Furthermore, no activities that aimed at fluency development were found.",,,European Journal of Applied Linguistics,,,,2024-03-19,2024,2024-03-19,,0,0,,Closed,Article,"Concu, Valentina; Noli, Sara","Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Universidad del Norte); Noli, Sara (Oakton Community College, Skokie, USA, Universidad del Norte)","Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte)","Concu, Valentina (Universidad del Norte); Noli, Sara (Oakton Community College)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169860075,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",4 Quality Education

While students’ entrepreneurial intentions in traditional fields like economics, business and engineering have been widely studied, less attention has been given to nontraditional fields, especially in emerging economies. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the entrepreneurial intentions of health sciences students in Colombian universities, a context marked by unique socioeconomic and cultural factors.   Design/methodology/approach The study surveyed 202 students across three colleges. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to validate the theorized relationships and analyze the data.   Findings Preliminary findings indicate a positive correlation between personal attitudes and educational support with entrepreneurial intentions among health science students. Contrary to expectations, the influence of family roles and broader sociocultural contexts appeared less significant, suggesting a distinct pattern within this field.   Originality/value This paper presents a detailed study of the factors influencing the entrepreneurial intention of health sciences students in higher education. It provides theoretical and practical insights, contributing to the existing literature on entrepreneurial intention.

In this paper, I examine the relationship between income, as a source of economic stress, and the sex ratio at a subnational level for the 1895-2010 period. For this, I use census microdata from Argentina -a developing country that experienced rapid growth at the end of the 19th century and stagnated in recent decades- and I estimate from a two-way fixed effects model that exploits the wide temporal and geographic variability in income. The results show that as per capita income increases, the sex ratio at birth also increases. In particular, for every US$ 1,000 increase in per capita income, the sex ratio increases between 0.3 and 0.6 points. These findings make it possible to quantify the lost boys (i.e. those boys who were not born due to high economic stress on their parents) and constitute a call for attention in favor of the implementation of prenatal care policies -especially in periods of stagnation or income decline- to maintain a more balanced sex ratio.",,The author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.,Biodemography and Social Biology,,,"Male; Female; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Humans; Socioeconomic Factors; Sex Ratio; Income; Population Dynamics; Argentina; Developing Countries",2024-01-02,2024,2024-03-04,2024-01-02,69,1,4-18,Closed,Article,"González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio","González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio (Escuela de Ciencias Empresariales, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Larrondo, Chile)","González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio (Catholic University of the North)","González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169415348,44 Human Society; 4403 Demography,

This question is the subject of intensive research, and is based mostly on the results of greenhouse experiments, landscape-level experiments and modeling. In this paper, we examined leaf morphological and physiological characteristics of Nothofagus dombeyi populations exposed to different atmospheric CO2 levels by analyzing leaf cuticle from a Late Pleistocene (∼15,500–13,200 cal yr BP) fossil site, a Middle Holocene (∼6700–4900 cal yr BP) fossil site, and a modern (2016) collection in mid-latitude Chile. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were inferred as ∼230 ppm, ∼270 ppm and ∼ 400 ppm based on a comparison with icecore and instrumental records. Our findings show that as atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by 74% during the transition from late glacial to modern conditions, stomatal density decreased by 24% and maximum stomatal conductance decreased by 42%. In contrast, we observed a 10% increase in stomatal size, a 195% increase in intrinsic water use efficiency, and an increase in leaf nitrogen content. Carbon discrimination decreased as CO2 levels increased contrary to our expectations underscoring that additional factors such as water availability and nutrients can affect carbon discrimination. We also tested the paleo-CO2 method of Franks that performed well under high CO2 conditions (∼400 ppm) but failed under low levels (∼230 ppm) of atmospheric CO2 indicating the need for a better understanding of photosynthesis during glacial times.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

METHODS: Secondary data from a 2015 national survey of health services in Peru were analyzed. The self-perceived consultation time was calculated by asking how long it took from when you entered the consultation until you departed. It was then categorized as low, medium, and high. Five self-reported questions were used to construct a knowledge of the prescribed treatment. Adjusted regression models from the Poisson family models were used to evaluate the relationship. We report adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
RESULTS: A total of 9939 outpatients were analyzed, with 58% women; the average age was 44 years; and 45.4% had higher education. Using low self-perceived consultation time as references, medium and high consultation times were associated with understanding the prescribed treatment (aPR=1.17; 95%CI, 1.04-1.33 and aPR=1.30; 95%CI, 1.20-1.40, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Patients who reported a medium and high self-perceived consultation time better understood the prescribed treatment.

Myliobatis freminvillei is currently listed as vulnerable by the 2019 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species given that it is often captured as bycatch by artisanal and commercial fisheries, along the coasts of Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela. This study, for the first time, assembled and characterized the mitochondrial genome of M. fremnvillei. The A+T rich mitochondrial genome of M. fremnvillei is 18,356 bp long and encodes 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (12S ribosomal RNA and 16S ribosomal RNA), 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), and also contains a non coding control region 2,617 bp long. Nonsynonomous codon usage with a preference for A+T rich codons was observed in all 13 PCGs. Leu (CTA), Ile (ATC), Phe (TTC), Thr (ACA), and Ala (GCC) were the most frequently used codons. Ka/Ks ratios estimated for all 13 PCGs exhibited values < 1, indicating strong purifying selection affecting all these genes. In contrast to the results of a previous study that claimed diversifying selective pressure in two mitochondrial PCGs of Mobula tarapacana, reanalysis of the Ka/Ks values for the same species indicated purifying selection in all 13 PCGs. Of the 22 tRNA genes, all have a cloverleaf secondary structure except tRNA-Ser1 which has a truncated dihydrouridine arm. In the control region, A+T rich microsatellites (n = 42) and short tandem repeats (n = 6) were identified, and the secondary structure of the same region contained numerous hairpin loops. Phylomitogenomic analyses supported the monophyletic status of the order Myliobatiformes and family Myliobatidae. The assembled mitochondrial genome will assist with conservation efforts in Myliobatis fremnvillei.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Thus far, the yessotoxin levels recorded in this region have not posed a serious threat to human health. However, a bloom of P. reticulatum during the austral summer of 2022 caused the first ban of shellfish collection, due to the high toxin levels. A bloom of P. reticulatum during the austral summer of 2020 allowed an evaluation of the fine-scale distribution of the dinoflagellate during a tidal cycle. High-resolution measurements of biophysical properties were carried out in mid-summer (February 18-19) at a fixed sampling station in Puyuhuapi Fjord, Chilean Patagonia, as part of an intensive 24-h biophysical experiment to monitor the circadian distributions of P. reticulatum vegetative cells and yessotoxins. High P. reticulatum cell densities (>20 × 103 cells L-1) were found in association with a warmer (14.5-15 °C) and estuarine (23.5-24.5 g kg-1) sub-surface water layer (6-8 m). P. reticulatum cell numbers and yessotoxins followed a synchronic distribution pattern consistent with the excursions of the pycnocline. Nevertheless, the surface aggregation of the cells was modulated by the light cycle, suggesting daily vertical migration. The yessotoxin content per P. reticulatum cell ranged from 9.4 to 52.2 pg. This study demonstrates both the value of fine-scale resolution measurements of biophysical properties in a highly stratified system and the potential ecosystem impact of P. reticulatum strains producing high levels of yessotoxins.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The application of standard procedures to more complex systems, sensitive to dissociation, such as adherent monolayers, especially comprising mature cell types, or tissues, remains unsatisfactory. Uncontrolled cell detachment due to intracellular tensile stress, membrane ruptures and damages of adhesion proteins are common during freezing and thawing of cell monolayers. However, many therapeutically relevant cell systems grow adherently to develop their native morphology and functionality, but lose their integrity after dissociation. The hypothesis is that cells on stretchable substrates have a more adaptable cytoskeleton and membrane, reducing cryopreservation-induced stress. Our studies investigate the influence of stretchable surfaces on the cryopreservation of adherent cells to avoid harmful dissociation and expedite post-thawing cultivation of functional cells. A stretching apparatus for defined radial stretching, consisting of silicone vessels and films with specific surface textures for cell culture, were developed. Adherent human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) were cultivated on a stretched silicone film within the vessel, forming a monolayer that were compressed by relaxation, while remaining attached to the relaxed film. Compressed hUC-MSCs, which were cryopreserved adherently showed higher viability and less detachment after thawing compared to control cells without compression. Within three to seven days post-thawing, the hUC-MSCs recovered, and the monolayer reformed. These experiments support the hypothesis that cryopreservation success of adherent cell systems is enhanced by improved adaptability of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane, opening up new approaches in cryobiotechnology.",Declaration of competing interest The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

According to the IUCN, C. mexicanus is considered “Near Threatened”, as its populations are dwindling and habitats are affected by anthropogenic disturbance. Corynorhinus leonpaniaguae has not been assigned to an IUCN Red List risk category due to its recent description.Methods and resultsIn this study, the mitochondrial genomes of C. mexicanus and C. leonpaniaguae were assembled and characterized in detail. The mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of C. mexicanus and C. leonpaniaguae have lengths of 16,470 and 16,581 bp respectively, with a predominant nucleotide usage of adenine (31.670% and 31.729%, respectively) and thymine (26.15% and 26.18%, respectively). The mtDNA of C. mexicanus and C. leonpaniaguae is composed of 37 coding and non-coding elements: 22 transfer RNAs (tRNA), 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNAs and a non-coding region, the control region, which has a length of 933 bp and 1,149 bp, respectively. All tRNAs exhibited a cloverleaf secondary structure, with the exception of trn-Ser1 which showed a deletion of the dihydrouridine arm in the two species. All PCGs are subjected to purifying selection, with atp8 being the gene showing the highest Ka/Ks value.ConclusionsThese are the first whole mitogenomic resources developed for C. mexicanus and C. leonpaniaguae and enhance our knowledge of the ecology of these species and aid in their conservation.",,This work was supported by grant Ciencias de Frontera (15307) granted to Jorge Ortega.,Molecular Biology Reports,,,"Animals; Genome, Mitochondrial; Chiroptera; Mexico; RNA, Transfer; Phylogeny; DNA, Mitochondrial; RNA, Ribosomal",2024-06-14,2024,2024-06-14,2024-12,51,1,760,Closed,Article,"Valencia M, Pablo; Baeza, J.

While Item Response Theory (IRT) has been instrumental in identifying patterns of cognitive impairment through psychometric tests, its parametric models often require large sample sizes and strict assumptions. This creates a need for more adaptable, less demanding analytical methods. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Mokken scale analysis (MSA), a nonparametric IRT model, in identifying hierarchical patterns of cognitive impairment from psychometric tests. Using data from 1164 adults over 60 years old, we applied MSA to the orientation subscale of ACE-III. Our analysis involved calculating scalability, monotone homogeneity, invariant item ordering (IIO) and response functions. The MSA effectively retrieved the hierarchical order of cognitive impairment patterns. Most items showed strong scalability and consistent patterns of cognitive performance. However, challenges with IIO were observed, particularly with items having adjacent difficulty parameters. The findings highlight MSA's potential as a practical alternative to parametric IRT models in cognitive impairment research. Its ability to provide valuable insights into patterns of cognitive deterioration, coupled with less stringent requirements, makes it a useful tool for clinicians and researchers.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to the team of the FONIS project “Utilidad diagnóstica del test Addenbrooke&#x27;s Cognitive Examination, versión chilena, para discriminar la presencia de deterioro cognitivo leve y demencia” at Universidad Católica del Norte for their invaluable feedback and assistance with data collection.

To determine the normative scores of the TMT - black & white (TMT B&W), considering sociodemographic factors in adult and elderly Chilean population. A total sample of 227 participants (133 healthy, 94 cognitively impaired) from the Ageing Mets cohort were recruited from three areas in Chile (Antofagasta, Santiago, and Puerto Montt). The TMT B&W was administered to all participants. A multiple regression model was used to generate normative data only in the cognitively healthy group, considering the effect of age, education and sex. A significant effect of age was found in the score of the TMT B&W Parts A and B. The level of education influenced the part B of the test; however, the completion rate of the TMT B&W parts A and B was over 90% in cognitively healthy people.

This significance is particularly pronounced in salt wedge estuaries, where discharge holds greater influence than tides. Despite this, there is a limited amount of research based on high-resolution in-situ data to analyze circulation and mixing processes affected by density gradients in the convergence front of a salt wedge estuary. In this study, continuous measurements of current velocities and CTD profiles were conducted over three tidal cycles to analyze the intratidal variability of circulation patterns (u, v, w) and mixing parameters in the convergence front. Stratification parameter ( η s ) and Richardson numbers ( R L and R i ) were calculated to analyze the mixing/stratification variability within a tidal cycle. The observations revealed a persistent Subsurface Velocity Maximum (SVM) in the longitudinal component, coinciding with density gradient increases > 4 kg m−3 along the water column. Similarly, lateral circulation patterns were influenced by those increases in density gradient, resulting in eastward-directed currents and the formation of two circulations cells. As expected in a salt wedge estuary, stratification occurs during flood and High Water (HW), when the density gradient increases due to intrusion of the salt wedge. Notably, in the Magdalena River estuary, when the discharge is below 3800 m3 s−1, the salt wedge remains consistently present irrespective of the tidal phase, resulting in a permanently stratified water column with η s values between 1.60 – 1.95. It is expected that the steady presence of stratified conditions during periods of low discharge leads to an increased accumulation of sediments. These findings provide valuable quantitative insights into the complex interplay of density gradients, circulation patterns, and stratification dynamics in salt wedge estuaries.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Juan Camilo Restrepo reports financial support was provided by Colombia Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation.

We characterize the maximal regularity property solely in terms of R-boundedness of a block operator-valued symbol, and provide corresponding estimates. In addition, we show practical criteria that imply the R-boundedness part of the characterization.

One of these phenomena is the observation of intralayer/interlayer excitons. While much effort has been done to characterize excitons in monolayer TMDCs and their heterostructures, a quite limited number of works have addressed the exciton spectra of their bulk counterparts. In this work, we employ ab initio many-body perturbation calculations to investigate the exciton dynamics and spectra of bulk 2H-MX2 (M = Mo, W, and X = S, Se). For molybdenum-based systems, we find the presence of interlayer excitons at energies higher than the first bright exciton (XA), with non-negligible strength intensity. Our results also show that interlayer excitons in tungsten-based systems are almost degenerate in energy with XA and possess very small oscillator strengths when compared with molybdenum-based systems. At room temperature, and considering the thermal exciton fine-structure population for the XA-exciton, we estimate effective radiative lifetimes in the range of ∼4-14 ns. For higher energy excitons we predict longer effective lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds.","E. M. Jr acknowledges the financial support from the Brazilian agency FAPESP, Grant no. 20/13172-8.

1184,pub.1175355771,10.1061/jmcee7.mteng-16787,,,Moisture-Induced Deterioration Mechanism of Asphalt Mortar Using Different Fillers,"The effect of different filler types on the properties of asphalt mortar before and after water saturation was studied by laboratory tests. Under both dry and water-saturated circumstances, four alternative fillers, limestone powder, hydrated lime, PO42.5 cement, and brake pad powder, are used, evaluated, and compared. The study methodology included characterizing the micromorphology, while X-ray diffraction imaging analysis and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the chemical composition of the asphalt mortar following water saturation. To quantify the effects of moisture on the bonding mechanisms, surface energy concepts were employed to compute the surface free energy parameters of the asphalt mortar made with different filler materials. Dynamic shear rheometry was employed in the investigation to describe the rheological characteristics of the asphalt mortar as a function of filler under different water saturation conditions. The bonding strength of the asphalt mortars with various fillers was then quantitatively measured using pullout tests to account for the coupling effects of moisture and temperature. The findings of the laboratory tests generally showed that the asphalt mortar’s effectiveness declined following moisture conditioning and saturation in water. However, hydrated lime, brake pad powder, and cement showed promise in strengthening the bonding of fillers and asphalt, with hydrated lime being superior. Likewise, the asphalt mortar’s ability to tolerate moisture and resist water damage was also generally improved by hydrated lime.",The National Natural Science Foundation of China and Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2020CFB567) provided some funding for the project (Grant Nos. 52108415 and 51803157).,,Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering,,,,2024-09-02,2024,2024-09-02,2024-11,36,11,04024375,Closed,Article,"Bai, Tao; Fan, Yi; Chenxin, Changlong; Wu, Fan; Xu, Fang; Fuentes, Luis; Walubita, Lubinda F.","Bai, Tao (Professor, School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan 430074, China, .

METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis from a 2019 panel study in Lima, Peru, was conducted focusing on women, aged 18 and above, who are mothers of 3- to 5-year-olds in mid-high and mid-low districts. There were two outcome variables: excessive TV and excessive electronic devices screen time, defined as ≥ 1 h of screen exposure for each one. Explored factors included the mother's age, education and wealth index and the children's age, sex, physical activity, day care attendance and ultra-processed food consumption. Crude (cPR) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were estimated for the association between associated factors and excessive screen time using the GLM Poisson of with a logarithmic link.
RESULTS: Excessive TV screen time and electronic devices prevalence was 74% and 36.9%, respectively. For TV screen time, a high wealth index (aPR 1.13; 95%CI: 1.03-1.23) and children's age (aPR 1.18; 95%CI: 1.08-1.29 for 4 years, PR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.07-1.28 for 5 years) were significant. For electronic devices, significant associations included mothers with more than 3 children (aPR 0.77; 95%CI: 0.62-0.96), being single (aPR 1.27; 95%CI: 1.01-1.58) and a high wealth index (aPR 1.38; 95%CI: 1.13-1.68). Furthermore, significant associations were found between excessive electronic device screen time and consumption of candies and chocolates (aPR 1.38; 95%CI: 1.08-1.77).
CONCLUSIONS: Seven out of 10 preschool children exceeded the recommended television screen time. Certain characteristics of the children, their mothers and the family's socio-economic situation are related to excessive television screen time and excessive electronic device screen time.",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,"Funding: Funding was provided by Bloomberg Philanthropies (grant numbers 46129 and 2019‐71181).

In addition, the parasitic and growth indices, and hematological, biochemical, enzymatic and histopathological parameters were evaluated in the tambaqui. After 30 days of feeding with diets containing 1.52 g EOLO kg−1, the length, mean weight and mean weight gain decreased. There was 100% survival of fish fed with the EOs, and a decrease in the rates of parasitism in fish fed with diets containing 0.86 g EOLG kg−1, 0.76 g EOLO kg−1, 1.03 and 2.06 g EOOG kg−1. For these concentrations, the anthelmintic efficacy of the EOLG was 62.1%, EOLO was 61.8% and EOOG was 58.7% and 59.8%, respectively. An increase in plasma levels of total protein and alkaline phosphatase was found in the fish fed with diets containing highest concentrations of EOLG and EOLO. Maintenance levels of alanine aminotransferase in plasma and aspartate aminotransferase, together with the higher frequency of mild to moderate damages in liver tissue and presence of focal point necrosis, suggest the influence of a high abundance of parasites on the biochemical and enzymatic processes of the host fish. Histomorphological and physiological indicators and a decrease in the rates of parasites with diets containing 0.86 g EOLG kg−1, 0.76 g EOLO kg−1 and 1.03 and 2.06 g EOOG kg−1 indicate that this is a promising therapeutic alternative in the control of acanthocephalosis in tambaqui.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1136,pub.1169410671,10.1002/bse.3703,,,Circular product design challenges: An exploratory study on critical barriers,"Abstract Despite the recognition that the adoption of the circular economy depends on aligning the new product development process with the principles of circularity, there are still few studies on the barriers to circular product design. This article aims to contribute to this topic by developing an exploratory study to identify and analyze these barriers in the Brazilian context. In addition to a theoretical analysis, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was utilized to evaluate the significance of various hindrances and obstacles to circular product design. To gain a better understanding of these barriers, semi‐structured interviews were also conducted. Experts in areas such as sustainability, marketing, and R&D from companies that develop products participated in this research. The results of the study reveal that the difficulties supply chains have in providing circular economy‐based products and reverse logistics systems are among the main barriers. Challenges such as low consumer valorization of these products and a lack of knowledge and technologies were also identified as relevant. By investigating a set of barriers to circular product design, this study extends knowledge about the difficulties companies face in the transition to circular business models.",,"Funding information São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Grant/Award Number: 21/12579‐0",Business Strategy and the Environment,,,,2024-03-05,2024,2024-03-05,2024-07,33,5,4825-4842,Closed,Article,"Jugend, Daniel; dos Santos, Hugo Henrique; Garrido, Susana; Siqueira, Regiane Máximo; Mesa, Jaime A.","Jugend, Daniel (Production Engineering Department, São Paulo State University—UNESP, Bauru, Brazil); dos Santos, Hugo Henrique (Production Engineering Department, São Paulo State University—UNESP, Bauru, Brazil); Garrido, Susana (CeBER, Faculty of Economics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal); Siqueira, Regiane Máximo (Production Engineering Department, São Paulo State University—UNESP, Bauru, Brazil); Mesa, Jaime A.

1135,pub.1162887479,10.1016/j.iref.2023.07.029,,,Towards understanding MILA stock markets integration beyond MILA: New evidence between the pre-Global financial crisis and the COVID19 periods,"This study contributes to the debate on the impact of MILA on its integration objective of MILA (Mercados Integrados Latinoamericanos) stock markets. First, given the inconclusive results of previous studies on the impact of MILA per se on the integration of such stock markets, we provide new evidence by accounting for global events during a longer observation period compared to previous studies: between the pre-Global Financial Crisis (March 2004) and COVID19 (March 2023) periods. Second, we consider close geographical proximity during that observation period by including in our analyses other non-MILA stock markets in Latin America (i.e., Argentina and Brazil), in addition to the usual approach of considering the US as the proxy for international markets. Third we identify and verify structural breakpoints prior to modeling stock returns through dynamic correlations. Finally, we test robustness of results through CCC, VCC, in addition to the usual approach of using DCC GARCH models. Fourth, our analysis is based on real returns rather than nominal. Key findings are as follows. First, except for Colombia, LATAM stock markets tend to respond identically to a series of major global events. Second, crisis periods, both GFC and Covid19, were associated with increased volatility and correlation despite mixed correlation outcomes during Covid19. However, whereas real returns dropped during the GCF, it was the contrary during Covid19. Third, regarding the effect of MILA there were changes in returns, volatility, and correlation during MILA periods, and they are consistent for all markets, including non-MILA markets. We, therefore, consider MILA events as coincidences during the two global events, just like other events from the GFC and Covid19. Fourth, the Colombian stock market is segmented from other markets throughout the covered period. We discuss these findings by highlighting possible policy implications and uncover some areas for further research towards searching robust solutions to market integration in the region.",Declaration of competing interest None.,,International Review of Economics & Finance,,,,2024-01,2024,,2024-01,89,,478-497,Closed,Article,"Lukanima, Benedicto Kulwizira; Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier; Gómez-Bravo, Yuli Paola","Lukanima, Benedicto Kulwizira (Business School, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Business School, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia); Gómez-Bravo, Yuli Paola (Business School, Universidad del Norte, Km 5 Via a Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte)","Lukanima, Benedicto Kulwizira (Universidad del Norte); Sanchez-Barrios, Luis Javier (Universidad del Norte); Gómez-Bravo, Yuli Paola (Universidad del Norte)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162887479,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",

The platform provides an economical alternative for conducting chemistry laboratory activities. The research had a mixed approach, where surveys were applied to teachers, students, and administrative staff of the University of Cartagena, and a V-model was used for the development of the application. The main stages of the model included benchmarking to determine the components to be used, the construction of the data acquisition hardware, the development of the laboratory data acquisition software, and the application of component integration, reliability, and technological acceptance tests. As a result, a web application was created, and TDS and temperature sensors were installed and connected by Wi-Fi. In addition, a technological acceptance test was conducted in the Chemistry program. The acceptance test was based on Davis’ technology acceptance model (1989), which considers the user’s ease of use and usefulness perceived, which resulted in a high degree of acceptance. In addition, the platform built has compatibility with multiple sensors, including those outside chemistry, allowing its use in laboratories of other disciplines.",,,IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,,,,2024-09-11,2024,2024-09-11,,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,"Velez-Ramos, Jeimy; Tovar-Garrido, Luis; Scholborgh, Francisco","Velez-Ramos, Jeimy (); Tovar-Garrido, Luis (); Scholborgh, Francisco ()",,"Velez-Ramos, Jeimy (); Tovar-Garrido, Luis (); Scholborgh, Francisco ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175663502,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Focusing on how romantic love myths affect relationship satisfaction and their ties to interpersonal violence, sexism, and gender inequality, the methodology involved 308 participants, mainly females (75%), using the SMRL and Relationship Assessment Scale. Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis (BCFA) assessed the scale's structure and reliability, complemented by descriptive statistics and correlation analyses to examine the myths' impact on intimate relationships. Results showed the SMRL's two-dimensional structure, confirming its robust psychometric properties and satisfactory internal consistency. Descriptive findings revealed a skeptical view of traditional romantic myths among participants, indicating the scale's good reliability and successful adaptation to the Peruvian context. This validation highlights how debunking romantic love myths can improve relationship dynamics and satisfaction and addresses their wider societal effects.",,,Journal of Marital and Family Therapy,,,,2024-09-18,2024,2024-09-18,2024-09-18,,,,Closed,Article,"Ventura‐León, José; Lino‐Cruz, Cristopher; Tocto‐Muñoz, Shirley; Sánchez‐Villena, Andy Rick; Martinez‐Munive, Renzo; Talledo‐Sánchez, Karim; Casiano‐Valdivieso, Kenia","Ventura‐León, José (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Lino‐Cruz, Cristopher (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Peruana de Ciencia Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Tocto‐Muñoz, Shirley (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Sánchez‐Villena, Andy Rick (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Martinez‐Munive, Renzo (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru); Talledo‐Sánchez, Karim (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal, Lima, Peru); Casiano‐Valdivieso, Kenia (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Peru)","Ventura‐León, José (Private University of the North)","Ventura‐León, José (Private University of the North); Lino‐Cruz, Cristopher (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Peruana de Ciencia Aplicadas, Lima, Peru); Tocto‐Muñoz, Shirley (Private University of the North); Sánchez‐Villena, Andy Rick (Private University of the North); Martinez‐Munive, Renzo (Private University of the North); Talledo‐Sánchez, Karim (Federico Villarreal National University); Casiano‐Valdivieso, Kenia (Private University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175816710,44 Human Society; 52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,5 Gender Equality

The impact of dopant types (n- and p-types), optical energy gap, crystallite size and stress on EFE parameters has been explored in detail. The surface morphology of grown SiNWs has been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), showing vertical, well aligned SiNWs. Optical absorption and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the quantum confinement (QC) effect. The EFE performance of the grown nanowire arrays has been examined through recorded J-E measurements under the Fowler-Nordheim framework. The Si NWs grown on p-type Si showed a minimum turn-on field and also a higher field enhancement factor. The band-bending diagram also suggests a lower barrier height of p-type Si NWs compared to n-type Si NWs, which plays a key role in enhancing the EFE performance. These investigations suggest that dopant types (n- and p-types), band gap, crystallite size and stress influence the EFE parameters and Si NWs grown on p-type Si (100) substrates are much more favorable for the investigation of EFE properties.",This work was supported by CEDENNA through Financiamiento Basal para Centros Científicos y Tecnológicos de Excelencia (Grant AFB220001).

Most existing interventions fail to address the multidimensional nature of empowerment. Using a double matching design to construct the sampling frame and to estimate causal effects, I evaluate the long-term impact of a multifaceted policy intervention designed to improve women’s empowerment in the Atlantic region in Colombia. This intervention provided information about women’s rights, soft skills and vocational training, seed capital, and mentoring simultaneously. I find that this intervention has mixed results: there are improvements in incomes and other economic dimensions along with large political and social capital effects, but limited or null impacts on women’s rights knowledge and control over one’s body. Using a list experiment, I even find an increase in the likelihood of intra-household violence. The results highlight the importance of addressing the multidimensional nature of women’s empowerment in policy innovations designed to foster it and incorporating men in these efforts.","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

While the residual presence of such substances is known to depend on environmental conditions, most ecotoxicological studies to date have not considered environmental context. Here, we conducted oceanographic monitoring combined with experiments aiming to estimate the effects of two pyrethroids on the feeding rates of larvae of farmed mussels, Mytilus chilensis. In additional experiments, mussel spats were exposed to both pyrethroids, but under contrasting temperature/pH so as to mimic winter and summer conditions. Experiments mimicking spring conditions revealed that both pyrethroid substances affected the feeding of mussel larvae as a function of concentration. Conversely, significant impact of pyrethroids on adults were not observed with regard to temperature and pH, but a significant impact of low temperature/low pH condition on ingestion rates was confirmed. Given the current status of increasing ocean acidification, the results of this study are expected to provide useful information with regard to achieving sustainable mussel aquaculture, especially considering both activities occur in similar geographic areas, and the expansion of salmon farming areas is ongoing in Chile.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Cristian A.

Fouling-induced sinking of plastic litter is one of the proposed mechanisms responsible for this mass difference. While some of this 'missing' plastic mass may be explained by the effects of fouling, it has also been hypothesized that sinking litter may return to the surface after benthic organisms consume the biofouling. However, this hypothesis has never been tested. The present study evaluated the structure and biomass of the fouling community in response to benthic predation in both summer and winter seasons. Floating PVC plates were installed during winter and summer in central Chile (36°S) until the growing biofouling community caused them to sink. Plates were then moved to the seabed, where they were exposed to benthic predation, while control plates were maintained in a mesh cage impeding predator access. In summer, all plates recovered their buoyancy, while in the winter only 60 % recovered buoyancy. All caged control samples remained on the bottom in both seasons. The community structure differed both in the treatments and across the seasons, with plates that recovered buoyancy initially being dominated by Ulva sp. and Ciona robusta. Conversely, plates that did not refloat were mainly covered by species resistant to predation such as Pyura chilensis, Austromegabalanus psittacus, and Balanus laevis. Thus, fouling community structure influences how predation facilitates buoyancy recovery, because not all epibionts can be consumed by predators. While previous studies had shown how fouling organisms cause sinking of floating litter, this is the first study to provide experimental evidence that predation can reverse this process and allow litter to resurface and become again available as dispersal vectors for native and invasive species.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

AIMS: This study aimed to analyze the symptoms of pandemic fatigue through network analysis in individuals from five South American countries.
METHOD: A total of 1,444 individuals from Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay participated and were evaluated using the Pandemic Fatigue Scale. The networks were estimated using the ggmModSelect estimation method and a polychoric correlation matrix was used. Stability assessment of the five networks was performed using the nonparametric resampling method based on the case bootstrap type. For the estimation of network centrality, a metric based on node strength was used, whereas network comparison was performed using a permutation-based approach.
RESULTS: The results showed that the relationships between pandemic fatigue symptoms were strongest in the demotivation dimension. Variability in the centrality of pandemic fatigue symptoms was observed among participating countries. Finally, symptom networks were invariant and almost identical across participating countries.

Context and perspectives following the first report of YTX levels exceeding the regulatory limit in the Patagonian fjord system,"In late summer and early autumn 2022, an intense bloom of Protoceratium reticulatum-the main yessotoxin (YTX) producer along Chilean coasts and a major threat to artisanal fisheries, the aquaculture industry, and environmental health-was recorded in the Patagonian fjord system. The high YTX levels (>3.75 mg kg-1) resulted in the first ban of shellfish collection in Chile. At Puyuhuapi Fjord, a global ""hotspot"" of harmful algal bloom events, the cell density of P. reticulatum determined in integrated tube samples (0-10 m) at the end of April 2022 reached 407,000 cells L-1. At the same time, YTX levels well exceeded the regulatory limit by roughly 2.5-fold, with concentrations as high as 9.42 mg kg-1 measured in native populations of the blue mussel Mytilus chilensis. Five different YTX analogues, 45-OH-YTX, COOH-45-keto-YTX, COOH-45-OH-YTX, COOH-YTX, and 45,55-diOH-YTX, were also detected in relevant amounts. While the ban lasted close to 3 months, accumulation and detoxification processes were monitored over a 1-year period. This study assessed the implications of high levels of YTXs and their analogues on the local economy and ecosystem health, given the increase in P. reticulatum blooms predicted for NW Patagonia in the context of a changing climate.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

1103,pub.1174003508,10.1016/j.jobe.2024.110249,,,Synergizing metakaolin and waste-glass for sustainable and functional UHPCC– a central composite design and ecological footprint assessment,"Optimizing ultra-high-performance cementitious composites (UHPCC) with sustainable materials often compromises certain properties due to the chemical nature of alternative binders used to replace standard UHPCC components like Portland cement (OPC) and microsilica (MS). In the context of Waste-Glass-UHPCC, the reduction in early strength, attributed to the varied pozzolanic reactivity of MS and recycled glass powder as cementitious materials, may reduce its application that requires high early strength. This study addresses the early strength deficiency of Waste-Glass-UHPCC by incorporating metakaolin (MK) and also aims to assess the impact of MK on 28-day compressive strength, durability, and carbon footprint. Research investigating the effects of MK on UHPCC with reduced OPC and MS content is currently limited. Specifically, this investigation explores the influence of MK on UHPCC characterized by a cement content of 620 kg/m3. By utilizing advanced statistical methods [i.e., the Central Composite Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)], this study investigates the substitution of MK for OPC in formulations of Waste-Glass-UHPCC. The experimental design comprises 18 encoded mixtures, allowing for the development of second-order regression models for critical responses [slump flow and compressive strength at different ages]. Besides, visualization through RSM-3D graphs facilitates a comprehensive examination of the effects of various factors. For a deeper analysis, two of the CCD's points, i.e., SP-12 (Waste-Glass-UHPCC without metakaolin), and SP-10 (Waste-Glass-UHPCC with 65.77 kg of metakaolin per cubic meter) were further investigated along with a control dosage that represents a typical UHPCC formulation. The responses studied encompassed 1, 7, and 28 d compressive strength, chloride ion penetration, and carbon footprint measured by a systematic life cycle analysis (following ISO 15804), assessing the environmental impact of the UHPCC's making materials from raw extraction to disposal. Despite encountering challenges in meeting self-compacting concrete criteria due to MK's tendency to accelerate hydration, the enhanced early strength properties (61 % higher than those of the Waste-Glass-UHPCC) make the MK-based mixture appropriate for various applications such as bridge engineering or pavement rehabilitation. Additionally, the addition of MK in UHPCC formulation demonstrated superior resistance to chloride ion permeability even compared to the control mixture, attributed to MK's ability to enhance the concrete's microstructure and capture chloride ions, attributed to Friedel's salt formation. Noteworthy findings include a significant (27 %) reduction in carbon footprint with the incorporation of MK in Waste-Glass-UHPCC compared to the control counterparts. The current study highlights the durability and environmental advantages of MK-based UHPCC blends while emphasizing the critical requirements of workability and strength development of sustainable UHPCC.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The present study evaluates the effects of P. reticulatum and YTXs on the survival and feed ingestion of veliger larvae of Argopecten purpuratus. Larvae were 96 h-exposed to 500, 1000 and 2000 P. reticulatum cells mL-1, and their equivalent YTX extract was prepared in methanol. Results show a survival mean of 82 % at the highest density of dinoflagellate, and 38 % for larvae with the highest amount of YTX extract. Feed ingestion is reduced in the dinoflagellate exposure treatments as a function of cell density. Therefore, the effect of YTXs on A. purpuratus represents a new and important area of study for investigations into the deleterious effects of these toxins in the early stages of the life cycle of this and, potentially, other bivalves.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This research proposes a bi-objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model for designing reverse logistics networks that enable both economical and safe medical waste management. Said model determines optimal quantity, depot locations, and routes for transporting waste from its generating points (hospitals) to the treatment and disposal sites (depots). This research addresses a bi-objective location routing problem, with multiple depots, time windows, capacity constraints, and variated waste types, across a multi-period horizon. It is innovative because no previous works have successfully dealt with such a combination of pragmatic features. The Location Routing Problem is an already well-known NP-Hard problem, with the additional aforementioned features further adding to its complexity. Thus, a genetic algorithm to solve large-sized realistic instances within reasonable computing times had been developed. Numerical experiments considered 20 random instances contrasting exact and approximate solution approaches. Also, a medical waste collection case study of a public hospital network in Atlántico Department, Colombia, delivering a Pareto frontier solution set, was introduced. The results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed genetic algorithm in successfully addressing small instances of the problem, delivering outcomes comparable to the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. Furthermore, it yields good-quality solutions in a reduced computational time for larger instances deemed unfeasible for the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. This article contributes to both scientific literature and practitioners by presenting a decision-making tool designed to address the medical waste reverse logistics challenge under realistic scenarios. It approaches the issue from a bi-objective standpoint, jointly considering economic factors and biomedical safety. Additionally, the article introduces realistic and pertinent assumptions that have not been explored in previous literature.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2024-10,2024,,2024-10,474,,143592,Closed,Article,"Palomino-Perez, Yulieth; Rojas, Miguel; Amaya-Mier, René","Palomino-Perez, Yulieth (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Rojas, Miguel (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia); Amaya-Mier, René (Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Colombia)","Palomino-Perez, Yulieth (Universidad del Norte)","Palomino-Perez, Yulieth (Universidad del Norte); Rojas, Miguel (Universidad del Norte); Amaya-Mier, René (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175526389,40 Engineering,

These insectivorous bats provide important ecosystem services, including pest control. Even though some aspects of their biology are well- known, only a few genomic resources are available for these species, which limits our understanding of their biology. In this study, we assembled and annotated the mitochondrial genome of four species: R. aenea, R. genowaysi, R. mira, and R. parvula. We generated a phylomitogenomic hypothesis based on translated protein-coding genes for a total of 52 species in the family Vespertilionidae and examined the phylogenetic position of the genus Rhogeessa and species within the family. The AT-rich mitogenomes of R. aenea, R. genowaysi, R. mira, and R. parvula are 16,763, 16,781, 16,807, and 16,794 pb in length, respectively. Each studied mitogenome encodes 13 Protein Coding Genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, and 2 rRNA genes, and contains a putative control region (CR). All tRNAs exhibit a 'cloverleaf' secondary structure, except tRNA-Serine-1 that lacked the DHU arm in all studied mitogenomes. Selective pressure analyses indicated that all protein-coding genes are exposed to purifying selection. The phylomitogenomic analysis supported the monophyletic status of the family Vespertilionidae, confirmed the placement of Rhogeessa within the tribe Antrozoini, and clarified phylogenetic relationships within and among subfamilies and tribes in this family. Our results indicate that phylomitogenomics are useful to explore the evolutionary history of vesper bats. The assembly and comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genomes offer the potential to generate molecular references and resources beneficial for genetic analyses aimed at understanding the ecology and evolution of these remarkable bats.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Yet, the existence of a set of globally distributed topsoil microbial and small invertebrate organisms consistently associated with land plants (i.e., their consistent soil-borne microbiome), together with the environmental preferences and functional capabilities of these organisms, remains unknown. We conducted a standardized field survey under 150 species of land plants, including 58 species of bryophytes and 92 of vascular plants, across 124 locations from all continents. We found that, despite the immense biodiversity of soil organisms, the land plants evaluated only shared a small fraction (less than 1%) of all microbial and invertebrate taxa that were present across contrasting climatic and soil conditions and vegetation types. These consistent taxa were dominated by generalist decomposers and phagotrophs and their presence was positively correlated with the abundance of functional genes linked to mineralization. Finally, we showed that crossing environmental thresholds in aridity (aridity index of 0.65, i.e., the transition from mesic to dry ecosystems), soil pH (5.5; i.e., the transition from acidic to strongly acidic soils), and carbon (less than 2%, the lower limit of fertile soils) can result in drastic disruptions in the associations between land plants and soil organisms, with potential implications for the delivery of soil ecosystem processes under ongoing global environmental change.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study work associated with this manuscript was founded by a Large Research Grant from the British Ecological Society (No LRB17\1019; MUSGONET).

Due to the local scope of most studies, we lack a global quantification of the relative importance of species addition ‘versus’ replacement. We assessed the role of these processes in the variation (β-diversity) of plant communities colonizing the forelands of 46 retreating glaciers worldwide, using both environmental DNA and traditional surveys. Our findings indicate that addition and replacement concur in determining community changes in deglaciated sites, but their relative importance varied over time. Taxa addition dominated immediately after glacier retreat, as expected in harsh environments, while replacement became more important for late-successional communities. These changes were aligned with total β-diversity changes, which were more pronounced between early-successional communities than between late-successional communities (>50 yr since glacier retreat). Despite the complexity of community assembly during plant succession, the observed global pattern suggests a generalized shift from the dominance of facilitation and/or stochastic processes in early-successional communities to a predominance of competition later on.","This study was funded by the European Research Council under the European Community’s Horizon 2020 Programme, Grant Agreement no. 772284 (IceCommunities) to I.C., A.C., A.G., S.M., A.B., R.A., R.S.A., F.G., L.G., N.K., G.A.D., J.P., W.T., M.C. and G.F.F.

These anthropogenic effects have primarily been linked to the development of the mining industry, the impact of which remains uncertain. Here, we use high-resolution geochemical characterization and magnetic properties analysis from the sedimentary core of Inka Coya Lake, located in the Atacama Desert, to assess the anthropogenic impact in this metallogenic region. The geochemistry and magnetic properties changed with core depth. Elements, such as Cu, Ni, and Zn, increased during the lake's most recent period. Additionally, an increase in mass magnetic susceptibility (χ) and a decrease in magnetic susceptibility depending on the frequency (χfd%) may be attributed to fine iron oxide grains originating from industrial and urban sources. Moreover, indices of pollution classified the sediment of Inka Coya Lake as slightly polluted and strongly polluted with Ni, and Cu, respectively. This could reflect a period of pollution caused by the increase in the production of copper sulfide. These results highlight the possible impact of mining activities in the hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert, which affects surrounding areas through dispersive processes, even reaching high altitudes, and provides a scientific basis for the prevention of environmental pollution from mining and the protection of the sediment and water source in the Atacama Desert.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The stack was manufactured using ASTM A240 Type 316L stainless steel. After one year of its service, massive leakages and cracks were observed near the welds. Following a visual examination of the stack, a representative sample was extracted and analyzed using visual and radiographic inspection, metallographic examination, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometry, optical emission spectrometry, ferrite number analysis, and leak testing. Furthermore, corrosion mechanisms and the sequence of events leading to failure were determined. Two different mechanisms were identified: acid dew point corrosion caused by the condensation of H2SO4 and HCl at the inner walls of the chimney, followed by stress-corrosion cracking near the welded joints.","The authors would like to express their gratitude to Universidad Nacional de Colombia—Sede Medellín—Facultad de Minas—Laboratorio de Soldadura, and Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano (ITM) for their valuable support.

Two types of materials, crushed rubber (CR) and steel slag (SS), were selected to analyze their effects on micro-paving asphalt mixtures. The methodology was carried out in two phases: first, the behavior of these materials in cold asphalt mixtures was analyzed and, in the second phase, the design of micro surfacing developed in three scenarios was analyzed under the requirements of the ISSA standard (the control mixture (MP), the mixture with SS as a 10% aggregate substitute and the mixture with the best performing percentages of CR and SS). Test specimens were prepared with the addition of 5%, 8%, 10% and 12% of CR and 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of SS as a replacement for fine aggregate. Main tests such as wet track abrasion test (WTAT), loaded wheel test (LWT) and Schulze–Breuer and Ruck compatibility were developed. As favorable results, the first two scenarios of the second phase (the control mix and 10% SS) had better performances; however, the mix incorporating CR and SS in percentages of 5 and 10% did not meet the design requirements of the ISSA standard for the WTAT and LWT. It was concluded that the best alternative for micropavement design was the substitution of fine aggregate by SS, in effect, it had lower costs, good mechanical performance and sustainable design for cold climates.",We are grateful to the Professional School of Civil Engineering of Civil Engineering of the Universidad Señor de Sipan for providing us with the facilities to carry out the research.,The present research work has no source of financing; it is financed by the author’s own resources.,Innovative Infrastructure Solutions,,,,2024-01-17,2024,2024-01-17,2024-02,9,2,37,Closed,Article,"Pérez, Sócrates Pedro Muñoz; Viera, Jean Pierre Fernández; Carranza, Jeiner Fernando Gonzales; Zapata, Luigi Italo Villena; Chumacero, Juan Martin Garcia; Brast, Carlos Eduardo Ramos; Ortiz, Edwin Adolfo Diaz; Laffite, Ernesto Dante Rodriguez","Pérez, Sócrates Pedro Muñoz (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad Nacional Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza de Amazonas, Chachapoyas, Peru); Viera, Jean Pierre Fernández (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru); Carranza, Jeiner Fernando Gonzales (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru); Zapata, Luigi Italo Villena (Professional School of Business Administration, School of Business Science, Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, Peru); Chumacero, Juan Martin Garcia (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru); Brast, Carlos Eduardo Ramos (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Universidad San Martín de Porres, Lima, Peru); Ortiz, Edwin Adolfo Diaz (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad Nacional Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza de Amazonas, Chachapoyas, Peru); Laffite, Ernesto Dante Rodriguez (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru)","Pérez, Sócrates Pedro Muñoz (National University Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza)","Pérez, Sócrates Pedro Muñoz (National University Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza); Viera, Jean Pierre Fernández (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru); Carranza, Jeiner Fernando Gonzales (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru); Zapata, Luigi Italo Villena (Universidad César Vallejo); Chumacero, Juan Martin Garcia (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru); Brast, Carlos Eduardo Ramos (Universidad de San Martín de Porres); Ortiz, Edwin Adolfo Diaz (National University Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza); Laffite, Ernesto Dante Rodriguez (Professional School of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism, Señor de Sipán Private University, Chiclayo, Peru)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168017268,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Because of its relevance and increased use in recent years for pavement engineering applications, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent case studies that investigate the application of UHPC in bridge pavement rehabilitation or reconstruction projects. The selected case studies include projects conducted in America, Asia, and Europe, and provide valuable insights into the design, construction, and performance of UHPC overlays. These showcase the effectiveness of UHPC in addressing common issues such as cracking, rutting, and structural deficiencies in bridge pavements. Furthermore, these highlight the superior flexural and compressive strength of UHPC, which contributes to improved load-carrying capacity and resistance to permanent deformation. Moreover, some environmental benefits derived from UHPC such as smaller carbon footprint are highlighted in the paper as well as cost-effectiveness considerations in light of the long-term performance and reduced maintenance obtained with UHPC overlays. Overall, the comprehensive literature review and case studies presented in this paper provide valuable data on material properties, project types, construction techniques, and post-rehabilitation evaluations. These findings can guide future research and assist practitioners in making informed decisions regarding the implementation of UHPC overlays for pavement rehabilitation. Finally, this paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge on UHPC overlays and emphasizes their significance in improving the longevity and sustainability of bridge pavements.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Construction and Building Materials,,,,2024-01,2024,,2024-01,410,,134221,Closed,Article,"Abellán-García, Joaquín; Carvajal-Muñoz, Juan S.; Ramírez-Munévar, César","Abellán-García, Joaquín (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Carvajal-Muñoz, Juan S.

Conditions that make them vulnerable in what Gonzalo A. Saraví (2020) calls ""accumulation of disadvantages"". The above, through the analysis of a settlement located in Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, Jalisco, a municipality known for its disjointed urbanization patterns and the challenges it faces in terms of water supply due, in part, to this urban growth pattern. The results point to the fact that women belonging to less advantaged social groups the disparity increases and disadvantages accumulate due to the expenses associated with the purchase of water by tanker trucks and bottled water, as well as the time they spend on transportation, storage, purification, distribution and disposal of water (Gutiérrez-Villalpaldo et al., 2013:101) in a territorially disjointed and practically isolated environment.",,,Vivienda y Comunidades Sustentables,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-01-01,2024-01-01,0,15,25-40,Closed,Article,"Cervantes, Abril Casas","Cervantes, Abril Casas (Universidad de Guadalajara, México)",,"Cervantes, Abril Casas (University of Guadalajara)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173781413,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 37 Earth Sciences,

In the hyperarid coast of the Atacama Desert, hunter-gatherer-fisher developed standardized stone-built architectural features mostly built on or directly related to shell-matrix deposits during the Late Archaic period (5700 – 4000 cal. years B.P.). These structures have been usually interpreted as sedentary villages or long-term campsites. These functional interpretations are based primarily upon intrasite variability, lacking systematic site formation analysis and chronostratigraphy. As a response to concerns arising from limited interpretive approaches, we propose a detailed taphonomic study of bone assemblages from a stone-built funerary structure of the Zapatero site (∼25°S, Taltal, Chile). We recorded macroscopic taphonomic modification features on mammal and avian bone remains (n = 1776) from five stratigraphic units within the structure. Our results attest that despite some similarities between strata, key differences in overall proportions suggest different taphonomic pathways. This variability within the sample is interpreted as a re-deposition of bone refuse from previous occupations as structural filling, intentionally deposited previous to the abandonment of the structure, therefore not directly related to the occupation of the architectonic feature. Finally, we highlight the role that relatively simple zooarchaeological and taphonomical comparisons intra-site, might shed light on exceptional site formation processes on short timescales, emphasizing why we must consider this sort of data even in low relative abundances in order to interpret taphonomic history pathways and depositional practices.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The global retreat of glaciers exposes nutrient-poor substrates in extreme environments and provides a unique opportunity to study early successions of mycorrhizal fungi by assessing their dynamics and drivers. We combined environmental DNA metabarcoding and measurements of local conditions to assess the succession of mycorrhizal communities during soil development in 46 glacier forelands around the globe, testing whether dynamics and drivers differ between mycorrhizal types. Mycorrhizal fungi colonized deglaciated areas very quickly (< 10 yr), with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi tending to become more diverse through time compared to ectomycorrhizal fungi. Both alpha- and beta-diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were significantly related to time since glacier retreat and plant communities, while microclimate and primary productivity were more important for ectomycorrhizal fungi. The richness and composition of mycorrhizal communities were also significantly explained by soil chemistry, highlighting the importance of microhabitat for community dynamics. The acceleration of ice melt and the modifications of microclimate forecasted by climate change scenarios are expected to impact the diversity of mycorrhizal partners. These changes could alter the interactions underlying biotic colonization and belowground-aboveground linkages, with multifaceted impacts on soil development and associated ecological processes.","Acknowledgements We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers and the editor Maarja Öpik for critical suggestions that improved the manuscript.

The ingestion of these microplastics by commercial fish poses a threat to the ecosystem and human livelihood. Coastal lagoons are highly vulnerable to microplastic and microbiological pollution, yet limited understanding of the risks complicates management. Here, we present the main bacterial groups, including potentially pathogenic species, identified on microplastics in waters, sediments, and commercial fish from Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), the largest coastal lagoon in Colombia. DNA metabarcoding allowed identifying 1760 bacterial genera on microplastics, with Aeromonas and Acinetobacter as the most frequent and present in all three matrices. The greatest bacterial richness and diversity were recorded on microplastics from sediments, followed by waters and fish. Biochemical analyses yielded 19 species of potentially pathogenic culturable bacteria on microplastics. Aeromonas caviae was the most frequent and, along with Pantoea sp., was found on microplastics in all three matrices. Enterobacter roggenkampii and Pseudomonas fluorescens were also found on microplastics from waters and fish. We propose management strategies for an Early Warning System against microbiological and microplastic pollution risks in coastal lagoons, illustrated by CGSM. This includes forming inter-institutional alliances for research and monitoring, accompanied by strengthening governance and health infrastructures.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this study, thin films of Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) and B–Ga co-doped ZnO (BGZO) were prepared on glass substrates using the plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technique, and their structural and optoelectronic properties were characterized. It is found that all thin films were consistent with hexagonal fibrous ZnO structure, and the surface morphology of the membrane was homogenous at nanoscale. UV spectroscopy analysis showed that the doping of B and Ga elements could increase the transparency of ZnO films. The electrical properties can be remarkably enhanced by doping with B and Ga elements. Further more, tungsten oxide (WO3) was deposited on the as-prepared BGZO films using magnetron sputtering method. We activated the sample by applying voltage and observed a color transition from transparent to dark blue.

Species with broad environmental tolerances can quickly adapt to local conditions and expand their niches along environmental gradients, and even colonize habitats with extreme abiotic conditions. Here we report and document the distribution of eight marine NIS (four seaweed and four invertebrate species) found in tidepools along a 3000 km latitudinal gradient along the Pacific coast of Chile (18.4°S to 41.9°S). The seaweed NIS Codium fragile, Capreolia implexa, Schottera nicaeensis and Mastocarpus latissimus were mostly distributed towards high latitudes (i.e., more southerly locations), where temperatures in tidepools were low. The invertebrate NIS Anemonia alicemartinae, Ciona robusta, Bugula neritina and Bugulina flabellata were more common towards low latitudes, where high temperatures were registered in the tidepools. Across the intertidal gradient, seaweed NIS were mostly found in pools in the mid and low intertidal zone, while invertebrate NIS occurred mostly in pools from the mid and upper intertidal zones. The realized niche spaces of NIS (based on the Outlying Mean Index, OMI) in the study area were mainly influenced by environmental conditions of temperature and salinity (along the latitudinal and intertidal gradients), while other tidepool characteristics (depth, surface area, exposition, and complexity) only had minor effects. Five of the eight NIS exhibited a realized niche space coinciding with the average tidepool environmental conditions, while marginal niches were occupied by species with affinities for specific temperatures and salinities along the latitudinal and intertidal gradients. Our results indicate that physiological tolerances to environmental factors play a fundamental role in the distribution of seaweed and invertebrate NIS in tidepools along the Chilean coast. This study confirms that tidepools offer suitable conditions for some seaweed and invertebrate NIS, potentially facilitating their invasion into new natural habitats.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

888,pub.1171024665,10.1111/mec.17360,38656687,,Combining population genomics and biophysical modelling to assess connectivity patterns in an Antarctic fish,"Connectivity is a fundamental process of population dynamics in marine ecosystems. In the last decade, with the emergence of new methods, combining different approaches to understand the patterns of connectivity among populations and their regulation has become increasingly feasible. The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is characterized by complex oceanographic dynamics, where local conditions could act as barriers to population connectivity. Here, the notothenioid fish Harpagifer antarcticus, a demersal species with a complex life cycle (adults with poor swim capabilities and pelagic larvae), was used to assess connectivity along the WAP by combining biophysical modelling and population genomics methods. Both approaches showed congruent patterns. Areas of larvae retention and low potential connectivity, observed in the biophysical model output, coincide with four genetic groups within the WAP: (1) South Shetland Islands, (2) Bransfield Strait, (3) the central and (4) the southern area of WAP (Marguerite Bay). These genetic groups exhibited limited gene flow between them, consistent with local oceanographic conditions, which would represent barriers to larval dispersal. The joint effect of geographic distance and larval dispersal by ocean currents had a greater influence on the observed population structure than each variable evaluated separately. The combined effect of geographic distance and a complex oceanographic dynamic would be generating limited levels of population connectivity in the fish H. antarcticus along the WAP. Based on this, population connectivity estimations and priority areas for conservation were discussed, considering the marine protected area proposed for this threatened region of the Southern Ocean.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors want to thank all scientists and logistics support staff, from different institutions and countries, which contribute to sample obtention.

To determine the pathways by which plastic reaches their colonies, we analysed the abundance of plastics at the nesting sites of five seabird species (Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti, Peruvian booby Sula variegata, kelp gull Larus dominicanus, grey gull Leucophaeus modestus, Markham's storm-petrel Hydrobates markhami) nesting in northern Chile. Seabirds were primarily grouped according to their nesting behaviour, but two species foraging in contrasting habitats (kelp gull and Markham's storm-petrel) were also compared directly. The abundance, type, and polymer of macro-, meso- and microplastics were analysed in the soil of colonies and control sites, and microplastic ingestion was evaluated for selected species. Densities of plastics in colonies of surface-nesting seabirds ranged from 0 to 21.4 items m-2 (mainly plastic bags and thin films), and 0.002 to 19.7 items m-2 (mainly hard fragments) in colonies of burrow-nesting seabirds. Mean microplastic loads in the stomachs of seabirds were between 3.7 ± 4.2 plastic items individual-1. Overall, the abundances of plastic items in all seabird colonies were low, suggesting a limited transfer of plastics from sea to land. For kelp gulls, the results indicate transfer of macroplastic items to colonies, reaching the colony via regurgitates, with landfills considered as the main plastic source. Our results suggest that contrasting nesting behaviour and foraging habitats among species can explain differential plastic accumulation in seabird colonies, but also other factors, such as wind, contribute to the accumulation of plastic debris in colonies. Proper management of sanitary landfills are key to reduce plastic contamination of coastal seabirds and their colonies.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Additionally, the impact of JM-20 on chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats under chronic morphine exposure was investigated, and its efficacy in reducing mechanical hypersensitivity and histopathological changes in the sciatic nerve was assessed. JM-20 (20 mg/kg, per os [p.o.]), administered 60 min before morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c. twice daily at 12 h intervals) for ten days, significantly inhibited the development of morphine-induced hyperalgesia assessed using an electronic pressure-meter paw test, hot-plate, and formalin test, as well as the appearance of spontaneous withdrawal somatic symptoms in rats. Furthermore, JM-20 decreases spinal pro-inflammatory interleukin-1β and restores glutathione to close physiological concentrations, biomarkers directly related to the intensity of mechanical hypernociception. After CCI and sham surgery, co-treatment with JM-20 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for five days decreased morphine increased-mechanical hypersensitivity, even 12 days after its discontinuation. Continued morphine treatment imposed a neuroinflammatory challenge in CCI animals, further increasing cellularity (>75% immune cell infiltration) with lymphocytes and macrophages. However, JM-20 co-treatment still reduced the presence of cellular infiltrates (51-75%) with a predominance of lymphocytes. Even in the absence of nerve injury, JM-20 attenuated the peripheral neuroinflammatory response observed in morphine-treated sham-operated animals (0% vs. 1-25%). These findings suggest that JM-20 could prevent morphine-induced hyperalgesia by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Phytoremediation has emerged as a sustainable approach to remediate metal-contaminated mine waste areas. A scientometric analysis of 913 publications indexed in Web of Science from 1999 to 2023 was conducted using CiteSpace. The results reveal an expanding, interdisciplinary field with environmental sciences as the core category. Keyword analysis of 561 nodes and 2,825 links shows a focus on plant-metal interactions, microbial partnerships, bioavailability, and field validation. Co-citation analysis of 1,032 nodes and 2,944 links identifies seminal works on native species, plant-microbe interactions, and amendments. Temporal mapping of 15 co-citation clusters indicates a progression from early risk assessments and native plant inquiries to integrated biological systems, economic feasibility, and sustainability considerations. Recent trends emphasize multidimensional factors influencing adoption, such as plant-soil-microbe interactions, organic amendments, and field-scale performance evaluation. The findings demonstrate an intensifying translation of phytoremediation from scientific novelty to engineering practice. This quantitative and qualitative analysis of research trends aids in understanding the development of phytoremediation for mine tailings. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this evolving field.",,,International Journal of Phytoremediation,,,,2024-07-08,2024,2024-07-08,2024-07-08,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-19,Closed,Article,"Keith, Brian F.; Lam, Elizabeth J.; Montofré, Ítalo L.; Zetola, Vicente; Bech, Jaume","Keith, Brian F.

Métodos Aplicamos criterios de inclusión y exclusión para seleccionar estudios relevantes en bases de datos como EBSCO y PubMed. Las estrategias de búsqueda, realizadas hasta diciembre de 2023, se centraron en publicaciones que abordaran la tecnología de los oxímetros de pulso y variables que influyen en su precisión. Evaluamos el riesgo de sesgo de los estudios incluidos y utilizamos métodos estandarizados para la síntesis de resultados. Resultados Se incluyeron 23 estudios. La síntesis de los resultados destacó que los equipos con tecnología tetrapolar mostraron mayor precisión en las mediciones de SpO2. Una mayor pigmentación de la piel, hemoglobinopatías y altas temperaturas de la piel pueden llevar a una sobreestimación de la SpO2, mientras que factores como baja perfusión, temperatura de la piel fría, esmalte de uñas o tatuajes, hipoxemia, anemia y entrenamiento a gran altitud pueden subestimarla. Por otra parte, artefactos de movimiento, contaminación lumínica, frecuencia>150lpm, interferencia electromagnética y el lugar de colocación del sensor pueden provocar distorsión de la señal de fotopletismografía. Conclusiones La síntesis de los resultados destacó que la pigmentación de la piel y las interferencias luminosas pueden llevar a una sobreestimación de la SpO2, mientras que otros factores, como la baja perfusión y la altitud, tienden a subestimarla.

Objective Identify and reach consensus on the variables that affect the measurement of oxygen saturation (SpO2) using pulse oximetry. Methods We applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to select relevant studies in databases such as EBSCO and PubMed. The search strategies, carried out until December 2023, focused on publications that addressed the technology of pulse oximeters and variables that influence their accuracy. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and used standardized methods for synthesis of results. Results Twenty-three studies were included. The synthesis of the results highlighted that equipment with tetrapolar technology showed greater precision in SpO2 measurements. Increased skin pigmentation, hemoglobinopathies and high skin temperatures can lead to an overestimation of SpO2, while factors such as low perfusion, cold skin temperature, nail polish or tattoos, hypoxemia, anemia and high altitude training, they may underestimate it. On the other hand, motion artifacts, light pollution, frequency>150bpm, electromagnetic interference and location of the sensor can cause distortion of the photoplethymography signal. Conclusions The synthesis of the results highlighted that skin pigmentation and light interference can lead to an overestimation of SpO2, while other factors such as low perfusion and altitude tend to underestimate it. The studies presented variability and heterogeneity in their designs, evidencing limitations in the consistency and precision of the evidence. Despite these limitations, the results underscore the importance of considering multiple variables when interpreting pulse oximetry measurements to ensure their reliability. The findings have significant implications for clinical practice and future research.","Agradecimientos El artículo forma parte del Proyecto de Investigación FONIS SA2210178, año 2022, Evaluación de la precisión de la oximetría de pulso en función de la concentración de melanina en la piel.",,Revista Clínica Española,,,,2024-05,2024,,2024-05,224,5,314-330,Closed,Article,"León-Valladares, D.; Barrio-Mateu, L.A.; Cortés-Carmona, N.; Fuentes-Lizana, G.; Cabanas, A.M.; Latorre-Progulakis, K.; Guajardo, M.

A random finite element analysis is used to model the centrifuge experiment performed during the 2020 phase of the Liquefaction Experiments and Analysis Project (LEAP). The relative density of the main soil deposit in the LEAP-2020 experiments ranged from 50 to 75 %. In this study the spatial variability of each centrifuge model was determined from the inflight cone penetration tests (CPT) performed before the shaking phase in each experiment. The vertical spatial correlation length was directly determined from the CPT measurements, while the mean and coefficient of variation of the soil relative density were obtained from an empirical relationship correlating the cone tip resistance with the relative density. The variability observed in the achieved base motions for the LEAP-2020 centrifuge experiments was modeled by generating synthetic base motion time histories that matched the variability observed in the response spectra of the achieved base motions. The results obtained from this analysis shed light on the effects of the base motion variability and soil density on the excess pore pressure development and the triggering of soil liquefaction. It also provides an understanding on the sensitivity of the wall lateral displacement to such variabilities. The observed variability in the simulation response is compared with the variability observed in the centrifuge experiments. This comparison is used to evaluate the capability of the current numerical simulation tools in modeling the variability in the wall response.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Presently, there is a scarcity of treatments for FASD.Objectives: To analyze current literature, emphasizing evidence derived from preclinical models, that could potentially inform therapeutic interventions for FASD.Methods: A narrative review was conducted focusing on four prospective treatments: nutritional supplements, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds and environmental enrichment. The review also highlights innovative therapeutic strategies applied during early (e.g. folate administration, postnatal days 4-9) or late (e.g. NOX2 inhibitors given after weaning) postnatal stages that resulted in significant improvements in behavioral responses during adolescence (a critical period marked by the emergence of mental health issues in humans).Results: Our findings underscore the value of treatments centered around nutritional supplementation or environmental enrichment, aimed at mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, implying shared mechanisms in FASD pathogenesis. Moreover, the review spotlights emerging evidence pertaining to the involvement of novel molecular components with potential pharmacological targets (such as NOX2, MCP1/CCR2, PPARJ, and PDE1).Conclusions: Preclinical studies have identified oxidative imbalance and neuroinflammation as relevant pathological mechanisms induced by prenatal ethanol exposure. The relevance of these mechanisms, which exhibit positive feedback loop mechanisms, appear to peak during early development and decreases in adulthood.

These bays lie in one of the most productive marine ecosystems on Earth and are dominated by permanent coastal upwelling at Lengua de Vaca Point and Choros Point, one of the three upwelling centers on the Chilean coast. Significantly, this productive system experiences a high recurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB) events. This paper examines 9-year (2010-2018) samples of three toxic microalgal species collected in different monitoring programs and research projects. During this period, nine HAB events were detected in Guanaqueros Bay and 14 in Tongoy Bay. Among these, three HAB events were produced simultaneously in both bays by Pseudo-nitzschia australis, and two events produced simultaneously were detected in one bay by Alexandrium spp. and the other by Dinophysis acuminata. Before El Niño 2015-16, there were more HAB events of longer duration by the three species. Since El Niño, the number and duration of events were reduced and only produced by P. australis. HAB events were simulated with the FVCOM model and a virtual particle tracker model to evaluate the dynamics of bays and their relationship with HAB events. The results showed retention in bays during the relaxation conditions of upwelling and low connectivity between bays, which explains why almost no simultaneous events were recorded.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

840,pub.1173230666,10.1029/2023jd040255,,,Synchronous Tropical Andean Hydroclimate Variability During the Last Millennium,"Abstract The impact of latitudinal variations in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on northern Andean hydroclimate during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 950–1,150 CE) and Little Ice Age (LIA; 1,300–1,850 CE) is uncertain. Synthesis of two new lacustrine paleoclimate records from the Eastern Colombian Andes with existing circum‐Andean records shows that effective moisture anomalies were synchronous and in phase across the tropical Andes during the last millennium. During the MCA, when the ITCZ was shifted northward, topographically controlled responses in the northern Andes to vigorous atmospheric convection resulted in low precipitation and high evaporation, while precipitation was also reduced in the southern tropical Andes. During the LIA, precipitation decreased in the northern Andes as the ITCZ migrated southward but was offset by cooling that lowered evaporation, establishing high effective moisture. In the southern tropical Andes, the southward ITCZ position simultaneously strengthened precipitation, increasing effective moisture. MCA‐like responses to continued warming trends could similarly reduce northern Andean precipitation while increasing evaporation, thereby lowering effective moisture and possibly reducing water resource availability.
Plain Language Summary The position of the tropical rain belt has been proposed as a leading control on Andean hydroclimate during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 950–1,150 CE) and Little Ice Age (LIA; 1,300–1,850 CE), producing opposite hydroclimate conditions in the northern and southern tropical Andes. Using two new paleoclimate records from the eastern Colombian Andes and existing records from the northern and southern tropical Andes, we show that tropical Andean hydroclimate responses were similar, with generally warmer and drier conditions during the MCA and cooler and wetter conditions during the LIA. Whereas southern tropical Andean responses were in line with variations in the tropical rain belt, northern tropical Andean responses were not. For the northern Andes, we propose that slow‐moving, low‐energy convective precipitation during the MCA was blocked by the eastern Andes, resulting in reduced precipitation at elevation and in the interior Andes while warming increased evaporation. Wet conditions in the northern Andes during the LIA were the result of cool atmospheric temperatures that reduced evaporation and increased effective moisture despite low precipitation. This suggests topography and temperature played important roles in the northern Andean hydroclimate and that further warming could reduce effective moisture through topographic precipitation blocking and increased evaporation.
Key Points    Tropical Andean hydroclimate variability was synchronous and in‐phase between the northern and southern hemispheres during the last millennium   Orographic influences on atmospheric convection‐controlled precipitation in the northern tropical Andes during the last millennium   Mean annual temperatures controlled effective moisture in the northern tropical Andes vis‐à‐vis evaporation",Acknowledgments We thank Corpoboyacá and Felipe Velasco for their assistance with logistics and fieldwork at Lake Tota.

837,pub.1167784893,10.1016/j.neunet.2024.106122,38244356,,Bayesian DivideMix++ for Enhanced Learning with Noisy Labels,"Leveraging inexpensive and human intervention-based annotating methodologies, such as crowdsourcing and web crawling, often leads to datasets with noisy labels. Noisy labels can have a detrimental impact on the performance and generalization of deep neural networks. Robust models that are able to handle and mitigate the effect of these noisy labels are thus essential. In this work, we explore the open challenges of neural network memorization and uncertainty in creating robust learning algorithms with noisy labels. To overcome them, we propose a novel framework called ""Bayesian DivideMix++"" with two critical components: (i) DivideMix++, to enhance the robustness against memorization and (ii) Monte-Carlo MixMatch, which focuses on improving the effectiveness towards label uncertainty. DivideMix++ improves the pipeline by integrating the warm-up and augmentation pipeline with self-supervised pre-training and dedicated different data augmentations for loss analysis and backpropagation. Monte-Carlo MixMatch leverages uncertainty measurements to mitigate the influence of uncertain samples by reducing their weight in the data augmentation MixMatch step. We validate our proposed pipeline using four datasets encompassing various synthetic and real-world noise settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed pipeline using extensive experiments. Bayesian DivideMix++ outperforms the state-of-the-art models by considerable differences in all experiments. Our findings underscore the potential of leveraging these modifications to enhance the performance and generalization of deep neural networks in practical scenarios.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This study focuses on healthcare organisations' need for supply chain coordination to deliver quality services. Based on previous experiences in the literature, we examine the interrelatedness of elements such as updated technologies (technological innovations) in the form of e-business and medical solutions using the internet. Additionally, lean practices, human capital, and their impact on building an effective supply chain and, therefore, the delivery of quality services are examined. The study's objectives were to discuss and report through a detailed methodology the evaluation of critical hypotheses found during the literature review process, particularly applicable to the health sector in Colombia and Latin America. Initial findings from the structural equation modelling analysis show that the use of technologies has no impact on lean practices, quality of the service, and building an effective supply chain. This study shows the relevant role of human capital in delivering an effective supply chain when organisations implement technological innovations affecting service quality.",,,International Journal of Business Performance Management,,,,2024-07-02,2024,2024-07-02,2024,25,4,543-564,Closed,Article,"Santa, Ricardo; Ferrer, Mario; Calvo, Erick; Pinzon, Elisa; Cardona, Daniel; Pico, Sayda","Santa, Ricardo (School of Management, Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administración (CESA), Cll 35 No. 5A-31, Bogota, Colombia); Ferrer, Mario (Operations and Project Management Department, Alfaisal University, P.O.

Despite ongoing research in various countries, mental health exploration in Chile lags behind nations like the USA. Recognizing this gap, this study aims to address this disparity by analyzing subjective well-being and mental health levels within a Chilean prison setting in the postpandemic context.   Design/methodology/approach Design was nonexperimental, cross-sectional, descriptive and relational using quantitative techniques. Data was collected using Ryff and brief DASS-21 scales into three different sections of the studied prison. In total, 97 people participated. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis.   Findings Levels of subjective well-being range from mild to low, with best scores in environmental mastery and worst in autonomy. Women obtained best scores on purpose in life and positive relations with others. Mental health levels measured in terms of anxiety, depression and stress showed worst levels in males. A positive correlation was observed between mental health and substance use and between mental health and violence.   Research limitations/implications Answers depend on the victim's report, which is biased by its interpretation, along with fearing consequences from the answers and distrust in authorities. This can lead to altered (unrealistic) values in relation to substance use, violence suffered and levels of subjective well-being, among others. Another limitation is the number of participants of this study, along with the fact that it was carried out in only one penitentiary center in Chile.   Practical implications A challenge and a practical implication of this study is the need to do more work to promote mental health and well-being. Specifically, within this limited context where survey can send bias responses, a challenge is to work and promote mental health from a gender a perspective.   Social implications Results presented here also highlight the relevance of studying in depth prisoners’ mental health, considering gender differences across well-being and mental health variables. Moreover, it shows the importance and urgence to advance in respecting human rights, as democratic and diverse societies, and in terms of ethical aspects linked to research of this type in vulnerable populations like prisoners.   Originality/value This study contributes to the understanding on the intricated interplay between subjective well-being, mental health and various factors within prison environments, offering valuable insights for targeted interventions and policy considerations.","The authors acknowledge that this study was conducted thanks to Gendarmería Chile.

Cross-Cultural Validation of the Pornography Use Motivations Scale (PUMS) and Its Short Form (PUMS-8),"Motivations for pornography use may vary across gender identities, sexual orientations, and geographical regions, warranting examination to promote individual and public health. The aims of this study were to validate the Pornography Use Motivations Scale (PUMS) in a diverse, multicultural sample, and develop a short form (PUMS-8) that can assess a wide range of pornography use motivations. Using data from 42 countries (N = 75,117; Mage = 32.07; SDage = 12.37), enabled us to thoroughly evaluate the dimensionality, validity, and reliability of the Pornography Use Motivations Scale (PUMS), leading to the development of the more concise PUMS-8 short scale. Additionally, language-, nationality-, gender-, and sexual-orientation-based measurement invariance tests were conducted to test the comparability across groups. Both the PUMS and the PUMS-8 assess eight pornography use motivations, and both demonstrated excellent psychometric properties. Sexual Pleasure emerged as the most frequent motivation for pornography use across countries, genders, and sexual orientations, while differences were observed concerning other motivations (e.g. self-exploration was more prevalent among gender-diverse individuals than men or women). The motivational background of pornography use showed high similarity in the examined countries. Both the PUMS and the PUMS-8 are reliable and valid measurement tools to assess different types of motivations for pornography use across countries, genders, and sexual orientations. Both scales are recommended for use in research and clinical settings.","The authors would like to thank Anastasia Lucic for her help with project administration and data collection, and Natasha Zippan, Abu Bakkar Siddique, Anne-Marie Menard, Clara Marincowitz, Club Sexu, Critica, Digital Ethics Center (Skaitmeninės etikos centras), Día a Día, Ed Carty, El Siglo, Jakia Akter, Jayma Jannat Juma, Kamrun Nahar Momo, Kevin Zavaleta, Laraine Murray, L’Avenir de l’Artois, La Estrella de Panamá, La Voix du Nord, Le Parisien, Lithuanian National Radio and Television (Lietuvos nacionalinis radijas ir televizija), Mahfuzul Islam, Marjia Khan Trisha, Md.

Psidium guajava has been globally used for its antidiarrheal potential. We conducted a systematic review of scientific articles published up to the year 2021, which included in vivo pre-clinical tests and clinical trials involving patients with acute infectious diarrhea to verify the antidiarrheal, antibacterial and antispasmodic effects of galenic preparations or phytopharmaceuticals from P. guajava. PRISMA and Rayyan were used as tools for the selection of studies collected in four databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct). The keywords used to carry out the search were: 'Psidium guajava', 'guava', 'antidiarrhe*' and 'diarrhe*', joined by Boolean operators 'OR' or 'AND'. The characteristics of studies in animal models of acute diarrhea induction, as well as in vivo and in vitro motility and microbiological tests linked with its main pathophysiological mechanisms, were collected. Twenty-three articles were included. Twenty (87%) of these reported heterogenic preclinical studies, predominating pharmacological studies of efficacy against conventional antidiarrheal agents, which utilized relevant outcomes and models of infectious diarrhea from the top pathogens in the clinic along with classical castor oil-induced diarrhea associated with motility tests. Only three articles (13%) corresponded to clinical trials investigating the efficacy, dose and safety of these preparations. Most studies reported positive results and significant mechanistic evidence from antibacterial, anti-motility, anti-secretory and protective/anti-inflammatory perspectives. However, further studies are needed to define the clinical significance and safety treatment with P. guajava extracts. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.,,Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,,,,2024-04-24,2024,2024-04-24,2024-10,104,13,7731-7753,Closed,Article,"Garrido, Gabino; Garrido‐Suárez, Bárbara B.; Martínez‐Tapia, Nicolás; Valdés‐González, Marisela; Ortega‐Mardones, Andrea","Garrido, Gabino (Departamento de Ciencias Farmacéuticas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Garrido‐Suárez, Bárbara B.

802,pub.1166891311,10.1016/j.algal.2023.103359,,,Use of macroalgae as a nutritional supplement for sustainable production of ruminants: A systematic review and an insight on the Colombian Caribbean region,"Exploring alternative feed sources that reduce rumen methane production while improving livestock productivity is of importance because of rising global temperatures. Colombia is exposed to extreme climate changes and the consequences of these periods of climate change are drought, erosion, salinization, floods, sedimentation and alteration of ecosystems. As a result, the livestock industry experiences significant losses due to damaged feed and reduction in productivity and reproductivity of agricultural animals. The objective of this work is to determine the global bioprospective potential of macroalgae as nutritional supplements for ruminants and their potential application in the Colombian Caribbean area. For this, a quantitative and longitudinal documentary research design was used. An exploratory bibliographical review was carried out to explain the interactions between the variables applying the PRISMA protocol. The analysis of the changes in production variables of the ruminants supplemented with macroalgae was carried out by comparing the data of the treatment groups with their respective control groups in cattle, goats and sheep. For cattle, data by algal phylum showed that brown and red macroalgae increased average daily weight gain. Data by phylum and family of algae associated with milk production showed a positive impact of dietary supplementation with macroalgae on milk production, particularly with green and red algae. In the present study, it has been confirmed that red macroalgae is the best option to produce feed supplements for ruminants because they increase milk and meat production and show a statistically significant reduction in enteric methane production in cattle. For the Colombian Caribbean region, the red algae families Gigartinaceae and Gracilariaceae are recommended to produce feed supplements for ruminants because of their high prevalence in the marine habitats.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Jimena Bohorquez-Herrera reports financial support, administrative support, and article publishing charges were provided by University of Cartagena.

Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of construction and demolition wastes (CDW) in pavements. Within CDW, one material with great potential for use is recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The present study evaluated the mechanical performance of a hot-mix asphalt (HMA) that used RCA as a partial substitute for the coarse fraction of the natural aggregate – Nag (particle size retained on 1/2” and 1/2""+3/8” sieves). The substitution was performed in a conventional way by mass and also by volume. To evaluate the performance under monotonic loading, the stability/flow ratio (S/F) of the Marshall test and the Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) were measured on dry (ITSd) and conditioned (immersed in water, ITSw) samples. The tensile strength ratio (TSR) was calculated to evaluate the resistance to moisture damage. Under cyclic loading, tests of resilient modulus – RM (three temperatures and three loading frequencies), permanent deformation, and fatigue resistance under controlled-stress were performed. Cantabro tests were performed to measure the resistance to abrasive wear. Conventional characterization tests and imaging processing in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were carried out on particles of RCA and Nag. A Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) was performed with the results obtained. The general conclusions were as follows: (i) RCA increases the asphalt content in the mixes, however, volume substitution could help to decrease it; (ii) the mixes with RCA met the volumetric and strength parameters established by the Colombian specification (especially for roads with low traffic volumes); (iii) mixes with RCA undergo better mechanical performance in all tests performed, however, resistance to moisture damage may be compromised when dosing by volume and asphalt content decreases; (iv) substitution by mass or volume did not generate clear trends in the results, but better overall performance is reported in mixes dosed by volume. It is recommended to carry out more studies where Nag is replaced by RCA in volume.",,,Road Materials and Pavement Design,,,,2024-07-03,2024,2024-07-03,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-23,Closed,Article,"Sejin-Garces, Jorge Elias; Ahumada-Navarro, Galo; Rondón-Quintana, Hugo Alexander; Reyes-Lizcano, Fredy Alberto; Bastidas-Martínez, Juan Gabriel","Sejin-Garces, Jorge Elias (Facultad de Ingeniería, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Ahumada-Navarro, Galo (Facultad de Ingeniería, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Rondón-Quintana, Hugo Alexander (Facultad del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, Bogotá, Colombia); Reyes-Lizcano, Fredy Alberto (Facultad de Ingeniería, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia); Bastidas-Martínez, Juan Gabriel (Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Piloto de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia)","Rondón-Quintana, Hugo Alexander (District University of Bogotá)","Sejin-Garces, Jorge Elias (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Ahumada-Navarro, Galo (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Rondón-Quintana, Hugo Alexander (District University of Bogotá); Reyes-Lizcano, Fredy Alberto (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana); Bastidas-Martínez, Juan Gabriel (Pilot University of Colombia)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173555093,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The role of coping strategies mediating this relationship is of interest to better understand the mechanisms involved. The aim was to analyze the relationship between cannabis use and depression and its directionality, considering the mediating role of coping styles and their dependence on sex. Correlational and cross-sectional design. There were 261 cannabis users aged 18–57 years (M = 31.04), 36.66% women. Sex, cannabis dependence, coping styles, and depressive symptomatology were analyzed. Women scored higher in depression and men reported higher cannabis use, with a higher prevalence for moderate addiction. Higher severity of depressive symptomatology was found in cannabis users with dependence compared to those with moderate addiction. Active coping strategies were more common in the non-addicted group, while avoidant coping strategies were more common in the dependent group. The role of coping styles was observed to differ according to sex. In men, the relationship between depression and cannabis use was bidirectional, but the predictive capacity of each variable with respect to the others disappeared when considering avoidant coping as a mediator. Passive coping style is key in the relationship between depression and cannabis use.

Furthermore, it seeks to reveal if there is a moderating role played by gender in the relationship between CSR dimensions and CS in the realm of restaurant services.   Design/methodology/approach The findings of this research were obtained by analysing 352 questionnaires collected from Iranian restaurants. Structural equation modelling was used to test the conceptual model.   Findings According to this research, responsibility (economic, legal, ethical and environmental) is related to CS. Additionally, this study delves into the specific influence of each facet of CSR on CS, a departure from prior research which treated CSR as a singular entity. Consequently, the findings of this study offer clarity on which dimension of CSR can impact CS. Prior studies examining the correlation between CSR and CS typically encompassed various CSR aspects, including economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic dimensions, with the environmental dimension often subsumed under ethical CSR. This research, however, recognises environmental CSR as the fifth distinct dimension. The results of this research show that CS is directly and significantly influenced by all aspects of CSR (except philanthropy). Also, the findings of this research show that gender does not make a difference on the impact of different dimensions of CSR on CS.   Practical implications The findings of this study provide restaurant managers with a deeper understanding of CSR and how it can influence CS. The research demonstrates that environmental CSR had the strongest impact on Iranian CS among the five CSR dimensions investigated. The findings also support the notion that Iranian consumers are beginning to use CSR information to evaluate restaurants.   Originality/value This research represents an early exploration of how individual facets of CSR affect CS. As part of this investigation, Carroll’s initial model was modified to include a novel element, environmental responsibility, to address environmental concerns' growing importance. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that CSR activities are not all equally effective.",,,The TQM Journal,,,,2024-08-20,2024,2024-08-20,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,Closed,Article,"Omidvar, Mohammadsadegh; Palazzo, Maria","Omidvar, Mohammadsadegh (Kharazmi University, Tehran, Iran); Palazzo, Maria (Universitas Mercatorum, Rome, Italy)","Palazzo, Maria (Mercatorum University)","Omidvar, Mohammadsadegh (Kharazmi University); Palazzo, Maria (Mercatorum University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174858440,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

We found that migrants frequently prefer to stay within the informal economy as a way of preserving their identities, values and principles, rather than adopting those of their new country. This choice sets up ethical tensions for the migrants and their host countries. Our analysis challenges the current policy goals of transitioning migrants from informal to formal economies as a mark of success and inclusion. Instead, we attempt to recognize the migrant voice and their agency capacity through our research using focus groups and applied thematic analysis (ATA) of popular music and narratives. Our findings broaden the understanding of why migrants choose to stay in the informal economy and challenge policy goals that focus on inclusion and integration of migrants into formal economy.",,Partial financial support was received from CEIPA University for edition services.,International Migration,,,,2024-02-07,2024,2024-02-07,2024-04,62,2,110-134,Closed,Article,"Del Giudice, Oscar Naranjo; Kabadayi, Sertan","Del Giudice, Oscar Naranjo (School of Management, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia); Kabadayi, Sertan (Gabelli School of Business, Fordham University, New York, New York, USA)","Del Giudice, Oscar Naranjo (Universidad de Los Andes)","Del Giudice, Oscar Naranjo (Universidad de Los Andes); Kabadayi, Sertan (Fordham University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168629064,44 Human Society,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

EFs include planning, organizing, initiating, and monitoring actions, and have been found to improve with age due to the maturation of the brain, especially during childhood. Therefore, our correlational study sought to determine the relationship between the performance in executive functions and age in 79 children (36 girls, 45.6%) throughout development, between the ages of 6 and 12 (mean = 9.25; SD = 2.05), using a battery designed in Chile: BEFE (Batería de Evaluación de las Funciones Ejecutivas: Executive Function Assessment Battery) based on traditional neuropsychological tests to evaluate Working Memory, Inhibitory Control, Cognitive Flexibility, and Planning skills. Our results showed various correlations between the variables age and performance in various behavioral parameters, demonstrating an increase in the number of correct responses (positive correlation) and/or a decrease in errors (negative correlation) with age (6-12) in the subtests that correspond to dimensions of Cognitive Flexibility (Semantic and Phonological Fluency, Card Sorting Game, and Tracing Tasks), Inhibitory Control (ENA-F and Sentence Completion), Working Memory (Audio-verbal WM Forward and Ordering, and Visuospatial WM Forward and Backward), and Planning (La Portada de Antofagasta and FISA Maps). These results are consistent with previous empirical evidence and support the notion of a developmental relationship between EF performance and age. Additionally, this study contributes to understanding EF development in culturally specific contexts, highlighting the importance of contextually relevant assessment tools in evaluating cognitive development.","We want to thank Alejandra Saa, Romina Leal, Francheska Cataldo, and Andrea Olivos for their contribution to a previous design of subtests ENA-F-A and ENA-F-B, and Milan Domic for his artistic talent supporting us in creating and designing the stimuli of the test.

In addition, the potential of developed formulation was compared with marketed formulation via in vitro antifungal studies. CO-transferosomes were optimized and developed using design of experiment approach viz. 24 full-factorial design and employing four independent variables viz. ratio of edge activators viz. sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and tween 80, ratio of lipids viz. soya lecithin (SL), and cholesterol, ratio of solvent system i.e., chloroform and ethanol and volume of hydrating solvent viz. phosphate buffer saline PBS (pH 7.4). Rotary evaporation-sonication technique was used to formulate transferosomes. Particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential were three selected dependent variables. To comprehend the intricate interaction between the underlying variables and the outcome variables of the developed formulation, the response surface methodology suggested by Design Expert® was found to be desirable with a desirability value of 0.676. Based on desirability function, the optimized formulation was developed and characterized. The results of optimized formulation for particle size were found to be 124.2 ± 5.1 nm, PDI was 0.280 and a negative zeta potential value of −12.20 ± 6.49 mV. Furthermore, the drug entrapment efficiency was found to be 96.56 ± 0.08 % with a release of 95.67 ± 1.05 % at the end of 24h. The results of release kinetics displayed that the release followed Higuchi diffusion kinetics with highest regression coefficient, followed by zero order. Additionally, the formulation was evaluated for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes which revealed a wider zone of inhibition of 28.05 mm ± 0.86 as compared to the marketed formulation. The results of ex vivo skin permeation studies of CO-loaded transferosomes revealed high permeability of transferosomes with enhancement ratio of 2.2. Based on the promising results, it may be possible to treat athlete's foot with improved cutaneous distribution of ciclopirox olamine using transferosomes.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Previous research has found limited evidence on the prevalence of burnout in university students, in addition to the relationship between exhaustion behaviours and sleep quality. The social exchange theory (SET) is important for understanding how the various actors in that context behave and with what effect on their social exchanges, here, specifically, verifying academic burnout and its perception by students and institutions themselves. Research has not sufficiently addressed the examination of burnout and forms of coping in that context. The data for this study were collected during the 2023 academic year, through an online survey, from 311 Portuguese university students from different undergraduate courses, without children and without student‐worker status, aged between 18 and 38 (M = 21.58 and DP = 3.20). The results showed a high‐negative correlation between burnout and sleep quality in university students with a direct impact on academic performance (burnout rates and poor sleep quality are associated with low academic performance scores, regardless of the course attended). This research and its results make a contribution that directs the management of university and specifically of courses towards a greater awareness of the existence of burnout and well‐complied sleep schedules by students. Given the evidence that there is a deficit in sleep quality caused by burnout in university students, resilience in this context is one of the aspects that deserve further research, in order to prevent burnout, poor sleep quality, and consequently, control of academic grades.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was funded by national funds through FCT – Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Foundation for Science and Technology) – as part of the project CIP/UAL – Ref.

This comprehensive literature review (257 peer-reviewed publications) showed that both macrolitter (mostly plastics) and microplastics tend to accumulate on EP shorelines. Moreover, they were also reported in all the other compartments investigated: sea surface, water column, seafloor and 'others'. Mostly local, land-based sources (e.g., tourism, poor waste management) were identified across the region, especially at continental sites from low and mid latitudes. Some sea-based sources (e.g., fisheries, long-distance drifting) were also identified at high latitudes and on oceanic islands, likely enhanced by the oceanographic dynamics of the EP that affect transport of floating litter.

This reflects a shortcoming in our understanding of imperial tactics, as provincial site layouts were likely politically calculated. Here we present an architectural study of the Inka provincial capital of Turi, a well-preserved local population center in northern Chile co-opted for Inka imperial administration of the Atacama Desert area. We reevaluate layout planning at the site using concepts of building coordination and inter-site standardization to identify potentially planned features, and add to this a chronological study of surface architecture based upon wall-abutments and radiocarbon dates associated with a sample of building events. Results indicate significant Inka-era remodeling took the pre-existing site’s layout in a more coordinated and monumental direction, serving to increase site symmetry, reference political ideas through inter-site standardization, and focus greater attention upon Inka political buildings. Political buildings themselves grew more formalized and monumental over the course of the imperial occupation, culminating in the construction of a large kallanka state building near the end of the 15th century. Overall, we argue that layout remodeling was used to form increasingly strong architectural pronouncements of state legitimacy over time, and that moving past a ‘planned’ versus ‘unplanned’ conceptual binary will aid in gleaning more information from imperial sites in future research.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A qualitative study to explore how knowledge, environmental initiatives and economic viability affect sustainability","Purpose Circular supply chain management (CSCM) is considered a promising solution to attain sustainability in the current industrial system. Despite the exigency of this approach, its application in the food industry is a challenge because of the nature of the industry and CSCM being a novel approach. The purpose of this study is to develop an industry-based systematic analysis of CSCM by examining the challenges for its application, exploring the effects of recognised challenges on various food supply chain (FSC) stages and investigating the business processes as drivers.   Design/methodology/approach  Stakeholder theory guided the need to consider stakeholders’ views in this research and key stakeholders directly from the food circular supply chain were identified and interviewed ( n = 36) following qualitative methods.    Findings Overall, the study reveals that knowledge, perception towards environmental initiatives and economic viability are the major barriers to circular supply chain transition in the UK FSC.   Originality/value This research provides a holistic perspective analysing the loopholes in different stages of the supply chain and investigating the way a particular circular supply chain stage is affected by recognised challenges through stakeholder theory, which will be a contribution to designing management-level strategies. Reconceptualising this practice would be beneficial in bringing three-tier (economic, environmental and social) benefits and will be supportive to engage stakeholders in the sustainability agenda.",,,Qualitative Market Research An International Journal,,,,2024-04-05,2024,2024-04-05,2024-09-10,27,4,572-607,Closed,Article,"Kaur, Mandeep; Palazzo, Maria; Foroudi, Pantea","Kaur, Mandeep (School of Business and Creative Industries, University of the West of Scotland, Lanarkshire, UK); Palazzo, Maria (Department of Economics, Universitas Mercatorum, Rome, Italy); Foroudi, Pantea (Department of Marketing, Brunel University London, London, UK)","Palazzo, Maria (Mercatorum University)","Kaur, Mandeep (University of the West of Scotland); Palazzo, Maria (Mercatorum University); Foroudi, Pantea (Brunel University London)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170395498,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Our preferred empirical approach uses a triple difference design that leverages variation in the share of female students eligible for the program across municipalities and the fact that the introduction of SPP should not affect the education and fertility decisions of older women not targeted by the program. We find that after the introduction of SPP, fertility rates for women aged 15–19 years old decreased in more affected municipalities by about 6 percent relative to less affected municipalities. This effect accounts for approximately one-fourth of the overall decrease in teen fertility observed in the years following the program’s announcement. Our results suggest that increasing economic opportunities through expanding college access can contribute to lowering teen fertility rates.",,,Journal of Development Economics,,,,2024-10,2024,,2024-10,171,,103321,Closed,Article,"Bloem, Michael D.; Villero, Jesús","Bloem, Michael D.

A stable isotope study and its consequences for early human settlement","How did hunter-gatherers initially settle and move across extreme environments? We conducted a multi-disciplinary study to tackle this question, focusing on how Paleoindigenous populations inhabited the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. Particularly, we examined the stable isotopic values of ∼12,000–11,200-year-old camelid and rodent bones and hair samples retrieved from low-elevation archaeological sites (Pampa del Tamarugal basin - PdT, 800–1200 masl). By integrating novel and existing data into a regional stable isotope ecology, we offer a baseline for interpreting our results. δ 13C and δ 15N values on archaeological remains show animals with different geographical origins. A first group includes camelids and rodents with lower δ 15N values and δ 13C values indicating a dominantly C3 diet, corresponding to animals either local to the PdT or from the Andean Steppe, at least ∼80 km away and between 4000 and 4500 masl. Most of these remains, however, come from residential sites and belong to young camelids, indicating a local origin. A second group presents a higher δ 15N signal and δ 13C values indicative of a mixed C3–C4 based diet. These animals were not local but source to the Puna at least ∼60 km away between 3200 - 4000 masl. We hypothesize that the first would correspond to animals associated with hunter-gatherer bands settled around a wetland and grove environment in the PdT. The second group could correspond to remains brought by humans from the Puna to the PdT. Our results demonstrate that during the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene the Atacama was very different than today, supporting life that included large and mid-size game. These results also show that the core of the Atacama attracted animals and people and counters the notion of this ecosystem as a barren passageway from the Andes to the coast.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this research topic, a few studies have been published in recent years. Based on this motivation, this paper addressed a case-oriented two-dimensional cutting stock problem with variable-sized stocks of a carton box manufacturing company to determine optimal dimensions, production requirements, and the purchasing amounts of the corrugated boards. A novel mathematical programming model of the problem is first developed that formally defines the problem. Due to the complex nature of the proposed model and difficulties in its optimal solution, a matheuristic-based solution approach is also proposed. The proposed approach incorporates a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) into a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. By using the proposed matheuristic approach, the dimension values of the purchased corrugated boards are selected from the combinations of zero-waste dimensions of the demanded carton boxes and supplied at each iteration of the SA algorithm as inputs to MILP. Then, MILP is easily solved within reasonable computation times by making use of the Gurobi MIP solver in each SA iteration. The performance of the matheuristic approach is first tested on a real-life application study for the towel radiator box products of a manufacturing company in Turkey. Thereafter, a comprehensive computational study is also performed. Computational results have demonstrated that the proposed approach can generate promising results, which necessitate minimal stock diversity and impose minimum waste costs when compared to the existing cutting and purchasing plans of the company as well as the results of some greedy search heuristics embedded in the proposed MILP model.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

SSOPs are implemented in slaughterhouses to reduce or eliminate contamination during the slaughter stage. This work aimed to verify the microbiological effect of SSOP for washing beef carcasses, with pressurized (3 atm) and chlorinated (5 ppm) water from the hind to the front limb. In the forelimb region, groups of indicator microorganisms were quantified, and Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, pathotypes of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli non-0157, and Staphylococcus aureus with toxigenic potential were investigated in cattle carcasses slaughtered in northern Brazil before and after washing with SSOP. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in the quantification of enterobacteria, mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, E. coli, and S. aureus after washing with the SSOP. However, were detected Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic (ETEC) E. coli in the sampled carcass regions after washing. S. aureus, potentially producing enterotoxin D, was identified in two carcasses (6.66 %) before and after washing SSOP. Therefore, the SSOP may have spread contamination from other carcass areas to the forequarter region. Therefore, the processes, techniques, and SSOPs carried out at this stage must be reviewed, verified, and monitored to avoid the inclusion of pathogens that could compromise the microbiological safety of carcasses during the pre-washing stages.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Jose Carlos Ribeiro Junior reports financial support was provided by Federal University of the North of Tocantins.

In such systems, orders are delivered to customers from local distribution points respecting a delivery time promise. An important example is a restaurant meal delivery system, where delivery times are expected to be minutes after an order is placed. The system serves orders by making use of couriers that continuously perform pickups and deliveries. Operating such a rapid delivery system is very challenging, primarily because of the high service expectations and the considerable uncertainty in both demand and delivery capacity. Delivery providers typically plan courier shifts for an operating period based on a demand forecast. However, because of the high demand volatility, it may at times during the operating period be necessary to adjust and dynamically add couriers. We study the problem of dynamically adding courier capacity in a rapid delivery system and propose a deep reinforcement-learning approach to obtain a policy that balances the cost of adding couriers and the cost-of-service quality degradation because of insufficient delivery capacity. Specifically, we seek to ensure that a high fraction of orders is delivered on time with a small number of courier hours. A computational study in the meal delivery space shows that a learned policy outperforms policies representing current practice and demonstrates the potential of deep learning for solving operational problems in highly stochastic logistic settings.

Exploring the Role of Therapists in Client Change Processes: A Systemic Therapy Case Study,"This case study focuses on the therapeutic change process, highlighting the crucial role of therapists in facilitating it. Rooted in constructivist epistemology, we employed an integrative systemic model. Our exploration centers on the presence or absence of system restructuring within the therapeutic process. We delve into the differing perceptions of change between the therapist and the client, particularly regarding the criteria for therapy discharge. A significant aspect of our analysis is the discussion on the authenticity of change. We examine the dual role of therapists as expert observers and participants in the therapy, navigating between “objective” and subjective perspectives in their interventions. This includes assessing various levels of change, first and second order. We highlight the client’s autonomy in defining the reality and authenticity of change, advocating for a balance between the therapist’s guidance and the client’s agency. Additionally, we emphasize the therapist’s need for self-reflection and adherence to ethical practices. Our study contributes to systemic therapy literature by demonstrating the effective application of an integrative approach. It reinforces the importance of collaboration in therapeutic change, offering insights into how therapists can navigate complex therapeutic dynamics.",,,International Journal of Systemic Therapy,,,,2024-04-09,2024,2024-04-09,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-20,Closed,Article,"Marín-Medina, Jennifer; Véliz-García, Oscar; Domic-Siede, Marcos","Marín-Medina, Jennifer (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Véliz-García, Oscar (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Domic-Siede, Marcos (Escuela de Psicología, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)","Marín-Medina, Jennifer (Catholic University of the North)","Marín-Medina, Jennifer (Catholic University of the North); Véliz-García, Oscar (Catholic University of the North); Domic-Siede, Marcos (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170574464,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Thirteen studies were conducted in highly varied contexts, studying naturally happening phenomena, and focusing on a wide range of collective gatherings ( N = 2,260 participants). The results of factor analyses and a random-model meta-analysis strongly support the idea that group identification and emotional synchronization constitute two differentiated constructs that are systematically positively associated. At the aggregate level, results of multilevel models show that both group identification and emotional synchronization are significant predictors of key social-psychological variables.

Different industries are taking advantage of this nostalgia and using old-style packaging or old logos for marketing purposes. Consumers are addressed on an emotional level and this marketing model is successful with target groups with certain character traits. This article is intended to take a deep insight into character traits that are appealing to retro marketing. The work on retro marketing aims to investigate and analyse how and why retro marketing strategies affect consumers, and what are the main motivations behind buying retro products. The work also seeks to understand which age groups are most responsive to retro marketing campaigns, what role nostalgia plays in attracting consumers, and how retro brands and products are used to create an authentic image and emotional connection with customers. Therefore, research was conducted to determine the lifestyle of consumers of retro products and to understand the key factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The research aimed to identify specific patterns of behaviour, values and preferences of consumers who prefer retro products, as well as to investigate to what extent their lifestyle contributes to their preference for these products. The research also analysed how consumers perceive retro products - whether they perceive them as symbols of quality, authenticity or perhaps innovation in a contemporary context. The results of the research will provide insight into the demographic characteristics of consumers, their motives for shopping, and the role that retro products play in their everyday life and identity. Based on these insights, developing more precise marketing strategies adapted to target groups is possible.",,,MAP Social Sciences,,,,2024-09-25,2024,2024-09-25,2024-09-25,,,78-87,Closed,Article,"Vuković, Dijana; Untersweg, Tanja","Vuković, Dijana (University of the North); Untersweg, Tanja (University of Applies Sciences Burgenland)",,"Vuković, Dijana (University of the North); Untersweg, Tanja (University of Applies Sciences Burgenland)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1176004453,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3506 Marketing; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies",12 Responsible Consumption and Production
432,pub.1174842767,10.1287/trsc.2023.0196,,,The Online Shortest Path Problem: Learning Travel Times Using a Multiarmed Bandit Framework,"In the age of e-commerce, logistics companies often operate within extensive road networks without accurate knowledge of travel times for their specific fleet of vehicles. Moreover, millions of dollars are spent on routing services that fail to accurately capture the unique characteristics of the drivers and vehicles of the companies. In this work, we address the challenge faced by a logistic operator with limited travel time information, aiming to find the optimal expected shortest path between origin-destination pairs. We model this problem as an online shortest path problem, common to many last-mile routing settings; given a graph whose arcs’ travel times are stochastic and follow an unknown distribution, the objective is to find a vehicle route of minimum travel time from an origin to a destination. The planner progressively collects travel condition data as drivers complete their routes. Inspired by the combinatorial multiarmed bandit and kriging literature, we propose three methods with distinct features to effectively learn the optimal shortest path, highlighting the practical advantages of incorporating spatial correlation in the learning process. Our approach balances exploration (improving estimates for unexplored arcs) and exploitation (executing the minimum expected time path) using the Thompson sampling algorithm. In each iteration, our algorithm executes the path that minimizes the expected travel time based on data from a posterior distribution of the speeds of the arcs. We conduct a computational study comprising two settings: a set of four artificial instances and a real-life case study. The case study uses empirical data of taxis in the 17-km-radius area of the center of Beijing, encompassing Beijing’s “5th Ring Road.” In both settings, our algorithms demonstrate efficient and effective balancing of the exploration-exploitation trade-off.",,,Transportation Science,,,,2024-08-16,2024,2024-08-16,,,,,Closed,Article,"Lagos, Tomás; Auad, Ramón; Lagos, Felipe","Lagos, Tomás (Discipline of Business Analytics, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2000, Australia;); Auad, Ramón (Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile;); Lagos, Felipe (Faculty of Engineering and Sciences, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago de Chile 7941169, Chile)",,"Lagos, Tomás (The University of Sydney); Auad, Ramón (Catholic University of the North); Lagos, Felipe (Adolfo Ibáñez University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174842767,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

However, studies in chronic and intermittent hypobaric or normobaric hypoxia similar to described in miner’s population are scares o absent. In regards with this we propose evaluated the effect of chronic intermittent normobaric hypoxia (CINH) on the hematological, cardiovascular response and expression of lymphocyte’s cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-2, IL6 and IL-10 in rats. A total of 20 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in two groups: a) CINH of FiO 2 10% (n=10) and normoxic rats (n=10) were used as controls. Blood samples were obtained from both groups for hematological studies, systolic arterial pressure and heart rate was measured in tail-cuff sensor, and expression of cytokines obtained from lymphocytes was determined by RT-PCR. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count and hematological constant are elevated however leucocyte count decrease. A significant increase of systolic arterial pressure (over 50%). In vitro expression of cytokines from lymphocytes shown that IL-10, IL-2 and IL6 increase 35%, 64% and 16% respectively, while that of IL-1bdecreases by 18%. CINH could be activate an inflammatory response mediated by IL-2, however this response could be attenuated due to the increase in the expression of IL-10, a known anti-inflammatory cytokine, and the decrease in the expression of IL-1β and IL6 suggesting a mechanism of adaptation to CINH.

Scallop production is the third largest aquaculture industry in Chile, with annual landings of 11,313 metric tons in 2019. Industrial and small-scale farming are geographically located in the north of the country. For the first time, private actions and economic policy that enabled the evolution of the scallop industry in Chile from 1980 to 2022 are presented. As an object of study, the scallop industry allows us to address the economic expansion of the aquaculture production sector through an analysis of the economic factors of production: land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurial skills. For the analysis, a detailed historical account of environmental, technological, economic, and governance developments is presented. A retrospective examination of the history of the scallop industry identifies the decisions made by public and private actors to improve the economic factors of production and assesses the effects of the decisions made over time. The current decline in production presents an opportunity to discuss the implications of each economic factor of production in this industry to revitalised it.

Our previous study found that carvacrol (CVR) can inhibit the growth of Alternaria alternata by interfering with the accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides. To gain a deeper understanding of how CVR affects saccharide accumulation in A. alternata, this study analyzed changes in the carbohydrate content of the fungi. The results showed that CVR reduced the cell wall thickness, chitin and β-1,3-glucan distribution, glycogen accumulation, and the total sugar, trehalose, mannose, fructose, and galactose contents in A. alternata. Further transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that CVR treatment accelerated the decomposition of cell wall polysaccharides in the fungi, hindered sucrose consumption, disrupted the glycolysis pathway, and promoted the decomposition of carbohydrates related to stress resistance. Meanwhile, the results of quantitative real-time PCR were consistent with the above findings. In addition, the results of the carbon source culture showed that CVR treatment improved the utilization ability of A. alternata in cellulose and starch while inhibiting the utilization of pectin and sucrose. These results indicate that CVR affects carbohydrate metabolism, which is associated with A. alternata growth, infection, and stress resistance of A. alternata.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Nevertheless, this analysis has not been made using South-south migration communities. Thus, this study analyzed the individual predictors of the attitudes toward immigrants from Perú and Venezuela in a Chilean sample, controlling supra-individual variables. We used available data (N total = 956, composed of 599 and 357 for Peruvians and Venezuelans, respectively), considering seven predictors and three types of intergroup attitudes. The main results indicated that contact quality, similarity and social dominance orientation were related to almost all types of attitudes (symbolic threat, realistic threat and liking) toward both immigrant populations, except that similarity and dominance orientation were not associated with realistic threats and liking toward Venezuelans, respectively. The rest of the predictors, contact quantity, generalized trust, political orientation, and right-wing authoritarianism explained three or fewer types of attitudes toward both immigrant communities. We speculated about the reasons why contact quality, similarity and social dominance orientation were associated with more types of attitudes than the rest of the predictors, and the present model’s robustness.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors have no interest conflicts to declare.

Here, we report CdS thin film on silicon and glass substrates through direct current(dc) magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of air-annealing on deposited thin films & its impact on morphological and optoelectrical characteristics of CdS thin films have been explored in this study. The sputtered CdS thin films were characterized using the scanning electron microscopy(SEM), atomic force microscopy(AFM), diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer and solar simulator system. FESEM images show the uniform, homogeneous and crack free grain, AFM topography exhibits the roughness increases with increasing air-annealing. EDS spectra confirm the elemental composition of Cd and S in deposited thin film. The optical analysis showed the reduction of energy gap from 2.36 eV to 2.29 eV and the estimated Urbach tail increases with increasing air-annealing. Moreover, the complex reflective index, dielectric constant, tangent loss, volume energy & surface energy loss studies were effectively influenced by the air-annealing conditions. The impact of air-annealing on the performance of Ag/Ni:CdS/Si/Al photodetectors are analyzed through I–V measurement at room temperature. The detector parameters such as responsivity (R) detectivity (D*) snd quantum efficiency have been estimated and discussed in detail. Here the responsivity and detectivity decreases and quantum efficiency increases with increasing air-annealing. The responsivity, and detectivity of CdS film are in the range of 0.42 and 0.46 AW-1 and 2.58 × 1011 to 4.09 × 1011Jones, respectively. The effect of the air-annealing was noticeable and obviously improved the detection parameters of the designed photodetectors device.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

425,pub.1170765289,10.1007/s11433-023-2332-5,,,Driving factors behind multiple populations,"Star clusters were historically considered simple stellar populations, with all stars sharing the same age and initial chemical composition. However, the presence of chemical anomalies in globular clusters (GCs), called multiple stellar populations (MPs), has challenged star formation theories in dense environments. Literature studies show that mass, metallicity, and age are likely controlling parameters for the manifestation of MPs. Identifying the limit between clusters with/without MPs in physical parameter space is crucial to reveal the driving mechanism behind their presence. In this study, we look for MP signals in Whiting 1, which is traditionally considered a young GC. Using the Magellan telescope, we obtained low-resolution spectra within λλ = 3850–5500 Å for eight giants of Whiting 1. We measured the C and N abundances from the CN and CH spectral indices. C and N abundances have variations comparable with their measurement errors (∼ 0.1 dex), suggesting that MPs are absent from Whiting 1. Combining these findings with literature studies, we propose a limit in the metallicity vs. cluster compactness index parameter space, which relatively clearly separates star clusters with/without MPs (GCs/open clusters). This limit is physically motivated. On a larger scale, the galactic environment determines cluster compactness and metallicity, leading to metal-rich, diffuse, old clusters formed ex situ. Our proposed limit also impacts our understanding of the formation of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy: star clusters formed after the first starburst (age≲ 8–10 Gyr). These clusters are simple stellar populations because the enriched galactic environment is no longer suitable for MP formation.",,,"Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy",,,,2024-04-12,2024,2024-04-12,2024-05,67,5,259513,Closed,Article,"Huang, Ruoyun; Tang, Baitian; Li, Chengyuan; Geisler, Doug; Mateo, Mario; Song, Ying-Yi; Baumgardt, Holger; Carballo-Bello, Julio A.; Wang, Yue; Nie, Jundan; Dias, Bruno; Fernández-Trincado, José G.","Huang, Ruoyun (School of Physics and Astronomy, Sun Yat-sen University, 519082, Zhuhai, China; CSST Science Center for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, 519082, Zhuhai, China); Tang, Baitian (School of Physics and Astronomy, Sun Yat-sen University, 519082, Zhuhai, China; CSST Science Center for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, 519082, Zhuhai, China); Li, Chengyuan (School of Physics and Astronomy, Sun Yat-sen University, 519082, Zhuhai, China; CSST Science Center for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, 519082, Zhuhai, China); Geisler, Doug (Departamento de Astronomía, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; Instituto de Investigación Multidisciplinario en Ciencia y Tecnología, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile; Departamento de Astronomía, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile); Mateo, Mario (Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan, 48109, Ann Arbor, USA); Song, Ying-Yi (David A.

425,pub.1170315490,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.740906,,,Impacts of climate-driven upwelling intensification on the microbiota and health of cultivated scallops,"The scallop Argopecten purpuratus plays a pivotal role as an economic resource cultivated in regions where climate change may intensify the coastal upwelling. This process has the potential to impact host-microbiota interactions. Hence, we conducted a field study to investigate the effects of varying upwelling intensities on hemolymph and gill microbiota dynamics (utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing), as well as the pathological state of A. purpuratus maintained in culture systems. Helicobactereaceae and Arcobactereaceae emerged as the prevailing families within both the hemolymph and gills. In contrast to the period of weak upwelling, the phase characterized by intensified upwelling revealed notable shifts in the abundance of bacterial community members, thereby leading to implications for the functional potential of the hemolymph microbiota. Notably, environmental factors played a substantial role in shaping the microbial community, accounting for 82–96% of the observed variation. Among these factors, wind, oxygen, and temperature exerted the most influence. During intensified upwelling, the abundance of Arcobactereaceae increased from 27% to 36% within gills and from 43% to 55% within hemolymph. Conversely, Helicobactereaceae decreased, particularly within gills, from 15% to 8% during the same period. Significantly, bacteria with fermentation capabilities, such as Colwellia, along with those involved in sulfur cycle processes, such as Arcobactereaceae, Desulfobulbaceae, and Desulfobacteraceae, exhibited an elevated representation during the period of intensified upwelling. This suggests potential nutritional advantages for A. purpuratus. However, the intense upwelling phase also saw an overrepresentation of potentially pathogenic bacteria for mollusks, including Francisella halioticida, Vibrio, and Photobacterium. Moreover, histopathological examination revealed heightened hemocytic infiltration, the presence of granulomatous “swirl” lesions, and a potential Apicomplexan parasite during this intensified upwelling period. These findings underscore the importance of the adaptability of host-microbiota interactions and the potential risks of pathogenicity for cultivated A. purpuratus within the context of ongoing and future environmental changes. Therefore, continuous monitoring of pathogen emergence and immune status evaluation during intensified upwelling periods are crucial for successful A. purpuratus aquaculture.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Postdoctoral FONDECYT #3220568 grant, and by ANID-CENTROS-REGIONALES R20F0008 grant.",Aquaculture,,,,2024-07,2024,,2024-07,588,,740906,Closed,Article,"González, Roxana; Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos; Lohrmann, Karin B.; Rojas, Rosanna; Mercado, Ana; Lira, Germán; Brokordt, Katherina","González, Roxana (Laboratorio de Fisiología y Genética Marina (FIGEMA), Departamento de Acuicultura, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile); Henríquez-Castillo, Carlos (Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Alba, Av.

Materials and Methods: 16 subjects without experience to altitudes over 1500 m (9 women/7 men) and 39 subjects acclimatized workers to CIHH at high altitude (5050 m, 9 women/32 men) were recruited. Normobaric hypoxia were performed in 3 steps: 5 min breathing ambient air, 20 min breathing hypoxic air (11,5% O 2 , equivalent to 5050 m) and 5 min of recovery breathing ambient air. CIHH condition represents a normal exposure characterized by 8 days working at high altitude and 6 days resting at low altitude (<1500 m). Subjects were evaluated at sea level and 5-6 th day of exposure to CIHH at 5050 m. In each condition, Hemoglobin concentration (Hb), Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), Methemoglobin (MetHb), Pulse oximetry (SPO 2 ), heart rate (HR) were measured using a transcutaneous sensor (Rad 67 pulse Co-Oximeter, Masimo). Results: In evaluations performed at sea level, both groups of hypoxia (normobaric and CIHH) exhibited a lower hemoglobin concentration in women in comparison with men. During exposure to simulated hypoxia, a significative increase in hemoglobin concentration was showed, associated to decrease in SpO 2 and increase in HR. However, an increased level of MetHb in women and men and only increased level of COHb in women were observed. During hypobaric exposure, Hb concentration increased, with reduced SpO 2 , and increased HR in comparison to sea level. Lower HR was observed in men respect of women. Lower level of COHb was observed in men respect of women. In addition, in women was observed an increase of level COHb related with time of exposure, in contrast, a tendency to reduction in level of COHb and MetHb in men was observed. Conclusion: The use of transcutaneous sensor to measure SpO 2 and Hb showed an increase in hemoglobin concentration in normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia, in agreement with previous results from our laboratory. In addition, we reported new information about level of COHb and MetHb in two different model of exposure simulated hypoxia and hypobaric hypoxia at extreme altitude.  SUSESO ACHS 279-2022.

Fluvial landforms and sedimentary deposits serve as essential records for studying the long-term dynamics of fluvial systems in response to external factors such as tectonic and climatic influences. The study area, located in the Andean Mountain range, is highly sensitive to hydrodynamic changes and sediment transport processes, making it suitable for studying fluvial dynamics and their relationship to climate fluctuations over millennia. In particular, the transitional semi-arid conditions of this region provide an opportunity to link Holocene fluvial sediments to climatic shifts. This study presents the analysis of well-preserved sedimentary deposits that outcrop along the valley walls, including grain-size distribution, stratigraphy, geochemical composition and radiocarbon dating to establish the chronological context. Facies association analysis, along with geochemical data, allowed the interpretation of depositional sub-environments and their evolution through time. We interpret the Holocene sedimentary evolution for the Turbio River valley as six time periods that reflect shifts in sediment source, energy regime, flow types, and sedimentary processes linked to fluctuations between wet and dry climatic conditions. The sedimentary sequence is interpreted as reflecting an initial high-energy period with continuous surface runoff followed by two periods of formation of extensive lakes, likely separated by periods of runoff intensification. The later part of the sequence reflects a more stable fluvial landscape that led to the excavation of the sedimentary fill. This sedimentary record provides valuable insights into past climate variations and their impact on the hydrodynamic conditions of the fluvial system in the region. Comparisons with other regional records support a broader understanding of climate change in the semi-arid Andes of Chile.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Consequently, the implementation of more osmosis reverse desalination plants in central-northern Chile has been promoted, but the consequences of brine discharges on local organisms are largely unknown. The Chilean abalone (Concholepas concholepas) represent the most economically important marine resource exploited along the Chilean coast. In this study, newly hatched larvae of C. concholepas were used to investigate the effects of brine discharges of a reverse osmosis desalination plant on coastal organisms. Under laboratory conditions, larvae were exposed to various dilutions of a brine to assess the consequences on lethal (survival) and sublethal (swimming performance and metabolism) traits. The results indicated that brine discharges had no effects on larval survival. However, undiluted brines (ca. 56 PSU) and salinities above 38 PSU led to increased metabolic rates and a reduction in the swimming performance of the larvae. We suggest mitigating the negative effects of brines on newly hatched C. concholepas larvae by situating discharge points in highly hydrodynamic zones or as far as possible from mating and larval hatching areas. Additionally, we recommended using diffusers to enhance mixing and dilute brine to sub-lethal levels (below 48 PSU).","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

However, there is no information on its cross-cultural utility. Thus, this study assessed the measurement invariance of the GIS using a large sample of bereaved adults ( N = 2060) from Peru, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Colombia. Specifically, we employed two measurement invariance techniques: multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) and the alignment optimization method. The results indicated that the GIS demonstrated configural and metric invariance, but not scalar invariance through MG-CFA. The alignment optimization method indicated the presence of an approximate invariance. Therefore, the results suggest that the GIS measures grief-related impairment similarly across the four Latin American countries. Among the countries examined, Peru reported the highest average score on the GIS and had the highest percentage of cases at risk for clinically relevant functional impairment due to grief (6.2%). These findings support the cross-cultural validity of the GIS and lay the foundation for future comparisons.",,,Illness Crisis & Loss,,,,2024-08-01,2024,2024-08-01,,,,,Closed,Article,"Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Lee, Sherman A.; Yupanqui-Lorenzo, Daniel E.; Ventura-León, José; Vilca, Lindsey W.; Baños-Chaparro, Jonatan; Valencia, Pablo D.; Carbajal-León, Carlos; Travezaño-Cabrera, Aaron; Torales, Julio; Barrios, Iván; Lobos-Rivera, Marlon Elías; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Sánchez-Villena, Andy Rick; Oré-Kovacs, Nicole; Moreta-Herrera, Rodrigo; Puerta-Cortés, Diana Ximena","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás (Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Científica del Sur, Lima, Perú); Lee, Sherman A.

Herein, we targeted phosphodiesterase 7A (PDE7A) in EOC cells, based on data derived from RNA-sequencing assays comparing high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and fallopian tube samples. Methods: To understand the role of PDE inhibition, we evaluated the effects of its inhibitor BRL50481 alone or in combination with paclitaxel (PTX) on untreated A2780 EOC cells and multi-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) OVCAR3 cells. To do so, we pursued with the: validation of data obtained by high throughput RNA sequencing assays using qRT-PCR; evaluation of PDE7 expression in normal and EOC cells, as well as in normal Fallopian tube cells by qRT-PCR; immunoblotting; metabolic cell viability (MCV) by MTT assays; cytokine dosage by qRT-PCR and ELISA; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; statistical analysis (GraphPad software). Results: Drug-sensitive A2780 cells, but not OVCAR3 cells, exhibited lower MCV when treated with the PDE7 inhibitor; however, the combinatory therapy decreased MCV in both cell lines. Of clinical relevance, pre-treatment of A2780 and OVCAR3 with the PDE7 inhibitor BRL50481 followed by PTX lowered its IC50 by 103- and 625-fold, respectively. While the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B(AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was inhibited in both cell lines, the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 Associated X-protein (BAX) was overexpressed in A2780 cells only. Analysis of mRNA and protein expression in OVCAR3 pretreated with BRL50481 showed a 2-fold increase in IL-6 cytokine expression. Pre-treatment of OVCAR3 with BRL50481 followed by the combination of BRL50481 and PTX inhibited the expression of vimentin and Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) by 2-fold. BRL50481 promoted changes in EOC cells morphology and mitochondrial cristae. Conclusions: Altogether, our data led us to postulate that inhibition of PDE7 in EOC cells, specifically in those presenting the chemoresistant phenotype, is a promising strategy to fight this yet highly lethal disease.

As a result, an estimated 300–500 million people are at risk of severe health impacts and premature mortality. In this Review, we discuss the sources, occurrences and cycling of arsenic, fluoride, selenium and uranium, which are GGCs with widespread distribution and/or high toxicity. The global distribution of GGCs is controlled by basin geology and tectonics, with GGC enrichment in both orogenic systems and cratonic basement rocks. This regional distribution is broadly influenced by climate, geomorphology and hydrogeochemical evolution along groundwater flow paths. GGC distribution is locally heterogeneous and affected by in situ lithology, groundwater flow and water–rock interactions. Local biogeochemical cycling also determines GGC concentrations, as arsenic, selenium and uranium mobilizations are strongly redox-dependent. Increasing groundwater extraction and land-use changes are likely to modify GGC distribution and extent, potentially exacerbating human exposure to GGCs, but the net impact of these activities is unknown. Integration of science, policy, community involvement programmes and technological interventions is needed to manage GGC-enriched groundwater and ensure equitable access to clean water.","A.M. acknowledges the time and resources obtained from the project DST/TMD-EWO/WTI/2K19/EWFH/2019/201 (G) &amp; (C) dated 28.10.2020 for authoring the manuscript.

405,pub.1170050730,10.1158/1538-7445.am2024-6158,,,Abstract 6158: Tumor genomic heterogeneity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from Latin America,"Abstract Motivation: Life prospects of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have greatly improved over the last decades with the adoption of tumor genomic profiling. A better understanding of the mutational landscape has allowed for a more precise molecular characterization and the development of more effective treatment alternatives. However, tumors present a widespread heterogeneity, and many challenges remain to fully comprehend the influencing factors. Of particular importance is the Latin America population which i) is commonly underrepresented in clinical trials and large-scale epidemiological studies, ii) presents higher incidence and mortality rates in comparison to the developed world, and iii) is constituted by a genetically admixed population. Our research attempts to close this gap by investigating the interplay between sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, and the effect these exert on the mutational profiles of Latin-American NSCLC patients. Methodology: The study population is derived from the NIRVANA study, a cross-sectional multicenter observational study aiming to characterize and validate molecular diagnostic technologies for NSCLC patients in Chile, Brazil, and Peru. Between July 2015 to October 2018, 5030 NSCLC patients were recruited from 37 centers, meeting inclusion criteria of age ≥18, histologically or cytological proven NSCLC diagnostic, and naïve treatment. Exclusion criteria included prior chemotherapy treatment and refusal to give informed consent. Primary or metastatic NSCLC samples were collected during standard of care biopsy and processed for the DNA and RNA isolation. Next Generation Sequencing (NSG) genomics profiles were obtained using the Oncomine Focus Assay (OFA). Covariates of interest, including sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, were assessed at enrollment. QC-approved genomic profiles were obtained for 1864 participants. Results and Conclusions: The prevalence of mutations and fusions in the eight most relevant NSCLC genes (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, MET, RET, BRAF, ROS1 and ERBB2) varies based on sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics. Clear distinctions emerged in the prevalence of EGFR, KRAS and ERBB2 mutations among the three countries (EGFR: 20.9%, 17.6%, 35.3%; KRAS: 21.8%, 15.6%, 10.3%; ERBB2: 2.8%, 3.3%, 4.4% for Brazil, Chile, and Peru, respectively). Furthermore, distinct association patterns were identified between the prevalence of genetic alterations and the studied factors, with attributes such as sex, tobacco use and ethnicity mostly influencing the occurrence of EGFR, ALK and ROS1 alterations. These findings provide novel insights into NSCLC studies among Latin-American patients, potentially serving as guidelines for more tailored strategies in the overall management of this underrepresented population.

390,pub.1175514142,10.2139/ssrn.4930941,,,Decolonial Constitutionalism,"The American Declaration of Independence kindled the first successful decolonial movement in the modern world, culminating in the enactment of the United States Constitution. From colony to sovereign state to Great Power, the United States modeled for subordinated peoples abroad how to launch and win their own battles for sovereignty. Since the end of the Second World War, however, America’s eighteenth-century precedent of revolutionary self-determination is no longer the prevailing path to decolonization. The traditional warmaking toolkit for winning independence—revolution, illegality, and violence—has been replaced by more orderly tactics consonant with the rule of law. Evolution, lawfulness, and continuity are the touchstones in the new global model of decolonial constitutionalism that now lights the path to self-determination. Decolonial constitutionalism is the use of legal, legitimate, and non-violent means to assert sovereignty, to secure rights, or to achieve recognition for a people, nation, or state that is legally or politically subordinate to domestic or foreign actors. In contrast to the American model of revolutionary self-determination, this new global model of decolonial constitutionalism has pluralized actors and sites of contestation, though the decisive objective of decolonization remains the same. Once won in the theatre of war, decolonization is now prosecuted in parliaments, courts of law, and the public square. The protagonists are no longer soldiers and generals; they are politicians, lawyers, judges, and civil society. Nor does self-determination today necessarily entail establishing a new state in the international order and taking a seat among equals alongside the countries of the world. In our new era of non-violent claims to sovereignty, decolonial movements choose instead to write new constitutions for existing states, to amend enduring constitutions, to enforce treaty rights, to promulgate multilateral agreements, or to pursue analogous courses of disruptive constitutional activity well short of declarations of independence. Decolonial constitutionalism therefore refers to a suite of strategies to exercise self-determination, defined expansively to comprise a broad scope of decolonial objectives consistent with the rule of law.In this Article, I introduce, illustrate, and theorize decolonial constitutionalism as the modern form of self-determination. Drawing from historical and modern decolonial movements, I show how subordinated peoples have seized the levers of law and politics to innovate new paths to self-determination without taking up arms, in the process showing similarly situated peoples how to achieve their own goals of independence, nationhood, or constitution-making in a manner that reinforces rather than undermines the rule of law. These strategies have proven ultimately more productive for decolonial movements to free their peoples from bondage in law or politics, to attract ideologically aligned partners at home and abroad, and to more effectively communicate to internal and external audiences the moral legitimacy of their claims to self-determination.",,,,,,,2024-08,2024,,,,,,Closed,Article,"Albert, Richard","Albert, Richard (University of Texas at Austin - School of Law; University of Texas at Austin - Department of Government; Université Paris II - Panthéon-Assas; Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo; Universidad Externado de Colombia - Facultad de Derecho; São Paulo Law School of Fundação Getulio Vargas FGV DIREITO SP; University of Toronto - Faculty of Law; University of Ottawa - Faculty of Law; Reichman University - Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliyah - Harry Radziner School of Law; Airlangga University; Yale University; Maharashtra National Law University Mumbai)",,"Albert, Richard (University of Texas at Austin - School of Law; University of Texas at Austin - Department of Government; Université Paris II - Panthéon-Assas; Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo; Universidad Externado de Colombia - Facultad de Derecho; São Paulo Law School of Fundação Getulio Vargas FGV DIREITO SP; University of Toronto - Faculty of Law; University of Ottawa - Faculty of Law; Reichman University - Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliyah - Harry Radziner School of Law; Airlangga University; Yale University; Maharashtra National Law University Mumbai)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175514142,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The XRD patterns are used to calculate the grain size of NiOx film, which increases with increasing thickness. Fractal dimensions were estimated from the power spectral density (PSD) algorithm using AFM images. The band gaps were calculated from recorded transmission spectra, showing the reduction of band gap from 3.88 eV to 3.67 eV with increasing grain size. The effect of grain size on the performance of Ag/p-NiOx/n-Si/Al-based Schottky-diodes are analyzed through I-V measurement. The diode parameters of the designed device were calculated using the thermionic emission, Norde, and Cheung models. It is found that the reduction of barrier height of the Schottky diode from 0.95 eV to 0.84 eV with increasing grain size of NiOx films. It is found that the grain size of film strongly impacted on the diode parameters, such as ideality factor ( η ), potential barrier ( φ h ), series resistance (Rs) performance.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

338,pub.1175889325,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.09.260,,,Enhanced hydrogen evolution performance of twinned Mn0.65Cd0.35S with Zn-doped cadmium selenide under visible light irradiation,"The cadmium manganese sulfide, despite being recognized as a highly efficient photocatalytic semiconductor for hydrogen evolution, faces significant challenges in terms of charge recombination when used solely as a catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The construction of heterojunction photocatalysts is regarded as one of the effective strategies to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this work, Zn-doped CdSe was adopted to enhance the photocatalytic active sites of the twinned Mn0.65Cd0.35S. As results, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Zn–CdSe-1/T-MCS-40 can reach approximately 47447.15 μmol g−1 after 5 h, representing a 15 times increase compared to Mn0.65Cd0.35S. Besides, the hydrogen evolution rate shows almost no significant attenuation after four consecutive cycles (20 h). The significant achievement can be largely attributed to the successful construction of an S-scheme heterojunction of Zn–CdSe-1/T-MCS-40, which effectively minimized the charge transfer distance and suppressed the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Additionally, the incorporation of Zn-doped CdSe significantly expands the response range to visible light, thereby providing a conceptual framework for advancing the design of solar-to-chemical energy conversion and effectively guiding the fabrication of metal sulfide-based photocatalytic heterojunctions.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Adjusting the energy band structure of photocatalyst is one of the means to design efficient and stable photocatalyst. In this work, the bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) was sulfurized. It is worth noting that the process of vulcanizing NiFe-PBA (NF) into NiFe-PBA-S (NFS) has an adjustment effect on the energy band structure. NFS and graphdiyne (GDY) are combined to form NFS/GDY composite catalyst with S-scheme heterojunction, NFS/GDY has the best photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 2847.86 μmol h-1 g-1. The analysis of XPS test, in-situ XPS test and Mott-Schottky test further shows that the regulation of energy band structure accelerate the electron transport and provide sufficient active sites of surface.

Operations of refineries in local neighborhoods often lead to adverse impacts on the surrounding community and environment. However, PRI projects also yield positive effects on local, national, and international economies. Mitigating the negative consequences of refinery operations necessitates a scientific and quantitative approach to selecting refinery locations. This process should consider a multitude of parameters and alternatives, encompassing social and environmental resiliency, transportation factors, and product markets throughout the refinery life cycle, in an integrated manner. Quantifying the impact of these parameters on the triple bottom line is essential for informed decision-making. In this study, we employ a previously developed integrated sustainability assessment framework in conjunction with a Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) based scenario model to evaluate the impact of various location alternatives on the three pillars of sustainability.

However, the catalytic performance of single ZnCr LDHs is limited by the feeble dynamics. Herein, the 2D/3D S-scheme heterojunction ZnCr LDHs/ZIF-67 was coupled together by moderate electrostatic self-assembly to block the recombination of photogenerated charges on single ZnCr LDHs. Thanks to the successful formation of S-scheme heterojunction, the prepared ZZC-25 heterojunction presents a high hydrogen evolution of about 3.0 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 308.34 times and 4.82 times higher than that of ZnCr LDHs and ZIF-67, respectively. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of an S-scheme heterojunction serves as an effective strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of a single wide spectrum semiconductor. The present study offers experimental guidance for the efficient separation of photo-generated carriers in LDHs-based wide-spectrum semiconductors.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A total order that extends a given partial order is called an admissible order and a preorder that arises by mapping elements of a non-empty set into a poset is called an h-order or reduced order. In practice, one often considers a discrete setting, i.e., admissible orders and h-orders on the class of non-empty, closed subintervals of a finite set L n = { 0 , 1 , . . . . , n } . We denote the latter using the symbol I n ⁎ . Admissible orders and h-orders on I n ⁎ can be generated by the function that maps each interval x = [ x _ , x ‾ ] ∈ I n ⁎ to the convex combination K α ( x ) = ( 1 − α ) x _ + α x ‾ of its left and right endpoints. In this paper, we determine a set consisting of a finite number of relevant α's in [ 0 , 1 ] that generate different h-orders on I n ⁎ . For every n ∈ N , this set allows us to construct the families of all h-orders and admissible orders on I n ⁎ that are determined by some convex combination. We also provide formulas for the cardinalities of these families in terms of Euler's totient function.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

324,pub.1172117035,10.1002/cae.22767,,,Predictive modeling of on‐time graduation in computing engineering programs: A case study from Northern Chile,"Abstract In the ever‐evolving landscape of 21st‐century education, this research seeks to understand the challenges of on‐time graduation for students in two related computing majors. In particular, we focus on the Universidad Católica del Norte computing engineering programs in Chile, specifically the “Computing and Informatics Civil Engineering” (ICCI) and “Computing and Informatics Execution Engineering” (IECI) programs. We developed a machine‐learning‐based model using random forests to predict delays in submissions of the final report of graduation projects, the key step in the graduation pipeline of the analyzed students. We had access to a data set comprised of 209 students in the period from 2013 to 2017, out of these students, only 111 completed all their graduation requirements. Thus, we focused on this subset of students for the analysis. Our analyses of results indicate that individual advisors minimally contribute to predicting timely or late submissions, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach. In contrast, the specific major, graduation modality, and time in the program play crucial roles, with GPA emerging as the most influential factor (24.06%). Notably, the “Professional Work” modality exhibits a moderate positive correlation with late submissions, contextualized by students' employment commitments. The study's predictive model offers actionable insights for educators and administrators, identifying at‐risk students and advocating for personalized support strategies. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing educational outcomes by integrating data‐driven approaches tailored to diverse student profiles.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,,,,2024-05-26,2024,2024-05-26,2024-09,32,5,,Closed,Article,"Quelopana, Aldo; Keith, Brian; Pizarro, Ricardo","Quelopana, Aldo (Department of Computing & Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Keith, Brian (Department of Computing & Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Pizarro, Ricardo (Department of Computing & Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Departamento de Electrónica in Universidad de Alcalá (UAH), Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain)","Keith, Brian (Catholic University of the North)","Quelopana, Aldo (Catholic University of the North); Keith, Brian (Catholic University of the North); Pizarro, Ricardo (Catholic University of the North; University of Alcalá)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172117035,39 Education; 40 Engineering,4 Quality Education

This study quantitatively evaluated greening on the Loess Plateau based on Fraction Vegetation Cover (FVC) calculated by MOD13Q1 dataset, compared FVC in different climatic zones, and explored the relationship between greening and precipitation, evaporation, soil water content (SWC), surface water bodies, and human activities. The study found that FVC on the Loess Plateau increased significantly at a rate of 0.538% yr−1 from 2000 to 2020, resulting in 94% greening. The greening rate was higher in the middle temperate zones (0.557% yr−1) than in the southern temperate zones (0.532% yr−1), but its average FVC was lower. This suggests that the greening rate (0.551% yr−1) is higher within 5 km of water bodies. Cropland (15.26%), grassland (13.66%) and trees (12.57%) had higher FVC increment than other types, while the six-fold increase in urban area is a significant impediment to greening. Additionally, there is a significant positive correlation with FVC when the urban economy exceeds 100 billion. The interaction of natural factors and human activities made the greatest contribution to greening, as calculated by the GeoDetector. It is hypothesized that there is significant potential for greening in the middle temperate zones. However, large-scale tree planting may not have a catalytic effect and could even be counterproductive. To achieve sustainable greening of the Loess Plateau in the future, shrubs and artificial water storage facilities may be key.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In response to this critical concern, this study introduces an innovative methodology designed to discern between gradual and sudden failures, offering a nuanced exploration of the distinct failure mechanisms at play. Distinguishing itself through a sophisticated treatment of failure mechanisms—specifically, the incorporation of thermomechanical fatigue and vibration-induced mechanisms—within the context of solder joint degradation, the proposed approach significantly elevates the precision and accuracy of reliability evaluations. This refined methodology emerges as a valuable contribution to the field, promising more insightful and reliable results in the assessment of electronic device durability under diverse and complex operational conditions.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Vacuum,,,,2024-04,2024,,2024-04,222,,113004,Closed,Article,"Li, Yongxin; Askar, Shavan; Paucar-Sullca, Soledad; Burga-Falla, José-Manuel; Asaad, Renas Rajab","Li, Yongxin (Shaanxi Engineering Research Center of Controllable Neutron Source, School of Electronic Information, Xijing University, Xi'an, 710123, China); Askar, Shavan (Erbil Technical Engineering College, Erbil Polytechnic University, Erbil, Iraq; Arcella Telecom, Erbil, Iraq); Paucar-Sullca, Soledad (Academic Department of Basic Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, National Amazonian University of Madre de Dios, Puerto Maldonado, Peru); Burga-Falla, José-Manuel (Universidad Privada Del Norte, Lima, Peru); Asaad, Renas Rajab (Department of Computer Science, Nawroz University, Duhok, Iraq)","Askar, Shavan (Erbil Technical Engineering College, Erbil Polytechnic University, Erbil, Iraq; Arcella Telecom, Erbil, Iraq)","Li, Yongxin (Xijing University); Askar, Shavan (Erbil Technical Engineering College, Erbil Polytechnic University, Erbil, Iraq; Arcella Telecom, Erbil, Iraq); Paucar-Sullca, Soledad (Academic Department of Basic Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, National Amazonian University of Madre de Dios, Puerto Maldonado, Peru); Burga-Falla, José-Manuel (Private University of the North); Asaad, Renas Rajab (Nawroz University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168117015,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering,

However, the electronic configuration of graphdiyne makes it difficult to achieve efficient interfacial contact and photocatalysis. In this study, a new method based on ball milling technology was developed to efficiently produce GDY and hydrogen substituted graphdiyne (H-GDY), and it was proved that H-GDY can achieve efficient interface contact and promote the separation of interface charges to improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the high work function of H-GDY can enlarge the larger work function difference (ΔΦ) between NiSe2, which drives the effective transfer of charges at the interface, and then forms a stronger built-in electric field, thus significantly improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

In these environments, anthropogenic climate changes may contribute to the intensification of droughts and increase the susceptibility of lands to desertification. In this study, the evolution, current topics, and the research trends in climate change in four dry environments in South America (Caatinga, Patagonia, Gran Chaco, and the Atacama Desert) were analyzed.MethodsThe database was obtained from the Core Collection of Web of Science. A total of 1,386 scientific papers (1993–2022) were analyzed.ResultsPatagonia accounted for 37.4% of research on climate change in the four studied environments, while the Gran Chaco accounted for only 6.9%. Overall, the research trends indicate the need for the understanding in the increasing severity of drought in the Caatinga and the intensification of fire frequency in the Gran Chaco on soil properties, animals, and plants. The implementation of more sustainable animal production systems, aiming at soil conservation and reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions should be a priority in Patagonia. In Atacama Desert, the relationship between climate change and soil microbiome, as well as plant-microorganism interactions under hyper-arid conditions, represent important research trends in this ecosystem. Across all biomes, quantification of GHG emissions, the development of strategies to promote C sequestration by biomass and in soils and studies to understand the effects of climate change on people's lives have been scarce and urgently need implementation.ConclusionThere is an urgent need to implement public policies aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change in the dry climate environments of South America with emphasis on the Gran Chaco, where climate-environmental research is limited, and ecosystem degradation is pronounced.",,,Journal of Soils and Sediments,,,,2024-07-11,2024,2024-07-11,2024-08,24,8,3013-3027,Closed,Article,"Oliveira Filho, José de Souza","Oliveira Filho, José de Souza (Department of Soil Science, Federal University of Ceará, Campus do Pici, BL. 807 - Av.

299,pub.1167879016,10.1016/j.infsof.2024.107404,,,A longitudinal study on the temporal validity of software samples,"Context In Empirical Software Engineering, it is crucial to work with representative samples that reflect the current state of the software industry. An important consideration, especially in rapidly changing fields like software development, is that if we use a sample collected years ago, it should continue to represent the same population in the present day to produce generalizable results. However, it is seldom the case in which a software sample built several years ago accurately depicts the current state of the development industry. Nevertheless, many recent studies rely on rather old datasets (seven or more years of age) to conduct their investigations. Objective To analyze the evolution of a population of open-source projects, determine the likelihood of detecting significant differences over time, and study the activity history of the projects. Method We performed a longitudinal study with 72 snapshots of quality projects from Github, covering the period between July 1st 2017 and June 1st 2023. We recorded monthly values of seven repository metrics (contributors, commits, closed pull-requests, merged pull-requests, closed issues, number of stars and forks), encompassing data from a total of 1991 repositories. Results We observed significant changes in all the metrics evaluated, with most cases showing negligible to small effect sizes. Notably, merged pull-requests registered medium effect sizes. The evolution was not equal in all the metrics, however, after five years it was unlikely that a sample of projects remained representative for any of the analyzed metrics, showing probabilities below 25%. Conclusion Although the temporal validity of a sample depends on the specific data being studied, employing datasets created several years ago does not appear to be a sound strategy if the aim is to produce results that can be extrapolated to the current state of the population.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This can cause the plant to wilt if it is not watered occasionally to keep the soil moist. In summer, this problem tends to get worse because the temperature tends to rise and reach high degrees. The objective is to design an automatic and manual irrigation system with a humidity detector through hardware programming and free software to solve this. The necessary components will be identified and selected, humidity thresholds will be established, and the adoption of technologies such as internet of things (IoT), Arduino, and humidity sensors will be promoted to solve the problem in automated irrigation systems. The technical specifications of the components are described, and the circuit design is presented. A programming algorithm will be developed to control the frequency and duration of irrigation, as well as the state of the water pump. Implementing the automated system will allow precise water supply control, contributing to the healthy growth of plants and crops in green areas.",,,Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,,,,2024-09-01,2024,2024-09-01,,35,3,1437-1446,Closed,Article,"Pérez-Baca, Molly Scarlet; Sambrano-Luna, Karina Lizeth; Sánchez-Ramírez, Jhony Miguel; Cabana-Cáceres, Maritza; Castro-Vargas, Cristian","Pérez-Baca, Molly Scarlet (Universidad Privada del Norte); Sambrano-Luna, Karina Lizeth (Universidad Privada del Norte); Sánchez-Ramírez, Jhony Miguel (Universidad Privada del Norte); Cabana-Cáceres, Maritza (Universidad Privada del Norte); Castro-Vargas, Cristian (Universidad Privada del Norte)",,"Pérez-Baca, Molly Scarlet (Private University of the North); Sambrano-Luna, Karina Lizeth (Private University of the North); Sánchez-Ramírez, Jhony Miguel (Private University of the North); Cabana-Cáceres, Maritza (Private University of the North); Castro-Vargas, Cristian (Private University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173417862,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics",
291,pub.1168312288,10.1007/s10009-024-00735-4,,,A process for creating KDM2PSM transformation engines,"Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) is a special kind of reengineering that employs models along the process. The main ADM metamodel is the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM), which is a platform-independent metamodel able to represent several views of a system. Although a lot of research is currently focused on the reverse engineering phase of ADM, little has been devoted to the forward engineering one, mainly on the generation of Platform-Specific Models (PSMs) from KDM. The forward engineering phase is essential because it belongs to the end of the horseshoe model, completing the reengineering process. Besides, the lack of research and the absence of tooling support in this phase hinder the industrial adoption of ADM. Therefore, in this paper, we present a process for creating Transformation Engines (TEs) capable of transforming KDM instances in a chosen PSM. We highlight two main contributions in this work. The first is a process that software engineers can follow for building TEs capable of generating PSM instances (e.g., Java model, Python model, etc.) from KDM instances. Having that on their hands, modernization engineers can then use generators for generating language-specific source code from the PSM. The second is delivering a specific TE called RUTE-K2J, which is able to generate Java models from KDM models. The transformation rules of RUTE-K2J have been tested considering sets of common code structures that normally appear when modernizing systems. The test cases have shown that in this version of RUTE the transformation rules are able to correctly generate 92% of the source code submitted to the transformation.","We would like to thank the financial support provided by FAPESP, SP, Brazil, process number (2016/03104-0) and by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001.",,International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer,,,,2024-01-26,2024,2024-01-26,2024-02,26,1,1-20,Closed,Article,"Angulo, Guisella; San Martín, Daniel; Ferrari, Fabiano; García-Rodríguez de Guzmán, Ignacio; Perez-Castillo, Ricardo; Vieira de Camargo, Valter","Angulo, Guisella (Computing Department, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil); San Martín, Daniel (Engineering School, Catholic University of the North, Coquimbo, Chile); Ferrari, Fabiano (Computing Department, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil); García-Rodríguez de Guzmán, Ignacio (Institute of Technology and Information Systems, University of Castilla – La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain); Perez-Castillo, Ricardo (Institute of Technology and Information Systems, University of Castilla – La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain); Vieira de Camargo, Valter (Computing Department, Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil)","Angulo, Guisella (Federal University of São Carlos)","Angulo, Guisella (Federal University of São Carlos); San Martín, Daniel (Catholic University of the North); Ferrari, Fabiano (Federal University of São Carlos); García-Rodríguez de Guzmán, Ignacio (University of Castilla-La Mancha); Perez-Castillo, Ricardo (University of Castilla-La Mancha); Vieira de Camargo, Valter (Federal University of São Carlos)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168312288,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,
290,pub.1174769729,10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103856,,,Efficiency analysis of engineering classes: A DEA approach encompassing active learning and expositive classes towards quality education,"The science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research delves into the core of sustainable development goals (SDGs), including the pillars of quality education (SDG4), robust economic growth (SDG8), and diminished inequalities (SDG10). These pursuits stand as keystones in sculpting inclusive societies and bridging societal gaps. While previous studies utilising data envelopment analysis (DEA) have explored educational performance mainly from a macro-perspective, there is a lack of micro-perspective investigation. Our study aims to fill this gap by proposing a DEA approach to assess the relative efficiency of engineering classes. We analysed 70 classes covering 38 subjects in the first semester of 2022 at a South American school. Methodologically, we employed the slack-based measure (SBM) model under the benefit of doubt (BoD) condition. Unlike prior research, we analysed classes' relative performance considering different pedagogical approaches - 11 active-learning classes (15.7 %) and 59 passive-learning classes (84.3 %). Our results showed that 18 classes were efficient (25.7 %). Active classes were more efficient, but few subjects maintained similar efficiencies for all classes. Moreover, efficient classes were concentrated in the last two years prior to graduation (57.9 %). This may represent an additional barrier for low-income students, who tend to drop out in the first years. The findings support several improvement recommendations, such as integrating digital technologies, boosting active learning opportunities, and bolstering classes in foundational subjects. Also, implications for researchers, decision- and policy-makers are discussed. Our approach can be replicated in diverse educational contexts, enabling the identification of strengths and weaknesses for more efficient educational management.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The effect of sputtering power (20 watts, 25 watts, and 30 watts) on the thin films, their surface scaling, fractal dimension, and optical properties are extensively investigated. Autocorrelation and height–height correlation functions were applied to AFM images to extract deep insights about the thin films’ surfaces. Fractal dimension (Df) was extracted through the power spectral density (PSD) function. Various scaling exponents, including α, β, and 1/z, of the NiO film's surface were independently observed. The local roughness exponent, α, was approximately 0.81 for films deposited with 20 watts sputtering power and decreased to 0.71 with higher sputtering power. The interface width () scales with sputtering power (Sp) as ∼ Spβ, with a growth exponent (β) value of 1.17. The lateral correlation length (ξ) follows as ∼ Sp1/z with a 1/z value of 0.703. Additionally, optical parameters were recorded through UV-Vis optical spectroscopy, and an attempt was made to correlate them with fractal parameters (Df & α). Optical absorption (reflection) increased (decreased) with increasing Df values. The minimum (maximum) reflection (absorption) was observed on the roughest surface (Df = 2.29). The calculated band gap decreased with increasing fractal dimension. This investigation suggests that sputtered surfaces with minimal reflectivity, band gap, and enhanced light-absorbing capacity could potentially be used as active solar layers for advanced optoelectronic devices.","Declaration of Competing Interest ☒ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. ☐The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Acknowledgment This work was supported by CEDENNA through Financiamiento Basal para Centros Científicos y Tecnológicos de Excelencia (Grant AFB220001).

They possess a topological charge of Q=0 and can move in straight lines unaffected by the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, using micromagnetic simulations, we study the behavior of a skyrmionium when a polarized spin current transports it along a racetrack in the presence of a semicircular magnetic defect with different Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction values. As a first step, we obtained the perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy (Kz) and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya constants (Dint) for which it is possible to form a skyrmionium in the racetrack. Our results show that the higher the Kz value, the higher the Dint values necessary to stabilize the skyrmionium. Furthermore, interaction energies between the skyrmionium and the semicircular defect are presented. The results show that the interaction energy can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya defect interaction constant (Dintdef). Finally, we conclude that using these types of defects and a spin-polarized current, the motion of the skyrmionium can be either modified in a specific way or even blocked.","H.

279,pub.1175381792,10.1080/00222933.2024.2350106,,,The complete mitochondrial genome of the leopard shark Triakis semifasciata (Triakidae),"The leopard shark Triakis semifasciata (family Triakidae) is threatened by habitat loss and targeted by recreational and commercial fishermen in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, from Oregon, USA, to the Gulf of California, Mexico. Despite environmental issues, there are few genetic and genomic resources available for this species. This study assembled the complete mitochondrial genome of T. semifasciata from a skin metagenomic sample and described it in detail. The phylogenetic position of T. semifasciata amongst closely related species was also examined using mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs). The mitochondrial genome of T. semifasciata is 16,613 bp in length and consists of 13 PCGs, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. A 30 bp long region was identified as the origin of replication for the light strand (OL) between the trnN and trnC genes, and a 974 bp long putative control region (CR) contains the origin of replication for the heavy strand (OH). The gene order in T. semifasciata is identical to that of cofamilial species. An analysis of Ka/Ks ratios for all PCGs yielded values < 1, indicating that all PCGs experience strong purifying selection. All tRNAs exhibit a canonical ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structure except for tRNA-Ser1 which lacks the stem of the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm and in place possesses a simple loop. A phylomitogenomic maximum likelihood (ML) analysis did not support the monophyly of the family Trakidae and placed T. semifasciata in a sister position to Hemitriakis japanica. However, the aforementioned sister position was poorly supported by ML bootstrap values. This study represents a new genomic resource for this commercially and recreationally important species and confirms that mitochondrial genomes can be assembled from skin metagenomic samples as shown before in an unrelated shark species.",J.

One of the ways to promote strategies for the valorization of mining-impacted soils is through the commercial impulses that exist behind it. For example, obtaining valuable materials with low treatment costs is highly desired compared to massive remediation tasks. Thus, this work focuses on obtaining copper salts with commercialization potential from mining-contaminated soils. The approach was addressed in two steps: by leaching and crystallization. The soil was leached with seawater at different conditions of pH, solid/liquid ratio, and number of recycling stages, achieving recoveries exceeding 70%. Crystallization was carried out under ambient conditions for water evaporation, obtaining crystals of copper chloride with high concentration. In this study, the obtained copper salts have a market, and the process resulted in a significant diminution of metal concentration in soils, becoming a remediation strategy that can be evaluated in larger scale.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

278,pub.1175385622,10.1080/00222933.2024.2354543,,,Characterisation of the complete mitochondrial genome of the imperiled Pearl darter Percina aurora (Perciformes: Percidae),"The Pearl darter Percina aurora, a member of the species-rich family Percidae, is endemic to the Pearl and Pascagoula river systems in Louisiana and Mississippi, USA. However, this fish is now only found in the Pascagoula River and is listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. This study, for the first time, assembled and characterised in detail the mitochondrial genome of P. aurora. The mitochondrial genome of P. aurora is 16,646 bp in length and comprises 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rrnS [12s ribosomal RNA] and rrnL [16s ribosomal RNA]). A 33 bp long region was identified as the origin of replication for the light strand (OL), and a putative non-coding control region (CR), 987 bp in length, contains the origin of replication for the heavy strand (OH). The two ribosomal RNA genes, the majority of the PCGs, and the majority of the tRNA genes are encoded on the positive, or heavy, strand. The gene order in P. aurora is identical to that previously reported for confamilial species. All tRNAs exhibit a cloverleaf secondary structure except tRNA-Serine 1 which lacked the D-arm loop. An analysis of selective pressure (Ka/Ks ratios) for all the PCGs showed Ka/Ks values ≤1, suggesting that all these PCGs experience strong purifying selection. This new genomic resource will aid with bioprospecting and biomonitoring of P. aurora using environmental DNA.","Many thanks to Dr Vincent P. Richards for bioinformatics support.

Interpersonal relationship challenges underline the significance of emotional commitment for well-being. The RIS uniquely assesses this aspect, distinguishing it from love, satisfaction, and maintenance measures. Through meticulous validation involving translation and expert review, and a sample of 300 Peruvian young adults, the research confirms the RIS’s unidimensional structure and reliability. Factorial analysis refines the scale by eliminating low-loading items, while associations with relationship satisfaction validate its construct. Utilizing confirmatory factor analysis, the study highlights the positive link between involvement and satisfaction, suggesting the RIS’s utility in understanding romantic dynamics.

If a pedestrian is injured in an outdoor public space, we are talking about a “pedestrian fall”. Pedestrian falls are a more common cause of pedestrian injuries than traffic crashes but have received less attention and the literature on this topic is scarce. Aims and methods The aim of this work is to describe at a general level the prevalence and consequences of pedestrian falls and injuries, to make international comparisons of pedestrian falls and to identify risk factors and not least to examine the relationships between the prevalence of falls and pedestrian risk behaviour. A total of 6,373 participants from 15 different countries were recruited to take part in this study. To collect data a questionnaire was used. To cover the risky behaviour of pedestrians we used a short version of Pedestrians Behaviour Scale (PBS). In order to identify groups of countries with a similar pedestrian transport situation, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. The analysis produced four groups of countries based on pedestrians’ safety level, popularity of walking and GDP. Results and conclusions As for the results, we can conclude that young people and older people are more frequently involved in falls and that women report more frequent involvement in falls than males. However, the risk of getting injured in a fall is not higher than that of men. Frequent walking is associated with a lower risk of falling while walking. In contrast to this, physical activity increases such risk. The prevalence of falls and injuries seems to be weakly related to pedestrians’ risky behaviour, thus other factors such as safety infrastructure probably play an important role.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this work, we introduce a simple approach to investigate static screening in dielectric systems in the presence of an impurity charge for different dimensionalities. This approach is applicable to semiconductors and insulators alike. We demonstrate that, in 3D systems, the macroscopic dielectric function in reciprocal space is a constant, while in 2D and 1D systems, it strongly depends on the momentum transferred to the electrons in the dielectric. Through the proposed dielectric screening model, one can also determine binding energies in a hydrogenic model that can be used to describe excitations in real semiconductor systems.","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and detailed comments which have significantly improve the overall message of our manuscript.

The optical properties focus on the up-conversion emission and optical temperature sensing properties of thermally and non-thermally coupled levels. Exciting at 975 nm, the up-conversion produces three emissions bands centered at 533, 545, and 670 nm. When the concentration of Er ion increases, the intensity of emission increases up to 5 %. The mechanism shows the absorption of two photons and the energy transfer up-conversion process. Optical temperature sensing is studied in the range of 299–327 K based on thermal coupled and non-thermal coupled levels by the luminescence intensity ratio technique. The absolute sensitivity, relative sensitivity, and uncertainty temperature values were obtained to study the material's performance and applicability. The maximum absolute and relative sensitivity values are 5.21 × 10−3 K−1 at 327 K for I670/I545 and 0.87 % at 299 K for I533/545. On the other hand, the temperature uncertainty is 0.2 K, indicating that the present material may be used as an effective temperature-sensing device using thermal coupled and non-thermal coupled levels.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Utilizing co-authorship as a metric for collaboration and examining publications sourced from the Scopus database, the research delineates the nuanced dynamics of Cuban international scientific collaboration over the span of 122 years. The findings highlight the efficacy of Cuba’s strategic geographical diversification efforts in bolstering its scientific prowess and fostering innovation. Moreover, the adoption of this strategy has contributed to the augmentation of Cuba’s scientific output. The results demonstrate a progressive diversification of Cuban collaborations across various regions, with notable emphasis on partnerships with Western Europe and Latin America. Nevertheless, collaborations with other regions exhibit limited engagement, indicative of untapped opportunities for expansion. Despite encountering challenges, scientific collaboration emerges as a pivotal driver in advancing Cuba’s scientific productivity.

Prior research has acknowledged that strategies for mine planning and the design of mineral concentrators are interdependent; thus, it is highly desirable to optimize them together. However, achieving detailed holistic optimization of the entire mineral value chain remains unresolved because of the inherent limitations associated with mathematical formulations and computational processing capacity. This paper details a method that contributes to bridging these limitations by employing a novel parallelized variable neighborhood descent approach combined with an embedded mass–balance component using linear programming techniques refined through Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. This approach is exemplified through a case study of a gold deposit, which illustrates the enhanced performance capabilities of the new algorithm. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in the optimization process for mine planning, providing a stronger link between the mine’s output and processing plant’s capabilities.",Powered@NLHPC: This research was partially supported by the supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC (ECM-02).,"This research was partially funded by a scholarship granted by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development–ANID, grant number 72200205.","Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration",,,,2024-08-13,2024,2024-08-13,,,,1-14,Closed,Article,"Quelopana, Aldo; Navarra, Alessandro","Quelopana, Aldo (Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile; Mining and Materials Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, Canada); Navarra, Alessandro (Mining and Materials Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, Canada)","Quelopana, Aldo (Catholic University of the North; McGill University)","Quelopana, Aldo (Catholic University of the North; McGill University); Navarra, Alessandro (McGill University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174726622,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of an armadillid isopod, Cubaris murina, was assembled and characterised in detail for the first time. The gene order and secondary structure of transfer RNA (tRNA) genes were compared among isopods. The 14,212-bp-long mitogenome consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 20 tRNAs, two ribosomal RNAs, and four non-coding regions (NCRs), each longer than 100 bp. Two tRNA genes (trnG and trnI) were missing and several other tRNA genes exhibited secondary structures that departed from the typical cloverleaf pattern. Deletions and nucleotide insertions in the T- and D-arms and mismatches in the acceptor stem were commonly observed in these tRNAs. Notably, the mitogenome of C. murina exhibited a new gene order containing four tRNA rearrangements, and differences in the location of the NCRs were detected when compared to those reported for other isopods, including oniscid species. Interestingly, the second NCR had a similar number of secondary structures and repetitive elements to those reported in the control region of other crustaceans. The novel gene order, tRNA secondary structures, and NCR organisation reported herein for the mitogenome of C. murina confirms the hyper-variability of mitochondrial genomes in isopods. This study is the first to characterise in detail the mitogenome of the invasive isopod C. murina, belonging to the species-rich family Armadillidae within the Isopoda, and advances our understanding of mitochondrial genome architecture in isopods.",,This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017R1D1A2B04033088) and (No. 2021R1I1A2051574).,Journal of Natural History,,,,2024-09-03,2024,2024-09-03,2024-09,58,33-36,1293-1306,Closed,Article,"Hwang, Hee-seung; Shin, Jiyeong; Jung, Jongwoo; Baeza, J.

The materials were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX). The copper(II) 5-methyl-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylate (Cu(LNO2)2) complex exhibited the best electrochemical performance toward the sulfite electron transfer process regarding onset potential and peak current. Best results were obtained at pH 4, and the following analytical parameters for sulfite detection were determined by amperometry at 0.90 V, as follows: reproducibility (1.9 %), repeatability (1.6 %), limit of detection (0.75 µmol/L), limit of quantification (2.27 µmol/L), dynamic concentration range (10 µmol/L to 5.00 mmol/L, R2 = 0.995), and sensitivity (7.43x10-3 µA µmol−1 L). Precision was evaluated in terms of repeatability, and a relative standard deviation < 15 % was found at three concentration levels. The method́s accuracy was assessed by determining sulfite in commercial wine samples, and acceptable errors were obtained compared to values reported by an external analytical laboratory. The selectivity towards interfering species (Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, NO3 −, glucose, sucrose, NaCl, and KCl) and the stability was also evaluated. The practical application of the Cu(LNO2)2/GCE sensor was examined by analyzing the sulfite content in white and red commercial wines.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this case A is called a realizing matrix for Λ. The problem of characterizing all realizable lists Λ is known as the Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (NIEP). If A is required to be persymmetric, the Persymmetric Nonnegative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (PNIEP) arises. In this paper, we show that the NIEP and the PNIEP are equivalent for any realizable list of three complex numbers. Furthermore, we give a new sufficient condition for a list of three complex numbers to be the spectrum of a persymmetric nonnegative matrix with prescribed diagonal entries. For some realizable lists of four complex numbers, we show that the NIEP and the PNIEP are equivalent. In general, we show that these problems are different. Finally, we found a sufficient condition for a trace zero list of five complex numbers to be the spectrum of a persymmetric nonnegative matrix.","Declaration of Competing Interest There is no competing interest.

This is the first study focused on the removal of pollutants present in greywater using a pretreatment system based on ozone and solar irradiation. A series of treatments were addressed to evaluate the depuration of greywater coming from the dishwashing of a university dining hall. Notable findings of the study include several aspects such as a very high colour removal using sedimentation and, filtration and flotation process, with an overall colour removal of 91.8 %. The adsorption process removed a higher amount of surfactants with dried compost as adsorbent compared to fly ash or zeolite, with surfactant removal rates of 50.8 %, 7.8 %, and 9.0 %, respectively. Eliminating oil and grease from the greywater was studied with a solar photoreactor coupled with an ozonation process and configured in different ways. When ozone was incorporated into the vertical ozonation tube, and greywater was pumped to mix it with the ozone gas to pump the resulting mix to the borosilicate tube, oil and grease removal was 84.1 %. These treatment processes offer an effective solution for removing pollutants present in greywater; however, further studies and optimisation of operational conditions are required to enhance the efficiency of the treatment.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Water Process Engineering,,,,2024-07,2024,,2024-07,64,,105653,Closed,Article,"Poblete, Rodrigo; Pérez, Norma; Cortes, Ernesto; Chacana, Jaime","Poblete, Rodrigo (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Coquimbo, Chile); Pérez, Norma (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Coquimbo, Chile); Cortes, Ernesto (Universidad Católica del Norte, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Coquimbo, Chile); Chacana, Jaime (Universidad Católica del Norte, Departamento de Ingeniería Química y de Medio Ambiente, Antofagasta, Chile)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North)","Poblete, Rodrigo (Catholic University of the North); Pérez, Norma (Catholic University of the North); Cortes, Ernesto (Catholic University of the North); Chacana, Jaime (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173166510,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,6 Clean Water and Sanitation

Despite its pedagogical significance and diverse technological applications, this model often receives inadequate attention in foundational electromagnetism literature, limiting early student exposure to this emblematic concept. In this pedagogical initiative, we present a comprehensive analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation through a dielectric medium positioned between semi-infinite media. We examine interference phenomena arising from back-and-forth reflected waves within the dielectric, focusing on the coherent and incoherent reflection regimes as limiting cases. Employing rigorous analytical treatment, we delineate transmittance and reflectance profiles, offering students a lucid understanding of how the refractive index’s real and imaginary components compete and manifest under specific conditions. This analytical approach enhances students’ comprehension of electromagnetic wave behavior within diverse mediums. Furthermore, we extend this theoretical foundation to practical applications, emphasizing renewable energy contexts. By calculating absorptance, we estimate the maximum photo-generated current and power conversion efficiency of a prototype solar cell, establishing a tangible link between theoretical knowledge and real-world solar energy utilization.","CEPV gratefully acknowledges Alexandre R Rocha and P Venezuela for their insightful discussions and valuable feedback.

The crystal structure was established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The powder X-ray powder diffraction analysis confirms the phase purity of the crystalline sample. The hydantoin with formula C6H10N2O2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4/m (N°87), Z=8, and unit cell parameters a=15.554(2) Å, c=6.623(6) Å. This space group is very infrequent to find in purely organic molecules and is since, in the asymmetric unit, the hydantoin ring lies on a mirror plane m. The crystalline packing is stabilized by the formation of intermolecular interactions of the strong hydrogen bond type of the N–H···O between the neighboring hydantoin rings. In addition, the crystalline structure presents the formation of weaker unconventional hydrogen bonds of the C–H···O type. These hydrogen bonds give rise to the formation of 8, 24, and 36-membered ring-type supramolecular structures described by the graphs R2 2(8), R4 4(24), and R8 8(36), respectively, which govern the packing of the supramolecular structure of 1,5,5-trimethyl-imidazolidine-2,4‑dione. Hirshfeld surface analysis of the crystal structure shows that the most important contributions for the crystal packing are from H···H (58.3%) and H··O/O··H (34.0%) interactions, which indicate that van der Waals interactions are the dominant forces in the crystal packing. Energy framework calculations suggest that the contacts formed between molecules are slightly electrostatic. These intermolecular interactions were also investigated through topological analysis of the electron density (ρ) employing the NCI method. Experimental and theoretical results obtained for this new hydantoin compound suggest that N–H···O and C–H···O interactions play an important role in the stabilization of its supramolecular structure.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Romantic attachment, couple relationship quality and depressive symptoms in a Chilean sample","Substantial evidence has established a connection between attachment insecurity and depressive symptoms. Although numerous mechanisms explain this relationship, the role of couple relationship quality as a mediator has received less attention, particularly within diverse cultural contexts. This study examined the direct and indirect associations between attachment insecurity and depressive symptoms through couple relationship quality, and the moderating effect of sex, and sexual orientation in Chilean adults involved in a couple relationship. 985 Chilean adults completed self-report measures of attachment insecurity, indicators of couple relationship quality (dyadic trust, emotional intimacy, positive sexuality, and relationship satisfaction), and depressive symptoms. Structural equation modelling analyses supported our proposed model, which explained 28% of the variance in depressive symptoms, and 32% of couple relationship quality. Attachment insecurity was associated with more depressive symptoms directly and indirectly, through lower couple relationship quality. The model was invariant across sex assigned at birth, and sexual orientation. This study suggests that one of the pathways through which attachment insecurity may contribute to poorer mental health is via lower couple relationship quality. For clinical practice, this study highlights that addressing attachment insecurity and couple relationship quality can be relevant in designing effective interventions for individuals with depressive symptoms.",,This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development of Chile [FONDECYT 1190240].,Current Psychology,,,,2024-06-18,2024,2024-06-18,2024-08,43,30,25247-25256,Closed,Article,"Guzmán-González, Mónica; Valarezo-Bravo, Omayck; Casu, Giulia","Guzmán-González, Mónica (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Valarezo-Bravo, Omayck (School of Psychology, Universidad Católica del Norte, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile; Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador); Casu, Giulia (Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)","Guzmán-González, Mónica (Catholic University of the North); Valarezo-Bravo, Omayck (Catholic University of the North; Universidad Nacional de Loja); Casu, Giulia (University of Bologna)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172990388,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

A relevant alternative to detect contaminants in food products is to couple near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) with chemometrics. Among the most accurate chemometric techniques employed to analyze food products, partial least squares regression (PLSR) combines features from and generalizes principal component analysis (PCA) to create compact and accurate models. Other techniques inspired in the human brain, such as multilayer perceptron, the long short-term memory (LSTM) models, and other approaches based on deep learning, take advantage of the high complexity of weights and neurons to train models based on large amounts of data. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate chemometric tools to estimate the percentage of adulterants in paprika powder using NIR spectroscopy, and three approaches are proposed and compared showing different performances. According to the methodology, the paprika samples were dried and separated into pericarp, peduncle, and seed cake. The resulting elements were finely milled, sieved, and mixed into 21 different combinations with a different percentage of each. Spectral profiles were used to train PLSR, multilayer perceptron, and regression models based on LSTM networks. The models were compared following a k-fold cross-validation strategy. Results showed that PLSR presented the highest R2=0.978$$R^2=0.978$$ for peduncle adulterant estimation, and the lowest RMSE=6.24$$RMSE=6.24$$. In particular, when seed cake powder was used as an adulterant, the PLSR approach showed the highest R2=0.981$$R^2=0.981$$, and the lowest RMSE=5.806$$RMSE=5.806$$. The RPD values were higher than 2.000 for all models that use the peduncle as an adulterant and only for models bound to the PLSR in the adulterated samples with pressed seed cake. In summary, the best predictions were obtained using PLSR models, providing evidence of the feasibility of using NIR spectra to estimate the percentage of adulterants in paprika powder.","The authors appreciate the support provided to this work by the project “Creation of the laboratory service for food safety research at the Universidad Nacional de Frontera,” with Unique Investment Code No. 2439545.",,Neural Computing and Applications,,,,2024-05-06,2024,2024-05-06,2024-08,36,23,14263-14273,Closed,Article,"Castro, Wilson; Oblitas, Jimy; Nuñez, Luis; Yoplac, Ives; Avila-George, Himer; De-la-Torre, Miguel","Castro, Wilson (Facultad de Ingeniería de Industrias Alimentarias y Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional de Frontera, Av.

Genomic resources to support conservation of this species are needed. Here, we assembled, annotated and characterised in detail the mitochondrial genome of O. chrysurus. The mitochondrial genome of O. chrysurus is 16,502 bp in length and encodes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), and two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA). The putative control region, 827 bp in length, is located between the tRNA P and tRNA F genes. Most genes are encoded on the positive strand, while a single PCG (nad6) and six tRNA genes (in order from 5′ to 3′: tRNA N, tRNA P, tRNA E, tRNA Q, tRNA C and tRNA Y) are encoded on the negative strand. All tRNA have a typical ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structure except tRNA S1 (Serine1) that lacks the D arm. Calculated Ka/Ks values of all PCGs were <1, suggesting that these genes are under purifying selection. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis confirmed monophyly of the family Lutjanidae and indicated that the genus Lutjanus is paraphyletic given that O. chrysurus clustered together with Lutjanus peru and L. guttatus in a strongly supported clade. Data published herein will inform conservation and management strategies for this fished snapper.","JAB thanks Dr Vincent Richards for bioinformatic support.

In this dipole model, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the physical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function f ( Q ) through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the f ( Q ) function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where f Q plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR.","Declaration of competing interest I declare no conflict of interest.

We analyzed populations of A. typa occurring on the kelps Lessonia spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera at six locations on the coast of northern-central Chile. Males could be clearly distinguished from females starting at total body lengths (TL) ⩾ 14 mm, taking as criteria the presence of reproductive appendages and the development of gonopods in males. Females reached substantially larger sizes (up to 22.20 mm) than males (up to 18.25 mm), confirming the existence of sexual size dimorphism in A. typa. Although females had developed oostegites at lengths ⩾ 14 mm TL, only the largest females (⩾17 mm TL) were ovigerous. This suggests that female A. typa reproduce once before dying. At most study sites there were more adult females than males occurring on Lessonia spp., while males dominated on M. pyrifera. Some A. typa individuals had white stripes present on the dorsal part of the pereon, a colour polymorphism apparently independent of the sex of the isopods but becoming more frequent in large individuals, suggesting high predation pressure and that individuals with these stripes have higher survival rates. The results of this study confirm sexual size dimorphism in A. typa, which appears to be a semelparous species. A comparison with other sphaeromatid species indicates that the evolution of semelparity is unrelated to body size, but might be more common in species from habitats with high predation pressure.","The idea for a collaborative project first came up when Christoph with a large group of his students attended the Crustacean Society meeting in Coquimbo in 2007. Naturally, we discussed some crab ideas, but at the time our lab focused on kelp ecology and rafting dispersal. Somehow, we were able to convince Christoph to study the phylogeography of the kelp isopod Amphoroidea typa. We conducted two field expeditions, one to northern Chile and one to southern Chile, and successfully collected many isopods. Needless to say that Christoph also continuously looked for his beloved crabs, and we learned a lot about his favorite animal group during these trips.

However, often, the NIS are not able to colonize the adjacent seafloor, where high predation pressure by benthic predators might inhibit them. To test this hypothesis, we quantified and compared consumption rates of standardized bait (squidpops) in four water depth zones (sea surface, sub-surface, midwaters, seafloor) in five representative regions in the Southeast Pacific, covering oceanic Rapa Nui (Easter Island; 27°S, 109°W; November 2022) as well as the Chilean continental coast (29–41°S, 71–73°W; March–June 2022). We found a strong overall effect of water zonation, with significant bait consumption being limited to the seafloor and occurring only sporadically in other depth zones. Consumption frequencies also differed between experimental regions but were not influenced by latitude or mean sea surface temperature. An analogous experiment with the NIS Ciona robusta, conducted at one sampling site, showed that the occurrence or absence of predation per site and water depth zone, but not the exact consumption rates, concurred between both bait types. Our results confirm that predation in SE Pacific temperate shallow waters mainly depends on benthic predators that cannot reach higher zones of the water column. These findings have far-reaching implications, as they indicate that predation rates in mid-latitude systems might be underestimated through commonly used water column-based experiments. For a comprehensive estimation of predation pressure in a given system, future studies should consider differences between vertical water zones.","We are very grateful to the representatives and people in charge of all marinas, ports, and aquaculture facilities that housed our experiments.

Approximately 1.35 million cubic meters of clay were released, a large volume liquefied, and debris was transported almost two kilometers downstream. An investigation following the slide determined that the slide was initialized in a 30-meter-high slope after 2-to-2,5-meter vertical erosion in a small creek running along the toe of the slope. After the initiation, the slide developed retrogressively in the order of 500 meters backward and sideways over a period of about 2 minutes. A conventional geotechnical slope stability analysis explains the initial slide. However, more advanced numerical tools are needed to simulate the retrogressive mechanism and the debris flow.

The theoretical X-ray peak profile analysis has been pursued through the Scherrer model, modified Scherrer model, modified Williamson–Hall model, size–strain plot model and Halder–Wagner model. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results in the crystalline nature of Ag NPs having nearer dodecahedron structure. The parameters including micro-strain, internal stress and energy density have been estimated for all reflection peaks of XRD. The findings show that the nano-crystalline size (NCS) estimated from all models is in reasonably good agreement.

We consider the background space to be described by the isotropic Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker geometry, the anisotropic Kantowski-Sachs and the anisotropic Bianchi III geometries. Across all these models, we establish that the field equations in f ( Q ) -cosmology exhibit second-order characteristics in the coincident gauge and those of a sixth-order theory in the non-coincident gauge. Specifically, within the latter scenario, the dynamic degrees of freedom are attributed to two scalar fields. Finally, as an example of integrability, we derive a vacuum cosmological solution within the non-coincident gauge.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Chilean brown seaweeds of economic importance, commonly known as kelps, constitute a multi-specific fishery with a workforce of 15,000 people. Four species of kelps are harvested from natural populations by artisanal fishers and exported to world markets as raw material for alginate extraction. On the other hand, copper mining production, contributes 36 % of GDP and it is the major Chilean export commodity. Due to the non-existence of entry barriers to seaweed extraction, this activity has become the sink for unemployment in northern Chile mainly from mining activity. In this context, our results show that when the price of copper is in a downward cycle, it negatively affects the abundance of brown seaweeds, due to the mobility of the workforce to the coastline, increasing the illegal harvest of these marine resources. In contrast, the upward cycle of copper decreases the harvesting pressure, removing illegal harvesters from the coastline and returning them to a mining industry and its suppliers with better wages. These drivers would generate a temporary window for recovery and restoration of brown algae populations, as well as the numerous ecosystem services provided by these engineering organisms.",,,Marine Policy,,,,2024-07,2024,,2024-07,165,,106191,Closed,Article,"Vásquez, Julio A.; Morales, Cristian; Vallone, Andrés","Vásquez, Julio A.

However, this rise has been accompanied by concerns of adulteration, often involving the fraudulent addition of sugars. Our study sought to compare the physicochemical and isotopic properties of various honeys available to Chilean consumers, assessing the extent of adulteration. Samples included honey produced from bees that fed on multiple flowers and those fed by ulmo flowers – an endemic species of South America that produces a high-quality, high-cost honey – and analyzed for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The analysis of ash content (%), moisture (%), pH and total phenolic content (mg GAE/100 g honey) found little obvious differences among honeys regardless of the feeding flowers (multifloral vs ulmo), type of purchase market (formal vs informal) or origin of the honeys (Central vs Southern Chile). However, the use of stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) of honey provided a powerful means to identify the degree of adulteration prior to the point of sale. Multifloral honeys purchased at informal markets were all adulterated, and ulmo honeys included both the least and most adulterated honeys. Regarding their antimicrobial activity, most multifloral honeys were less effective than ulmo honeys. Notably, while multifloral honey activity was independent of adulteration, the antimicrobial activity of ulmo honey was negatively affected by adulteration.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

To deal with the problem, governments in the region embarked on popular transformative agendas that included decontextualization and the removal of alleged problematic monuments from the public sphere. Such approaches have over the years received the backing of several scholars of heritage and history, who have often cited them as ones capable of offering ever-ending solutions to the issue. However, while recognizing the necessity of transformation, this article nevertheless argues that such a transformative agenda that is characterized by erasures of that which has been accepted as heritage in a particular phase of a country’s history is not a proper way of dealing with such symbols. First, such approaches create possibilities for heritage fundamentalism to filter into the domain of heritage. Second, such approaches were premised on the narrow argument that the notion of problematic heritage is only limited to cases of racial differences or between the former colonizers and the colonized. Instead, by using examples of case studies in one of the countries in the region, the article demonstrates that all heritage is subject to review, either by new political dispensations or by future generations. Hence, when dealing with symbols accepted as heritage, interpretation as opposed to decontextualization or destruction must be resorted to as a guiding framework. When this happens, heritage then ceases to be a platform of contestation and becomes one of continuity.",,"Funding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.",Journal of Heritage Management,,,,2024-04-11,2024,2024-04-11,2024-06,9,1,87-102,Closed,Article,"Magadzike, Blessed","Magadzike, Blessed (Salt River, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa)","Magadzike, Blessed (Salt River, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa)","Magadzike, Blessed (Salt River, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170653677,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4302 Heritage, Archive and Museum Studies",

Based on a reconstruction of the operational chains and the differential representation of their phases, we suggest that the final production, use, maintenance, and discard of large stemmed projectile points occurred at the site. Of the assemblage studied, nine (9) projectile points and one end-scraper were subjected to residue analysis using cross-over immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). Four positive reactions to antisera of human, camelid (guanaco or vicuña) and canid (Andean fox) were recorded. The results are discussed based on the depositional context and the structure of the archeological record.

As an alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods that often suffer from a slow convergence to the target distribution, we propose the use of sequential Monte Carlo approaches, with different variants of particle filtering. These variants are tested on synthetic and real datasets, to showcase their applicability and effectiveness under a proper setup of the importance sampling strategy, visiting sequence, number of particles, block size and kriging neighborhood used. The real case study, which deals with the simulation of gold grades in a porphyry copper-gold deposit, shows that the multi-Gaussian model based on a non-monotonic anamorphosis better assesses uncertainty than the traditional model based on a strictly monotonic anamorphosis, and that a moving neighborhood implementation of sequential Monte Carlo approaches can be successful, opening the door to applications to large-size problems in spatial uncertainty modeling.","The authors acknowledge the funding by the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile, through postgraduate study scholarship ANID-Subdirección de Capital Humano/Doctorado Nacional/2022-21220317 (F.

Pregerminative treatments with various chemicals and hormones are routine procedures to break the seeds’ dormancy and stimulate crop germination. However, innovative techniques using nanoparticles (NPs) for seed priming are considered a potentially effective and efficient strategy to promote seed germination, nutrient delivery, and growth through impregnation. The present work aimed to synthesize iron oxide NPs (FeONPs) by a green method by using vegetal organic waste as a source of reducing and stabilizer agents for NPs formation, and then it was used to promote seed germination, growth, and biofortification of Solanum lycopersicum. The results indicate the effectiveness of orange peel waste for the one-step green synthesis of magnetite Fe3O4 NPs with an apparent spherical form and an average size of 13 nm determined with SEM analysis. The application of NPs as a nano priming (0.1–300 ppm) did not show significant changes in the germination development of tomatoes. However, positive effects on the growth of seedlings were observed with medium doses administered (10–50 ppm) because root length, stem length, and biomass were increased. In addition, an increase in the Fe and other micronutrients of both grain and seedlings was also observed, suggesting that nano priming with Fe3O4 NPs can stimulate the growth and Fe uptake of S. lycopersicum crops.Graphical Abstract","The authors thank the financial support of project IDeA I + D ID21I10130 funded by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) and Unidad de Equipamiento Científico- MAINI®-UCN”, DRX-FIC Regional 2008 EQU 25 Conicyt 2009.

We studied the Mejillones Fault (MF), located near one of the strategic ports in northern Chile. The MF is an active geological fault that extends 40 km in the N-S direction and is part of an extensive complex system of structures known as the Atacama Fault System (AFS). We built an S-wave tomography model using seismic ambient noise data that was recorded continuously in a dense network of stations from 2013 to 2015. The tomographic maps exhibited velocity anomalies that correlate with surface geology. We found lower velocities in the western part of the MF than in the eastern zone, with a shear wave velocity (Vs) of about 2.4 km/s, associated to fractured metamorphic rocks (Triassic) and marine sediments (Neogene-Quaternary). Higher velocities (Vs > 3.0 km/s) in the eastern part of the fault are related to igneous rocks from the Upper Jurassic. The difference in velocities between the western and eastern zones of the MF remained persistent in depth. The potential depth of the MF could be >5 km and delimits the boundary between 2 different geological zones. Intermediate Vs (∼2.8 km/s) at −23.25°, observed up to 4 km depth, can be associated with andesitic rocks deposited in an intra-arc basin (Upper Triassic) and accommodated by the MF over the last ∼200 Myr, evidencing the activity of this fault from Triassic to Quaternary.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We prove initially that, in the general case, when the objective function is proper and lower semicontinuous, each accumulation point of the sequence generated by the method, if it exists, is a limiting critical point of the function. Then, under the assumptions that the sectional curvature of the manifold is bounded above by some non negative constant and the objective function is quasiconvex we analyze two cases. When the constant is zero, the global convergence of the algorithm to a limiting critical point is assured and if it is positive, we prove the local convergence for a class of quasiconvex functions, which includes Lipschitz functions.","I am grateful to the Optimization Research Group at Institute of Mathematics and Statistic of the Federal Goias University (IME-UFG), Brazil, by the suggestions developed during the Optimization Seminars.

However, the inherent complexities in coordinating high-quantity, low-capacity reefers and low-quantity, high-capacity propulsion loads make efficient DG operation a challenge. This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based bilevel strategy to optimize diesel generator (DG) efficiency in electrified container ships (ECSs). Focused on real-time tracking of DGs’ optimal efficiency points, the scheme addresses economic dispatch and navigational reliability under complex maritime conditions. Furthermore, we propose an aggregated reefer cluster (RC) model and a refrigeration efficiency consensus algorithm. The RC model streamlines reefer flexibilities into an additive, thermal-balance-based representation, thus avoiding temporal coupling issues. The algorithm ensures rapid, constraint-compliant optimization of loads.

Specifically, we consider the Kantowski-Sachs and locally rotational Bianchi III geometries to describe the physical space. By analyzing the phase-space, we reconstruct the cosmological history dictated by f(Q) gravity and comment about the theory’s viability. Our findings suggest that the free parameters of the connection must be constrained to eliminate nonlinear terms in the field equations. Consequently, new stationary points emerge, rendering the theory cosmologically viable. We identify the existence of anisotropic accelerated universes, which may correspond to the preinflationary epoch.","A. D.

Game-based learning is a useful tool for learning economic theory due to the instruction of knowledge and skills training in an environment that simulates real-world situations. Aims This study established university students' perceptions of and reflections on non-digital learning activities based on long-term market games in the classroom. Sample Participants were 192 undergraduate students. Methods The Mercadito is a competitive classroom market game that invited students (household role) to lease their economic factors of production and, with their payment, consume the goods and services offered by other students (company role). A qualitative study was conducted (n = 27). Data were collected through focus groups and in-depth semi-structured interviews. The information was transcribed, coded, and analysed by the saturation of information principle. Results The students highlighted Mercadito as a dynamic and didactic learning activity that reflected the reality of the economy. Other reflections highlighted that (a) indebtedness allows access to consumption, while payment strategies are sought, (b) inequality is not only an economic issue, and (c) competition in the market must be ensured so that benefits are received by both households and companies. Conclusions Students perceived behaviours such as solidarity, honesty, and collaboration, and other opposites such as collusion, cheating, and unbridled ambition. Mercadito also showed potential as a laboratory for predicting socio-economic behaviours both in local economies and in countries with different economic systems.","Acknowledgment Niris Cortés, José Bakit, Valeria Burgos-Fuster, and Mónica Castillo-Rosales, thanks to a Diploma of Higher Education of UCN for advice and technical support.","The study was funded by the ""Fondo de Desarrollo de Proyectos Docentes de Pregrado"" of the Universidad Católica del Norte.",Learning and Instruction,,,,2024-12,2024,,2024-12,94,,102007,Closed,Article,"Cortés, Niris; Bakit, José; Burgos-Fuster, Valeria; Araya-Piñones, Angelo; Bonilla, Enzo; Veas-García, Paulina; Jorquera, Mario; Castillo-Rosales, Mónica","Cortés, Niris (Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Bakit, José (Departamento de Acuicultura, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile; EqualSea Lab-CRETUS, Department of Applied Economics, University of Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Spain); Burgos-Fuster, Valeria (Dirección de Innovación Docente y Desarrollo Curricular - DIDDEC, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Araya-Piñones, Angelo (Programa de Magister en Gestión Ambiental, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Bonilla, Enzo (Escuela de Prevención de Riesgos y Medioambiente, Facultad de Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Veas-García, Paulina (Escuela de Educación, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Jorquera, Mario (Instituto de Políticas Públicas, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile); Castillo-Rosales, Mónica (Departamento Estudiantil, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)","Bakit, José (Catholic University of the North; University of Santiago de Compostela)","Cortés, Niris (Catholic University of the North); Bakit, José (Catholic University of the North; University of Santiago de Compostela); Burgos-Fuster, Valeria (Catholic University of the North); Araya-Piñones, Angelo (Catholic University of the North); Bonilla, Enzo (Catholic University of the North); Veas-García, Paulina (Catholic University of the North); Jorquera, Mario (Catholic University of the North); Castillo-Rosales, Mónica (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175433075,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,10 Reduced Inequalities

To address its quasiparticle band structure and excitonic effects on its optical absorption spectrum, we carry out ab initio calculations based on many-body perturbation theory within the GW-Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) framework. Our results reveal a quasiparticle band gap of 1.05 eV by employing the eigenvalue self-consistent GW approach, corroborating its potential in optoelectronics. The band gap exhibits an anomalous negative dependence on temperature, verified through the band gap pressure coefficient. Acoustic phonon-limited scattering analyses indicate an ultrahigh hole mobility of ∼87 × 104 cm2 V–1 s–1 along the [010] direction. The most prominent absorption peak of monolayer penta-NiN2 is associated with resonant excitons, corresponding to transitions from the valence band maximum to conduction band minimum + 2, which is explained by analyzing the state symmetry of the band edges. Hence, this pentagonal 2D semiconductor exhibits compelling and promising properties deserving deeper exploration in infrared optoelectronics and high-speed devices.","E.M.Jr. acknowledges the financial support from the Brazilian agency FAPESP, grant nos. 20/13172-8 and 2017/02317-2.

The knowledge of its natural and cultural resources was assembled by scientific expeditions defining and configuring what we understand as a ‘desert,’ a peripheral empty and arid space ready to be occupied and exploited. The irruption and expansion of capitalist extractivism created a particular idea of landscape and reconfigured its socio-political contours. Archaeological, scientific, and artistic expeditions actively participated in this ‘becoming desert’ process. This article examines some trajectories constituting the Atacama Desert as an extractive and sacrificial territory. We propose the notion of ‘surrealistic landscapes,’ and we use the poetry of the Chilean Canadian poet Ludwig Zeller to highlight the surreal condition of contemporary materialities, constantly feeding the archaeological imagination of Atacama.","The authors thank Beatriz Hausner, Arni Brownstone, Justin Jennings, Tiziana Gallo, the editors, and anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.","This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico (FONDECYT, ANID Chile) [grant number 11220113].",Landscape Research,,,,2024-05-28,2024,2024-05-28,2024-08-17,49,6,851-866,Closed,Article,"Rivera, Francisco; Galaz-Mandakovic, Damir","Rivera, Francisco (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile; The Archaeology Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Galaz-Mandakovic, Damir (Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile)","Rivera, Francisco (Catholic University of the North; University of Toronto)","Rivera, Francisco (Catholic University of the North; University of Toronto); Galaz-Mandakovic, Damir (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172145465,33 Built Environment and Design; 41 Environmental Sciences; 44 Human Society,

One of the industries that produces a larger amount of polluted wastewater is aquaculture. The aim of this research is the evaluation of the use of a novel treatment line consisting of coagulation/flocculation, filtration, advanced oxidation by ozone/solar photo-Fenton, and membrane distillation (MD) arranged in series to treat wastewater coming from the wash of a Chilean aquaculture facility of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus. In the pretreatment section, the use of a flocculant based on polyacrylamide improved the removal of suspended solids up to 86 %, higher than that achieved with FeCl3. Combining the effects of the oxidation and separation stages, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was reduced up to 97 % in a single pass. Moreover, salt rejection in MD was higher than 99.8 %, which allowed to obtain freshwater with acceptable quality. Permeate flux was almost constant around 18 L/h/m2, suggesting that no permanent fouling was formed onto the membrane surface. The treatment line presented in this work allows therefore to deal with highly contaminated wastewaters, contributing thus to an appropriate waste management and avoiding severe environmental damages.","Declaration of competing interest All authors have participated in (a) conception and design, or analysis and interpretation of the data; (b) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and (c) approval of the final version.

226,pub.1170978698,10.1007/s10933-023-00310-y,,,Paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic dynamics of the Subtropical Andes of Argentina (35° S) during the last 3000 years,"The most recent IPCC report indicated that the Subtropical Andes (32°–35° S) are one of the world areas undergoing a strong tendency towards more arid conditions due to current climate change. The winter precipitation that falls on the Andes, related to the Southern Westerlies System (SWS), is the main source of water for central Chile and west central Argentina, making it a fundamental socioeconomic resource. The few long-term records of the eastern slope of the Subtropical Andes do not permit establishing the long-term natural climate variability or determining if this trend does or does not respond to natural forcings. This study therefore presents a centennial and sub-centennial scale reconstruction of the paleoenvironmental dynamics of the eastern slope of the Subtropical Andes during the last 3000 cal yrs BP, based on the pollen record of the Laguna Corazón (LCO; 35.13° S; 2200 m a.s.l.), in order to establish the different regional paleoenvironmental scenarios. The sedimentary record (182 cm) is mostly composed of laminated dark brown clay, and includes a 21–24 cm layer preliminarily associated with the 1932 AD eruption of the Quizapú volcano. The LCO record shows the development of a grass steppe associated with high-Andean shrubs between 3000 and 2440 cal yrs BP, suggesting slightly more humid conditions than present. From 2440 to 1110 cal yrs BP, there was continuous presence of the grass steppe along with high-Andean and Patagonian low shrubs, indicating moderately more humid conditions than today. The development of a grass steppe with low high-Andean shrubs from 1110 to 320 cal yrs BP reflects conditions slightly more humid that at present, showing a progressive decrease in humidity between 900 and 320 cal yrs BP. Since then, environmental conditions were similar to present ones, associated with the climatic variability at sub-centennial timescale. In the last 320 cal yrs BP, the record shows the presence of introduced species as a consequence of the occupation of the valley to raise livestock, and more recently, tourist activities. These environmental/climatic patterns are similar to those recorded for the western slope of the Subtropical Andes for the Late Holocene, indicating a regional forcing related to the winter precipitation associated with the SWS.","We thank the Company Valle de Las Leñas S.A. for allowing us to work in Valle Hermoso, especially the efforts of geologist Luis Ballarini.

Central Chile is an emblematic case study for mediterranean ecosystems, where a progressive and sustained population increase began approximately 2000 years ago alongside significant landscape changes. In this work we analyzed regional paleo-demographic trends by compiling a new database of archaeological dates over the last 3000 years, and integrating population dynamics theory with an analysis of the spatio-temporal variation of regional cultural stages. Results show three moments of marked acceleration in population growth: just before agricultural adoption, during the Archaic Period (c. 700-300 BCE); during the second half of the ECP (500–900 CE); and during the Late Intermediate Period (1200–1400 CE). We also identified periods of deceleration in per capita growth rates, although population size continued to increase (300 BCE−500 CE, 900–1200 CE and after 1400 CE). These large shifts in the per capita growth rates coincide with major cultural changes associated with social and economic aspects. The pulses of major occupation show in general terms a more intensive use of the valleys as the population size increased, although the remaining ecosystems never ceased to be occupied with different economic and symbolic emphases.","We thank Hernán Ávalos, Nuriluz Hermosilla, Ariadna Cifuentes, Arturo Sáez, Jaime Vera and Fernanda Falabella for help in obtaining original radiocarbon/TL dates and unpublished archaeological site coordinates.

Nowadays, most techniques integrate multiple layers of information and use machine learning for both data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches. This study introduces a novel and generalised methodology for comparing different layers of information by using superpixels instead of pixels to identify similarities. This methodology provides an enhanced statistical representation of regions, facilitating and enabling effective comparisons. Three different statistical distance measures were considered: Kullback–Leibler divergence, Wasserstein distance and total variation distance. We apply the proposed process to data from the Antofagasta region of northern Chile, a well-known area for metallogenic belts, that contain notable copper reserves. Each metric was used and compared, resulting in different similarity maps highlighting interesting mineral exploration areas. The study results lead to the conclusion that the proposed methodology can be applied at different scales and helps in the identification of areas with similar characteristics.",,"This work was funded by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) PIA-Project AFB230001, FONDEF ID21I10022 and FONDEF IT23I0131.",Natural Resources Research,,,,2024-07-24,2024,2024-07-24,,,,1-18,Closed,Article,"Navarro, Felipe; Díaz, Gonzalo; Ojeda, Marcia; Garrido, Felipe; Comte, Diana; Ehrenfeld, Alejandro; Egaña, Álvaro F.; Palma, Gisella; Maleki, Mohammad; Sanchez-Perez, Juan Francisco","Navarro, Felipe (ALGES-AMTC, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Díaz, Gonzalo (ALGES-AMTC, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Ojeda, Marcia (ALGES-AMTC, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Garrido, Felipe (ALGES-AMTC, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Comte, Diana (AMTC-DGF, FCFM Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Ehrenfeld, Alejandro (ALGES-AMTC, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile); Egaña, Álvaro F.

This study addresses the problem of modeling alumina and silica grades in a layered bauxite deposit using three geostatistical approaches. The first one is the direct approach, where grades are cokriged inside the mineralized layer interpreted by geologists; the second one (indirect approach) substitutes the grades with the layer thickness and accumulations as service variables; the third approach trades the traditional random field representation for a deterministic representation to jointly predict the alumina and silica grades inside the mineralized layer, based on an innovative technique called transitive cokriging. A comparative analysis of the results highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, in terms of data preparation, geological modeling, and mineral resources modeling. The study concludes that the transitive approach is a promising alternative for mapping ore grades in deposits with narrow dimensions, due to a more congenial structural analysis and a reduced smoothing effect in comparison with the direct approach, while it avoids scaling down the representation of the deposit to two dimensions as in the indirect approach.","The authors acknowledge the funding by the National Agency for Research and Development of Chile, through grants ANID Fondecyt 11220464 (M.

Empirical evidence from the Brazilian context considering the relation between competences and technologies,"Purpose Manufacturing systems have undergone radical changes because of the implementation of physical and digital innovating technologies with high levels of connectivity, interoperability and autonomy. In this regard, the objective of this study was to investigate whether industrial engineers graduated in recent years in Brazil are prepared or not to work in companies and industries within the scope of Industry 4.0 technologies in a way that they positively contribute to the implementation and management of such technologies.   Design/methodology/approach To achieve these objectives, a literature review and a survey on managers of the industrial sector acting in Brazil were carried out as the research strategies. The data collected were analyzed through a quantitative approach by means of the structural equations modeling method.   Findings The hypothesis that the competencies of industrial engineers currently graduating in Brazil have a positive impact on the implementation and management of Industry 4.0 technologies has been confirmed. Predicting the evolution of production scenarios, understanding the interaction between organizations and their impacts on competitiveness and keeping abreast of technological advancements, organizing them and putting them to the service of business and societal demands were the competencies that obtained the highest factor loadings in the construct of industrial engineer competencies. In addition, cloud manufacturing, automation and robotization were the competencies that obtained the highest factor loadings in the industry 4.0 construct.

An example of this is the scallop culture industry, which uses potable for washing systems and generates wet sludge. The water contained in this waste evaporates and is released into the atmosphere in the form of unused steam. In order to evaluate the recovery of this water, the use of two sizes of heat exchanger (10- and 16- tube configuration) and Peltier modules (2 and 4 plates) to condense the vapour was studied. For this, an adapted humidification-dehumidification process (HDH) with a closed water-open air cycle was used in areas of water scarcity, such as northern Chile, where scallops are farmed. The volume of water recovered with the heat exchanger was higher with the 16-tube system than with the 10-tube system, obtaining total volumes of 2000 mL and 1680 mL, respectively. The highest gained output ratio (GOR) values achieved with the 10- and 16-tube heat exchangers were 2.2 and 2.6, respectively. In the case of the Peltier modules, the GOR values were 0.27 and 0.25 with 2 and 4 plates, respectively. The electrical conductivity of the condensate was 163 μS/cm. The condensation performance of the processes was 0.915 and 1 for the heat exchangers with 10 and 16 tubes, respectively and, 0.063 and 0.145 for Peltier modules with 2 and 4 plates, respectively. Economically, HDH with Peltier plate dehumidifiers required a lower investment than tube heat exchangers: Peltier modules with 2 and 4 plates required 0.00058 and 0.00054 US$/L, respectively, and heat exchangers with 10- and 16- tubes required an investment of 0.00029 and 0.00027 US$/L, respectively. However, when the investment, operational costs and recovery time were referred to as reclaimed water units, the performance was better for tube heat exchanger dehumidifiers.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

 HKUST-1 MOF and HKUST-1-based compounds have been employed to develop active photocatalytic materials; however, a deep understanding of several fundamental physicochemical properties to explain the photocatalytic activity of these materials is limited. Several physicochemical properties of HKUST-1 were studied through experimental and computational approaches to determine its (photo)electrochemical (PEC) properties and applications. These properties were correlated with the structural features of the material and the photocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. A meticulous characterization confirmed the synthesis of HKUST-1 using a slow evaporation methodology. XRD measurements revealed a large crystallite size (≈123 nm). Meanwhile, UV-vis spectroscopy, electrochemical measurements, and DFT calculations allowed us to identify three fundamental issues that limit the photocatalytic activity of HKUST-1: (i) a low relative permittivity of the semiconductor ( ε r ), (ii) a wide bandgap value, and (iii) a low reduction potential for the conduction band (CB). The issues mentioned above are related to high porosity, a small conjugated system, and the presence of open metal sites in the secondary building units (SBU) that constitute the CB, respectively. Instability problems are also related to the decrement of the observed open metal sites. Regarding PEC measurements, it was determined that HKUST-1 is an n-type semiconductor suitable for photocatalytic reduction or PEC oxidation processes, however, it presents recombination issues. Determining the relative permittivity for HKUST-1 through computational tools provides an accurate methodology to calculate the density of charge carriers ( N D ) through the Mott–Schottky equation. The measurements and analysis presented in this work point out the main issues responsible for low photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and suggest the employment of HKUST-1 in PEC oxidation processes.","We would like to thank “Núcleo de Investigación No. 7 UCN-VRIDT 076/2020, Núcleo de modelación y simulación científica (NMSC)” and supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC (ECM-02) for the scientific support.

In this study, the influence of composition on the structural and thermodynamic properties of Cu–Ag–Au nanoalloys with 5083 atoms is analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. Relevant thermodynamic quantities are used to describe the melting and solidification behaviors of three models of Cu–Ag–Au nanoalloys. Our results indicate that the melting temperature presents linear and quadratic dependencies with the composition, i.e. for Cu33Ag 67−x Au x , Ag33Cu 67−x Au x , and Au33Ag 67−x Cu x are Tm=912.6+1.9x , Tm=882.3+2.7x , and Tm=1056.6−4.9x+0.07x2 , respectively. In addition, most Ag atoms segregate to the surface and the Au and Cu atoms are localized in the center of the nanoalloy during the heating process, and this trend is maintained in the cooling process. The solidification temperature does not have an explicit correlation with the composition. Furthermore, the structural analysis of cooled nanoalloys exhibits local FCC and HCP symmetries, and the excess energy shows that Cu33Ag27Au40, Au33Ag17Cu50, and Ag33Cu37Au30 are relatively more stable to form nanoalloys. Finally, the possibility of controlling the composition in these metal nanoalloys opens up potential applications in plasmonic, catalysis, and bactericidal (by Ag surface segregation) fields.","All simulations were performed in Workstations of the Facultad de Ciencias Físicas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, and the Departamento de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú.

The use of highly diluted bioactive compounds (HDBC) has emerged as a novel and prophylactic strategy to improve gonad development, reproduction bioenergetics, and oocyte quality of marine bivalve broodstock. This study evaluates the effect of HDBC formulas to enhance the laboratory-controlled breeding capacity of Modiolus capax adult mussel, selected as a model organism because of its aquaculture potential as an alternative seafood resource. The experimental design included three replicates of three HDBC treatments at 31Centesimal (1 × 10−31) dynamizations using distilled water as the final excipient (TR1: SiT, CaS, HeS; TR2: PhA, FeP, ZnP; and TR3: ViP, ViA, ViT), and two control treatments: C+ hydro-alcoholic solution at 1% (Usual HDBC vehicle) and C- (distilled water) during a 30-day period. As a result, TR1 enhanced energy reserves (lipids and carbohydrates) in all tissues; TR2 promoted an increase in lipid and carbohydrate content in the gonad and their transfer into developing oocytes; TR3 significantly improved gonad development and reproductive capacity of the mussels with the highest proliferation of mature oocytes, enhancing food-nutrient assimilation and energetic reserve transfer from the somatic tissues to the ovary. Additionally, all HDBC formulas recorded a lower (P < 0.05) number of atretic oocytes compared to the untreated animals. This evidence reflects a simultaneous improvement of gametogenesis and energy budget of M. capax broodstock, ensuring sexual maturation and higher-quality oocytes when HDBC are used.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Despite their economic value and known conservation concerns, only a few genetic and no genomic resources exist for these two species. In this study, we assembled and described the complete mitochondrial genomes of Mustelus canis and M. norrisi. The mitochondrial genomes of M. canis and M. norrisi are 16,758 bp and 16,769 bp in length, respectively. Both mitogenomes are A + T rich and contain 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a control region (CR) 1122 bp and 1121 bp in length, respectively. Mitochondrial synteny observed in M. canis and M. norrisi is identical to that previously reported for congeneric species. In the studied mitochondrial genomes, all PCGs experienced purifying selection. In both species, 21 of the 22 tRNA genes exhibited a typical ‘cloverleaf’ secondary structure, except trnS1 that lacked a complete D-arm. The CR of the studied species lacked tandem repeats, but abundant A + T rich dinucleotide microsatellites were detected. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses based on translated PCGs supported the monophyly of the family Triakidae. The same analyses indicated that the genus Mustelus was not monophyletic considering that all representatives of the genus Mustelus clustered together with Triakis megalopterus in a fully supported clade. The assembled mitochondrial genomes will aid with the accurate identification of specimens belonging to the genus Mustelus and support biomonitoring programs based on environmental DNA (eDNA).","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

223,pub.1169187426,10.1111/ijal.12546,,,Can EFL teaching help revitalize the Aymara language and culture? Exploring EFL teachers' practices from Northern Chile,"Abstract Under the premise that revitalization can be attained through multi‐, inter‐, or transdisciplinary fields, this article posits that teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) can aid in revitalizing the Aymara, an indigenous community in Northern Chile, to avoid their cultural and linguistic extinction. This qualitative study explored how EFL teachers’ practices can contribute to revitalizing the Aymara culture and language in schools located in Northern Chile. Ten teachers participated in individual semi‐structured online synchronous interviews and a group interview. The findings revealed two types of practices: (a) non‐intercultural teaching practices that were mediated by personal, educational, and institutional factors, and (b) approximations of intercultural teaching practices where the teachers valued and included Aymara culture, yet they did not generate spaces for intercultural dialog in the classrooms. The study concludes that the approximations of intercultural teaching practices contribute to an initial stage in revitalizing indigenous languages and culture, an implication that should be considered valuable in teacher education programs and the EFL classroom.
Resumen Bajo la premisa de que la revitalización puede lograrse a través de campos multidisciplinarios, interdisciplinarios o transdisciplinarios, este artículo sostiene que la enseñanza del inglés como lengua extranjera (ILE) puede ayudar en la revitalización de los Aymara, una comunidad indígena en el norte de Chile, para evitar su extinción cultural y lingüística. Este estudio cualitativo exploró cómo las prácticas de los profesores de ILE pueden contribuir a revitalizar la cultura y lengua Aymara en escuelas ubicadas en el norte de Chile. Diez profesores participaron en entrevistas individuales sincrónicas en línea semi‐estructuradas y una entrevista grupal. Los hallazgos revelaron dos tipos de prácticas: a) prácticas de enseñanza no interculturales mediadas por factores personales, educativos e institucionales, y b) aproximaciones de prácticas de enseñanza interculturales donde los profesores valoraban e incluían la cultura Aymara, pero no generaban espacios para el diálogo intercultural en las aulas. El estudio concluye que las aproximaciones de prácticas de enseñanza interculturales contribuyen a una etapa inicial en la revitalización de las lenguas indígenas y la cultura, una implicación que debería considerarse útil en los programas de formación docente y en el aula de ILE.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,,International Journal of Applied Linguistics,,,,2024-02-25,2024,2024-02-25,2024-08,34,3,920-935,Closed,Article,"Riquelme‐Sanderson, Michel; Ramos‐Leiva, Lucía; González‐Estay, Celia","Riquelme‐Sanderson, Michel (Facultad de Ciencias Humanas, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile); Ramos‐Leiva, Lucía (Facultad de Humanidades, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); González‐Estay, Celia (Facultad de Ciencias Humanas, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile)","Riquelme‐Sanderson, Michel (Arturo Prat University)","Riquelme‐Sanderson, Michel (Arturo Prat University); Ramos‐Leiva, Lucía (Catholic University of the North); González‐Estay, Celia (Arturo Prat University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169187426,"39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

Plants acclimate to drought by mechanisms like stomatal closure and osmotic adjustment. Maternally inherited symbiotic microorganisms with capacity to regulate these mechanisms have the potential to influence intergenerational plant drought responses. We studied how a seedborne endophyte affects maternal drought effects on seed germination water requirements and specialized metabolites. Isotopic analysis of seed cellulose indicated that drought led to improved water use efficiency (WUE; higher δ13C) in endophyte-free mother plants, seemingly without affecting stomatal conductance (non-significant δ18O change). Alternatively, endophyte-symbiotic plants did not exhibit a change in WUE but apparently an increase in stomatal conductance (significant δ18O decrease). Regardless of the symbiosis, drought reduced seed production but not seed size. Endophyte symbiosis improved the seed concentration of mannitol and sorbitol, but this increment was higher under drought. Maternal plant responses to drought did not increase seed germination under reduced water potential but induced dormancy in seeds from endophyte-free but not endophyte-symbiotic plants. Our findings suggest that although differential accumulation of metabolites in seeds results from how endophyte-symbiotic plants perceive and respond to drought, this response may not form part of a mechanism that would enhance seed performance of progeny under drought.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A strong genetic basis for the resistance of A. purpuratus larvae to vibriosis has been demonstrated, which is associated with an efficient energy metabolism and immunocompetence. However, various factors, including the microbiota composition, have a notable impact on the outcome of an infection in numerous animal models, affecting their resistance. In this context, we aimed to explore the possible contribution of host-associated bacteria to the resistance of scallop larvae to Vibrio bivalvicida VPAP30. To achieve this, we isolated culturable bacteria from four scallop families displaying contrasted resistance to VPAP30 infection. We taxonomically assigned 75 bacterial isolates by 16S rDNA sequencing, and we found that 34 isolates were exclusively associated with resistant larvae. Then, 8 isolates were pre-selected as potential probiotics based on their exclusivity to the resistant families and bibliographic records of their use. Results highlighted three isolates displaying potential, belonging to the genera Psychrobacter, Hydrogenophaga, and Shewanella. The three isolates displayed in vitro antagonistic activity against VPAP30 and a protective effect on scallop veliger larvae against infection. We observed three main aspects of this protective effect: scallop larvae pretreated with each of the three probiotic candidates showed (i) no mortality after 24 h infection, (ii) an earlier induction of immune pattern recognition receptors, and (iii) no increase in total Vibrio spp. counts after infection with VPAP30. The findings demonstrated that scallop larvae resistant to vibriosis carry distinct bacteria possessing probiotic properties suitable for the rearing of scallop larvae. This study reinforces the significance of host resistance-related microorganisms as a potential source for discovering novel endogenous probiotics with biotechnological applications.","Declaration of Competing Interest Paulina Schmitt reports financial support was provided by National Agency for Research and Development.

Spain is the second rice producer in the European Union (EU), geographically located in four autonomous communities contributing to the local economy. This study aims at assessing the productive efficiency of rice farms in this country. To our knowledge, no previous work has dealt with the performance of rice framers in the EU in general and in Spain in particular. We used the Generalized True Ramdom‐effects model to estimate the persistent and transient efficiency levels of farms and identifying the production risk factors using a sample of 158 rice farms over the period 2014–2017. Empirical findings reveal an overall efficiency level of 0.81 on average, mainly explained by the long‐term efficiency component. Moreover, results show an important room for efficiency improvement at the short‐term to enhance productive management skills of farmers. Finally, labor, fertilizer, water and insurance spending are likely to be risk‐decreasing factors.

They lack the features that appeal to the knowledge elite – at least from the perspective of Richard Florida’s influential work – and, therefore, face challenges to diversify their economy. The article deals with Antofagasta, which is the capital of one of the world’s most important mining regions. In recent years, considerable efforts have been undertaken in terms of “place branding” and “place marketing” so as to make Antofagasta more livable. Against the backdrop of narrative interviews, the author analyzes whether these efforts help to attract highly skilled professionals. A qualitative comparative analysis reveals that career opportunities are the key factor – a necessary condition for the knowledge elite to move to Antofagasta, not amenities or a pleasant lifestyle. The region’s general economic conditions are relevant too. The built urban and natural environment is much less important, although it matters to some interviewees. Most highly skilled professionals find that Antofagasta is not an attractive city to live in.

In this study, we utilised a physical-biogeochemical hindcast simulation (2002–2008) to investigate the sources of seasonal and interannual variability of mesozooplankton biomass within the upwelling zone of central-southern Chile. Monthly observations were obtained from an oceanographic time series conducted at Station 18 (36°30′S) off the coast of Concepción, Chile. The first step was to assess the coherence between model outputs and field observations of physical and biogeochemical variables, including the biomass of mesozooplankton. The factors accounting for the variation in biomass at Station 18 were then assessed. In the model, advective flows along the shore and across the shelf control the majority of biomass. The advection effect appears to be more pronounced during the upwelling season (austral spring-summer) than in winter, although it still significantly contributes to biomass variation during the latter. Our physical-biogeochemical model ROMS-PISCES applied on this EBUS showed that alongshore and cross-shelf advection play a crucial role in driving spatial and temporal variability in zooplankton biomass within the upwelling zone. Therefore, it is essential to consider these physical processes when interpreting observational data from fixed time series stations.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Ruben Escribano reports financial support was provided by Millenium Institute of Oceanography.

The heterostructures, prepared via a hydrothermal process, exhibit a heterogeneous connection between doped ZnO nanoparticles and the BT dielectric material with crystalline nature and chemical composition. Moreover, a significant reduction in the bandgap of the doped BT@ZnO:Ln heterostructures compared to undoped counterparts, indicating successful dopant incorporation and the creation of new sub-bands within the bandgap. A minimal adsorption interaction between SMX and the nanomaterials was observed. While BT alone exhibited limited photocatalytic activity, doping with ZnO significantly enhanced performance. Notably, the BT@ZnO:Yb heterostructure exhibited exceptional SMX degradation (99%) within 60 minutes. Incorporation of rare-earth ions (Eu, Er, Yb) not only improved photocatalytic activity but also acted as electron scavengers, mitigating electron-hole recombination. Furthermore, the investigation into the reuse of BT@ZnO:Yb 5%mol showed sustained high efficiency over three cycles. Mechanistic insights into SMX degradation pathways highlight the predominant role of hydroxyl radicals and electron-hole processes. Overall, these findings contribute significantly to the advancement of photocatalytic materials based on composites doped with lanthanide ions for applications in environmental wastewater treatment.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In the South Pacific, the Juan Fernández Archipelago (JFA) stands out for its high endemic biota, most of them endangered by human activities. Currently, two octopus species are recognized in JFA, but their taxonomic identity is not conclusive. In the present study, we performed morphometric and molecular analyses of both species inhabiting the JFA and contrast them with other species worldwide. Morphological, phylogenetic analysis, genetic diversity, and divergence times between species were estimated. Morphometric analysis did not show significant differences in body shape of males between/within Octopus species from JFA, only between females from different localities. However, phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses support the presence of two species in the JFA, namely Octopus mimus and Octopus vulgaris. In addition, both species show evidence of different divergence and colonization histories into the JFA during the Pleistocene. These findings do not only shed light on the identity, origin, and colonization time of the species, but also provide the basis to generate informed decisions on management and conservation. The recent colonization time and low genetic diversity observed in both species suggest that these populations are vulnerable to drastic changes, such as those caused by anthropic effects.Graphical abstract","We thank Alvaro Palma, Claudio González, Unai Markaida, Claudia Guerrero, and Cesar Salinas for their help with octopus tissue samples.

Accordingly, the current research paper aims to present a reliable instrumental unified earthquake catalog for the northern part of Algeria. This unified catalog is compiled using regional empirical relationships derived from converting different magnitude scales to an advanced physical-based moment magnitude scale suggested in the recent literature and denoted by Mwg. The regression methodology used in this study is called the New General Orthogonal Regression approach (N.GOR), which was selected since it is the most trustworthy procedure for scaling the magnitudes to Mwg. To highlight the significance of using the N.GOR, the obtained outcomes of the scaling relations were compared with those issued from the conventional general orthogonal regression (GOR) method, which is deemed to be the most dependable methodology used worldwide for magnitude conversion problems. The unified earthquake catalog was assembled from 1954 to 2022. Reliably converting the original magnitudes into homogenized moment magnitude leads to a complete and consistent unified earthquake catalog. Indeed, the unified moment magnitude catalog presented in this paper could provide reliable data for studying earthquakes distribution and the assessment of seismic hazards in the north of Algeria.","The authors would like to express their deepest gratitude to Dr. Assia Harbi (researcher at the Algerian CRAAG research center) for providing the CRAAG catalog for the northeast of Algeria.

Yet, it appears that many of these mega-projects already fail at the stage of implementation. The article deals with three problems that corridors face. Corresponding ideas are drawn from existing literature, and confirmed and expanded against the backdrop of a case study on the Bioceanic Corridor, which connects the central west of Brazil via Paraguay and Argentina to the north of Chile. First, there is a tendency to focus on opportunities and neglect challenges. Corridors often reflect unrealistic grand visions for the future. Second, these initiatives depend on territorial rescaling to sub- and supranational levels, but national governments bundle too much power. Third, being a means to facilitate integration into global value chains, corridors provoke disputes over gains.

211,pub.1174764991,10.1016/j.nanoso.2024.101294,,,Impact of fractal dimension and lateral correlation length on surface plasmon resonance activity in sputtered silver layers,"Fractal and optical characteristics of self-affine surfaces of silver(Ag) thin films deposited through direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering as a function of thickness are investigated and explored here. The surface morphology of Ag thin films is characterized by field emission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy technique. The cube counting algorithm is used to extract the fractal dimension of Ag thin film. The surface roughness (interface width) shows monotonic increases with film thickness, while the other parameters, such as lateral correlation length, roughness exponent, and fractal dimension exhibit linear variation with thickness. Our findings reveal distinctive scaling behaviors, with scaling exponents α, β, and 1/z indicating unique growth characteristics. The interface width w increases as a power law of thickness t, w ( t ) ∝ t β , with β=0.39± 0.007, and the lateral correlation length ξ grows as ξ t ∝ t 1 / z with 1/z=0.14± 0.002. The roughness exponent extracted from height-height correlation analysis is α=0.61–0.41. The self-affine nature of the Ag thin films is further confirmed by the autocorrelation function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to the confirm the growth of Ag thin film. Additionally, we have studied the role of fractal dimensions and lateral correlation length (ξ) on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag thin film. Our results indicate a red-shifting behavior of SPR with increasing interface width (w), lateral correlation length (ξ), and fractal dimensions. This study suggests the significance of not only the roughness exponent and fractal dimension but also the local surface slope in SPR activity in Ag thin films.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This work was supported by ANID through Financiamiento Basal para Centros Científicos y Tecnológicos de Excelencia (Grant AFB220001), Chile.

This resource is of high commercial importance in central and southern Chile and is an artisanal fishery that operates mainly under an open-access regime. This resource provides the domestic market with direct food and the international market with raw materials for the alginate industry. In recent years, the algal population has exhibited a sharp increase in landings due to increased exports, which could negatively affect the sustainability of this fishery. In this study, the situation of the D. antarctica algae fishery on the coast of the Maule Region in central Chile during the last two decades (2000–2021) was evaluated using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) conceptual framework. The findings show that the dynamics of the fishery are influenced by high international demand, which has promoted an increase in landing (pressure) from 2005 to the present, with the maximum recorded in 2017, of 732 tonnes. This, as a reaction to driving forces constituted by social (increase in the number of fisher) and economic (first sale price) factors. Furthermore, the negative effects on the “state” of the resource population and the species with which it interacts have not been fully examined, and the negative economic “impacts” are a consequence of the reduction in fishermen's revenues, high percentage of informal labor, and the delayed “response” of the fishery's governance. Efforts should be redoubled to integrate —within a holistic analytical framework— the variables and interactions that improve our ability to understand and anticipate unexpected responses.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

All three steps of malting (hydration, germination, and drying), as well as the resulting malt's quality indicators, were evaluated. Conventional and ultrasound-assisted (25 kHz; 91 W/L, 20 °C) hydration were carried out, followed by germination, ethanol (99.5%) pre-treatment (immersion 30 min, 25 °C), and convective drying (50 °C, 1 m/s). Texture analysis demonstrated that the different stages of the malting process modify the structure and composition by increasing or decreasing the compression force in the grain. The ultrasound-assisted hydration improved the second hydration stage, where hydration resistances were greater, reducing hydration time by 38%; moreover, ultrasound accelerated the germination step with root growth 1.17 times greater. During drying, ultrasound-assisted hydration followed by ethanol pre-treatment, reduced drying time by 38.5% (barley) and 17.8% (malt). Both evaluated technologies, therefore, intensify the malting process. In addition, it was demonstrated that their use increased the alpha (9%) and beta-amylase (7%) activity in malt and modified paste and gel-forming properties of barley and malt flours. Therefore, these results suggest that the use of ultrasound improved hydration and germination processes, and ethanol pre-treatment accelerated the drying process because of improved mass transfer, both without negative impact on malt quality.","Declaration of competing interest The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.

In Chile, a predominantly supply‐focused approach involves training workers, especially in vulnerable groups, as it is believed that investing in human capital will align job demand and available skills. This subnational Chilean case study in the Coquimbo region delves into the factors influencing worker training and placement programme implementation, with a specific focus on stakeholders' perceptions. Through qualitative data from interviews and focus groups, the research seeks to explore subjective challenges, including individual perspectives, governance and structural factors. Various variables affect policy implementation at different levels. On the micro level, actor motivations like personal goals and financial incentives are crucial for policy design. Regional governance levels grapple with coordination difficulties that impact programme implementation. Collaboration among stakeholders like government agencies, educational institutions and employers is essential. Structural issues within the regional economy and the target population also pose challenges to policy implementation. The study suggests that a comprehensive policy approach that considers the interconnectedness of institutions, labour markets, skills and the various stakeholders involved in the process is vital to address the complexity of active labour policies at the local level in Chile.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS To the team of the Observatorio Laboral Región de Coquimbo and participants involved in the interviews.

Herein, FA is used in a solar photocatalytic system to deal with landfill leachates (LL), which is another challenging waste. The photocatalytic process is combined with coagulation-flocculation pretreatment and a compost-based biological post-treatment. FA was characterized initially, showing silicon dioxide (52.25%), aluminum oxide (36.99%), calcium oxide (6.92%), iron oxide (2.47%), and titanium dioxide (1.74%), as the main composing oxides. Also, FA had a low surface area (0.48 m2/g), and high thermal stability (<2% of weight loss at 1000 °C). At the same time, the characterization of LL indicated this is a very polluted liquid, due to its high content of chemical oxygen demand (COD, 8072 mg/L), humic acids (HA, 7320 absorbance at 254 nm), iron (3.1 mg/L), copper (258 mg/L), and a slightly basic pH (8.5). After the coagulation-flocculation pretreatment, the supernatant liquid was submitted to the photocatalytic process (FA/H2O2/sunlight), which removed ∼70% of COD. For the photocatalytic system, the effects of pH, H2O2 concentration, and FA dose were assessed; evidencing that the pH change from 3.0 to 6.0 affected the COD and HA removals strongly. Under proper operating conditions (i.e., FA: 2.0 g/L, H2O2: 2000 mg/L, and pH: 3.0), the photocatalytic process significantly decreased the sample toxicity (∼56%). Thereby, the resultant sample from the FA/H2O2/sunlight system was submitted (for 10 days) to the action of the compost-based biotreatment, comparing the use of non-adapted and adapted aerobic microorganisms. The adapted microorganisms exhibited a higher action, achieving removals of ∼68% and ∼9% for the metals (Fe and Cu) and COD, respectively. The results of this research work demonstrated the good suitability of FA-photocatalysis combined with a coagulation-flocculation pre-treatment and a compost-based biological post-treatment to face problematic landfill leachates.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

It focuses on investigating the barriers hindering the integration of these systems within companies, emphasizing the influence of these difficulties on quality management. A survey involving 86 Brazilian experts who had experience with management system integration in their respective organizations was conducted. Grey Incidence Analysis was employed to assess the survey results, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers and identification of the most critical. The results of this study highlight critical factors that impede management system integration. In terms of qualitative characteristics, employee engagement emerged as a significant barrier. Quantitatively, several key obstacles were identified, including the need to reduce inconsistencies between documents, processes, and procedures, consideration of organizational culture aspects, standardization of terms and concepts, experiences in waste mapping, and the promotion of communication and interaction with stakeholders. By harmonizing processes, reducing conflicts and developing a culture of collaboration and communication, organizations can address the main barriers related to integrated management systems and enhance quality management practices. This research contributes to shedding light on the challenges of integrating management systems, an area that has received limited attention in existing literature. By employing Grey Incidence Analysis in this context, we offer a novel approach to understanding and prioritizing the barriers to integration and their potential impact in quality management.",,This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [303924/2021-7 304145/2021-1].,Quality Management Journal,,,,2024-03-15,2024,2024-03-15,2024-04-02,31,2,102-116,Closed,Article,"de Oliveira Júnior, Gilberto Cassoli; Sigahi, Tiago F.

Despite the significant impact of these transformations on the local labor market equilibrium, there is limited knowledge about their effects on the employment and labor conditions of local workers. I aim to fill this gap by investigating the case of Antofagasta in Chile, the world's leading copper producing region. The recent transformations in the mining industry there have resulted in an increase in the number of workers commuting long distances, as well as the emergence of local suppliers providing mid- to low-quality services to the extractive sector, both of which have the potential to impact the industry's embeddedness and influence on the local economy and labor market. Although this research is focused on Antofagasta, the findings can be extrapolated to similar mining regions worldwide, such as those in Canada, Australia, and Russia. I demonstrate that the recent transformations within the mining industry significantly impact the labor conditions of local workers, and the region's susceptibility to copper price fluctuations, thereby limiting sustained and long-term socio-economic development in Antofagasta.",Declarartion of competing interest None.,,The Extractive Industries and Society,,,,2024-03,2024,,2024-03,17,,101431,Closed,Article,"Pérez-Trujillo, Manuel","Pérez-Trujillo, Manuel (Universidad Católica del Norte, Economics Department, Avenida Angamos #0610, Pabellón X-10, Piso4, 1240000 Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Pérez-Trujillo, Manuel (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168873586,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Design/methodology/approach Using a quantitative methodology, a survey was applied to 314 companies in order to analyze the results of their talent management in the DT process. DT is not only digitalization as demonstrated in this study. Talent management is the key piece that can facilitate or block achieving high levels of digital maturity.   Findings The study finds that the changes brought about by DT impact talent attraction, talent retention, and talent management in general, and also shows that digital transformation does not depend on digitalization, but rather that talent management is the key to either helping or preventing high levels of digital maturity being achieved.

An expert survey was conducted to assess eight critical factors for the integration of CE practices in supply chains. The collected data was analyzed using a modified version of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), specifically the Fuzzy TOPSIS class. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the results. The findings indicated that practices related to economic and risk management, cleaner production, top management support, and knowledge management were categorized as having medium maturity. Conversely, practices associated with governance, product development, infrastructure, and social and cultural changes are still in an early stage. This research provides insights for organizations by identifying areas of strength and areas requiring attention in the adoption of CE practices within Brazilian supply chains. Policymakers can use the findings to design targeted policies and incentives that encourage and facilitate the development of circularity in supply chains, thus promoting CE principles. This research highlights the importance of addressing specific factors related to CE practices within supply chains, providing a framework for further investigations and strategies to bridge the gap between CE and supply chain management. The findings suggest that there are social and cultural challenges associated with the adoption of CE practices, implying a need for awareness campaigns, education, and community involvement to drive positive social change and adoption of CE principles.",,The work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [304145/2021-1 and 303924/2021-7]; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior [88887.807766/2023-00].,International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Ecology,,,,2024-02,2024,2024-02,2024-07-03,31,5,611-625,Closed,Article,"Cazeri, Gustavo Tietz; Sigahi, Tiago F.

Building on the theory of planned behavior, this study examines the factors influencing actors in the Ecuadorian fruit and vegetable sector to transition towards a circular economy. Data are collected through an online questionnaire comprising 22 items related to an extension of the theory of planned behavior and 9 organizational characteristics. In total, 306 firms in the fruit and vegetable sector were surveyed. Confirmatory factor analysis and a structural equation model evaluated data fitness and tested the research hypotheses. An analysis of variance tested differences across firm types and chain stages. Results show that the intention to move towards a circular economy is strongly affected by the perceived behavioral control of actors, followed by attitude and social pressure. Although interorganizational coordination is of less influence for behavioral intention, it positively affects actors' perceived control. The results show that beliefs essentially drive circular economy intention. Moreover, large companies put more faith in their own abilities, knowledge and resources, while SMEs rely on the quality of business relationships to participate in a circular economy.",Declaration of Competing Interest No potential competing interest was reported by the authors.

201,pub.1167639583,10.1111/maps.14125,,,Dense collection areas and terrestrial alteration of meteorites in the Atacama Desert,"Abstract  In the last 15 years, more than 2700 meteorites have been recovered and officially classified from the Atacama Desert. Although the number of meteorites collected in the Atacama has risen, the physical and climatic properties of the dense collection areas (DCAs) have not been fully characterized. In this article, we compiled the published data of all classified meteorites found in the Atacama Desert to (i) describe the distribution by meteorite groups, (ii) compare the weathering degree of chondrites among different Atacama DCAs and other hot and cold deserts, and (iii) determine the preservation conditions of chondrites in the main Atacama DCAs in relation with the local climatic conditions. The 35 DCAs so far identified in the Atacama Desert are located in three main morphotectonic units: The Coastal Range (CR), Central Depression (CD), and Pre‐Andean Range/Basement. A comparison with reported weathering data from other cold and hot deserts indicates that the mean terrestrial weathering of Atacama chondrites (W1–2), displays less alteration than other hot deserts (W2–3) and resembles the weathering distribution of the Antarctic meteorites (W1–2). The highest abundance of Atacama chondrites with low weathering (≤W2) is localized in the CD (78.8%, N = 1435), which is protected from the coastal fog influence and seasonal rainfalls and displays the oldest surfaces in the Atacama Desert. The morphogenetic classification based on present‐day temperatures and precipitations of the main Atacama DCAs reveals similar regional/subregional climatic conditions in the most productive areas and a truly productive surface for meteorite recovery between 5% and 58% of the quadrangles formally defined for each Atacama DCA. Our morphogenetic classification lacks consideration of some meteorological parameters such as the coastal fog, so it cannot fully explain the differences in weathering patterns among CR chondrites. Future studies of chondrite preservation in the Atacama DCAs should consider other meteorological variables such as relative humidity, specific humidity, or dew point, in combination with exposure ages of meteorites and its surfaces.",Acknowledgments We are grateful to Rodrigo Martínez for all the discussion and the pictures of Atacama meteorites in situ.

201,pub.1172599902,10.1016/j.dark.2024.101547,,,Charged black holes by gravitational decoupling satisfying a non-local EoS,"In this work, we have constructed solutions for charged black holes through gravitational decoupling, using the Reissner–Nordstrom solution as a seed. As an additional condition to close the system, we have considered a non-local equation of state for the decoupler sector. As a result, our solutions possess the same event horizon as the Reissner–Nordstrom seed solution and depend on a free parameter, which happens to be the gravitational decoupling parameter, interpreted as a generic hair of the solution. It is demonstrated that for certain parameter values in the parameter space, the solution satisfies all energy conditions outside the event horizon. Furthermore, our solution does not contain extra singularities besides the already known essential singularity at r = 0 of the seed solution. To comprehend the behavior of test particles around our solution, potentially useful for comparison with observational data, we have conducted geodesic analysis for massive particles. Particularly, we find that the decoupling parameter plays a fundamental role in the periastron advance, as it increases, the advance angle grows. To complete the discussion, we have studied the quasinormal modes using the high-order WKB method, considering scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations (axial and polar). We find that once again, the decoupling parameter affects the frequency of the quasi-normal modes. Specifically, as it increases, the imaginary part becomes increasingly negative, indicating a greater damping of the signal. Finally, we found that generic hair breaks the isospectrality of the seed solution.","Declaration of competing interest The authors of this article hereby declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to the research, content, or financial aspects discussed in the manuscript.

The case of the red-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon rubricauda, as a model species","Oceanic seabirds have suffered population declines and extirpations due to human disturbance and still face multiple threats. Here, we assessed the potential genetic vulnerability of the red-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon rubricauda, a seabird species threatened by human disturbance and listed as ‘least concern’ by the IUCN. Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) we evaluated the genetic population structure of the red-tailed tropicbird throughout the Pacific Ocean using samples from 132 individuals from six islands. We sampled individuals from islands without human-related disturbance (non-impacted islands) and with human-related disturbance (impacted islands). Results of genome-wide SNP analyses were consistent with previous results using mitochondrial DNA sequences analyses. Genetic diversity did not differ between impacted and non-impacted islands, and low inbreeding estimates were detected for all colonies. The SNPs analyses confirmed a pattern of isolation by distance and significant inter-regional (Chile, Australasia, and Hawaiʻi) genetic structure, but revealed greater differentiation of tropicbirds in Hawaiʻi compared with Chile and Australasia. Within regions, our results further indicated significant differentiation between Rapa Nui and Salas & Gómez Island (Chile), and between Meyer and Phillip islands (Australasia) that was not detected using mitochondrial DNA analyses. Within Hawaiʻi, we found a lack of significant genetic differentiation between Oʻahu and Kauaʻi, separated by 200 km. Our findings indicated that red-tailed tropicbird colonies are at genetic risk due to limited dispersal among colonies which may reduce the fitness of the species in the long-term. We suggest that red-tailed tropicbird colonies are vulnerable to future population declines because recovery through immigration from other islands may be limited by geographic distance. Conservation actions will help preserve genetic diversity and discrete populations for this native seabird at colonies throughout the Pacific.","We are grateful to the Chilean Navy for transport to Salas &amp; Gómez Island.

However, there are shortcomings in its theoretical foundations, implementation, and implications for educational institutions. Therefore, this review aimed to analyze scientific articles that respond to the term's complexity from the scientific literature perspective in Scopus and Web of Science. A systematic literature review was conducted under PRISMA 2020, systematizing 74 documents. It was concluded that education for sustainable development is deconstructed under different perspectives and characteristics. Likewise, through critical analysis, the importance of higher education institutions and the role they must assume to contribute to sustainability was pointed out. Finally, the barriers and enablers of the implementation of the term under discussion were presented, systematizing these elements and turning them into factors to be considered during the implementation process. The aim is to encourage research that contrasts the theory presented and contributes to the theoretical strengthening of sustainability in HEIs.",Declaration of competing interest The authors report that there are no competing interests to declare.

The authors hypothesize that founders experience the tension between the social and commercial goals of their venture as a paradox rooted in their personal values.   Design/methodology/approach The authors surveyed 112 social enterprise founders in Chile and used structural equation modeling to test hypotheses about the relationship between self-transcendent values (i.e. promotion of others’ welfare and care for nature) and self-enhancement values (i.e. pursuing own interests and power over others) on a multidimensional scale of social venture performance.   Findings Self-transcendence and self-enhancement are distinct yet interrelated values that coexist within social venture founders (i.e. they constitute a paradox). Self-transcendence values negatively moderate the positive relationship between self-enhancement values and social venture performance.   Practical implications Mere benevolence is insufficient for effective social venturing; success depends on the founder’s self-enhancement values or their “drive” to succeed. Founder values can thus inform organizational design choices (e.g. tasks, team composition, structures and processes) and guide public and private investment decisions.   Originality/value This research empirically assesses the structure of hybrid personal identities, uncovering how the concurrent action of self-transcendence and self-enhancement values influences social venture performance. The authors challenge the belief that balancing social and commercial goals benefits social venture performance. Best-performing ventures are those whose founder’s exhibit high self-enhancement and low self-transcendence values.","The authors would like to express our deepest gratitude to Professor Tom Lumpkin for his invaluable contributions to this research.

In this regard, the present study aims to investigate the effects of climate change on the level of livability in Sistan and Baluchistan province, located in the southeast of Iran, which is facing severe climatic tensions. In this paper, daily climate data of temperature, humidity, wind, frost, and precipitation from 2000 to 2020 were analyzed temporally and spatially. From 2010 to 2019, the livability of this province's cities was also evaluated using the multi-criteria decision-making method. Geostatistical analysis methods were also applied to understand the relationship between climate and livability. The results showed that climatic drivers strongly influence the provinces of Sistan and Baluchistan. The northern regions of the province had the highest number of drought, frost, and windy days compared to the southern ones. But, the average humidity and temperature of the central and southern regions were assessed higher than the northern ones. Therefore, the above climatic features exerted different effects on the livability process. The livability situation results indicated that the cities' livability level was different in the studied years. Many cities had a downward trend. Also, based on spatial statistics analysis, the distribution of livability at the province level was uneven and clustered. In addition, the evaluation of the effect of climatic drivers on the livability of cities illustrated that there is a strong correlation between the humidity driver and the trend of livability (with a correlation of 0.35). However, the drivers of temperature, wind, frost, and drought (with correlations of 0.06, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.02) individually did not have a significant relationship with the livability trend. However, a combination of temperature-humidity (with a correlation of 0.3) and drought-humidity (0.31) drives greatly impacted the livability of the province's cities.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Cities,,,,2024-08,2024,,2024-08,151,,105114,Closed,Article,"Kashi, Seyed Mostafa Hedayatnezhad; Farrokhzadeh, Siamak; Baharvandi, Saba; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani","Kashi, Seyed Mostafa Hedayatnezhad (Faculty of Geography and Environmental Planning, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Iran); Farrokhzadeh, Siamak (IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, Netherlands); Baharvandi, Saba (Faculty of Geographical Sciences and Planning, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)","Kashi, Seyed Mostafa Hedayatnezhad (University of Sistan and Baluchestan); Farrokhzadeh, Siamak (IHE Delft Institute for Water Education); Baharvandi, Saba (University of Isfahan); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171715179,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,13 Climate Action

The effect of thickness on the deposited thin films and their morphological, fractal, optical and solar cell parameters have been extensively investigated. AFM results show that the Ag thin films are composed of different-size of nano-grains and the grain size increases with increasing thickness. Mono-fractal parameters, namely fractal dimension (Df) and Hurst exponent (H), were determined from the power spectral density function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicate that the deposited samples exhibit the presence of oxidation state of Ag (0) in thin films, confirming the stable structure. The optical analysis shows that the transmittance of the deposited thin films decreases with increasing thickness, on the other hand, the silver thin film with thickness of 20 nm shows surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) at 436 nm. Current-voltage (I–V) curves were measured in dark and under illumination mode at standard testing conditions, i.e., 300K, 1000 W/m2 and 1.5 AM global using a solar simulator. These measurement studies indicate that thicknesses are effectively impacts on photovoltaic performance. The calculated values of change in solar efficiency ( Δ η ) are 0.26, −0.20, −0.76 and −6.88 % for thin films with nominal thickness 0.5, 1, 2 and 20 nm respectively.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A survey was conducted with experts in sustainability reporting with extensive experience in the Brazilian corporate context. The analytic hierarchy process was employed to assign weights to the criteria, and a grey fixed weight clustering model was proposed to analyze the collected data. Clarity and accuracy received the highest weights, which is concerning given the quality observed in sustainability reports. A lower emphasis on timeliness in sustainability reporting reflects many companies' publishing practices, prompting more efficient reporting. The majority of respondents perceive the quality of information in sustainability reports from Brazilian companies as falling within the medium maturity range, suggesting significant room for enhancement. The originality of this study lies both in the methodological approach, which combines multicriteria decision techniques capable of incorporating uncertainty related to data on sustainability reports, as well as in the results that provide information for improving sustainability reporting practices. The findings provide a foundation for companies and policymakers to enhance sustainability reporting, particularly in developing nations, promoting transparency, accountability, and international standard compliance.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful for the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil) under the grants no. 304145/2021‐1 and no. 303924/2021‐7.,,Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management,,,,2024-04-05,2024,2024-04-05,2024-09,31,5,4298-4314,Closed,Article,"de Sousa, Isabela Caroline; Sigahi, Tiago F.

The f(T) theory constitutes a second-order theory of gravity, whose cosmological counterpart is delineated by a degenerate pointlike Lagrangian. To formulate the Hamiltonian function encompassing all constraints and degrees of freedom inherent to f(T) cosmology, we employ the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm. Subsequently, we determine the wave function of the universe and introduce a “probabilistic” interpretation.

184,pub.1174734874,10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103839,,,G20 countries’ progress on the 7th SDG under circular economy DEA model,"The purpose of this paper was to analyze the performance of the G20 nations in terms of efficiency and productivity concerning achieving the seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of providing affordable and clean energy between 2010 and 2019 under a circular economy framework. The diagnostic tools to measure included the output-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA, SBM) to determine efficiency and the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) to measure productivity. In the DEA model, renewable energy is the primary energy source as inputs and outputs as total Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions, electricity consumption, and renewable energy consumption. The results indicated that the efficiency and productivity of developed and emerging countries towards the 7th SDG targets were heterogeneous throughout the analysis. The results showed that among the G20 countries that ranked as efficient were emerging countries (South Africa, Brazil, India, and China). Developed countries have more to gain in efficiency by designing strategies with sustainable development and environmental policies consistent with CE actions than emerging countries. In addition, since productivity gains increased more due to efficiency changes than technology gains, as indicated by the MPI analysis, it seems reasonable to infer that strengthening research and development of resource-efficient technologies could help to reach the 7th SDG faster by increasing productivity through adopting new technologies. In the short run, all countries could benefit from a multilateral effort to reduce climate change and GHG emissions if developed countries provided technological support to emerging countries and the latter offered carbon credits to the former in exchange for measures to mitigate the emissions resulting from their rapid economic growth driven by capital investment.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming model is presented that maximizes the profit of small farmers in the production process of single-varietal extra virgin olive oil. The decisions are based on the geographical dispersion of the different olive growers and the oil concentration of the olive varieties in a certain period, which depends on the climatic conditions of each sector where the olives are cultivated. The mathematical programming model is applied in Coquimbo, Chile, using actual data collected from previous harvest seasons. The computational results of the optimization model indicate that transportation decisions impact olive harvesting and oil production decisions. It is concluded that cooperatives of small producers in the rural sector increase overall profits and reduce transportation costs and the number of kilometers traveled by at least 41% through a decentralized production process with mobile production plants.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank olive growers and the agronomists responsible for the PRODESAL-PADIS program for providing the data collected and for the feedback on the application case.

The results obtained reveal significant changes in projectile or weapons technologies throughout the sequence. This begins with projectile points whose measurements point to the predominance of the spearthrower-dart system during the Early Archaic, followed by the diversification and specialization of these technologies during the Middle Archaic, with a significant increase in the use of throwing and thrusting spears. In the Late Archaic, projectile point dimensions diminished significantly, displaying patterns that remained until the Early Formative. Nevertheless, during this last period some measurements decreased slightly, and a major change is detected in the haft width of stemmed points. Three alternate hypotheses are proposed for these last changes: 1) the presence of the bow-and-arrow system from the late Archaic onward; 2) the appearance of the bow-and-arrow system from the Early Formative only; 3) the reduction and standardization of spearthrower-darts, without the presence of the bow-and-arrow system until after the Early Formative. We argue that the first two hypotheses are the most plausible, although we consider the first to be the most likely.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The region was divided into 30 zones of 0.5∘$$0.5^\circ$$ latitude and 0.5∘$$0.5^\circ$$ longitude and non-extensive statistical physics was used. Both, the Sotolongo–Costa–Posadas (SCP) and Mathai models were deployed to analyze the magnitude-frequency distribution. A sub-division into cells of the catalog allowed to demonstrate that systems with value of q∼1$$q \sim 1$$ present exponential behavior, while it was expected to obtain q>1$$q > 1$$, by superimposing sub-systems supporting the superstatistical model. Thus, by subdividing the Coquimbo region into south and north, we found that in both zones the entropic index is greater than 1, q>1$$q>1$$, However, in the southern zone the long-range effects are greater than in the north, according to the value obtained, which means both sectors are well described under a nonextensive statistical model, be it the SCP model or the Mathai one. The entropic index is q>1$$q>1$$ and in both cases R2>0.99$$R^2>0.99$$. As the region is considered as a whole, the nonextensive statistical distribution is the more adequate one. With respect to probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, Mathai’s model proved to have the better fit. Thus, the frequency-interevent time distribution was used for different limit magnitude values. Our analysis showed that the probability occurrence of a seismic event in the region’s north is lower than in the south considering the same period. In the north the behavior is of Poissonian type.","The work of V.O was supported by “Dirección de Postgrados y Postítulos” Universidad de La Serena (PTE192132), as part of a thesis project.","The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the development of this research and preparation of this manuscript.",Pure and Applied Geophysics,,,,2024-04-25,2024,2024-04-25,2024-05,181,5,1427-1454,Closed,Article,"Ojeda, Valentina; Vega-Jorquera, Pedro; de la Barra, Erick; Palma-Chilla, Luis; Vidal, Luis; Saavedra, José; Pizarro, Alfredo","Ojeda, Valentina (Departamento de Física, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile); Vega-Jorquera, Pedro (Departamento de Física, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile); de la Barra, Erick (School of Business, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, CO, Chile); Palma-Chilla, Luis (Departamento de Física, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile); Vidal, Luis (Jumpitt Labs, Errázuriz 755, Ofice 603, Valparaíso, Chile); Saavedra, José (Albert Einstein College, Pampa Baja 3061, La Serena, Chile); Pizarro, Alfredo (Departamento de Física, Universidad de La Serena, La Serena, Chile)","Vega-Jorquera, Pedro (University of La Serena)","Ojeda, Valentina (University of La Serena); Vega-Jorquera, Pedro (University of La Serena); de la Barra, Erick (Catholic University of the North); Palma-Chilla, Luis (University of La Serena); Vidal, Luis (Jumpitt Labs, Errázuriz 755, Ofice 603, Valparaíso, Chile); Saavedra, José (Albert Einstein College, Pampa Baja 3061, La Serena, Chile); Pizarro, Alfredo (University of La Serena)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171112023,37 Earth Sciences; 3706 Geophysics,
182,pub.1172647259,10.1061/jenmdt.emeng-7332,,,Numerical Exploration of the Shielding Effect of Vegetation on Nearshore Structures under Wave Run-Up Loading,"Overland flow from inundation events (IEs) such as hurricanes or tsunamis produce destructive loading conditions on nearshore structures. The magnitude of this loading and its associated impact can be substantially reduced by the existence of natural and/or anthropogenic obstacles, such as planted vegetation patches or neighboring structures. This paper examines the shielding effects offered by onshore coastal vegetation to nearshore structures, by establishing a numerical framework in combination with statistical computing methods to explore how vegetation properties, such as density and, more important, geometry relative to a row of shoreline infrastructure elements, impacts the resultant IE loads and subsequently the structural vulnerability. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are first conducted to predict the intensity measures (IMs) of interest (momentum flux, free surface elevation, water pressure, and depth-averaged velocities, as well as base shear forces) on the shoreline structures for different excitation intensities (wave heights) and vegetation configurations. This information is used to develop a predictive model for the IMs using surrogate modeling techniques in order to expedite the succeeding risk assessment process. Gaussian process (GP) regression is specifically adopted as the surrogate modeling technique here, since it can accommodate noise in the training observations (CFD numerical errors) and quantify the associated predictive uncertainty (originating from the surrogate model) with minimal additional computational complexity. The spatial correlation between some of the examined IMs is explicitly addressed at the GP calibration stage. The developed predictive model is then used to estimate the structural vulnerability, with the surrogate model prediction errors explicitly considered when calculating the probability of exceedance for the different damage states, as warranted in such a vulnerability setting. Comparisons among different vegetation configurations, including the bare earth case, support an in-depth exploration of the impact of vegetation geometry on the shielding effects it can offer. Two case studies are examined, demonstrating applicability of the proposed framework for both system- and component-level vulnerability assessments.","This work was funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and by the National Science Foundation under Grants CMMI 17-09357 and CMMI-17-27662.

For this service, decision-makers must allocate the staff and route the visits as efficiently as possible. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we devise a new mixed-integer programming formulation that incorporates several industry-specific features, including matching patients to medical specialties and synchronized visits of multiple specialists. Moreover, the proposed formulation also includes three features that have not been tackled simultaneously in the previous literature: multiple time windows, mandatory lunch breaks at the hospital, and fast delivery of perishable biological samples. The proposed model can be reduced to a vehicle routing problem with multiple times windows, known as NP-hard. Therefore, for solving large instances, we design a heuristic procedure composed of a constructive heuristic coupled with an improvement heuristic, which builds on a local branching scheme. To test the applicability of our approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the actual operations of Hospital Padre Hurtado of Santiago, Chile. Our computational experiments show that the model provides fully implementable solutions. Moreover, the heuristic procedure provides high-quality routes (regarding quality and solution times), making it a promising alternative to experience-based scheduling methods and state-of-the-art solvers.","Acknowledgments Franco Basso gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the Complex Engineering Systems Institute, ISCI (grant ANID PIA/PUENTE AFB230002) and ANID-FONDECYT 617951.

This study investigates the potential of host-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as eco-friendly alternatives for pathogen control in aquaculture. Exploiting the scallop transcriptome, we identified sequences sharing common AMP features and designed a de novo peptide named helixidin, a 40-amino acid peptide with a net charge of +11 and a pI of 11.52. In addition, we designed an analog, N-ter ApBD Q13R, based on the hydrophobic domain of the scallop big defensin ApBD, with a glutamine-to-arginine substitution at position 13. N-ter ApBD Q13R is a 35-residue peptide with a net charge of +4 and a pI of 11.55. The synthetic peptides helixidin and N-ter ApBD Q13R adopted an alpha-helix secondary structure with an amphiphilic distribution of amino acid residues. Circular dichroism assays confirmed their structural stability across varying pH, osmolarity, and temperature conditions. Moreover, these peptides displayed potent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, in the case of helixidin causing cell wall and membrane disruption of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. On the other hand, N-ter ApBD Q13R showed a possible penetrating action on bacterial cells, with formation of nanonets-like structures against the scallop pathogen Vibrio bivalvicida VPAP30. Notably, both peptides exhibited selective activities against Vibrio strains isolated from healthy scallop larvae and specific bivalve pathogenic Vibrio, underscoring their potential for targeting host-associated vibrios. Biosafety tests showed that both peptides are harmless to A. purpuratus larvae. In conclusion, helixidin and N-ter ApBD Q13R represent novel cationic AMPs with different mechanisms of action against host-associated vibrios, offering promising prospects for sustainable pathogen control in scallop aquaculture.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Early diagnosis of this condition based on posture-related tests is still a research issue in the human body movement field. Currently, there is a need for affordable and reliable tools to identify and monitor the progression of this condition. The main goal of this work is to provide a method based on posture feature extraction from the center of pressure time series data, data analysis and machine learning models, in order to find patterns that allow the discrimination among healthy, diabetic and neuropathic people. Time series data from participants are captured using a low cost Wii Balance Board platform, following an experimental protocol. Following a data processing process, that includes reduction of noise, generation of new features, and data augmentation using a method inspired in genetic algorithms to overcome the small number of data. A hierarchical approached is applied in order to deal with class values overlapping. Machine learning algorithms are applied to generate classification models. Results show a range of 89%–97% F1-score, according the case being considered, of the feed-forward neural network models, after the application of the hierarchical approach, being superior to the other classifiers. The high predictive score achieved provides empirical evidence that the proposed approach, based on data augmentation, hierarchical classification and classical machine learning models, can reliably support the detection of diabetic neuropathy condition, also suggesting a simplification of the current procedure.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"The authors wish to express their gratitude to: (a) the Master’s program in Computer Engineering and the Nucleus of Research in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (Decree VRIDT N°083/2020 UCN), both of the Department of Computing and Systems Engineering at Universidad Católica del Norte (Antofagasta, Chile), and (b) to the Nucleus of Research in Rehabilitation and Human Movement Science (Decree 1076/2015) in the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Human Movement of the University of Antofagasta (Antofagasta, Chile), for partially supporting this research work.",Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,,,,2024-09,2024,,2024-09,95,,106302,Closed,Article,"Villegas, Claudio Meneses; Curinao, Jorge Littin; Aqueveque, David Coo; Guerrero-Henríquez, Juan; Matamala, Martín Vargas","Villegas, Claudio Meneses (Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Curinao, Jorge Littin (Department of Mathematics, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Aqueveque, David Coo (Department of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Guerrero-Henríquez, Juan (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Human Movement, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile); Matamala, Martín Vargas (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Human Movement, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile)","Villegas, Claudio Meneses (Catholic University of the North)","Villegas, Claudio Meneses (Catholic University of the North); Curinao, Jorge Littin (Catholic University of the North); Aqueveque, David Coo (Catholic University of the North); Guerrero-Henríquez, Juan (University of Antofagasta); Matamala, Martín Vargas (University of Antofagasta)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170973008,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering",
174,pub.1169563664,10.1016/j.elerap.2024.101378,,,The impact of ICT and e-commerce on employment in Colombia,"This study presents new empirical evidence regarding the impact of e-commerce adoption on employment in Colombia, a developing economy. We use firm-level data from the Annual Manufacturing Survey between 2013 and 2018 and differentiate the workforce by skill level and type of contract. We also use multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to construct a parsimonious set of instrumental variables to account for the endogeneity of e-commerce. Our main finding is that an increase of 1% in the degree of e-commerce penetration increases demand for skilled workers by 0.2% and does not have a negative impact in the demand for unskilled workers. We then delve deep into the evidence and test for complementarity or substitution between skilled labor and ICT capital related to e-commerce implementation by employing a new and specific theoretical framework, which is empirically assessed. Our results confirm that highly skilled workers benefit the most from the introduction of e-commerce and its associated ICTs into a company, exhibiting a high degree of complementarity compared to unskilled workers. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that ICT utilization and e-commerce adoption lead to labor substitution, particularly for low skill workers. This study recommends that policymakers invest in skill development to meet e-commerce demands, focusing on both upskilling workers to enhance digital literacy and implementing targeted support programs for a smooth transition to the digital economy across all skill levels.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,,,,2024-05,2024,,2024-05,65,,101378,Closed,Article,"Trujillo, Manuel Pérez; Aleán–Romero, Andrés","Trujillo, Manuel Pérez (Departamento de Economía, Instituto de Economía Aplicada Regional-IDEAR, Universidad Católica del Norte, Angamos, 0610, Antofagasta, Chile); Aleán–Romero, Andrés (Instituto de Estudios en Desarrollo, Economía y Sostenibilidad-IDEEAS, Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar, Cartagena, Colombia)","Aleán–Romero, Andrés (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)","Trujillo, Manuel Pérez (Catholic University of the North); Aleán–Romero, Andrés (Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169563664,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth
170,pub.1170878377,10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108658,,,Contributions by extreme rain events to long-term hyperarid landscape evolution,"The Atacama Desert in northern Chile provides a unique setting for investigating the short-term impact of extreme rain events on desert landscape evolution. A decadal-extreme rain event during January and February 2019 was scrutinized through radar and optical remote sensing. We evaluated its impact, contrasting it with a century-extreme 2015 rain event and established geological-timescale rates of change in the region. Five target features were selected for detailed analysis, encompassing all major landforms of the Atacama Desert, excluding mountain hillslopes. Our analysis distinguished active landforms (e.g., alluvial fans toes with mudflows) from static landforms (relict alluvial fans with calcium sulfate soil or eolian soil) and also landforms evolving from surface water and groundwater contributions, such as salt flats at drainage terminations. SAR coherence analysis and Sentinel 1-A Ground Range Detected (GRD) backscattering time series, complemented by Landsat 8 OLI scenes, detect surface changes between December 2018 and November 2019. The sedimentological record of alluvial deposits indicates that thicker and wider mudflows occurred during the last millennia compared to the 2019 event. Relict alluvial fans displayed minimal changes during the 2019 rain event, and any changes were transient. The evolution of the salt flats, over both short and long time spans, is highly variable, depending on the location in the arid high Andes or in the hyperarid lowland. Yet, a small part of the latter salt flat experienced a strong, transient SAR coherence decline spanning five to eight months after the rain ended that is suggestive of time-lagged groundwater flow. Aggregation of numerous events like the 2019 rain shaped the Atacama landscape fan toes and salt pans, yet higher magnitude rain events or extended periods of rains must have been responsible for geologically recorded substantial landscape modification and evolution. Larger events, like that of 2015, are needed to cause a significant impact on soil development on relict alluvial surfaces.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

169,pub.1168127023,10.1016/j.cor.2024.106558,,,Modeling and solving the two-level generalized median tour problem,"In many real-world situations, the beneficiaries of a distribution system may be grouped into clusters, requiring a transportation structure to serve each cluster of beneficiaries efficiently. For instance, in public services, such as health, education, and emergencies, delivery tasks rely on the local authority of each district or cluster. In this context, a two-level distribution system named the Two-Level Generalized Median Tour Problem (TLGMTP) is introduced. The first level addresses product distribution using a specialized vehicle, starting and ending at a depot and visiting some clusters. In this manner, products are delivered to one or more nodes belonging to the visited clusters. The second level comprises smaller vehicles that start their trips from the nodes belonging to the first level and transport the products to one or more nodes located in a non-visited cluster, ensuring that all non-visited clusters of the first level are visited in the second level. Then, the non-visited nodes in each cluster must reach a node in the same cluster to collect their products. In this study, we present, model, and solve the TLGMTP to minimize the total transportation costs. We develop three mathematical formulations and solve them using a branch-and-cut algorithm. Exhaustive computational experiments involving tests and real-world instances are presented to show the efficiency and advantages of the proposed methodology.","Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers, the Editor-in-Chief, and the Area Editor for their review comments.

To address this challenge, the use of an efficient battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential to regulate temperature within safe operating limits. Hence, this article provides a comprehensive review of lithium batteries and energy storage batteries, encompassing their classification, working principles, structural features, and heat generation mechanisms. A BTMS classification was proposed according to the most studied systems that were identified: Air-cooled, Liquid-cooled, Heat pipe-cooled, and phase change material (PCM)-cooled BTMS. Furthermore, a detailed analysis was conducted on PCM utilization in BTMS, according to its classification, selection criteria, properties enhancement methodologies, and applications. Notably, paraffins and inorganic compounds emerged as promising options for BTMS, with phase change temperatures ranging from 31.0 to 72.0 °C, latent heats from 35.0 to 210.0 J/g, and thermal conductivities of 0.5 to 9.3 Wm−1K−1. The integration of BTMS approaches, such as active and passive cooling, demonstrated potential in reducing power consumption and improving temperature uniformity within LIBs. Inorganic salt hydrates also showed promise in storing and managing heat during thermal runaway, suppressing its propagation, as supported by the ‘nail penetration test’. Additionally, the study highlights the growing utilization of industrial waste materials, such as bischofite, known for their cost-effectiveness. It also outlines future trends in BTMS, including active and passive cooling strategies, accurate heat generation modelling, and the potential of nano-enhanced PCM-cooled BTMSs, which could offer improved thermal conductivity. These findings offer a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals engaged in BTMS development and optimization, providing insights into the efficient management of heat for enhanced safety and performance.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

When it comes to monitoring digital twins of objects, maintenance predictions in time play a significant role. This study targets an artificial intelligence-based prediction of time-series data integrated with fully consistent expert elicitation. It also allows the integration of expert knowledge into the construction and explanation of the predictor. Moreover, it is considered a hybrid approach using data and expert knowledge for time series prediction. Reliability of obtained prediction is examined through comparisons with basic dynamic and static forecasts. Decision-making analysis based on expert’s opinions and optimization science coincides to prepare the data set for ANN prediction. Thus, the maintenance process will become predictable over time. Moreover, this prediction avoids sudden overhaul cost. Therefore, the entire production system is kept controlled. In this research, a FUll COnsistently Method (FUCOM) of optimization together with Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is used for obtaining optimal weights. Then, dynamic and static time-series forecasts are compared with ANN prediction. The obtained results prove ANN reliability according to expert’s opinions and FUCOM optimization model. FUCOM-ANN prediction achieves nearly 10 times smaller RMSE (0.08) than the RMSE (0.83) of general ANN prediction on the test data set. Moreover, the 10-fold cross-validation strategy shows better RMSE (0.13) for FUCOM-ANN validation sets than the RMSE (0.78) of general ANN validation sets.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,2024-03,2024,,2024-03,238,,121322,Closed,Article,"Khazaelpour, Payam; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani","Khazaelpour, Payam (Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Product Design, Industrial Systems Engineering (ISyE), Flanders Make vzw, B-3920 Lommel, Belgium 1; Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (School of Engineering, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile)","Khazaelpour, Payam (Flanders Make (Belgium); Ghent University)","Khazaelpour, Payam (Flanders Make (Belgium); Ghent University); Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani (Catholic University of the North)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163652412,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Let D ˆ ( G ˆ ) and A ˆ ( G ˆ ) be the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees and the mixed adjacency matrix of G ˆ , respectively. The α -mixed adjacency matrix of G ˆ is the matrix A ˆ α ( G ˆ ) = α D ˆ ( G ˆ ) + ( 1 − α ) A ˆ ( G ˆ ) . We study some properties of A ˆ α ( G ˆ ) associated with some type of mixed graphs, namely quasi-bipartite and pre-bipartite mixed graphs. A spectral characterization for pre-bipartite and some class of quasi-bipartite mixed graphs is given. For a mixed graph G ˆ we exploit the problem of finding the smallest α for which A ˆ α ( G ˆ ) is positive semi-definite. This problem was proposed by Nikiforov in the context of undirected graphs. It is proven here that, for a mixed graph this number is not greater than 1 2 and that a connected mixed graph G ˆ with n ≥ 2 is quasi-bipartite if and only if this number is exactly 1 2 . The spread of the α -mixed adjacency matrix is the difference among the largest and the smallest α -mixed adjacency eigenvalue. Upper and lower bounds for the spread of the α - mixed adjacency matrix are obtained. The α -mixed Estrada index of G ˆ is the sum of the exponentials of the eigenvalues of A ˆ α ( G ˆ ) . In this paper, bounds for the eigenvalues of A ˆ α ( G ˆ ) are established and, using these bounds some sharp bounds on the mixed Estrada index of A ˆ α ( G ˆ ) are presented.","Acknowledgements We thank the referees for the useful comments to the paper.

To look for transient sources associated with neutrino emission, a follow-up program of neutrino alerts has been operating within the ANTARES collaboration since 2009. This program, named TAToO, has triggered robotic optical telescopes (MASTER, TAROT, ROTSE and the SVOM ground based telescopes) immediately after the detection of any relevant neutrino candidate and scheduled several observations in the weeks following the detection. A subset of ANTARES events with highest probabilities of being of cosmic origin has also been followed by the Swift and the INTEGRAL satellites, the Murchison Widefield Array radio telescope and the H.E.S.S. high-energy gamma-ray telescope. The results of twelve years of observations are reported. In September 2015, ANTARES issued a neutrino alert and during the follow-up, a potential transient counterpart was identified by Swift and MASTER. A multi-wavelength follow-up campaign has allowed to identify the nature of this source and has proven its fortuitous association with the neutrino. No other optical and X-ray counterpart has been significantly associated with an ANTARES candidate neutrino signal. Constraints on transient neutrino emission have been set.

Carbon abundances in first-ascent giant stars are usually lower than those of their main-sequence counterparts. At moderate metallicities, stellar evolution of single stars cannot account for the existence of red-giant branch stars with enhanced carbon abundances. The phenomenon is usually interpreted as resulting from past mass transfer from an evolved binary companion now in the white dwarf evolutionary stage.   Aims. We aim to confirm the links between [C/O] enhancement, s -process element enhancement and binary fraction using large-scale catalogues of stellar abundances and probable binary stars.   Methods. We use a large data set from the 17 th data release of the SDSS-IV/APOGEE 2 survey to identify carbon-enhanced stars in the Galactic disk. We identify a continuum of carbon enrichment throughout three different sub-populations of disk stars and explore links between the degree of carbon enrichment and binary frequency, metallicity and chemical compositions.   Results. We verify a clear correlation between binary frequency and enhancement in the abundances of both carbon and cerium, lending support to the scenario whereby carbon-enhanced stars are the result of mass transfer by an evolved binary companion. In addition, we identify clustering in the carbon abundances of high- α disk stars, suggesting that those on the high metallicity end are likely younger, in agreement with theoretical predictions for the presence of a starburst population following the gas-rich merger of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage system.","The authors thank the anonymous referee for insightful and very helpful comments.

163,pub.1168225959,10.1007/s10878-023-01100-y,,,Integrating supplier selection decisions into an inventory location problem for designing the supply chain network,"This paper proposes a novel Inventory-Location problem that integrates supplier selection decisions to design a three-echelon supply chain network, under a continuous (s,Q) inventory control policy at the warehouses. In this problem, a set of warehouses must be selected within a set of potential locations to serve several customers or demand zones, additionally involving the selection of the suppliers for fulfilling incoming orders from the located warehouses. The optimal solution must be determined while minimizing total system costs including supplier selection, transportation (i.e., suppliers-warehouses and warehouses-customers), inventory (i.e., cycle and safety stock), and warehouse location costs. A key element of the problem is the consideration of variable lead-times for the warehouses, which are dependent on the selection of the supplier that serve them, thus increasing model complexity. Accordingly, an efficient algorithm based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition is developed and implemented to solve the proposed Mixed Integer, Nonlinear, Nonconvex, Programming Model. The proposed solution approach relies on a convenient model formulation and decomposition that yields a Mixed Integer Linear master problem and a continuous, convex subproblem. A wide set of medium-sized synthetic instances are optimally solved in affordable times, denoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model along with the proposed solution approach. Significant scientific and managerial insights are provided and discussed.","This research work was performed by ANID FONDECYT grant number 1123046.

162,pub.1170033339,10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108616,,,Multisequal aeolian deposition during the Holocene in southwestern Patagonia (51°S) was modulated by southern westerly wind intensity and vegetation type,"We studied a multisequal soil succession (MSS) just south of Torres del Paine National Park (51°S), at the present-day core of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW). The Río Serrano Section comprises paleosol horizons with associated intervening loess and sandy loess beds formed during the Holocene. Our record suggests strong and stable aeolian activity between ∼9.3–7.2 ka followed by a decline with centennial-scale variations until ∼5 ka. A strengthening commenced at ∼5 ka and culminated in a maximum between ∼2.2–0.5 ka with millennial-scale variations. Subsequent weakening of aeolian activity between ∼0.5 and 0 ka was coeval with the deposition of a ∼40 cm-thick paleosol, after which aeolian activity increased abruptly and reached an unprecedented maximum starting in the mid-20th century. The inferred wind intensity variations from our data bear partial agreement with competing hypotheses of SWW evolution, which postulate minimum SWW influence in SW Patagonia during the early Holocene and maximum influence during the Late Holocene, or vice versa. When analyzed through the lens of vegetation physiognomy/distribution and associated hydrological balance inferences from neighboring sites, our results suggest a primary control by precipitation and wind speeds associated to SWW strength at regional scale, modulated by the position of the forest/steppe ecotone east of the austral Andes. Human activities during the mid-20th century (deforestation, fire-regime shifts, livestock grazing, land use changes) caused an unprecedented increase in aeolian activity through decreased vegetation cover that increased sediment availability for aeolian transport, marking a striking difference with the magnitude of natural processes before the Anthropocene. Our results highlight the importance of climate change and natural/human-driven changes in vegetation cover for deciphering wind intensity histories, particularly in the transition from humid to semiarid environments along the eastern slope of the southern Patagonian Andes.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Fumarolic deposits were manually collected, while fumarolic plumes were sampled using the filter pack technique; after sample preparation, both sample types were analyzed by ICP-MS. The research focuses on chalcophile elements (As, Cd, Sb, Te, Cu, Zn, Tl, Pb, and Bi) and B, with the findings revealing significant enrichment of As and Pb in fumarolic deposit samples, especially in medium- and high-temperature fumarolic vents, respectively. On the other hand, filter pack measurements in the fumarolic plume indicate a notable enrichment in Te, B, As, and Tl, with Sc-normalized enrichment factors within the range of 104–106. From these elements, B, Tl, and Te appear to be less scavenged at the vent, presenting more significant enrichments in fumarolic plumes than in fumarolic deposits. By comparing our results with subduction-related volcanoes such as Etna, Stromboli, Lascar, Masaya, or La Soufrière de Guadeloupe, Lastarria fumarolic plume can be regarded as the one with the highest concentrations of B and As ever recorded. Moreover, Lastarria has chalcophile enrichments comparable to those volcanoes with shallower magma chambers and high-temperature magmatic emissions such as Stromboli. The higher abundance of chalcophiles suggests a significant magmatic influence feeding Lastarria fumaroles and the presence of ligands, such as Cl, which can transport significant amounts of chalcophiles at shallower levels of the crust during late-stage magma crystallization. Large amounts of chalcophiles released by Lastarria and Lascar volcanoes could be responsible for the naturally elevated concentrations of these elements in the Altiplano-Puna area. Future studies should focus on the lifetime of chalcophiles in the Central Andean atmosphere, where these elements could reside for a longer time given the dominant hyperarid environment.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

160,pub.1171059823,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101909,,,A multi-objective optimization model for planning emergency shelters after a tsunami,"Vertical evacuation helps people escape tsunami risks by elevating them above the level of tsunami inundation, usually by moving to higher ground or taking refuge in tall buildings or other elevated structures. Unlike horizontal evacuation, which involves moving away from the coast to higher ground, vertical evacuation reduces the demand for horizontal evacuation routes that can become congested and impede evacuation efforts. Therefore, investing in critical infrastructure that enables vertical evacuation is crucial in tsunami-prone areas. This study proposes a multi-objective optimization model to help decision-makers assign critical infrastructure for vertical evacuation in tsunami-prone areas. Critical infrastructure includes buildings that can provide shelter during a tsunami and road networks for rapid access to shelter points. The proposed model balances three objectives: (1) minimizing investment costs in critical infrastructure, (2) maximizing the population covered by shelters, and (3) minimizing the evacuation time for evacuees to reach the shelters. This model is tested on real-world data from the Coquimbo-La Serena coastal conurbation in the Coquimbo region of Chile. The study contributes to the literature on tsunami evacuation modeling and provides valuable information for decision-makers to plan and invest in critical infrastructure for vertical evacuation during tsunamis. A sensitivity analysis of various parameters is conducted, and managerial insights are provided.","Acknowledgements C.

138,pub.1168276115,10.1007/s10531-023-02769-7,,,Exploring the consequences of kelp removal: a review shows we are missing a broader perspective,"Marine deforestation combined with growing demands from the alginate market, reliant largely on wild kelp harvesting, has heightened concern for the potential broad and cascading effects of kelp removal on ecosystem functioning and services. Kelps are foundation species providing key habitat and resources for other organisms, including other fished species and thus their overharvest is often anticipated to have important and complex ecological and socioeconomical consequences. However, constructing expectations and strategies as to where, when, how, or how much kelp can be safely removed is often difficult to discern from the array of individual research studies quantifying the effects of kelp removal on kelp populations and associated communities because evidence appears mixed and results could depend on kelp species, removal methods and monitoring scales. This review of observational and experimental studies aims to identify and synthesize the effects of kelp removal, their monitoring, and the trends of significant effects. Here we show that monitoring has focused mainly on kelp populations effects, and effects on the local associated algae and sessile fauna. Almost no experiment assessed spatial patterns resulting from kelp removal. Most statistically tested effects of individual studies (64.3% of total) were non-significant. From those considered statistically significant, most (60.1%) showed decreasing trends (e.g., in kelp size, abundance, reproductive potential and the abundance and diversity of some associated taxa). Long-term studies and evaluated responses to kelp removal at the relatively large spatial scales (in extent and grain size) that include the patchy mosaics of kelp forests and critically match the geographic scale over which management strategies are applied were scarce. We note that temporal and spatial monitoring scales appear limited when compared to kelp’s lifespan and dispersal potential, as well as the scale of commercial harvest areas. Thus, we seek to call attention to the need for expanding monitoring scales and metrics to better meet the knowledge required to manage kelp forests and fisheries, which becomes urgent in countries where kelp fisheries control is difficult and as the effects could be magnified by climate change.",We sincerely thank Dr Adrien Chevallier for his insightful comments on this manuscript.

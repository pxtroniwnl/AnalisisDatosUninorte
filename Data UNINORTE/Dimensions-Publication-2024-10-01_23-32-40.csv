80,pub.1166109927,10.4324/9781003242499,,,"Anthropology and Climate Change, From Transformations to Worldmaking","In this third edition of Anthropology and Climate Change, Susan Crate and Mark Nuttall offer a collection of chapters that examine how anthropologists work on climate change issues with their collaborators, both in academic research and practicing contexts, and discuss new developments in contributions to policy and adaptation at different scales. Building on the first edition’s pioneering focus on anthropology’s burgeoning contribution to climate change research, policy, and action, as well as the second edition’s focus on transformations and new directions for anthropological work on climate change, this new edition reveals the extent to which anthropologists’ contributions are considered to be critical by climate scientists, policymakers, affected communities, and other rights-holders. Drawing on a range of ethnographic and policy issues, this book highlights the work of anthropologists in the full range of contexts – as scholars, educators, and practitioners from academic institutions to government bodies, international science agencies and foundations, working in interdisciplinary research teams and with community research partners. The contributions to this new edition showcase important new academic research, as well as applied and practicing approaches. They emphasize human agency in the archaeological record, the rapid development in the last decade of community-based and community-driven research and disaster research; provide rich ethnographic insight into worldmaking practices, interventions, and collaborations; and discuss how, and in what ways, anthropologists work in policy areas and engage with regional and global assessments. This new edition is essential for established scholars and for students in anthropology and a range of other disciplines, including environmental studies, as well as for practitioners who engage with anthropological studies of climate change in their work.",,,,,,,2023-11-16,2023,2023-11-16,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166109927,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society",13 Climate Action
370,pub.1162823788,10.4324/9781003319689,,,"Design for More-Than-Human Futures, Towards Post-Anthropocentric Worlding","This book explores the work of important authors in the search for a transition towards more ethical design focused on more-than-human coexistence. In a time of environmental crises in which the human species threatens its own survival and the highest level of exacerbation of the idea of a future and technological innovation, it is important to discard certain anthropocentric categories in order to situate design beyond the role that it traditionally held in the capitalist world, creating opportunities to create more just and sustainable worlds. This book is an invitation to travel new paths for design framed by ethics of more-than-human coexistence that breaks with the unsustainability installed in the designs that outfit our lives. Questioning the notion of human-centered design is central to this discussion. It is not only a theoretical and methodological concern, but an ethical need to critically rethink the modern, colonialist, and anthropocentric inheritance that resonates in design culture. The authors in this book explore the ideas oriented to form new relations with the more-than-human and with the planet, using design as a form of political enquiry. This book will be of interest to academics and students from the world of design and particularly those involved in emerging branches of the field such as speculative design, critical design, non-anthropocentric design, and design for transition.",,,,,,,2023-07-27,2023,2023-07-27,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,7,7,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162823788,33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design,

It documents the antiquity and widespread occurrence of the belief in supernatural gamekeepers at the global level. This interdisciplinary volume documents both the antiquity and the widespread geographical distribution of this belief along with surveying the various manifestations of this cosmology by way of studies from Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America. Some chapters explore the manifestations of this belief as they appear in petroglyphs/pictographs and other forms of material culture. Others focus on the environmental impacts of these beliefs/rituals and prescribed foraging restrictions by analyzing how they affect game harvests. The internationally recognized scholars in this volume assess the efficacy of this particular form of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and investigate if adherence to the belief in animal masters actually causes hunters to refrain from overharvesting wild game and thereby contributes to sustainable hunting practices. This volume is of interest to anthropologists, archaeologists and other social scientists researching traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), indigenous conservation, biodiversity, and sustainability practices, and animal deities.",,,"Conflict, Environment, and Social Complexity",,Richard J.

Latin American development models continue to prioritise extractivism: the intensive exploitation and exportation of nature in its primary commodity form. This constant expansion of the extractive frontier into new territories leads to forms of place-based resistance, negotiation and struggle in which competing territorial projects and claims are at stake. This book uncovers the underlying trends and dynamics of these ‘territorialities in dispute’, and the socio-ecological resistance movements that are emerging as marginalised communities struggle to reclaim their territorial rights and defend and protect their right of access to the global commons. A focus on territorialities in dispute renders visible the unsustainable expansion of extractivist territories and opens up new horizons to learn from these processes and to consider post-extractivist/post-development imaginings of another world and alternate futures – as well as the challenges to their realisation. This book will be of interest to both students and researchers in the fields of international development, political ecology, critical geography, social anthropology as well as to activists engaged in socio-ecological/eco-territorial movements.",,,,,,,2023-08-04,2023,2023-08-04,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163052709,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4406 Human Geography,

Civil marriage law still echoes religious marriage law, which for centuries determined which persons could enter into marriage with each other and how validly contracted marriages could be ended. Religions and denominations also had different regulations regarding whether a divorce only ended marital obligations or also permitted remarriage during the lifetime of the divorced spouse. This book deals with predominantly handwritten documents of divorce proceedings from the British Isles to Western, Central, and Southeastern Europe, and from 1600 to the 1930s. The praxeological analysis reveals the arguments and strategies put forward to obtain or prevent divorce, as well as the social and, above all, economic conditions and arrangements connected with divorce. The contributions break new ground by combining previously often separate fields of research and regions of investigation. It makes clear that the gender order doesn’t always run along religious lines, as was too often assumed. This book will be of interest to all scholars and students of economic, social, religious, cultural, legal, and gender history as well as gender and well-being in a broader sense.",,,,,,,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160056399,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 4403 Demography; 48 Law and Legal Studies",5 Gender Equality

The book is also a true global representation of challenges and opportunities that have been encountered, addressed, and critiqued from a wide variety of contributors rather than academicians per se. In doing so, rather than focusing on techno-centric prowess and associated case studies of the west (as is the case in most competing titles), the book also equally emphasizes upon the vulnerabilities and mitigating solutions being developed and tested in the under-developed and developing nations. Besides this, the book also acquires an ‘Equity’ oriented focus and hints upon sustainable, inclusive modes of shaping our built environment throughout the contributing chapters. The book is also unique in the way it combines the chosen themes to provide a holistic coverage of the broader determinants of urban healthand wellbeing, thus being better positioned to address SDG3 within one compact volume. The book also differs from a typical conference proceeding or a non-peer reviewed book since the book’s highly theme specific approach is curated by a scientific peer review committee to carefully maintain diversity of contributions to the book. Cities have a profound power to support or hinder human health and wellbeing in countless ways. Achieving greater health equity has emerged in recent years as a key priority and consideration when designing cities to promote health and wellbeing, although there is a dearth of evidence and practical examples of research translation to guide cities and communities. The book accordingly exemplifies a pluralistic approach to achieving urban health equity which recognises and addresses critical aspects of geography, age, race, background, socioeconomic status, disability, gender etc. With interdisciplinary science clearly pointing to the role of theneighbourhood environment as one of the most important health determinants, this book will undoubtedly lead the next generation of urban health actors to build contextually responsive, equitable, empathic cities to benefit residents around the world. The book, rather than being focused purely on academic propositions for building equitable cities, offers a unique multi-stakeholder perspective by collaborating with the International Society for Urban Health’s 18th International Conference on Urban Health. This unique collaboration allows access to hundreds of scientists, architects, urbanists, multilaterals, policymakers, non-profit leaders, and grassroots organizers. The book captures the voices and concerns of such diverse cross-sectoral professionals and showcases findings that turn evidence into action and impact in communities around the world.

By drawing on multiple research studies, the text synthesizes current understandings of the impacts of social network use, online gaming, pornography, and phenomena, including cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and internet addiction, to develop recommendations for the effective identification of at-risk youth, as well as strategies for informed communication about online risks and opportunities. It shows how media discussion of risks to children and teenagers from new technology is highly emotive and often exaggerated, rooted in the “moral panic” surrounding new cultural practices that young people engage in, but which adults do not understand. Online risks are thus conceptualized as centering on three areas, specific to adolescence, which have undergone radical changes due to new internet technology. These include young people’s identity, the types of content that are accessed, and social relationships. The author shows how these matters stem from the potential of new technology to establish new interpersonal connections, emphasizing how it brings opportunities, as much as risks. As such, he provides a uniquely balanced discussion of potential dangers, while also emphasizing the opportunities for social, academic, and personal growth which new technologies afford young people. It will be indispensable for researchers and clinicians interested in assessing levels of online risk, as well as scholars and educators with interests in cyberpsychology, social psychology, cyber culture, social aspects of computing and media, and adolescent development.",,,,,,,2023-02-08,2023,2023-02-08,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Ingram, Gordon P.

Presenting a diverse range of contributions from scholars, practitioners, and artists, the book reminds us that death and the dead body are omnipresent in museum and heritage spaces. Chapters appraise collection practices and their historical context, present global perspectives and potential resolutions, and suggest how death and dying should be presented to the public. Acknowledging that professionals in the galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) fields are engaging in vital discussions about repatriation and anti-colonialist narratives, the book includes reflections on a variety of deathscapes that are at the forefront of the debate. Taking a multivocal approach, the handbook provides a foundation for debate as well as a reference for how the dead are treated within the public arena. Most important, perhaps, the book highlights best practices and calls for more ethical frameworks and strategies for collaboration, particularly with descendant communities. The Routledge Handbook of Museums, Heritage, and Death will be useful to all individuals working with, studying, and interested in curation and exhibition at museums and heritage sites around the world.

An emerging concept in the literacy field, many scholars agree on the need for students to develop global literacies, yet few agree on a widely accepted definition. Based on a synthesis of the literature, the editors formulate a definition of global literacies with four dimensions, including: literacy as a human right in all nations around the world; critical reading and creation of multimodal texts about global issues; intercultural communication and reciprocal collaboration with globally diverse others; and transformative action for social and environmental justice that traverses borders. Taking this shared, proposed definition as a starting point, the chapters then offer contextualized examples of global literacies from K–12 and teacher education classrooms to make explicit links between research and practice. The contributors interact with and interrogate the book’s definition of global literacies using a common framework of critical theory. As such, this book provides both emerging and established scholars with critical frameworks for positioning global literacies in ways that are relevant, dynamic, and forward-thinking.",,,,,,,2023-03-09,2023,2023-03-09,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156089692,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

While existing analyses are effective in programs restricted to static features, precision declines in the presence of dynamic language features, and even further when the system behavior changes dynamically. As a consequence, improved points-to sets algorithms taking into account such language features and uses are required. In this paper, we present and extension of the point-to sets analysis to incorporate the language abstractions introduced by context-oriented programming adding the capability for programs to adapt their behavior dynamically to the system’s execution context. To do this, we extend WALA to detect the context-oriented language abstractions, and their representation within the system, to capture the dynamic behavior, in the particular case of the Context Traits JavaScript language extension. To prove the effectiveness of our extension, we evaluate the precision of the points-to set analysis with respect to the state of the art, over a set of context-oriented programs taken from the literature.",,,,Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs,,,2023-07-18,2023,2023-07-18,2023-07-18,,,18-24,Closed,Proceeding,"Cardenas, Sergio; Leger, Paul; Fukuda, Hiroaki; Cardozo, Nicolás","Cardenas, Sergio (University of Los Andes, Colombia); Leger, Paul (Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan); Cardozo, Nicolás (University of Los Andes, Colombia)","Cardenas, Sergio (Universidad de Los Andes)","Cardenas, Sergio (Universidad de Los Andes); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Cardozo, Nicolás (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160653127,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4612 Software Engineering,

Using a series of examples from pop culture, including films, television series, video games, memes and other digital products, this book provides the reader with a wider understanding of the procedures, interests, roles, assumptions and challenges, which foster or hinder the travels of media and cultural products. Compiling in one single narrative a series of case studies, theoretical debates and international examples, the book looks at a number of exchanges and transformations enabled by both traditional media trade and the internet. It reflects on the increase of cultural products crossing over regional, national and international borders in the form of video games and TV formats, through music and video distribution platforms or via digital social media networks, to highlight discussions about the characteristics of border-crossing digital production. The cultural transduction framework is developed from discussions in communication and media studies, as well as from debates in adaptation and translation studies, to map out the travels of media and cultural products from an interdisciplinary perspective.

The content of these two volumes marks a baseline for the collective work initiated by psychologists who came together to answer the call to combat the pandemic across the Americas. In that sense, both volumes are truly a “snapshot in time” that could help us assess in the future how much progress we have made to apply psychology to the pressing demands of our time.",,,,,"Nelson Portillo, Melissa L.

Drawing on a variety of heterodox and radical perspectives and global voices, including those from India, Africa, and South America, this collection explores the causes and impacts of global emergencies from a wide array of viewpoints. The first section outlines how the pandemic has shown up the biases of orthodox thought and policy, particularly its Eurocentric and patriarchal focus on the urban, formal economy. It outlines how adding an international dimension to institutional analysis uncovers systematic inequalities in the responses to emergencies, and how new paradigms can provide better alternatives. The massive interventionism worldwide has led to renewed interest in the global financial system, and also in Marxian approaches to money. The second section of the book therefore considers a range of alternative approaches to the study of finance – from Marx to Minsky – which are currently being revisited. The collection concludes with a suggestion for heterodox economics pedagogy, since changing economics education is vital for future dissemination of real-world ideas. The book will be of interest to a variety of researchers and postgraduate students, and lecturers, especially in the fields of development, health, labour and feminist economics, and also international political economy and heterodox economics.",,,,,,,2023-11-06,2023,2023-11-06,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165732222,38 Economics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities

Chapters in this book bring together both theoretical and empirical studies that take into account human biological and environmental conditions to understand how ethnic diversity, culturally determined lifestyle and dietary habits influence biological variation of human growth and nutrition in nine LAC countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. The book is divided into three sections. Chapters in the first section analyze nutritional and epidemiological aspects of child growth in the region. Articles in the second section focus on methods to evaluate human growth, development, and maturation. Finally, the third section brings together a series of studies representing different LAC countries, analyzing biocultural impacts on child growth and nutrition. By bringing together studies about the relationship between human biology, cultural diversity, nutrition and health in a region with huge environmental challenges, this volume addresses many of the challenges to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 3 (Good Health and Well-Being). Chapters in this volume present and discuss data on the effects of malnutrition on children's and adolescent's health and development, such as chronic undernutrition or stunting (growth deficit) and excess weight (overweight and obesity) as the risk factors for child morbidity and mortality m due to non-communicable diseases. Human Growth and Nutrition in Latin American and Caribbean Countries will be a valuable resource for both students and researchers in different disciplines dedicated to the interdisciplinary research on the intersection betweenhuman biology, cultural diversity, nutrition and health. It will also be a useful source of information for both health professionals and policy makers developing and implementing interventions and public policies to achieve UN’s SDGs 2 and 3, particularly in the LAC regions.",,,,,Sudip Datta Banik,,2023,2023,,2023,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1161705856,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,2 Zero Hunger; 3 Good Health and Well Being

Fuelled by the wider international exposure that internet distribution has brought to TV shows, this phase for high-end drama is one of unprecedented budgets and costs, frequent transnational coproduction and increased cultural diversification. While this drama continues to be facilitated by national broadcasters, fuelling the above trio of influences upon it has been the commissioning activity of multinational subscription-video-on-demand (SVoD) providers. This book showcases leading examples of transnational TV drama, produced outside the US, yet involving collaboration with US-owned SVoDs. It foregrounds some new potentials for drama creation in the context of its strategic importance to providers as different as national broadcasters and multinational SVoDs. This book helps to explain why today’s high-end dramas are demonstrating new elements of cultural specificity despite their common objective to engage a diverse international audience.

It brings together case studies of nine countries – Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru – and includes a comparative analysis of the overall evolution of women’s rights movements across the region during the past decades. This analysis shows Latin America as the home to the largest, strongest, and most densely regionally and globally interconnected women’s rights movements in the Global South. Each chapter in this volume seeks to understand where the struggles for women’s rights come from, how they stand today and where they are headed to. To do so, they all use qualitative methodologies, and most resort to first-hand accounts of the processes described and reflections by the actors on their own experiences, collected through surveys, in-depth interviewsand/or ethnographic observations. The comparative analysis of the different national case studies reveals the main struggles in which women’s rights movements are currently involved in Latin America and the Caribbean: the quest for political representation within the State and its political institutions; the fight against gender violence and the struggle for sexual and reproductive rights – especially abortion rights. Women’s Rights in Movement: Dynamics of Feminist Change in Latin America and the Caribbean will be a valuable resource for researchers, activists and policy makers interested in the struggles for women’s rights not only in Latin America and the Caribbean, but in different parts of the world.

Despite what, in many cases, is decades of investment and effort, why do partner governments continue to engage in those traditional patterns and styles of public service management that international development organizations have sought to supplant with methods that are supposedly more accountable, efficient, and effective? This book provides an answer to these questions. However, rather than pathologizing partner governments as the source of the problem—that is, rather than maintaining the distinction between doctor (international development organizations) and patient (partner governments), wherein the patient is seen as unwilling to take their medicine (enacting “good governance” practices)—this book instead reframes the relationship. The central argument is, first, that the programs and projects of international organizations are introduced into and are constrained by multiple layers of ritual governance, that is, performative acts and cultural logics that intersect with and reinforce the political, economic, and social structures in and through which they operate. As is shown, the contextual factors that guide governance practices are largely beyond the reach of the international development organizations; the relevant logics have their roots in state ideology but also extend back to the colonial logics that continue to operate at the heart of the state apparatus. The second central argument is that international aid organizations and the governments with which they work are engaged in a “ritual aid dance” where each actor plays a part but does not (and cannot) acknowledge the ways that it depends on the other for its own gain. This relationship can be considered a dance because each participant responds to and needs the other and because both sides do so in ways that are carefully choreographed, with the overall trajectory or contours of the dance being more or less known to the participants. These arguments are based on research on the World Bank’s efforts over the course of several decades to encourage, through its financing, projects, and technical assistance, the implementation of social sector reform in Indonesia related to decentralization, community participation, and school-based management.",,,,,,,2023-02-16,2023,2023-02-16,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155474027,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

1595,pub.1163976910,10.1007/978-3-031-39412-6,,,Sociology in Colombia,"This Palgrave Pivot presents a historical reflection about the development of sociology in Colombia from the late nineteenth century into the mid-twentieth century, a period in which the process of professionalization in the discipline occurred due to the creation of university training programs, as well as the extension of research centers and groups nationwide. The book exposes the different interrelations at the local, regional and international ambits that, only in part, offer a similar panorama to what happened in other Latin American processes in relation to the academic institutionalization of sociology. The role of international networks and government initiatives, national and foreign, was central to this development and, in general, to the take-off of sociology in the country, as happened in others nations such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. This book argues that, in Colombia, having these networks and initiatives during the Cold Wargenerated various tensions, which appeared early, between these forms of financing as a political effort to contain left movements in the region (especially after the Cuban Revolution) and the attempt to achieve an autonomous science. However, the Colombian case presents some peculiarities in the configuration of sociology at the national level. These are associated, to a large extent, with the phenomena that have been decisive in the history of the country: a nation without dictatorships between 1960 and 1970, unlike other South American countries, but with a restricted democracy that even today offers difficulties in order to accept alternative forces. This book also considers the effects of the longest armed conflict known in the continent and its own historical transformations in the face of the role played by various actors such as guerrillas, drug trafficking and paramilitary groups. The book thus discusses, under a specific case study, the role of science as well as the possibilities of social transformation through human action. This book constitutes not only a journey on the academic institutionalization and the professional practice of sociology in Colombia; it is also an opportunity to think about what is coming in this field in a possible post-conflict scenario.

It seeks to make sense of the inevitable centrality of the death of fish without reducing this fact to ethnocentric dilemmas of utilitarianism or animal rights, for example. Also avoiding recourse to broader, generic categories such as (multi)species or humans and nonhuman animals, the different meanings and moralities of killing are considered within the technicities of these two fishing methods. In focusing its approach on the shared semiotic materialities of these two activities, the chapter also explores the meanings of the death of fishermen in both contexts. It thus ethnographically demonstrates that their forms of life correspond to particular forms of death, including the gestures of killing and their dilemmas. This paper explores the cosmological foundation of Inuit rejection of herding and the primal relationships of migratory caribou and local spirits called ijirait. The study is drawing on classical ethnographical materials and oral sources collected in the Canadian eastern Arctic. Information was recorded from Inuit Elders between 1997 and 2011. The question of herding animals, specifically caribou and reindeer, emerged in the early 1920s when Saami herders were brought to Baffin Island. For various reasons, this adventure turned into a major failure. A closer look at Inuit perception of caribou illuminates the ontological foundations of Inuit’s historical and continued resistance to and resentment of herding. In the Canadian Arctic, now Nunavut, Inuit remain attached to hunting the caribou, which they refer to as ‘the lice of the earth’. They connect the caribou to a master spirit (inua) or God, and often associate caribou with the deceased and mountain spirits (ijirait). With this cosmology, and given that hunting and herding involve divergent ideas about animals’ agency and human–animal relationships, transforming Inuit hunters of caribou into herders seems a very difficult task. For Inuit, caribou cannot be mastered or domesticated, and they cannot be ‘products’. They are ‘subjects’ to be eaten and respected. Their paths were object of many rules in order to let the caribou go their proper way. Disrespect would trigger starvation. Hunting caribou was – and to a large extent still is – considered the only way to preserve them. The Karitiana, an Amerindian people in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon, mention the existence of many types of onças (jaguars) with whom they inhabit the world. While many are not recognized by scientific or popular/regional zoology, they are part of the world experienced by the Karitiana (and other Amazonian peoples). This article suggests that these Karitiana onças should be understood through the intersection between the experience and detailed knowledge these Indigenous people have of the territory in which they live, and the enormous richness and complexity of the world and the forms of life that exist. Rather than simply arguing that the Karitiana know a world that science cannot know (because of ontological and/or epistemological differences), the suggestion is that the world is so rich and has so many facets that there are countless ways of observing and understanding it. Human and nonhuman animals go on pilgrimages as wayfarers, but usually only the human participants are accorded the status of pilgrim. Based on the author’s ethnographic fieldwork among Aymara-speaking carers of llamas, alpacas and sheep in Isluga, northern Chile, this article demonstrates how herd members are co-participants along with human beings in ritual practices. Wayfaring as an activity is considered in relation to human personifications of other living beings, as well as of landforms in which the wayfaring takes place. Because the ritual inclusion of nonhuman animals takes place in a perceptual world that does not rest on an axiomatic split dividing ritual herders from non-ritual herded participants, the ethnographic evidence presented here indicates how dualistic principles in Isluga do not have the same contrastive force often imputed to Western ways of thinking and that commensurabilities between Andean and Western dualisms are partial, associated with different moral judgments. In June 2002 heavy snow fell unexpectedly in the dry season in the south of Bolivia. This chapter looks to the occasion of this snowfall, and its disastrous consequences for llamas and their herders alike, to consider the materiality of human-animal relations in the Andes. It takes up Ingold’s call to consider life as unfolding in a ‘weather world’ rather than a landscape, and Anderson’s focus on ‘architectures of domestication’ that considers domestication to be a material and spatial arrangement. In examining a case in which the weather rendered places normally convivial to humans and herd animals hostile, it concludes that domestication itself is a fragile arrangement that can be ruptured. A focus on the materiality of domestication takes into account the presence of human bodies and raises questions about the viability of Andean herding in an era of increased human migration, when extreme weather events appear to occur more frequently. In this chapter we explore the notion of investigatory attunement between Gwich’in dogmushers Abraham Stewart Junior and Joseph Kaye. Following their teachings and lives with dogs, we are careful to consider dogs as ‘production of work’ and instead advocate the notion of partnership to underscore the entanglements between dogs, Gwich’in, fish and other beings like the crow. In similar vein we are hesitant to consider these partnerships as social construction or as conventional understandings of domestication which entail forms of control or domination without any sense of mutual benefit. What the two Gwich’in dog mushers illustrate what living with dogs entails in the North is a more complex form of relationship that includes other beings such as fish within this life-world.","We are grateful to Maggie Bolton and two anonymous reviewers who provided valuable guidance and feedback on an earlier version of this chapter.

It will help readers make connections between Latin American and other regions’ perspectives, experiences, and environmental concerns. Latin America has seen an acceleration of environmental degradation due to the expansion of resource extraction and urban areas. This Handbook addresses Latin America not only as an object of study, but also as a region with a long and profound history of critical thinking on these themes. Furthermore, the Handbook departs from most treatments on the topic by studying the environment as a social issue inextricably linked to politics, economy, and culture. The Handbook will be an invaluable resource for those wanting not only to understand the issues, but also to engage with ideas about environmental politics and social-ecological transformation. The Handbook covers a broad range of topics organized according to three areas: physical geography, ecology, and crucial environmental problems of the region. These are key theoretical and methodological issues used to understand Latin America’s ecosocial contexts, and institutional and grassroots practices related to more just and ecologically sustainable worlds. The Handbook will set a research agenda for the near future and provide comprehensive research on most subregions relative to environmental transformations, challenges, struggles and political processes. It stands as a fresh and much needed state of the art introduction for researchers, scholars, post-graduates and academic audiences on Latin American contributions to theorization, empirical research and environmental practices.",,,,,,,2023-04-21,2023,2023-04-21,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157448242,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,

It particularly examines gender norms in relation to agency, influence and their impact. Despite growing transnational activities, regional studies analyses have so far maintained a primarily linear logic not incorporative of the increasing interface between state and non-state regionalism in a transnational context since the advent of liberalisation and democratisation. Increasing non-state activities, and their connection to state processes involved in norm creation, adaptation, diffusion and implementation around broad questions of security (including gender security), amount to regional thickening. The book’s analytical approach is informed by alternatives to mainstream approaches, emphasising processes rather than linearity inherent in regional international relations studies. The research reveals that transnational activities and regionalisation of gender and women-focused civil society actors are critical for advocacy and diverse representation within intergovernmental policymaking structures at the regional scale.

He explores political theology through the innovative lens of prophecy, the connection between leading prophets and powerful politicians, and the nexus between the prophetic imagination and political practices. This book provides a rigorous theoretical framework for crafting political theology in the global Pentecostal movement. It is, indeed, a brilliant book on Pentecostal political theology of prophecy.” ­—Nimi Wariboko, Walter G. Muelder,, Boston University, Boston, USA 'Prophecy and Politics in South African Pentecostalism' represents an important new development in Pentecostal studies. Dr Solomon's bold text outlines a postcolonial political theology that harnesses the emotive power of Pentecostalism in order to provide theological resources for a counter hegemonic, anti imperialist and more egalitarian South Africa. This is a must read. —Anthony G. Reddie, University of Oxford. Oxford, UK This book is an interdisciplinary study of the relationship between prophecy and politics in South African Pentecostalism. The role and the power of prophecy in enhancing the presence of politicians in the church square are unpacked through historical examples, as well as case studies of contemporary prophets. Solomon Kgatle argues that the influence of prophecy in politics has the potential to weaken the prophetic voice of the church in general and the Pentecostal movement in particular. He proposes a Pentecostal political theology of prophecy. This theology is developed by taking into cognizance the theoretical and theological frameworks of prophetic imagination and pneumatological imagination. In addition, this theology seeks a balance between prophecy and power and prophecy and sovereignty.

Furthermore, climate change concerns have forced the electric power system to be restructured. On the one hand, the system has been restructured using renewable resources for power generation; on the other hand, transmission lines can be thermally constrained, and this leads to inadequate power transmission capacity on existing transmission lines. When these types of restrictions occur, the cost of energy increases because more generation is needed to meet demand and losses along the transmission line. This problem can be mitigated by upgrading overhead transmission lines with high thermal resistance conductors, but this is costly. Therefore, using predictive models based on time series to analyze the thermal behavior of overhead transmission and distribution lines is necessary in order to make technical decisions regarding power dispatches and contingencies in case of fortuitous events. This paper presents a prediction model for ampacity and conductor temperature of a 110 kV power line in the northern region of Colombia, considering the uncertainty of electrical demand, ambient temperature, wind velocity, and solar radiation by applying the IEEE 738 standard.",The authors would like to thank ISES (Ingeniería y Solucines Especializadas) and AFINIA Network Operator for supplying information of the line that was studied.

The previous is mainly due to the sensitivity of people, the environment, and the economy to be impacted by these emergencies and the different technical and human resources that must be managed to ensure effective and efficient attention that minimizes the impacts on the different environments. In this regard, coordination among the actors involved is crucial to strengthen this stage and reduce potential environmental impacts. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have proven effective in reducing risks, improving preparation for critical events, strengthening emergency response, and optimizing recovery after such events occur. In this research, Business Process Management (BPM) has been applied to identify related activities in emergency response with hazardous materials in a mutual aid environment. Additionally, these activities have been designed, modeled, and implemented in a web interface through simulation exercises that allowed for adjustments and process improvements. Among the main findings, it was found that implementing BPM for emergency response management has the potential to improve coordination among the actors involved and boost resource management.

This is typically achieved through the use of EEG amplifiers capable of receiving external triggers and synchronizing them with the EEG data. However, such equipment is often sourced as a compatible accessory from either thirdparty vendors or acquired separately from the original vendor after-sales, incurring in significant additional costs. This paper describes in detail the methodology and considerations taken into account for the design and cost-effective construction of an EEG signal-stimuli synchronization equipment, compatible with EEG devices equipped to record external triggers, making the development of such systems more accessible and affordable. Furthermore, it showcases a successful case study involving participants exposed to auditory stimuli, where stimuli-coherent timestamps, referred to as “onset triggers”, were used. This data configuration is in high demand in neuropsychology research and our work demonstrates its attainability through the development and integration of custom-engineered components. These components are not only adaptable but are also open to enhancements and low-cost replication. Finally, a discussion about the significance of this alternative approach is presented, particularly for emerging neuropsychology and brain researchers exploring new paradigms through experimental setups that require flexibility and higher data manipulation capabilities.","This work is funded by Call 785 of the Colombian Minister of Science and Technology and the “scholarship for graduate students” by the academic development office supported by the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia","This work is funded by Call 785 of the Colombian Minister of Science and Technology and the “scholarship for graduate students” by the academic development office supported by the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia",,2023 International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM),,,2023-12-20,2023,,2023-12-20,00,,101-106,Closed,Proceeding,"Olivares, Cristian Y.; Schettini, Norelli","Olivares, Cristian Y.

However, the components necessary for generating temporal marks, crucial for accurately timestamping when a subject receives a stimulus, are typically costly. This paper presents the development of a prototype designed for conducting EEG experiments while providing stimulus marks. The prototype is capable of receiving visual and auditory stimuli and offers haptic interaction through a switch button. It combines these signals into a unified stream, which is then transmitted to the EEG equipment. The processing hardware relies on the Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL), implemented on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). A test bench, utilizing PsychoPy in Python, was created to assess the prototype’s performance. The flexibility of the prototype allows researchers to fine-tune its settings, offering a cost-effective solution to the research community for conducting EEG experiments with heightened confidence in temporal analysis.","This work is supported by the Electrical and Electronics Faculty at the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.",,,2023 IEEE Colombian Caribbean Conference (C3),,,2023-11-25,2023,,2023-11-25,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Antequera, Nicolle A.; Flórez, Sebastián A.; Trocha, Neymer D.; Olivares, Cristian Y.; Schettini, Norelli","Antequera, Nicolle A.

Factorial analysis assesses the impact of particle size (3-8 mm and 8-20 mm) and bed agitation frequency (20 seconds every 2, 4, and 6 minutes) on key indicators. Equivalence ratio (ER) remains steady at 0.17-0.20, cold efficiency ranges from 44.8% to 58.8%, High Heating Value (HHV) fluctuates between 6.07 and 7.18 MJ/Nm3, and gasification temperatures vary between 850 and 900 °C. Bed agitation with high or low frequencies reduces gas flow, causing considerable variations. Increasing particle size benefits gas flow and process stability but negatively affects HHV, ER, and overall process efficiency. In transient analysis, gas flow takes longer to stabilize. Frequent agitation (1/140 s-1) results in fewer variations but slower stabilization, while less frequent agitation (1/380 s-1) causes greater variations and faster stabilization.

Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces.",The authors would like to acknowledge the support from NSF grant CAREER 2237313.,The authors would like to acknowledge the support from NSF grant CAREER 2237313.,,2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,,2023-10-21,2023,,2023-10-21,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Vieira, Camilo; Restrepo, David; De La Hoz, Jose L.","Vieira, Camilo (Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Restrepo, David (Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas); De La Hoz, Jose L.

Our approach differs from most machine learning for undergraduate courses, which usually teach about machine learning on a language-centric code-first basis. However, while not everyone needs to deploy a model in production, we should open the black box so they understand what they consume and help build through their data and feedback. Our results will contribute to the growing field of machine learning education as we explore students conceptual understanding about Machine Learning and its algorithms. Machine learning is relatively ubiquitous in many different fields and contexts. There are new developments that include machine learning algorithms that students interact with every day. From the auto-complete feature in their cellphones to the content they are shown while browsing the internet, machine learning algorithms shape the way students experience the world. Therefore, students must critically understand this technology and its implications for their lives. This study focuses on a four-week course module that included learning activities designed for students to develop their intuition regarding the benefits of implementing machine learning before moving to a programming language. Students recognize commercial uses of machine learning algorithms, apply the concepts in a visual programming environment, and reflect on the benefits and limitations of the algorithms. This work-in-progress paper presents the work of 13 participants who completed at least one of the following learning activities. The participants completed reflection activities that represented retrieval practice opportunities to consolidate their learning and a final project to demonstrate their understanding of machine learning and how it may be implemented.

The most popular methods used to estimate flow parameters can be divided into the noncontact and the contact -based modalities. Conductance-based and capacitive sensors are the most popular contact-based techniques used to provide flow parameter estimations. Among the noncontact sensors, optical-based systems are commonly utilized for multiphase flow classification. However, contact-based systems require specific proprieties from the analyzed fluid mixture such as high conductivity or low conductivity and they must be attached to the tube, so accurate measurements can be provided. On the other hand, optical devices lack robustness against ambient light conditions and might require complex computational processing pipelines. In this work, gas-liquid two-phase flow monitoring based on radar technology is proposed. Characteristic flow velocity distributions associated with different two-phase flows are remotely recognized by studying the reflected sub-THz signals that are phase-modulated by the moving gas-liquid interface. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed scheme for the identification of different gas-liquid two-phase flows using sub-THz radar imaging.",The authors wish to acknowledge National Science Foundation (NSF) for funding support under the Grant 1808613 and the Grant 2030094.,,,2023 IEEE Wireless and Microwave Technology Conference (WAMICON),,,2023-04-18,2023,,2023-04-18,00,,133-136,Closed,Proceeding,"Rodrigues, Davi V.

Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.",,,,2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,,2023-10-21,2023,,2023-10-21,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Castellanos, Hugo; Vieira, Camilo; Magana, Alejandra","Castellanos, Hugo (Computer and Information Technology, Purdue university, West Lafayette, IN, USA); Vieira, Camilo (Education Studies Institute, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Magana, Alejandra (Computer and Information Technology and Engineering Education, Purdue university, West Lafayette, IN, USA)",,"Castellanos, Hugo (Purdue University West Lafayette); Vieira, Camilo (Universidad del Norte); Magana, Alejandra (Purdue University West Lafayette)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167711169,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

This process, commonly referred to as de-identification or anonymization, involves identifying and obfuscating PHI within clinical text. Although open source systems capable of identifying such information have been developed primarily for the English language, recent progress has been made in the field of Spanish language de-identification. However, there remains a dearth of open source models specifically tailored for accurate identification of PHI in Spanish clinical text. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating state-of-the-art open source deep learning models for their efficacy in recognizing a subset of PHI elements. To accomplish this, a comprehensive assessment of all pre-trained models available in the Hugging Face model hub was conducted to ascertain their suitability for PHI identification in Spanish clinical texts. Furthermore, an automated framework was developed to facilitate the evaluation of these open source deep learning models in the context of PHI recognition within Spanish clinical text. These models are evaluated with the aim of identifying the best ones, providing a foundation for subsequent implementation in various fields of research, specifically in the context of anonymization. To evaluate the performance of the models, the MEDDOCAN corpus, comprising 500 annotated Spanish clinical notes, was utilized. The results of the analysis revealed four models that exhibited the highest performance. These models demonstrated favorable metrics in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, it was observed that leveraging the entirety of the text and maximizing the number of tokens provided to the models resulted in enhanced performance, as demonstrated in this study.",,,,2023 IEEE Colombian Caribbean Conference (C3),,,2023-11-25,2023,,2023-11-25,00,,1-4,Closed,Proceeding,"de Jesús Martínez Acosta, Deivis; Aguilar, José David Posada","de Jesús Martínez Acosta, Deivis (Department of System Engineering and Computing, University of the North Popular University of the Cesar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Aguilar, José David Posada (Department of System Engineering and Computing, University of the North, Barranquilla, Colombia)","de Jesús Martínez Acosta, Deivis (Department of System Engineering and Computing, University of the North Popular University of the Cesar, Barranquilla, Colombia)","de Jesús Martínez Acosta, Deivis (Department of System Engineering and Computing, University of the North Popular University of the Cesar, Barranquilla, Colombia); Aguilar, José David Posada (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169062910,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics",

The focus is on individual coping strategies and the factor of reconciliation in victims of armed conflict. In the case of CONSTANCE IA, the Reconciliation Factor was identified from the Psychosocial Disposition Factors in Conflict questionnaire (CDPC). The study aims to establish whether there is a causal relationship with the variables of the Modified Coping Strategies Scale (EEC-M) questionnaire, identifying psychomarkers that would allow for the creation of a short intervention plan in the areas of prevention, promotion, or rehabilitation for conflict victims relocated in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. A non-experimental methodology with a cross-sectional design was used, with a total of 363 participants. The results highlight that elements related to economic factors, individual condition, and political concerns in the victims explain the conditions required to generate a reconciliation process in the context of reintegrating into civilian life. One of the conclusions is that the use of artificial intelligence enhances the process of psychological care by providing precision in the etiological information of the illness and the data, which enables discrimination between the health status, symptoms, and disease of the victims in order to contribute to the fulfillment of indicator 3.4 of the SDG: By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.",,,,2023 IEEE International Humanitarian Technology Conference (IHTC),,,2023-11-03,2023,,2023-11-03,00,,1-8,Closed,Proceeding,"De Lange, Anthony Millan; Brito, Carmen Molinares; Dasuki, Karim Hussein; Valencia, Stefany Baena","De Lange, Anthony Millan (Psichology Department, Universidad Del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Brito, Carmen Molinares (Formative Research Area Universidad del Sinu – Seccional Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Dasuki, Karim Hussein (Directorate of Social Projection and Extension, Universidad del Sinu – Seccional Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia); Valencia, Stefany Baena (Research Group i-Cluster Corporacion i-Cluster)","De Lange, Anthony Millan (Universidad del Norte)","De Lange, Anthony Millan (Universidad del Norte); Brito, Carmen Molinares (Universidad del Sinú); Dasuki, Karim Hussein (Universidad del Sinú); Valencia, Stefany Baena (Research Group i-Cluster Corporacion i-Cluster)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171282368,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 3 Good Health and Well Being"

In the context of image generation, prompt engineering refers to the process of providing a text or image prompt to a machine learning model to generate an image that meets certain criteria. The quality of the prompt can significantly impact the quality of the generated image. Hence, prompt engineering is an important part of the image generation process. By providing a well-crafted prompt that accurately describes the desired image, the generative model will more likely produce an image that meets the desired criteria. In the context of this study, students created prompts that were converted into images using Text-to-image Generative Models. When adequately prompted, these images are meant to visually describe their understanding of the concepts we have discussed during traditional lectures. The participants were presented with their own image as well as others' images to elicit both agreements or concerns at two levels: their understanding of the concepts and their understanding of the importance of prompting in the foreseeable future of AI-based systems. Hitherto, we have tried to use the generation of images using natural language for answering these research questions: i) for students, to which extent the crafting prompts may elicit thinking about the structural engineering phenomena? and ii) for instructors, to which extent these represent the level of understanding of the students on these topics?",The First Author acknowledges the financial support provided by 2021 SGR 01163 and the Technical University of Catalonia with the grant AGRUPS.,The First Author acknowledges the financial support provided by 2021 SGR 01163 and the Technical University of Catalonia with the grant AGRUPS.,,2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,,2023-10-21,2023,,2023-10-21,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Chacón, Rolando; Vieira, Camilo; Murzi, Homero","Chacón, Rolando (U.

The idea of LFAC is the formation of a transmission sub-grid at the desired voltage and frequency using a grid-forming control strategy such as Droop Control. For this reason, this work evaluates the small-signal stability of a point-to-point LFAC line controlled by Droop Control to establish safe limits in selecting the droop gains. In this sense, the Eigenvalue Analysis is used to determine how the droop gains and the system’s parameters affect the stability. The results show that the overall system’s dynamic is governed by the sum of the converters’ droop gains. Additionally, the droop gain at the marginally stable operating point is affected by the line’s length, the line’s R/X ratio, the operating frequency, and voltage. Also, the slow dynamics in the power measurement filter increases the droop gain range over which the system is stable. This work also proposes useful symbolic expressions that allow us to visualize how the system’s parameters affect the marginally stable operating point. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the analytical findings.","Authors acknowledge support from Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC), the Fulbright-MinCiencias Scholarship and the Universidad del Norte’s Faculty Development Scholarship.",,,2023 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE),,,2023-11-02,2023,,2023-11-02,00,,2676-2683,Closed,Proceeding,"Castillo-Sierra, Rafael; Venkataramanan, Giri; Ramirez, Dionisio","Castillo-Sierra, Rafael (Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA); Venkataramanan, Giri (Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA); Ramirez, Dionisio (Escuela Superior de Ingenieros Industriales, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain)","Castillo-Sierra, Rafael (University of Wisconsin–Madison)","Castillo-Sierra, Rafael (University of Wisconsin–Madison); Venkataramanan, Giri (University of Wisconsin–Madison); Ramirez, Dionisio (Technical University of Madrid)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167438013,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The pivotal factor influencing the choice of a solar thermal system lies in the temperatures achievable by flat and curved concentrators. Flat solar collectors are typically utilized for applications such as generating hot water, where evaporation isn't necessary due to the achieved temperature hovering around ninety degrees Celsius. On the other hand, high concentration collectors, distinguished by their non-planar configuration, are often categorized based on their curvature, like parabolic collectors and parabolic trough concentrators. These types excel when higher temperatures are sought, allowing for water evaporation, and facilitating more powerful applications. This study involves temperature measurements and energy efficiency assessments of both flat and curved collectors, each covering an area of one square meter. These collectors are integrated into systems for domestic ironing and water evaporation. Through the utilization of software and hardware for data acquisition and storage, an efficiency approximation for scaled models is calculated.

This model is rooted in a modified version of the Leader Progression Model (LPM) that incorporates stochastic attributes, resulting in a reduction in the computational resources required for describing the downward leader in lightning phenomena. The integral discharge channel model is employed to evaluate the shielding failure rate, and its outcomes are juxtaposed with those derived from the conventional electrogeometric model, applied to a 220 kV overhead transmission line spanning from Canutillar to Puerto Montt. Both the Shielding Failure Rate (SFR) and the Shielding Failure Flashover Rate (SFFOR) are computed for both models, facilitating a comprehensive comparative analysis. It is noteworthy that the values obtained from the LPM tend to be higher, primarily due to the LPM’s consideration of the tortuous and branching characteristics inherent in the lightning channel.",The authors would like to thank to Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María for supporting this study through the research project PI-LIR- 2022-14.,The authors would like to thank to Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María for supporting this study through the research project PI-LIR- 2022-14.,,2023 IEEE Colombian Caribbean Conference (C3),,,2023-11-25,2023,,2023-11-25,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Rivera, Sergio Zumarán; Chaparro, Johny Montaña","Rivera, Sergio Zumarán (Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile); Chaparro, Johny Montaña (Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile)","Rivera, Sergio Zumarán (Federico Santa María Technical University)","Rivera, Sergio Zumarán (Federico Santa María Technical University); Chaparro, Johny Montaña (Federico Santa María Technical University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169052244,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering,

Although the Cesar River is one the main tributary of the Magdalena River, very few studies, if any, have focused on estimating soil erosion rates in the Cesar watershed. This contribution addresses this gap by presenting soil erosion rates calculated specifically for the Cesar watershed. It is based on the RUSLE-GGS (RUSLE-GIS-GLUE-SDR) erosion model at the watershed scale. The estimates cover a period from 1991 up to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 2.5 km. Different scenarios were modeled to assess and predict the variations in sediment yield and to fit the model to the sediment concentration data observed in local sediment gauging stations. By using the Getis-Ord statistical analysis, hotspots where soil erosion is most pronounced were identified. To the best of our knowledge, this contribution represents the first assessment of soil erosion in the Cesar watershed. In addition to providing a basis for future research, the results are expected to contribute to the formulation of appropriate scenarios to address the restoration of the Cesar River. Finally, the study triggers a discussion on the sustainable management of the basin to explore solutions aimed at preserving the integrity of this vital water resource.","This manuscript was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation and the Fund for Science, Technology, and Innovation of the General Royalty System within the framework of the &quot;Bicentennial Doctoral Excellence Scholarship Program, defined in article 45 of the Law 1942 of 2018.&quot; We acknowledge the technical discussions on the matter with Dr. Willem Viveen, Dr. Miluska A.

Early diagnosis is essential to avoid its severe impacts. This paper seeks to compare classical machine learning techniques with ensemble approaches in the early classification of dengue: Dengue without alarm signs (DNWS), Dengue with alarm signs (DWWS) and Severe Dengue (SD). A dataset available at https://www.datos.gov.co/ from the Colombian government with 53,814 records and 38 attributes is used. The data are processed in Google Colab using Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy, while Scikit-learn is used for modeling. The results are supported by a detailed confusion matrix, revealing the actual performance of each model and highlighting the superiority of the ensemble approaches over classical techniques in early dengue classification. The Stacking method achieves an accuracy (Acc) of 88%, outperforming all other techniques employed. Among the classical techniques, Decision Tree (DT) achieved the best result with an Acc of 84%. In conclusion, when contrasting the performance of classical techniques and ensemble approaches in early dengue classification, it is highlighted that the latter demonstrate robustness in terms of quality metrics, such as accuracy, recall and F1-Score. This observation suggests that ensemble approaches have the potential to overcome the limitations associated with classical techniques, resulting in more robust and accurate achievements.","This study has been possible thanks to the support of the Bicentennial scholarship, granted by the Ministry of Science of Colombia for doctoral studies in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the Universidad de la Costa-CUC.",,,2023 IEEE Colombian Caribbean Conference (C3),,,2023-11-25,2023,,2023-11-25,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Arrubla-Hoyos, Wilson; Seveiche-Maury, Zurisaddai; Saeed, Khalid; Gómez, Jorge Eliecer Gómez; De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro","Arrubla-Hoyos, Wilson (Faculty of Engineering, University of Sucre, Sincelejo, Colombia); Seveiche-Maury, Zurisaddai (Faculty of Engineering, University of Sucre, Sincelejo, Colombia); Saeed, Khalid (Faculty of Computer Science, Bialystok University of Technology, Bialystok, Poland); Gómez, Jorge Eliecer Gómez (Faculty of Engineering, University of Cordoba, Monteria, Colombia); De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro (Department Computer Science and Electronics, Corporación Universidad de la Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Arrubla-Hoyos, Wilson (University of Sucre)","Arrubla-Hoyos, Wilson (University of Sucre); Seveiche-Maury, Zurisaddai (University of Sucre); Saeed, Khalid (Bialystok University of Technology); Gómez, Jorge Eliecer Gómez (University of Córdoba); De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro (University of the Coast)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169058386,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,3 Good Health and Well Being

On the other hand, a technology watch is a tool that helps to make decisions based on the information obtained, thanks to which the process of using video games for education students can be improved. Subsequently, this paper reviews 25 articles on the introduction of 2D and 3D video games in different grades of education and technology watch; furthermore, they were classified by types of video games, methodology, variety of graphics, and many other points. Also, their differences and similarities, such as the type of education or the age range for which the video games are intended, were compared. Finally, this publication indicates how many articles touch on technology watch related to education and video games to verify how important this is.",,,,2023 IEEE Colombian Caribbean Conference (C3),,,2023-11-25,2023,,2023-11-25,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Verastegui-Santiago, Jesús O.; Andrade-Macotela, Coraly; Valcarcel-Castillo, Hector; Aylas-Mayta, Geraldine; Candiotti-Chamorro, Gianella A.; Huamanchahua, Deyby; Escobar-Baquerizo, Suni","Verastegui-Santiago, Jesús O.

1093,pub.1169060284,10.1109/c358072.2023.10436307,,,Contamination of water resources by agrochemicals used in agricultural crops: a review from the ecological and human health risk,"The widespread use of agrochemicals in agriculture leads to significant environmental contamination, particularly in water resources. These toxic substances directly harm aquatic ecosystems and, through bioaccumulation and biomagnification, affect the food chain, ultimately impacting the health of communities reliant on these water sources for drinking. However, esticides, despite their low concentrations, can persist and travel long distances, significantly affecting the environment. A search conducted using Web of Science and co-occurrence analysis gathered scientific articles on the subject. Key findings indicate that agricultural activities primarily contaminate water resources with agrochemicals, requiring specialized analytical techniques for concentration identification. All case studies analyzed establish a direct link between ecological risks and human health effects. Considering that most consulted research addressed the issue of contamination in both surface and groundwater sources concurrently, the higher concentrations of agrochemicals were predominantly associated with surface water.",,,,2023 IEEE Colombian Caribbean Conference (C3),,,2023-11-25,2023,,2023-11-25,00,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Joseph, Soto-Verjel; Aymer, Maturana-Córdoba; Salvador, Villamizar","Joseph, Soto-Verjel (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Institudo de Estudios Hidraúlicos y Ambiental IDEHA - Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Aymer, Maturana-Córdoba (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Institudo de Estudios Hidraúlicos y Ambiental IDEHA - Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia); Salvador, Villamizar (Departamento de Ingeniería Civil y Ambiental, Institudo de Estudios Hidraúlicos y Ambiental IDEHA - Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia)","Joseph, Soto-Verjel (Universidad del Norte)","Joseph, Soto-Verjel (Universidad del Norte); Aymer, Maturana-Córdoba (Universidad del Norte); Salvador, Villamizar (Universidad del Norte)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169060284,41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,2 Zero Hunger

Mainstream historiography depicts Colombian independence as the achievement of European-descendent elites only, downplaying the role and importance of regional subaltern classes. Múnera’s well-researched account challenges theoretical, political, and cultural interventions and shows that these subaltern groups were pivotal to achieving independence from Spain. It was their organizing and pressing for freedom from colonial domination that ultimately brought about independence in Cartagena and later to the whole country. Yet Múnera demonstrates that these differing regional elites meant that a single, coherent unity across New Granada was not possible, a point that would ultimately doom subsequent nation-building efforts. Offering a truly decolonizing perspective, one that has remained hidden from official accounts of Colombian independence, scholars and researchers in political science, history, sociology, and anthropology will welcome the opportunity to read this work for the first time in translation.",,,,,,,2023-07-10,2023,2023-07-10,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Múnera, Alfonso","Múnera, Alfonso ()",,"Múnera, Alfonso ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160597749,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 44 Human Society; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

A GEOLOGICAL AND TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT,"The extraction and utilization of planetary materials in situ are of utmost importance to establish a sustainable human presence on Mars. Among these resources, water stands out as the most valuable due to its potential for producing rocket propellants and supporting life systems for astronauts. This research delves into the water resources in Meridiani Planum, an equatorial region where the presence of hydrated sulfates has been confirmed. Leveraging data from the Opportunity Rover and its advanced instruments� the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) and the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES)�chemical and mineralogical information were processed and classified using statistical methods. The authors go beyond data analysis, presenting a comprehensive high-level concept for acquiring the ore, mineral processing, and water extraction through dehydration techniques. Excavation and physical preparation are examined, incorporating crushing and beneficiation stages. Furthermore, the work includes calculating the temperature, enthalpy, Gibbs energy and kinetic for sulfates dehydration. The outcomes are highlighted through a conceptual architecture, offering estimations regarding mineral throughput for a pilot plant capable of supplying sufficient water to sustain six astronauts throughout an entire Martian year. This study sets a foundation for future endeavours in realizing the ambitious goal of establishing a selfsustaining human presence on Mars.",,,International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference & EXPO SGEM,"23rd SGEM International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Proceedings 2023, Nano, Bio, Green and Space: Technologies for a Sustainable Future, Vol. 23, Issue 6.1",,,2023-10-01,2023,,2023-10-01,23,,447-456,Closed,Proceeding,"Jamanca-Lino, Gustavo; Guerra Guevara, Clairet","Jamanca-Lino, Gustavo (Universidad Privada del Norte / Colorado School of Mines); Guerra Guevara, Clairet (Colorado School of Mines)",,"Jamanca-Lino, Gustavo (Private University of the North); Guerra Guevara, Clairet (Colorado School of Mines)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170953349,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 40 Engineering; 51 Physical Sciences; 5101 Astronomical Sciences,

AN ISRU CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE,"Because of the incoming mission of Artemis on the Moon, the extraction of water, oxygen, and metal from the lunar regolith is necessary, which involves intensive power requirements. To keep a mining unit operation running continuously, a technical solution known as the Tall Lunar Tower (TLT) claims to be able to capture sunlight 93% of the time through a solar panel structure. The composition of a typical panel is 76% glass, 10% polymer, 8% aluminum, 5% pure silicon, and 1% other metals. Fortunately, we just need to transport polymers, wire, and minor components from Earth because the regolith on the Moon contains large amounts of silicon and aluminum oxides. This article presents an ISRU architecture to provide plagioclase ore concentrate, the main mineral for the extraction of aluminum and silicon, detailing aspects such as the engineering challenges and the technological solutions for excavation, transport, and processing; all these calculations are based on a hypothetical construction and deployment of TLT at the South Pole. Processing techniques such as screening and magnetic separation are discussed to evaluate their advantages and drawbacks to obtain a concentrate of 70% plagioclase with 18% of global recovery.",,,International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference & EXPO SGEM,"23rd SGEM International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Proceedings 2023, Nano, Bio, Green and Space: Technologies for a Sustainable Future, Vol. 23, Issue 6.1",,,2023-10-01,2023,,2023-10-01,23,,431-438,Closed,Proceeding,"Jamanca-Lino, Gustavo","Jamanca-Lino, Gustavo (Universidad Privada del Norte / Colorado School of Mines)",,"Jamanca-Lino, Gustavo (Private University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170953347,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4001 Aerospace Engineering,

This approximation considers deviations from the equilibrium point made by springs that get stretched and compressed. Then, we derive the equations of motion from the Lagrangian formulation and find the frequency dispersion ratio using plane wave solutions. Since we obtain N coupled linear equations of motion, we propose an expression for a wave packet by superposition. Finally, considering an impulse highly localized at the central point of the system as the initial condition of the problem, we describe how the wave packet expands on the string.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,"IWOSP 2021, INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL PHYSICS",,,2023-05-15,2023,,2023-05-15,2731,1,030003,Closed,Proceeding,"Nogales, Benny; Curilef, Sergio","Nogales, Benny (Universidad Mayor de San Simón, Av.

We consider the stellar fluid composed of nucleons and electrons confined in a Wigner-Seitz cell surrounded by free photons. Besides, we implement a temperature depending on the mass density with the presence of an isothermal core. The impact of temperature on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs is observed. We compare our results with massive white dwarfs estimated from the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the high-surface gravity white dwarfs are well described by our curves with higher central temperatures. Our results suggest that these hot massive stars detected are within the range of white dwarfs with more radial stability. Moreover, we note the radial instability is attained before the pycnonuclear reaction for Tc ≥ 1.0 × 108[K].",,,,The Sixteenth Marcel Grossmann Meeting,,,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,2023-02,,,4508-4513,Closed,Proceeding,"Nunes, Sílvia P.; Arbañil, José D.

For such end, it is necessary to get an expression of the survival probability, and in this way, to obtain different analytical expressions that will be analyzed. Also, we will obseve the analytical scope of the resulting expressions. The relationship between the Weibull distribution and the irrigation function is effectively described, with which the analytical probability function of the model is constructed. As a result, the expressions for Shannon’s entropy, Disequilibrium and LMC Complexity are obtained, where they are analyzed with respect to the scale parameter t0 and form parameter n.

The first one concerns the calculation of Lyapunov exponents starting from the called tangent dynamics, which arises from the linearization of Hamilton equations. The second approach is the called geodynamic approach developed by Pettini and collaborators, which is based on the Riemannian reformulation of Hamiltonian dynamics. Our interest will be focused on systems with low dimensionality, such as a system of coupled anharmonic oscillators of the type β-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam Hamiltonian (β -FPU).",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,"IWOSP 2021, INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL PHYSICS",,,2023-05-15,2023,,2023-05-15,2731,1,040007,Closed,Proceeding,"Castillo, M.; Velazquez, L.; Calderón, F.

There are cameras that use an optical sensor, which generates images in the RGB model. There are some cameras that use thermal sensors, which perform the registration of the temperature of the object being recorded and presents them under a color model using a color map. This research study uses a novel method to fuse optical and thermal images with the intention of being able to recognize certain parts of the human body. This study evaluates the presence of veins that have a higher temperature when performing rehabilitation exercises. The results allow to evaluate different combinations of color bands. In order to demonstrate the method, the use and application will depend on the analysis of the image and the interpretation by health personnel. At the time of merging the images, the optical image provides the structural part of the image, and the thermal image provides the functionality characterized by the body temperature.

Our phase diagrams give numerical evidence of the existence of a wealth of regions of multistability produced by the birth of tongue-like structures of stable periodic orbits, born due to simple Shil’nikov bifurcations along a saddle node bifurcation curve and then invade the background region of a fixed point attractor. The system contains networks of stable islands of regular oscillations with ever-increasing periodicities containing chaotic islands that accumulate systematically toward a Hopf bifurcation curve boundary. This strong parameter sensitivity makes the Lorenz-84 model a promising candidate of a testing ground to validate techniques of assessing the sensitivity of low-order models to perturbations of parameters.",,,AIP Conference Proceedings,"IWOSP 2021, INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL PHYSICS",,,2023-05-15,2023,,2023-05-15,2731,1,040004,Closed,Proceeding,"Abraham, C.; Chávez, T.; Fuentes, Iván E.; Patricio, Alvear O.; Curilef, Sergio","Abraham, C.

In a single architecture, the proposed NMPC strategy is aimed at trajectory tracking and involves real-time re-planning of pre-scheduled points in a given crop mapped against static and dynamic obstacles. A Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme was adopted to ensure feasibility in the optimization process, even when meeting tightened constraints. A set of potential field functions is formulated to minimize tracking errors and control effort while maximizing obstacle avoidance. The benefits of the proposed strategy regarding performance, constraint satisfaction, and computational were tested via simulations and field trials on an SSMR Husky A200. The results evidenced that prioritizing the robot position and obstacle speeds reduced the tracking error and input effort by 45.3% and 40.8% respectively, compared to the scenario prioritizing only obstacle positions. Thus, prioritizing the obstacle model further mitigates the collision risks in the agricultural field.","The authors thank the support of ANID under Fondecyt Iniciaci6n en Investigaci6n 2023 Grant 11230962.

This paper develops a quantitative, descriptive, and correlational research on the assessments that university professors from PA countries make of their digital competence, the didactic use of ICT, and the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had in the habits of the use of ICT in the lectures. For this, a validated questionnaire has been used, which has been passed to a sample of 731 professors from the PA countries and whose responses were statistically analyzed. As a result, it has been identified that the assessment given of ICT is very high and that its use has grown after the pandemic in general, but unevenly among the different countries of the PA.

It improves flexibility, scalability and management of the network by separating forwarding logic and control logic. SDN controllers offer the ability to dynamically modify traffic forwarding rules and have a comprehensive view of the entire network. However, Introducing SDN brings some new vulnerabilities to DDoS attacks, such as single point of failure. Attacks known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) overload network links with illegal traffic at high speeds. Illegal traffic consumes network bandwidth, resulting in legal packets lost and network services unavailable. Low Rate Distributed Denial of Service (LRDDoS) attack is a variant of DDoS attacks and is becoming one of the most serious vulnerabilities. LRDDoS attacks consume network resources by periodically sending a relatively small number of packets. Consequently, it is harder to detect LRDDoS attacks. This paper proposes a real-time system for LRDDoS defense in SDN. The system uses Random Forest(RF) to detect attacks. We call this system as RFLRS. In addition, based on the CIC dataset, we suggest a feature subset that is most suitable for RFLRS to speed up classification. The experimental results show that RF performs a 99.8% accuracy with a reduction of 28% classification time.",,,,2023 33rd International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference,,,2023-12-01,2023,,2023-12-01,00,,304-309,Closed,Proceeding,"Liu, Shijin; Fukuda, Hiroaki; Leger, Paul","Liu, Shijin (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan); Leger, Paul (Escuela de Ingeniería, Universidad Católica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"Liu, Shijin (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Fukuda, Hiroaki (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Leger, Paul (Catholic University of the North)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167436060,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

This work presents a control strategy based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to operate an Active Front-End (AFE). The research's originality lies in finding an optimal control policy that leverages DRL's capabilities to enhance the AFE control performance, all without prior information regarding power converter dynamics and parameters. Moreover, the control strategy is designed to ensure the adaptability of the converter across diverse operational scenarios. To this end, multiple intelligent agents are developed, trained, tested, and validated using the AFE converter dynamics. Simulated results demonstrated that the proposed control methodology exhibits robustness, effectively handling uncertainties associated with the converter. Also, the empirical findings reveal that the proposed control strategy presents a solid performance in the current control and DC-link voltage control tasks, with a maximum Total Harmonic Distortion of 4.25% for 10 kHz sampling frequency.","J.

During the crop yield, manoeuvring tasks on changing and heterogeneous terrain surfaces lead autonomous vehicles to loose motion precision due to slipping or sliding phenomena, thus requiring an adaptable motion strategy to overcome a deteriorated control performance. In this scenario, this work proposes a gain-scheduling technique based on three non-supervised learning algorithms. In particular, clustering and self-tuning strategies are combined to obtain the best control parameters of trajectory tracking controllers. The proposed approaches are real-time implemented on two motion controllers and tested on an omnidirectional holonomic mobile manipulator –KUKA youBot. Results from trials with different reference trajectories and navigation terrains showed that the control performance could be enhanced, reaching around a 30.1% of tracking error reduction and 54.6% of total cost when using the proposed clustering approaches. The latter may impact on the energy resources of the mobile manipulator throughout harvesting tasks.",,"This work was supported and funded by ANID under Fondecyt iniciación en investigación 2023 grant 11230962.

In meals served in restaurants, schools or public canteens, it is not easy to identify the ingredients and/or the nutritional information they contain. Currently, technological solutions based on deep learning models have facilitated the recording and tracking of food consumed based on the recognition of the main dish present in an image. Considering that sometimes there may be multiple foods served on the same plate, food analysis should be treated as a multi-class object detection problem. EfficientDet and YOLOv5 are object detection algorithms that have demonstrated high mAP and real-time performance on general domain data. However, these models have not been evaluated and compared on public food datasets. Unlike general domain objects, foods have more challenging features inherent in their nature that increase the complexity of detection. In this work, we performed a performance evaluation of Efficient-Det and YOLOv5 on three public food datasets: UNIMIB2016, UECFood256 and ChileanFood64. From the results obtained, it can be seen that YOLOv5 provides a significant difference in terms of both mAP and response time compared to EfficientDet in all datasets. Furthermore, YOLOv5 outperforms the state-of-the-art on UECFood256, achieving an improvement of more than 4% in terms of mAP@.50 over the best reported.",,This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) (Grant No. FONDECYT INICIACIÓN 11230262),,2023 IEEE 13th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS),,,2023-07-07,2023,,2023-07-07,00,,1-7,Closed,Proceeding,"Morales, Roberto; Quispe, Juan; Aguilar, Eduardo","Morales, Roberto (Dept. of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Quispe, Juan (Dept. of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile); Aguilar, Eduardo (Dept. of Computing and Systems Engineering, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile)",,"Morales, Roberto (Catholic University of the North); Quispe, Juan (Catholic University of the North); Aguilar, Eduardo (Catholic University of the North)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160828780,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,2 Zero Hunger

This work comprehensively analyses a model-free control algorithm for three-phase inverters using DRL agents. To this end, different deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agents with variable hyperparameters were conceptualized, designed, and tested. On average, DDPG agents were shown to have excellent performance in the control of power inverters. Indeed, DDPG agents reduce the impact of model uncertainties and non-linear dynamics. To validate the proposed control policy, the two-level voltage source power inverter is simulated. Also, the main features of the control strategy are analyzed in terms of computational cost, root medium square error (RMSE), and total harmonic distortion (THD). Simulated results reveal that the proposed control strategy exhibits strong performance in the current control task, achieving a maximum RMSE of 0.78 A and a THD of 3.17% for a 6 kHz sampling frequency.","J.

The non-probabilistic sampling technique was used for convenience, cross-sectional of causal relationship through the structural equation model (SEM). The study population was made up of people residing in Lima who reported having been working in the teleworking modality. The sample consisted of 326 teleworkers (65.3% women and 34.7% men). The results showed that both work autonomy and work-life balance have a direct, positive, and significant impact on job satisfaction; being the work-life balance the one that presented a greater impact on job satisfaction (R=0.679, p<0.000). Likewise, labor autonomy presented a minor impact (R= 0.405, p<0.000), but equally important. The global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned organizations to adopt the teleworking modality on a mandatory basis in several of their operations , registering an increase in the emotional exhaustion and work burnout that impacted the quality of life , mental health and job satisfaction of workers due to the effort in adapting to the job and the context they faced [1], [2] Among the most noticeable health consequences resulting from this situation were increased anxiety and sleep disorders [3], which had consequences on the effectiveness of the assigned functions and the productivity of workers [4], [5]. In addition, the abrupt change to teleworking affected the daily work obligations of the worker since they had to face the difficulties of the family environment and other events that impacted the development of their work responsibilities [6]. Due to this situation , managers developed new strategies with the help of technology to ensure employee productivity under the condition of teleworking [2], [7]. As a result, the flexibility of working from home became a new way of operating for many workers and a new work culture for organizations that, in some cases, extended beyond the mandatory restrictions and continued after the restart economy and the decrease in the post-pandemic health crisis [8].",,,,"Proceedings of the 2023 7th International Conference on E-Commerce, E-Business and E-Government",,,2023-04-27,2023,2023-07-19,2023-04-27,,,79-86,Closed,Proceeding,"García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz; Rondon-Eusebio, Rafael Fernando","García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Faculty of Management Science, Universidad Autonoma del Peru, Peru); Rondon-Eusebio, Rafael Fernando (Department of Humanities, Universidad Privada del Norte, Peru)",,"García-Salirrosas, Elizabeth Emperatriz (Universidad Autónoma del Perú); Rondon-Eusebio, Rafael Fernando (Private University of the North)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160804995,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies",3 Good Health and Well Being; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Michael Chazan provides a translation of Éric Boëda’s authoritative work Techno-logique & Technologie, which draws on the latter’s career of research on stone tool assemblages from archaeological sites in Europe, the Middle East, China, and South America, together with a theoretical apparatus influenced by the work of Gilbert Simondon. This book presents a major challenge to all archaeologists studying ancient technology to reconsider how they think about artifacts and how to approach the question of progress through time in human technology. Lithic analysis is a highly empirical field of study that rarely has an impact on issues of broad theoretical interest, and Boëda’s book is a welcome exception. Michael Chazan, himself a Paleolithic archaeologist specializing in stone tool technology, includes an interview with the author to help equip the reader to engage with this challenging text. Chiming with the growth of interest in the work of Gilbert Simondon in the English-speaking world, this book is an important resource for Paleolithic archaeologists and lithic specialists.

Economic thought in Colombia can only be revealed through the exploration of economists’ practices and the role of economic arguments within broader public debate. This history of Colombian economic thought provides a detailed account of major issues that have marked the constant feedback between economic ideas and economic practice in Colombia during the 19th and 20th centuries. This volume is thus a history of the interaction between ideas and policy. Those involved in these debates – politicians, public officials, journalists, and, latterly, professional economists – established direct contact with what can be identified as the centers of production of economic theory (both in Europe and the US) and entered regional and local networks in economics, but were not just importers of ideas or theories. The way in which they read, discussed, transformed and applied economic theories in Colombia makes for a rich environment for the production and implementation of economic policies that drew, diverged and transformed the way economics was understood and used as a source of knowledge for practical concerns. This is why the history of Colombian economic thought does not fit into traditional typologies of economic schools and why it must be understood as part of a political debate and within a political, social and cultural context that demanded specific solutions to urgent social demands. Through the study of what was taught, when and how, at the beginnings of the republican era, and why and how professional economists came to lead public debate and economic policy making in the 20th century, this book explores the foundations of this permanent interaction between theory and practice. This book will be of significant interest to readers of history of economic thought, economic history and the history of Colombian and Latin American economic, political and social life more broadly.",,,,,,,2023-07-20,2023,2023-07-20,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162262195,38 Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,

The content of both volumes includes many of the first issues addressed by researchers, scholars, and practitioners across the Americas at the start of the pandemic – before vaccines, before knowledge of treatment and impact, before our worlds and daily lives were forever changed. Chapters in the first volume focus on the impacts of the pandemic in mental health, social and family dynamics, educational processes and the work of health professionals. Chapters in the second volume are dedicated to studies addressing the impacts of the pandemic in vulnerable populations; proposals of psychological interventions to deal with the distress caused by COVID-19; strategies of coping, resilience and adaptation; and the development of psychological instruments of measurement and assessments during the pandemic. The content of these two volumes marks a baseline for the collective work initiated by psychologists who came together to answer the call to combat the pandemic across the Americas.

It demonstrates that numerical methods (finite elements, finite volumes, finite differences) are a relevant response to the challenge to optimize the utilization of cement in concrete constructions while checking that these constructions have a lifespan compatible with the stakes of sustainable development. They are indeed accurate tools for an optimized design of concrete constructions, and allow us to consider all types of complexities: for example, those linked to rheological, physicochemical and mechanical properties of concrete, those linked to the geometry of the structures or even to the environmental boundary conditions. This optimization must also respectconstraints of time, money, security, energy, CO2 emissions, and, more generally, life cycle more reliably than the codes and analytical approaches currently used. Numerical methods are, undoubtedly, the best calculation tools at the service of concrete eco-construction.

Daniel is a British Council Research Partner and is also on the editorial board of AM Digital’s Apartheid South Africa, 1981-1994 digitisation project. This book analyses the British government’s use of cultural diplomacy in South Africa from 1960 to 1994. Previously, scholarship on UK-South African relations has focussed mainly on political, economic, or military links; this book makes an important and original intervention by emphasising how the British government sought to use cultural ties as part of its diplomacy in South Africa. The book also highlights the controversy these links generated owing to broader international efforts to ostracise South Africa owing to the racist apartheid system in the country at the time. By examining British policy towards educational exchanges, performing arts tours, radio and television broadcasts, and sporting contact, this book provides a dynamic case study from which to analyse Britain’s use of cultural diplomacy during a period of relative decline, while also adding a new layer to the well-established literature on the UK-South African special relationship.",,,Britain and the World,,,,2023,2023,,2023,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Feather, Daniel J.","Feather, Daniel J.

Produced anonymously in 1838, The Tree of Legal Knowledge is an elaborate visualization in five large colored plates of the law as stated in Sir William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England. Intended as “an assistant for students in the study of law,” the study aid was not a simple diagram but a beautiful tree with each branch and twig labeled with legal terms and concepts from the Commentaries. Not for law students only, the original was also intended to be of use to the practicing attorney and educated gentleman “in consolidating his learning and forming an instructive and ornamental appendage to an office.” Although Blackstone’s Commentaries had been first published eighty years earlier, it remained the primary source for knowledge of English law and required reading for American law students. The Commentaries remain relevant today and are frequently cited by the U.S. Supreme Court as a source for the original understanding of legal rights and obligations at the time of American Independence. Despite its artistic beauty and academic significance, The Tree of Legal Knowledge had seemingly disappeared shortly after its publication. It is not included in the collection of any library, including the Library of Congress or in Yale University’s Blackstone Collection, the largest in the world. It is not listed in the comprehensive Bibliographical Catalog of William Blackstone, edited by Ann Jordan Laeuchli, published for the Yale Law Library in 2015. The present volume reproduces the only extant copy of The Tree of Legal Knowledge. It includes an introduction by the editor that places The Tree in historical context and identifies the anonymous author, an otherwise unknown lawyer. In addition, it reprints the original author’s introduction and “explanation of the branches,” both extensively annotated.

Bethell, an intelligence officer and later, a border agent, is the protagonist who facilitated the acquisition of arms for Montshiwa's Ratshidi-Barolong to resist the depredations of freebooters, mercenaries based mostly in the Transvaal. In his alliance with Kgosi Montshiwa Tawana, Bethell identifies with Kgosi Montshiwa’s struggle to maintain political independence and economic security. The alliance was further cemented by Bethell’s marriage to a Morolong woman Tepo Boapile – an unusual occurrence in nineteenth century southern Africa. Surrounded by aggressive freebooters from across their eastern border with the Transvaal and the ambiguous forces of colonial advancement from the Cape colony and Britain, Montshiwa and Bethell form an unlikely but enduring relationship aimed at safeguarding Rolong interests. As the Bechuanaland Wars of the early to mid-1880s intensify in brutality Montshiwa and his Chief of Staff, Christopher Bethell are forced to desperate measures to defend the Rolong and avoid outright dispossession. Bethell’s demise is the trigger for firm British imperial intervention, the securing of the Road to the North and events that will determine the fate of Africans in south and central Africa. The book is a reminder that, in the author’s words, “past relations between South Africa’s different races were characterised as much by collusion and collaboration as they were by hostility, friction and dissent.” This book describes the career of an English aristocrat, Christopher Bethell.The book is a reminder that, in the author’s words, “past relations between South Africa’s different races were characterised as much by collusion and collaboration as they were by hostility, friction and dissent.”",,,,,,,2023-02-15,2023,2023-02-15,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Manson, Andrew","Manson, Andrew ()",,"Manson, Andrew ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155448462,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4303 Historical Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

This recalibration opens profound questions of intersectional politics, race, equity, and environmental justice around the contested topics of space exploration and life off-Earth. Among the many themes included in the volume are the various infrastructures, networks and systems that enable and sustain space exploration; space heritage; the ethics of outer space; social and environmental justice; fundamental debates about life in outer space as it pertains to both astrobiology and SETI; the study of scientific communities; the human body and consciousness; Indigenous astronomical systems of Knowledge; contemporary space art; and ongoing critical interventions to overcome the legacies of colonialism and dismantle hegemonic narratives of outer space.",,,,,,,2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159951132,44 Human Society; 51 Physical Sciences; 5101 Astronomical Sciences,
45,pub.1160347296,10.4324/9781003445142,,,"How Black Colleges Empower Black Students, Lessons for Higher Education","To their disadvantage, few Americans--and few in higher education--know much about the successes of historically Black colleges and universities. How is it that historically Black colleges graduate so many low-income and academically poorly prepared students? How do they manage to do so well with students “as they are”, even when adopting open admissions policies? In this volume, contributors from a wide spectrum of Black colleges offer insights and examples of the policies and practice--such as retention strategies, co-curricular activities and approaches to mentoring--which underpin their disproportionate success with populations that too often fail in other institutions. This book also challenges the myth that these colleges are segregated institutions and that teachers of color are essential to minority student success. HBCUs employ large numbers of non-Black faculty who demonstrate the ability to facilitate the success of African American students. This book offers valuable lessons for faculty, faculty developers, student affairs personnel and administrators in the wider higher education community-lessons that are all the more urgent as they face a growing racially diverse student population. While, for HBCUs themselves, this book reaffirms the importance of their mission today, it also raises issues they must address to maintain the edge they have achieved. Contributors: Pamela G.

It applies meta-analysis, literature review methodologies and the lens of decolonization theories to examine both studies and key reforms characterizing the continent. The book unpacks how these remarkable and unintended transformations of universities that shape Africa can be comprehended by researching national, regional, and continental arrangements of universities and systems in order to see how all these categories either dialogue or intersect.",,,,,,,2023,2023,,2023,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Uetela, Pedro João","Uetela, Pedro João (Universidade Púnguè, Chimoio, Mozambique)",,"Uetela, Pedro João (Universidade Púnguè, Chimoio, Mozambique)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164302966,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

42,pub.1166133546,10.4324/9781003382133,,,"Social Transformation for Climate Change, A New Framework for Democracy","This book argues that social transformation is both necessary and possible if democracies are to respond effectively to the climate crisis without social collapse. Climate transformation and social transformation are intimately connected. Understanding how to address climate change requires a historical approach both to the climate and to our collective institutions of humanity. Drawing on the works of Karl Polanyi and Thomas Piketty, Nicholas Low traces the course of historic social transformations from Britain, Russia, and Australia to highlight key commonalities: social crisis, the widespread sense by those in power that ‘something has to change’, the shift in ideology, and the political champions that drove the change. Within its international scope, the book delves deeper into specific instances of inequality and poverty from Britain, the USA, Australia, and the Global South. It shows how these examples are connected with the current climate emergency. Finally, the author draws together all the evidence from past transformations to outline how a new social democratic transformation could generate a better future, creating the social solidarity necessary to cope with the climate crisis. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate change, environmental politics and policy, political ecology, environmental sociology, and environmental studies more broadly. Its argument is also highly relevant for political actors working towards social and economic transformation.",,,,,,,2023-11-18,2023,2023-11-18,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Low, Nicholas","Low, Nicholas ()",,"Low, Nicholas ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166133546,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,10 Reduced Inequalities; 13 Climate Action

Bringing a flaneur’s “internal GPS” to postcolonial Johannesburg, Vladislavić established a critical sense of home via an intimate knowledge of geography and history. This sense of belonging can have positive ecological effects as we tend to protect what we know. The flaneur’s deep word hoard also helped him to develop a minimalist style, which was not only a means of living sustainably in the city, but in its humour and close attention to detail a way to make greening the city more of a joy than a duty. In this way, Vladislavić created a culture of sustainability.",,,,,,,2023-02-14,2023,2023-02-14,,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Gaylard, Gerald","Gaylard, Gerald ()",,"Gaylard, Gerald ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155413138,"44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 47 Language, Communication and Culture",

We have developed a protocol to assess microchimerism based on the HLA mismatch between the recipient and the donor. Our approach combines real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific primer PCR (SSP-PCR) to selectively amplify and measure the abundance of donor HLA alleles in DNA samples extracted from the recipient after transplant. To optimize and validate the reliability of this method at different levels of microchimerism, we tested serial dilutions of donor DNA into recipient DNA. We demonstrate that donor alleles can be readily detected and reliably measured at concentrations as low as 0.1%. This method is simple and rapid and could find practical application in the assessment of microchimerism in patients receiving organ or cellular transplants in conjunction with donor bone marrow cells infusion.",,,Transplantation,,,"Alleles; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Chimera; Genes, MHC Class II; HLA-DQ Antigens; HLA-DQ beta-Chains; Humans; Polymerase Chain Reaction",2002-03,2002,,2002-03,73,5,822-825,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Garavito, Gloria; Klein, Dagmar; Denis, Melvin; Pugliese, Alberto; Ricordi, Camillo; Pastori, Ricardo L.","Garavito, Gloria (Departamento de Inmunologia, Universidad del Norte.); Klein, Dagmar (Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.); Denis, Melvin (Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.); Pugliese, Alberto (Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.); Ricordi, Camillo (Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.); Pastori, Ricardo L.

6802,pub.1075048969,,11998929,,An inexpensive intervention for the control of larval Aedes aegypti assessed by an improved method of surveillance and analysis.,"A sampling method coupled with statistical calibration factors was developed to accurately assess the numbers of larvae and pupae of Aedes aegypti in large water-storage containers of variable capacities and water levels. Aedes aegypti productivity in different types of breeding sites found in an urban study area in central Colombia was assessed and compared. In this study, water-storage tanks and drums were found to comprise 79% of the containers positive for larval Ae. aegypti, which contributed to 93 and 92% of the total production of populations of 4th-stage larvae and pupae, respectively. These main breeding sites of Ae. aegypti were found at an indoor to outdoor ratio of 2.4:1 and no correlation was found between temporal fluctuation of populations of larval Ae. aegypti and monthly rainfall. Netted lids that used inexpensive local materials were designed to prevent oviposition by Ae. aegypti. During a 6-month trial period, 56% of inspected containers had netted lids correctly in place. Of these, 78% had no mosquito larvae. Because only 37% of uncovered containers were free of mosquito larvae, a significant difference was demonstrated when these inexpensive mechanical barriers were used (chi2 = 138.7; P < 0.001). These netted lids and the improved methods described to assess the productivity of larval and pupal Ae. aegypti in this study are now being used in combination with other strategies to assess and control these populations of dengue virus vectors in the main port city on the Atlantic Coast of Colombia.",,,Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association,,,Aedes; Animals; Colombia; Larva; Mosquito Control; Population Surveillance; Reproduction; Urban Population,2002-03,2002,,2002-03,18,1,40-6,Closed,Article,"Romero-Vivas, Claudia M E; Wheeler, Jeremy G; Falconar, Andrew K I","Romero-Vivas, Claudia M E (Departamento de Ciencias Básicas Médicas, Centro de Investigaciones en Enfermeda des Infecciosas, Fundación Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.); Wheeler, Jeremy G (); Falconar, Andrew K I ()",,"Romero-Vivas, Claudia M E (Universidad del Norte); Wheeler, Jeremy G (); Falconar, Andrew K I ()",21,1,0.57,1.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1075048969,31 Biological Sciences; 3109 Zoology,3 Good Health and Well Being

The authors discuss the issue based on the case of Brazil and Mexico, where a group of public health specialists have oriented their participation to influence the conflict concerning health policy reform in the respective countries. One approach has been to develop a new cognitive framework for technical health sector reform projects viewed as policy proposals with technical content. The purpose is to demonstrate how these specialists have managed to influence the national debate over health sector reform when the technical and scientific discussion leaves the academic sphere and reaches the social and political realm. The authors contend that this occurs because such technical and scientific knowledge has been postulated (independently of its intrinsic value) as a political and ideological alternative platform for sustaining a health sector reform proposal which, once transformed into a policy project, has served to aggregate certain political and social forces.",,,Cadernos de Saúde Pública,,,Attitude of Health Personnel; Brazil; Health Care Reform; Humans; Mexico; National Health Programs; Public Health; Research Personnel; Social Justice,2002-08-01,2002,2002-08-01,2002-08,18,4,971-989,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pêgo, Raquel Abrantes; Almeida, Celia","Pêgo, Raquel Abrantes (Cuernavaca, Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Centro de Investigación de Sistemas de Salud, Mexico); Almeida, Celia (Rio de Janeiro, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública, Departamento de Administração e Planejamento em Saúde, Brazil)",,"Pêgo, Raquel Abrantes (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública); Almeida, Celia (Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública)",20,2,0.32,2.82,https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/WjrGCK7wy788dSq3LnjyJpH/?lang=es&format=pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029342373,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,
1999,pub.1006079098,10.1016/s0169-8095(02)00098-4,,,Fog measurements at the site “Falda Verde” north of Chañaral compared with other fog stations of Chile,"Fog collection data registered through a Standard Fog Collector (SFC) installed by a local fishermen's association at a height of 600 m at the “Falda Verde” site, north of the Chilean harbor Chañaral (26°17′S/70°36′W), from November 1998 to November 2000, are analyzed. Trying to give new lights on the dynamics of fog along the Chilean northern coast, this article compares, for the first time, the data obtained at Falda Verde with those obtained at five other Chilean fog stations. The total time period runs from 1987 to 2001. A mean of 1.46 l/m2/day was registered at the Falda Verde site after 2 years of measurements, one of the lowest yields along the north Chilean coast. After a brief historical recapitulation of fog researches in the study area, geographical explanations of the water yields obtained in different sites are discussed. The annual mean collection from Cerro Moreno and Paposo shows a clearly different behavior from all other sites, showing a greater stability throughout the year. Other stations have a marked difference between extreme seasons. Alto Patache yields, if not the best in Chile, are very high and offer unexpected possibilities for future applications in the coast. Stations located away from the seashore (Cerro Guatalaya) are clearly less productive. Ocean proximity, altitude, south and southwest orientations of the coastal ranges and local relief explain some of the differences noted.","AcknowledgementsOur special thanks to the members of the Association of Fishermen of Chañaral and to the personnel in charge of the measurements at the different fog collection sites.

In a questionnaire-based study approximately 21% of interviewed resource-poor farmers (n = 150) indicated that they experienced problems with ticks and tick-borne diseases. About 56% of farmers indicated that tick-related problems were most severe in summer, while 32% indicated that the most problems were encountered in winter. About 12% indicated that the tick problems were experienced throughout the year. Farmers also indicated that the highest tick burdens were experienced between spring and early winter. The principal ticks infesting cattle (n = 30) were found to be Boophilus decoloratus (53.1%), Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (44.7%), Rhipicephalus follis (1.0%), Rhipicephalus gertrudae (0.7%) and Rhipicephalus warburtoni (0.4%). On small stock (n = 188), R. evertsi evertsi (68%) and B. decoloratus (32%) were recorded as the main ticks in the study area. A sero-epidemiological survey of cattle (n = 386) showed that 94% of cattle were sero-positive for Babesia bigemina by IFAT, while 87% were sero-positive for Anaplasma by indirect ELISA. All the animals were sero-negative for Babesia bovis and this is probably because the tick vector, Boophilus microplus, is not present in the study area. All sheep and goats were sero-positive for Theileria species by IFAT while 85% of sheep and 100% of goats tested positive for Anaplasma species by competition inhibition ELISA. The high incidence of positive serological results for B. bigemina and Anaplasma in cattle, and Theileria and Anaplasma in sheep and goats and the absence of clinical cases would indicate that this area is endemically stable for these diseases.",,,Experimental and Applied Acarology,,,"Anaplasma; Anaplasmosis; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Babesia; Babesiosis; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Goat Diseases; Goats; Humans; Ixodidae; Male; Rural Population; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tick-Borne Diseases",2002-05,2002,,2002-05,28,1-4,217-224,Closed,Article,"Mbati, Peter A.; Hlatshwayo, Motseki; Mtshali, Moses S.; Mogaswane, Kagiso R.; De Waal, Theo D.; Dipeolu, Olusegun O.","Mbati, Peter A.

In order to obtain this model, it was necessary to take into account certain variables that have a strong effect on combustion such as adiabatic flame temperature, equivalence ratio, equilibrium composition, reactor pressure and the incoming temperature of the reactants (ITR). By using the mathematical model it was possible to obtain graphic solutions for adiabatic flame temperature, equilibrium composition of the different species vs equivalence ratio, composition changes as a function of pressure ratio and the ITR. The mathematical model gave reasonable results, showing values that match with those obtained using complex models. This shows that it is possible to achieve a very simple model for butane combustion by using the basic principles, and what is more important, the results present a high degree of accuracy.Copyright © 2002 by ASME",,,,Advanced Energy Systems,,,2002-01-01,2002,2008-06-03,2002-01-01,,,555-563,Closed,Proceeding,"Vásquez, Ricardo S.; Bula, Antonio J.; Camargo, Javier E.","Vásquez, Ricardo S.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. Dietary intake was assessed by three 24-hour recalls, and knowledge and practices by means of a structured questionnaire (n = 133 men, 155 women). In-depth interviews were then conducted with 25 of the patients to explore their underlying beliefs and feelings with respect to their disease. Trained interviewers measured weight, height and blood pressure. A fasting venous blood sample was collected from each participant in order to evaluate glycaemic control.
SETTING: An urban area (Sheshego) and rural areas near Pietersburg in the Northern Province of South Africa.
SUBJECTS: The sample comprised 59 men and 75 women from urban areas and 74 men and 80 women from rural areas. All were over 40 years of age, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least one year, and attended primary health-care services in the study area over a 3-month period in 1998.
RESULTS: Reported dietary results indicate that mean energy intakes were low (< 70% of Recommended Dietary Allowance), 8086-8450 kJ day(-1) and 6967-7382 kJ day(-1) in men and women, respectively. Urban subjects had higher (P < 0.05) intakes of animal protein and lower ratios of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat than rural subjects. The energy distribution of macronutrients was in line with the recommendations for a prudent diet, with fat intake less than 30%, saturated fat less than 10% and carbohydrate intake greater than 55% of total energy intake. In most respects, nutrient intakes resembled a traditional African diet, although fibre intake was low in terms of the recommended 3-6 g/1000 kJ. More than 90% of patients ate three meals a day, yet only 32-47% had a morning snack and 19-27% had a late evening snack. The majority of patients indicated that they followed a special diet, which had been given to them by a doctor or a nurse. Only 3.4-6.1% were treated by diet alone. Poor glycaemic control was found in both urban and rural participants, with more than half of subjects having fasting plasma glucose above 8 mmol l(-1) and more than 35% having plasma glycosylated haemoglobin level above 8.6%. High triglyceride levels were found in 24 to 25% of men and in 17 to 18% of women. Obesity (body mass index > or = 30 kg m(-2)) was prevalent in 15 to 16% of men compared with 35 to 47% of women; elevated blood pressure (> or = 160/95 mmHg) was least prevalent in rural women (25.9%) and most prevalent in urban men (42.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of black, type 2 diabetic patients studied showed poor glycaemic control. Additionally, many had dyslipidaemia, were obese and/or had an elevated blood pressure.

DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
SETTING: University of the North and two semi-urban Secondary Schools.
SUBJECTS: 213 second year social science university students, 104 (48.2%) male and 112 (51.9%) female, and 199 Grade 11 secondary school students, 67 male (32.7%) and 132 female (66.3%).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire and a Food Choice Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Generally, students seemed to have below average nutrition knowledge levels. University students had significantly more nutrition knowledge than secondary school students. Dietary recommendations were associated with source of nutrients and diet-disease relationships, and sources of nutrients were associated with diet-disease relationships. Choosing everyday foods was not associated with dietary recommendations, source of nutrients, and diet-disease relationships. Among both university and secondary school students the three highest food choice factors included health, sensory appeal and mood.
CONCLUSION: Below average nutrition knowledge levels were found. Choosing everyday food seemed to be not associated with nutrition knowledge, and food choice was not only influenced by health but also sensory appeal and mood.",,,Central African Journal of Medicine,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Black or African American; Black People; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Preferences; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; South Africa; Surveys and Questionnaires",2002-01-01,2002,2002-01-01,2002,48,1-2,4-8,All OA; Green,Article,"Peltzer, K","Peltzer, K (Health Behaviour Research Unit, University of the North, Private Bag X1106, Sovenga 0727, South Africa.

METHOD: A total sample of 100 workers (nursing staff, private business men and women, laboratory assistants, the protective services [foreman and security staff], as well as people in human resources departments) took part in this study. All the participants were from the Northern and Gauteng Provinces in South Africa. The Combined Hassles and Uplifts Scale (Folkman & Lazarus, 1989) was used as an instrument to measure the perceived stress level of participants in a SMP.
RESULT: A significant reduction in stress levels was achieved among those who received the Information Phase of the SMP only, as well as those who received the whole stress management techniques. There was no significant difference between the amount of reduction in perceived stress-levels achieved among those that received the Information Phase of the SMP only, compared to that of those who received the whole techniques.
CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that where the resources are limited, only the information phase of a SMP may be given to desiring clients. That should help to save time and money spent on participating in SMPs. This should however not discourage the use of the whole SPM, where affordable.",,,Curationis,,,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Psychiatric Nursing; Relaxation Therapy; Stress, Psychological",2002-02,2002,2002-09-27,2002-02,25,1,28-34,All OA; Gold,Article,"Madu, S.N.; De Jong, E.S.","Madu, S.N.

High tick intensity on the cattle was observed between March and June, with a peak in May to June 1998 for B. decoloratus and R. evertsi evertsi. Few ticks from the other three species were recovered from the cattle. Small peaks in November to December 1998 for R. warburtoni, and in December 1998 for R. follis and R. gertrudae were observed. Following the winter (June to August), numbers of B. decoloratus declined markedly, while those of R. evertsi evertsi and other rhipicephalids increased.

Mitochondria were purified by combining methods of differential and Percoll-gradient centrifugation, and copper transport was studied using the copper-sensitive fluorescent dye Phen Green. Copper transport by this mitochondrial preparation was kinetically the sum of saturable and non-saturable transfer components. Addition of 500 micromol x l(-1) Ca2+ or 500 nmol x l(-1) Ruthenium Red abolished the non-saturable copper transport component, significantly (P<0.01) reduced the apparent binding affinity of the saturable transport component, but was without effect (P>0.05) on the apparent maximal transport velocity of the saturable transfer process. The antiport inhibitor diltiazem (500 micromol x l(-1)) acted as a mixed inhibitor of the saturable transport mechanism, but had no effect on the non-saturable component of transfer. These results suggest that the non-saturable copper influx process was probably by way of the well-known Ruthenium-Red-sensitive Ca2+ uniporter and that the saturable transport component was probably due to a combination of both the Na+-dependent, diltiazem-sensitive 1Ca2+/2Na+ antiporter and the Na+-independent, diltiazem-insensitive 1Ca2+/2H+ antiporter. A model is discussed relating these mitochondrial copper uptake processes to the transfer of metal ions across the epithelial brush-border membrane.",,,Journal of Experimental Biology,,,Animals; Biological Transport; Copper; Digestive System; Diltiazem; Fluorescent Dyes; Kinetics; Male; Mitochondria; Nephropidae; Organic Chemicals; Ruthenium Red,2002-02-01,2002,,2002-02-01,205,Pt 3,405-13,Closed,Article,"Chavez-Crooker, Pamela; Garrido, Nestor; Ahearn, Gregory A.","Chavez-Crooker, Pamela (Department of Zoology, 2538 The Mall, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA; Present address: Laboratory of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, Facultad Recursos del Mar, Universidad de Antofagasta, Casilla 170, Antofagasta, Chile); Garrido, Nestor (Department of Zoology, 2538 The Mall, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA; Present address: Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile); Ahearn, Gregory A.

In addition, relationships within Acontias were further investigated using sequence data from the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses of the 16S rRNA mtDNA data revealed that within this subfamily, Typhlosaurus is basal while Acontophiops and Acontias are sister taxa. Based on the 16S rRNA mtDNA data, the relationships within Acontias placed A. meleagris orientalis as the sister taxon of A. percivali tasmani, with A. m. orientalis lineacauda morph and A. m. meleagrus being the sister taxa to this group. The small-bodied skinks A. lineatus lineatus and A. l. tristis formed a monophyletic group, with the medium-bodied species A. gracilicauda gracilicauda being their sister taxon. Analyses of the COI gene for Acontias place A. m. orientalis as the sister taxon of A. p. tasmani with both A. meleagris meleagris and A. m. orientalis lineacauda being distinct. In contrast to the 16S rRNA mtDNA data, the COI data placed A. g. gracilicauda as the sister taxon to these medium-bodied species; while the subspecies status of the small-bodied taxa A. l. lineatus and A. l. tristis is reaffirmed. Combined analysis of both gene fragments for Acontias taxa recovered the same clades as found using only COI data. Systematic affinities in Acontias are discussed. These results indicate that Acontias is more species rich than previously thought.","AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the National Research Foundation for providing a research grant to N. Heideman.

This study investigated the distribution of its symptoms in a group of apprentices chosen by convenient sampling from Ile-Ife, a university town about 240 km northeast of Lagos in Nigeria. The subjects who (in contrast) were training under an indigenous form of education - the African apprenticeship system - consisted of 183 (69.8%) males, and 79 (30.2%) females, in the age range of 13-26 years (mean +/- SD 18.2 +/- 3.0 years). Questionnaires were interview-administered to collect data on the sociodemographic, economic, and family background, English language proficiency, and the degree of the presence of brain fag symptoms. Results indicated a generally low rate of brain fag symptoms among these different types of apprentices. A relationship between proficiency in English, but not socioeconomic status, with brain fag symptoms was found. In the case of the Nigerian apprentices investigated here, brain fag symptoms were not significantly associated with the method of training learning (which is dependent mainly on verbal instructions in the vernacular from their bosses, and vicarious learning by observing the boss at work). The implications of these findings for two of the theories advanced for the pathogenesis of the brain fag syndrome were discussed.",,,Psychopathology,,,"Adolescent; Adult; Black or African American; Attention; Black People; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cultural Characteristics; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Learning Disabilities; Male; Medicine, African Traditional; Multilingualism; Nigeria; Retention, Psychology; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Somatoform Disorders; Students; Syndrome; Vocational Education",2002,2002,2003-02-26,2002,35,6,362-366,Closed,Article,"Morakinyo, Olufemi; Peltzer, Karl","Morakinyo, Olufemi (Department of Mental Health, College of Health Sciences, Olufemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria;, Health Behaviour Research Unit, University of the North, Sovenga, South Africa); Peltzer, Karl (Department of Mental Health, College of Health Sciences, Olufemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria;, Health Behaviour Research Unit, University of the North, Sovenga, South Africa)",,"Morakinyo, Olufemi (Osun State University; University of Limpopo); Peltzer, Karl (Osun State University; University of Limpopo)",8,0,0.13,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039420208,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,4 Quality Education

However, through the reflection proposed in Symposium, poetry itself starts becoming a means by which a philosopher may reach knowledge of abstract truths. Then, a link is established between inspiration and concept, evidencing a clear compatibility between men's desire to talk to the gods, and the need of a conceptually consistent discourse. But philosophy is assimilated, even more, at the highest level of madness, thus adopting a particular charisma that Plato had formerly attributed to poetry and to the poet with explicit necessity to discredit them. Madness opens in Phaedrus some important perspectives with which we close the chart we have drawn up in our discussion. The Symposium and Phaedrus present as the fundament of ascension to eternal essences Eros, a madness crossed by passion, which has an unquestionable divine nature, and not simply the intellectual curiosity.

This species has a high commercial value and is cultivated in northern Chile, the location of its natural habitats. It has recently been introduced into southern Chile where advantages such as suitable sheltered locations protected from wave action favour its mass culture. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as lower water temperatures, which could affect reproduction. The results of the monthly variations of the gonadosomatic index and the frequency of maturity stages in specimens cultivated in Metri Bay (41° 36′S; 72° 43′W) and in those kept on the seabed in Quihua Channel (41° 50′S; 73° 05′W), suggest that the maturity and spawning period of this species extends from the end of spring through autumn. This pattern was more pronounced in Metri Bay, where levels of maturity were higher, due to higher summer water temperatures, than in Quihua Channel. Specimens at different maturity stages are found throughout the year, which seems to be associated with a rapid gonad recovery. The general pattern of the gametogenic cycle of specimens in the cultures does not differ from that recorded in the natural habitat of the species. The data available suggest that during reproduction temperature changes are more important than the relative values of the temperature. This evidence would support the possibility of mass culture of this species in southern Chile, outside its natural distribution area that extends from Corinto, Nicaragua (12°S) to Valparaíso, Chile (33°S).","The financial support of FONDECYT (Project 1961–302) is gratefully acknowledged as is the support of the Universidad de Los Lagos for providing facilities throughout the duration of the project.

METHODS: individual and group interviews were conducted in two municipalities in the North of Nicaragua, with mothers, other community members, traditional healers and basic health personnel. A household interview survey in a random sample of 1.924 families with under-fives was carried out in three departments. RESULTS: people can easily identify diarrhea, as a disease in itself or as a symptom of several folk diseases. The popular construction of the causes of diarrhea is complex, with a mixture of folk concepts and modern medical concepts which influence preventive and health seeking behavior. Health personnel often believe in these popular concepts. Dehydration is a new term and concept introduced by the health education campaigns and often mistaken for the term malnutrition. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is seen as an ineffective drug against diarrhea. The inadequate use of pharmaceuticals is widespread and in most cases they have been prescribed by doctors.

Furthermore, the results obtained are useful to compare with the fluid behavior of other carriers of different rheology, such as Newtonian fluids, power-law fluids, and viscoelastic fluids that obey the CEF model.

This equation is the first a priori design equation for devices such as the ones analyzed in this contribution. It is useful in determining mixing conditions for the values of the relevant parameters of the physical system.

Arsenic levels of up to 183 mg l(-1) were found in river sediments, and 27.5 mg l(-1) arsenic was found at the location of a dam where potable water is extracted. This indicates that the arsenic contamination of water supplies reported recently for the pre-Andes may be a widespread problem throughout the region. Copper contamination from smelting activities also provides cause for concern as elevated levels were found in aqueous extracts of soil up to 20 km away from a smelter. This study went beyond traditional chemical analysis by assessing the potential benefits of using microbial biosensors as an alternative to determination of chemical speciation, to provide an environmentally relevant interpretation of soil/sediment residue levels. This approach is simple to use and enables a rapid, low cost assessment of pollutant bioavailability.

Oocytes fixed directly from the ovary, have a total diameter of 549 microm and are covered by a 10- microm-thick transparent envelope. Electron microscope sections (dehydrated) of the egg envelope revealed an electron-dense external coat of 0.4 microm covered by filamentous processes, and a granular inner coat of 4- microm thickness. Oocytes placed for 5 min in seawater had a significantly larger diameter (573 microm), because of the increase in the thickness of the egg coats (32 microm) and the formation of a 16- microm perivitelline space. The diameter of the egg proper was reduced by the same extent as the size of the perivitelline space. All these changes were associated to the loss of the egg fertilizability. SDS-PAGE of isolated and solubilized egg coats with 20% beta-mercaptoethanol or 25 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) showed bands between 58 and 105 kDa and between 44 and 103 kDa, respectively. During normal fertilization, the sperm undergoes a drastic change in shape after first contact with the egg. We observed a similar change when solubilized egg coats were placed with vas deferens sperms. When the solubilized egg coat proteins were ultrafiltrated with a membrane of 10,000 MWCO (pore size) and then assayed for their effect on fertilization, an inhibitory effect of 30%, 41%, and 59% was found when oocytes were incubated with spermatozoa pre-treated with 30, 60, and 120 microg/ml of proteins solubilized with beta-mercaptoethanol.

A total of 103 gram-negative oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria recovered from various sources of 4 Chilean freshwater salmon farms were identified and investigated for their susceptibility patterns to various antibacterial agents, by using an agar disk diffusion method. Antibacterial resistance patterns of isolates were not correlated with bacterial species or strain source. A high number of bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin. erythromycin, and furazolidone, as well as an important frequency of bacterial resistance to florfenicol, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found. On the contrary, the proportion of bacteria resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, flumequine and enrofloxacin was rather low. Resistant microflora showed a high taxonomic variability and mainly consisted of non-fermenting bacteria (77.7%). These strains mainly belonged to the species Pseudomonas fluorescens (29), Aeromonas hydrophila (10), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6), isolated from salmon fingerlings, and Acinetobacter lwoffii (5) isolated from pelletized feed. The occurrence of simultaneous resistance to various antibacterials was frequent. We observe a high frequency of bacteria resistant to 6-10 antibacterials (74 strains), and antibiotic resistance index (ARI) values ranging from 0.38 to 0.48 for the four salmon farms studied. These results suggest that Chilean salmon farms might play a role as reservoirs of antibacterial multiresistant bacteria, thus prompting the necessity for a more restrictive attitude towards the intensive use of antibacterials in salmon farming.",AcknowledgementsThis study was partially supported by a grant from the Universidad Católica del Norte.

This study investigated, in alcohol-preferring Fawn-Hooded (FH) rats, whether chronic free-choice ethanol consumption and subsequent withdrawal cause alterations in central mu-opioid, dopamine D(1), and D(2) receptor density using autoradiography. FH rats were given a free choice between a 5% ethanol solution and tap water (n = 25) and displayed a mean ethanol consumption of 5.6 g/kg/day. A parallel group of FH rats (n = 5) only had access to tap water. Rats were then withdrawn from ethanol for 0, 1, 2, 5, or 10 days and killed by cervical dislocation and decapitation. Increases in mu-opioid receptor density were observed in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area upon withdrawal compared with the ethanol naive group. In the lateral amygdala, binding in all withdrawal groups was significantly different from the ethanol naive FH rats, and also from the chronic ethanol rats. An increase in dopamine D(1) receptor density was observed in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata in the 5- and 10-day withdrawal groups compared with ethanol naive. Accumbal dopamine D(2) receptor density (+25-30%) increased in the 10-day withdrawal group compared with both naive and chronic ethanol groups. These findings demonstrate that the opioid and dopamine systems are susceptible to modulation by chronic ethanol consumption and withdrawal in the FH rat. Furthermore, although acute ethanol withdrawal results in modulation of mu-opioid receptors, effects on dopamine receptors are delayed and only become evident 5 to 10 days after withdrawal.","This work was supported by the Australian Brewers&#x27; Foundation, Monash University Research Fund, and the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia, of which A.J.L. is a Senior Research Fellow.",,Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,,,"Alcohol Drinking; Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium; Animals; Autoradiography; Body Weight; Brain; Drinking Behavior; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Receptors, Dopamine D1; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Receptors, Opioid, mu",2002-08-01,2002,2002-08-01,2002-08-01,302,2,551-559,Closed,Article,"Djouma, Elvan; Lawrence, Andrew J","Djouma, Elvan (Department of Pharmacology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.); Lawrence, Andrew J ()",,"Djouma, Elvan (Monash University); Lawrence, Andrew J ()",38,0,0.92,2.94,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035407449,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, WCO is unknown to most optometrists and ‘international optometry’ is not part of the optometric curriculum in our schools, just as it is rarely on the agenda of our professional associations. As a consequence, many optometrists do not understand the difficulties faced by their colleagues in other countries, in both clinical and political challenges. Australian optometrists are regulated by law, educated at state universities, eligible for service coverage by universal health insurance, able to detect disease in the eye using diagnostic agents and, in increasing numbers, able to treat disease in the eye with therapeutic drugs. However, this community standing and professional privilege, taken for granted by most Australian optometrists, cannot be exported. In fact, an Australian optometrist would be jailed in many countries around the world just for doing the ordinary clinical procedures that he or she does on every patient, by routine, day in and day out. All optometrists should feel ownership of WCO and all should have a commitment to its mission to facilitate the enhancement and development of eye and vision care by optometrists worldwide. Australian optometrists are already linked to WCO through their membership of Optometrists Association Australia, which is itself a longstanding and valued member of WCO.

Genetic susceptibility to common conditions, such as essential hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, is probably determined by various combinations of small quantitative changes in the expression of many genes. NPR1, coding for natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA), is a potential candidate, because NPRA mediates natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxing actions of the nariuretic peptides, and because genetically determined quantitative changes in the expression of this gene affect blood pressure and heart weight in a dose-dependent manner in mice. To determine whether there are common quantitative variants in human NPR1, we have sequenced the entire human NPR1 gene and identified 10 polymorphic sites in its non-coding sequence by using DNA from 34 unrelated human individuals. Five of the sites are single nucleotide polymorphisms; the remaining five are length polymorphisms, including a highly variable complex dinucleotide repeat in intron 19. There are three common haplotypes 5' to this dinucleotide repeat and three 3' to it, but the 5' haplotypes and 3' haplotypes appear to be randomly associated. Transient expression analysis in cultured cells of reporter plasmids with the proximal promoter sequences of NPR1 and its 3' untranslated regions showed that these polymorphisms have functional effects. We conclude that common NPR1 alleles can alter expression of the gene as much as two-fold and could therefore significantly affect genetic risks for essential hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in humans.",,,Human Genetics,,,"Animals; Aorta; Cell Line; DNA; Dinucleotide Repeats; Exons; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Guanylate Cyclase; Haplotypes; Humans; Introns; Luciferases; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Polymorphism, Genetic; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcription, Genetic",2002-10-10,2002,2002-10-10,2003-01,112,1,62-70,All OA; Green,Article,"Knowles, Joshua W.; Erickson, Laurie M.; Guy, Vanessa K.; Sigel, Carlie S.; Wilder, Jennifer C.; Maeda, Nobuyo","Knowles, Joshua W.

DESIGN: Anonymous questionnaire survey.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 19 298 university students (8482 men, 10 816 women) aged 17-30 years from 23 countries, studying courses unrelated to health.
MEASUREMENTS: Standardized measures of smoking, wish to stop smoking, ratings of beliefs in the importance of not smoking for health and awareness of the influence of smoking on lung cancer and heart disease.
FINDINGS: Prevalence varied widely, being highest in samples from South European countries and lowest in developing countries (Thailand, South Africa). The pattern of tobacco use and differences between men and women conformed largely to the WHO model. Health beliefs were associated strongly with smoking behaviour both within and between countries. Awareness of specific health risks of smoking was very variable, with particularly low levels in Asian, South American and developing country samples. Risk awareness was inconsistently related to behaviour.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of tobacco smoking in well-educated young adults appears to conform with wider international patterns of tobacco use. Awareness of specific health risks is poor, and modifying attitudes must be a central element in modifying tobacco use world-wide.",,,Addiction,,,Adolescent; Adult; Attitude to Health; Awareness; Confidence Intervals; Culture; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking; Students,2002-12-11,2002,2002-12-11,2002-12,97,12,1561-1571,Closed,Article,"Steptoe, Andrew; Wardle, Jane; Cui, Weiwei; Baban, Adriana; Glass, Kelli; Pelzer, Karl; Tsuda, Akira; Vinck, Jan","Steptoe, Andrew (University College London, UK1); Wardle, Jane (University College London, UK1); Cui, Weiwei (University College London, UK1); Baban, Adriana (Babes‐Bolyai University, Romania2); Glass, Kelli (San Diego State University, USA3); Pelzer, Karl (University of the North, South Africa4); Tsuda, Akira (University of Kurume, Japan5); Vinck, Jan (Limburgs Universitair Centrum, Diepenbeek, Belgium6)","Steptoe, Andrew (University College London)","Steptoe, Andrew (University College London); Wardle, Jane (University College London); Cui, Weiwei (University College London); Baban, Adriana (Babeș-Bolyai University); Glass, Kelli (San Diego State University); Pelzer, Karl (University of Limpopo); Tsuda, Akira (Kurume University); Vinck, Jan (Hasselt University)",125,2,2.77,16.47,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045160168,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

Halogen concentrations suggest that the fumarolic condensates represent mostly magmatic fluids, but that the hot springs are a mixture between magmatic fluids and meteoric water with some presence of seawater. The magmatic component is best preserved in the high-temperature fumaroles collected in 1998 and has a 129I/I ratio of 756 ± 47 × 10−15. This 129I/I ratio yields an iodine age of 15.5 ± 1.5 Ma, which is compatible with derivation of iodine from subducted marine sediments in this region. Ratios of I/Cl, and Br/Cl in the fumaroles also indicate that halides in the magmatic component were mainly derived from marine sediments subducted in the Nankai Trough. These observations suggest that recycling of subducted sediments is an active source of halides in the Satsuma-Iwojima volcanic system. The comparison of 129I/I ratios obtained from fumaroles over the sampling period shows that a recent meteoric component was present in 1993, but not in 1998. This observation might reflect reorganization of the fumarolic system during this period, which expelled the more recent meteoric water from the fumarolic system after 1993. The acid hot springs on the flanks of the volcano maintain a 129I isotopic signature indicative of substantial dilution of magmatic waters by mixing with old meteoric water and seawater. Fumarolic gases and hot spring waters were also analyzed for 36Cl/Cl, but the measured ratios were at, or below, the detection limit of AMS, also indicating that recent contributions of Cl from meteoric water are small in the fumaroles and coastal hot springs.",,,"Earth, Planets and Space",,,,2002-03-01,2002,2014-06-24,2002-03-01,54,3,265-273,All OA; Gold,Article,"Snyder, G.

The aims were to assess how UV-B affects canopy area, dry mass, and some biochemical and morphological properties of leaves, and to investigate whether differences between species are related to growth form of the plants. There was no pattern of response to UV-B related to growth form. Leaves of trees had altered chlorophyll a and b, carotenoid and flavonoid concentrations, but those of shrubs or herbs did not. Non-structural carbohydrates were unaffected. Smaller canopy areas and dry masses were observed under enhanced UV-B, but these were not statistically different among growth forms. There was a general insensitivity of species to elevated UV-B. Only five species had significantly altered leaf biochemical and morphological properties, canopy area and dry mass, the changes differing in magnitude. There was no consistent pattern of change in leaf thickness or biochemical composition with increased UV-B. Correlation analyses did not support the view that growth is less negatively affected in species with thick leaves or in those where leaf thickness increases, or in species with naturally high leaf flavonoid contents or that are able to synthesize additional flavonoids in response to UV-B enhancement. The analyses did not support the hypothesis that growth was inhibited by starch accumulation in leaves under elevated UV-B. However, changes in leaf shape did correlate with canopy area and dry mass, showing the importance of photomorphogenetic changes caused by UV-B which affect species' performance. We conclude that generalizations on plant sensitivity to UV-B based on growth form and functional type could be misleading, and that the great majority of economically important species of the region are likely to be insensitive to future UV-B increases. Notable exceptions include the Colophospermum mopane tree ecotypes chota and leslie and the arable annual Vigna unguiculata, both of which are traditional sources of livelihood to rural African populations and of importance to African industry and agriculture.",,,Annals of Botany,,,Plant Development; Plants; South Africa; Ultraviolet Rays,2002-07-01,2002,2002-07-01,2002-07-01,90,1,127-137,All OA; Green,Article,"Musil, Charles F; Chimphango, Samson B M; Dakora, Felix D","Musil, Charles F (Research and Scientific Services, National Botanical Institute, Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa. musil@nbict.nbi.ac.za); Chimphango, Samson B M (); Dakora, Felix D ()","Musil, Charles F (South African National Biodiversity Institute)","Musil, Charles F (South African National Biodiversity Institute); Chimphango, Samson B M (); Dakora, Felix D ()",36,2,0.37,2.58,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4233860?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022068899,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,

However, appeal for the long-term use of HU in HIV-1 infection may be limited by its propensity to induce hematopoietic toxicity. We report a comparison of the efficacy and bone marrow toxicity of HU (400 and 200 mg/kg/day) with the novel RR inhibitors and free radical-scavenging compounds didox (DX; 3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid; 350 mg/kg/day) and trimidox (TX; 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime; 175 mg/kg/day) in the murine AIDS (LPBM5 MuLV) model of retrovirus infection. Infected mice received daily drug treatment for 8 weeks. Efficacy was determined by measuring drug effects on retroviral-induced disease progression (i.e. development of splenomegaly and hypergammaglobulinemia) and by evaluating splenic levels of proviral DNA. Bone marrow toxicity was evaluated by measuring peripheral blood indices (WBC, hematocrit and reticulocyte counts), femoral cellularity and by determining the numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM, BFU-E) per femur and spleen. Compared to infected controls receiving no drug treatment, disease progression was significantly suppressed by TX, DX and HU. However, HU was associated with mortality and induced significant hematopoietic toxicity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, TX and DX effectively inhibited retrovirus-induced disease but did not induce hematopoietic toxicity. These results suggest that due to their reduced hematopoietic toxicity and ability to inhibit disease progression in murine AIDS, TX and DX may offer effective alternatives to HU therapy in HIV-1 infection.","AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of Drs H.C.

Early eighteenth‐century religious art inspired by a vision received by Isidoro of Seville, a Capuchin friar, presented the Virgin Mary as the Divine Shepherdess with her flock of Christians, depicted as sheep with roses in their mouths. This imagery resonates in the flowering ceremony practised by Aymara pastoralists in Isluga, Chile. The floreo serves as a rite of passage for herd animals, its intention being to enhance their fertility by making them ‘flower’. However the congruence between the visual codes produced by Europeans and Andeans conveys related but different social and moral messages. Whereas sheep can represent human beings in Christian art, they cannot stand in for human beings in Isluga, since Isluga people recognize that both human and herd animals require spiritual nourishment.",,,Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,,,,2002-03,2002,2002-12-20,2002-03,8,1,1-21,Closed,Article,"Dransart, Penelope","Dransart, Penelope (University of Wales, Lampeter)",,"Dransart, Penelope (University of Wales)",7,1,,2.34,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040492488,"43 History, Heritage and Archaeology; 4301 Archaeology; 44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology",

The good exposure and excellent preservation of basement and supracrustal geology in this region makes it particularly suitable for such a study. At a regional scale, several contrasting magnetic domains are recognized, which correlate with crustal geology. Two basement domains are separated by a NNE-trending boundary, which is believed to correlate with a Paleozoic suture zone between the Pampia (to the southeast) and Arequipa–Antofalla terranes (to the northwest). Locally overlying these basement terranes is the Cenozoic magmatic domain, which is best developed in the N–S-trending volcanic arc at the western edge of the Puna (the Cordillera Occidental). In addition, four southeast-trending volcanic zones extend for several hundred kilometers across the Puna. Many important mineral deposits and areas of hydrothermal alteration are associated with these volcanic breakouts, and we have selected three such areas for more detailed study: Bajo de la Alumbrera (Argentina's largest porphyry copper deposit), Cerro Galán (the largest ignimbrite caldera in Argentina, with associated hydrothermal alteration zones), and El Queva (a historic polymetallic district located within a major volcanic range). A comparison of lineament maps generated from aeromagnetic and Landsat TM images reveals broad correlation between these different remote sensing techniques, which respectively highlight subsurface magnetic and surface geological features. In addition, the locations of magmatic and hydrothermal centers can be related to the interpreted structural framework, and are seen to occur near the intersections of major lineament zones. It is suggested that in three dimensions, such intersection zones form trans-lithospheric columns of low strength and high permeability during transpressional or transtensional tectonic strain, and may thereby serve as conduits for magma ascent to the shallow crust. Pooling of large volumes of deeply derived magma in shallow crustal magma chambers may then result in voluminous devolatilization and the formation of hydrothermal mineral deposits. It is important to note that in this model, structural intersections serve as facilitators for magma ascent and volatile exsolution, but do not in themselves cause this process—other factors such as magma supply rate and tectonic stress are essential primary ingredients, and local magmatic and volcanic processes affect the ultimate potential for ore formation. Nevertheless, we suggest that lineament analysis provides a valuable framework for guiding the early stages of mineral exploration; other regional and local geological considerations must then be applied to identify priority targets within this framework.",AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank the Servicio Geológico Minero Argentino (SEGEMAR) for financial support and for permission to use the geophysical data.

A retrospective self-rating questionnaire was completed by 722 University of the North undergraduate students (South Africa) in a classroom setting. The questionnaire addressed the demographic variables of the participants; psychological, physical, and emotional abusive experiences from their parents or adult caretakers before the age of 17 years; and ritualistic abusive experiences before the age of 17 years. The prevalence rates were as follows: 79.1% (N=526) for psychological abused, 16.2% (N=110) for physical abuse, 28.5% (N=194) for emotional abuse, 6.0% (N=37) for ritualistic abuse.

Design: Survey of nurses. Setting: Registered professional nurses at health centres and clinics. Participants: 84 registered professional nurses Results: Nurse’s perceptions were basically positive toward ethnomedical therapy (traditional healing, faith healing and complementary medicine); this also included their integration into the primary health care system. Mean ratings for referral to a faith healer was 2.7, followed by complementary medicine (2.6) and traditional healing (2.2). Although low rates of referrals to ethnomedical therapists were practised, it was done so mainly in the patient’s interest and not as a last resort for chronic or terminal illness. Most did not discuss with a patient benefits of traditional healing but 71% discussed the possible harmful effects. However, the majority discussed the benefits rather than harmful effects of faith healing. With respect to mean ratings on knowledge, faith healing was considered the most important (4.3), followed by complementary medicine (4.2), and traditional healing (4.1). Conclusion: Faith healing was considered as more important than complementary medicine and traditional healing.

 The socialization of traditional and transitional persons can be illustrated in the form of a model in three dimensions: the authority dimension (vertical, diachronic, historic); the group dimension (horizontal, synchronic, social); the body – mind – environment dimension. Various
 personhood attributes are identified along the three dimension such as that the traditional person is socialized primarily by people, while the modern person is socialized primarily by objects.

Kirk ex J. Leonard is an intensely folded bilobed structure. The epidermal layer of the stigma consists of non‐papillate cells. Before anthesis the epidermis is covered with a cuticle and thin proteinaceous layer. Elongated subepidermal cells constitute the secretory zone. Cell disintegration in the central region of each stigma lobe leads to cavities that become connected to the central cavity in the style. During early anthesis it appears as if the receptive surface of the stigma is confined to the depressions of the stigma surface and to the cleft between the two stigma lobes as the secretory product and pollen grains are mainly confined to these areas. The secretory products of the stigma and style are released during five different stages from prior to anthesis to late anthesis. The stigmatic exudate appears complex and consists of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The style has a hollow, lysigenous, fluid‐filled canal that is not lined with an epidermal layer or cuticle. The stylar canal is continuous with the opening between the two stigma lobes and provides an open route for the passage of exudate. The stylar exudate is PAS‐positive. The dorsal and ventral bundles that supply the style branch in such a way as to almost form a cylinder around the central transmitting tissue and stylar canal.

The cladistic analysis was repeated using abstracted genera, re-codedfrom the ­initial set of species, as terminal taxa. The topology of the resulting cladograms was similar. In the first (primary) analysis several genera (including Neotheronia, Itoplectis, Dolichomitus, Dreisbachia, Polysphincta, Oxyrrhexis and Zonopimpla) were not retrieved as monophyletic groups; however, all except the last were found to be monophyletic in the second analysis. These results suggest that using abstracted taxa may force a ‘false monophyly’ on the preselected groups. Thus we reject the use of such abstractions, preferring instead to use exemplar speciesthat together show much of the variation that occurs within a hypothesizedgenus. Within the Pimplinae three major groupings were recognized, the Delomeristini (including the Perithoini syn. nov.), the Pimplini and the Ephialtini. Within the Pimplini, two generic groups were recovered, the Xanthopimpla and Pimpla genus-groups, but a third postulated group, the Theronia genus-group, was found to be paraphyletic. Within the Ephialtini five groups wererecognized, the Pseudopimpla, Alophosternum, Camptotypus, Ephialtes and Sericopimpla genus-groups. The spider parasitizing complex of genera (the Polysphincta genus-complex) was found to nest within the Sericopimpla genus-group confirmingthe placement of Polysphinctini as a synonym of Ephialtini. Problems with the status of some existing genera are highlighted, but formal nomenclatural changes are not proposed. The ancestral Pimplinae are hypothesized to have been solitary ectoparasitic idiobiontson weakly concealed immature Hymenoptera. The major radiations within the Pimplinae are shown as: (1) a progressive exploitation of cocooned, then weakly cocooned, lepidopterous pupae in the Pimplini leading to idiobiont endoparasitism; (2) increasing specialization to attack hosts deeply concealed in wood in the Ephialtes genus-group, and (3) specialization on a variety of cocooned hosts, including spider egg sacs, leading to koinobiont ectoparasitism of spiders. A brief synopsis of the distribution of the group is given, and some biogeographical inferences drawn. The group is presumed to have originated and radiated on Laurasia; no evidence for trans-Antarctic relationships can be found.","We thank Sondra Ward for the excellent stereoscan photographs, and for her perceptiveness in observing the propodeal denticles.

In this work, the frequency of oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria from water, pelletized feed and fingerlings from four Chilean freshwater Atlantic salmon farms, as well as the level of resistance of selected strains was investigated. Viable bacterial counts were performed by a spread plate method and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were counted in culture media supplemented with the selected antibiotic. Resistance levels of selected strains isolated in media containing antibiotic were determined using an agar plate dilution method. High proportions of low- and high-level oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria (selected in agar plates containing 30 and 100 μg/ml, respectively), mainly from pelletized feed and effluent samples of the fish farms were found. The highest proportions of resistant bacteria were found in the effluent samples, and were significantly higher (P<0.05, Tukey's test) than those from the other samples studied. On the contrary, influent samples exhibited the lowest proportions of resistant bacteria. One hundred and three resistant Gram-negative isolates, which represented the oxytetracycline-resistant bacterial population, were randomly selected on TSA containing 30 or 100 μg/ml of oxytetracycline, from salmon farms and pellet samples, and streaked for purification on TSA plates without oxytetracycline. A large number of non-fermenting bacteria (77.7%) were identified. Among these, Pseudomonas fluorescens (28.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.8%), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (5.8%), Acinetobacter lwoffii (4.8%), and Pseudomonas putida (4.8%) were the most frequent. Also, an important number of strains of Aeromonas hydrophila (9.7%), Burkholderia cepacia (3.9%), Brevundimonas vesicularis (3.9%), Acinetobacter johnsonii (2.9%), Pantoea sp. (2.9%) and Moraxella sp. (2.9%) were found. P. fluorescens and A. hydrophila predominated in salmon fingerlings, whereas A. lwoffii and S. maltophilia were predominant in pellet samples. Selected strains exhibited high levels of oxytetracycline resistance, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 64 to 2048 μg/ml, whereas MIC90 of oxytetracycline varied between 1024 and 2048 μg/ml. This study shows the presence of an important population of oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria in the microflora of Chilean salmon farms. Therefore, the environment of these farms might play important roles as reservoirs of bacteria carrying genetic determinants for high-level tetracycline resistance, prompting an important risk to public health for workers involved in fish culturing and processing.",AcknowledgementsThis study was supported in part by the Universidad Católica del Norte.

The sample consisted of 200 adults, 100 from an semi-urban area (Mankweng) and 100 from a rural area (Tiberius) in the central region of the Northern Province of South Africa. The two geographically different communities were chosen by convenience and the participants in the two communities were choosen by cluster sampling. Results indicate that about a third (30% in semi-urban and 34% in rural) of the study sample are overweight and 18% are obese. A moderately high prevalence of six simple healthy dietary practices was found. However, there was a very low prevalence rate of eating fruits daily among both semi-urban (10%) and rural dwellers (9%). Semi-urban dwellers showed significantly higher healthy diet behaviour than rural dwellers in regard to avoiding fat, trying to eat fiber, limiting red meat, and limiting salt. Men reported more than women that they tried to eat fiber and they had more often breakfast everyday. Being semi-urban and female were significantly associated with the healthy dietary index, whereas age, BMI, educational level and marital status were not. The results give insight into dietary health behaviour practices and the factors that influence them, which have practical implications for dietary health promotion.",,,Curationis,,,,2002-09-27,2002,2002-09-27,,25,2,41-47,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peltzer, K.","Peltzer, K.

In this paper, we explore the topic further by examining Rushton and Skuy's [Intelligence 28 (2000) 251] hypothesis that a bimodal distribution exists in the African population with a high-scoring group virtually indistinguishable from Whites, and a low-scoring group performing significantly below both Whites and the higher-scoring African group. To test this hypothesis, we sought out a potentially higher-scoring African population than has previously been studied. We administered untimed Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) to 342 17- to 23-year-olds in the Faculties of Engineering and the Built Environment at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg (198 Africans, 86 Whites, 58 Indians; 71 women, 271 men). Out of the 60 total problems, the African students solved an average of 50, the Indian students, 53, and the White students, 56 (P<.001). On the 1993 US norms, Africans were at the 41st percentile, Indians at the 55th, and Whites at the 75th, with IQ equivalents of 97, 102, and 110, respectively. The African–Indian–White differences were most pronounced on those items with the highest item-total correlations, indicating a difference in g, or the general factor of intelligence. Hence, they were “Jensen Effects.” Indeed, the g loadings showed a small degree of cross-cultural generality; for example, item-total correlations calculated on the Indian students predicted the magnitude of the White–African differences. When the 60 items were aggregated into 10 “subtests,” the magnitude of the Jensen Effect was similar to that from previous studies based on whole subtests (median ρ=.53). There were no sex differences. Nor did this study of African engineering students support the idea of a bimodal distribution.",,,Intelligence,,,,2002-09,2002,,2002-09,30,5,409-423,Closed,Article,"Rushton, J.Philippe; Skuy, Mervyn; Fridjhon, Peter","Rushton, J.Philippe (Department of Psychology, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada N6A 5C2); Skuy, Mervyn (Division of Specialized Education, The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2050, South Africa); Fridjhon, Peter (Division of Specialized Education, The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2050, South Africa)","Rushton, J.Philippe (Western University)","Rushton, J.Philippe (Western University); Skuy, Mervyn (University of the Witwatersrand); Fridjhon, Peter (University of the Witwatersrand)",34,0,,2.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111433037,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

The peculiar morphology, very distinct from other species in Lake Titicaca, was not analysed in detail after the original description. However, the present authors' study of an extensive collection from The Natural History Museum in London has revealed two morphologically distinct species. Descriptions of H. armata and the new species H. longispina are given.Diagnosis of Hyalella longispina n. sp. (Figs 1, 2): Body (Fig. 1) with a posterior dorsal transverse ridge on every segment. Coxae 1 to 4 acuminate. Coxa 4 excavated posteriorly, and with deep acumination at right angle to sagittal body plane. Lateral process of coxa 4 strongly elongate (Fig. 2), distance between left and right process apices longer than body length (that distance shorter than body length in H. armata). Eyes pigmented. Antenna 1 shorter than antenna 2. Antenna 2 less than half body length. Mandible incisor toothed. Maxilla 1 palp uniarticulate, longer than wide, reaching more than half the distance between base of palp and tip of setae on outer plate; inner plate slender, with two strong and pappose apical setae. Maxilla 2 inner plate with one strong pappose seta on inner margin. Gnathopod 1 propodus quadrangular (length less than twice maximum width), hatchet-shaped, inner face with more than ten pappose setae, distoposterior and distoanterior borders without setose scales. Gnathopod 2 propodus triangular, palm longer than posterior margin, slope oblique, anterior edge with a small process. Telson wider than long, apically rounded, with more than two short simple setae, arranged symmetrically on the apical margin.

We studied animals originating from three geographical regions and used biochemical genetic and morphological approaches to address this question. The most prominent trend from allozyme data was derived from the locusPrt-2 (an unspecified serum protein), where each of the three populations could be characterised by the absence or presence of unique alleles. Nevertheless, statistical coefficients indicated little genetic divergence, with genetic distance values of 0.001–0.003 and an overall fixation index value of 0.046. Average heterozygosity did not differ appreciably among populations (2.5–3.3%). The morphological study identified suitable traits, free from the influence of growth allometry, that can be used for inter-population comparisons. No significant morphological differences between con-specific populations were however found. It is concluded that vervet monkeys from the species’ wider distribution range is relatively monotypic, but that monkeys from different geographical areas should not be unduly mixed, pending the results of finer grained molecular studies.",,,Mammal Research,,,,2002-06,2002,,2002-06,47,2,113-124,Closed,Article,"Grobler, Paul J.; Matlala, Jacob M.","Grobler, Paul J.

This study was, therefore, an attempt to find out the nature of students' experiences by finding out aspects (conditions and or events) of the university they assessed as stressful especially during their early days in the university. A 40-item questionnaire, with statements clustered into five categories of stress-induced factors of university, was used to collect relevant data. The subjects responded to the questionnaire in terms of their assessment of their experiences of the different aspects of the university presented to them on the questionnaire. The results revealed that factors associated with Financial Difficulties, Demands of the University Environment and the University Administrative Process (in that descending order) were assessed as stressful. While data analysis revealed significant sex differences in the assessment of stressful experiences with various aspects of the university, no significant differences were found on the basis of subjects' age groups and institutional affiliations.",,,Counselling Psychology Quarterly,,,,2002-09,2002,2010-07,2002-09,15,3,277-290,Closed,Article,"Bojuwoye, O.","Bojuwoye, O.

This article, which adds to the mainly thematic and aesthetic critical reviews of his aeuvre, is a linguistic (forms) and sociolinguistic (functions) analysis of two of his autobiographical novels, Down Second Avenue and The Wanderers , written respectively almost entirely at home and altogether in exile. Like many of his African contemporaries, Mphahlele uses 'hybrid' forms of English in both novels, to introduce or maintain an authentic flavour of, or keep his work closer to, its surroundings. He, however, introduces significant differences between the two novels in the use of sociolinguistic and pragmatic devices, such as code-mixing, styleswitching, and the nativization of speech functions, to underscore the richness of the multi-setting world in which his autobiography evolves, and, thus, reflect the 'local' and 'global' characters of the socio-political settings of each novel. Arguing that the understanding of Mphahlele's outstanding literary mountain is incomplete without an in-depth critical sociolinguistic analysis of the whole of his literary work, I suggest that my analysis, tentative though it may be, may set an agenda for future and more comprehensive studies.",,,Journal of African Cultural Studies,,,,2002-12,2002,,2002-12,15,2,183-201,Closed,Article,"Kasanga, Luanga A.","Kasanga, Luanga A.

Espermatozoides extrados de la gnada y diluidos en agua de mar se mezclaron en proporcin 1:1 con cada crioprotector. Despus de cada incubacin se evalu la toxicidad producida por cada crioprotector mediante la evaluacin de la motilidad espermtica, diferencindola en tres tipos (M1, M2 y M3).

El mayor porcentaje de motilidad 3 (44,3%) se obtuvo en espermatozoides incubados en DMSO 1 M por 5 min, lo cual sugiere que este crioprotector genera la menor toxicidad.

The angular dependence of both the projected range and the crystalline quality of the resulting silicide shows excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and simulations. Simulations indicate that the critical angle for channeling is largely independent of substrate temperature. The postimplantation strain in the silicide layer is determined by irradiation-induced damage and therefore increases with the angle between the crystalline axis and the ion beam direction.,,,Applied Physics Letters,,,,2002-06-10,2002,,2002-06-10,80,23,4363-4365,Closed,Article,"Hogg, S.

Available information is fragmentary and widely dispersed in many different journals and books. A survey by Liengme (1983a) has shown several gaps in the scientific literature and some progress has been made towards a more complete record of indigenous plant use in the region. Information on some ethnic groups, such as the Khoi, Ndebele and Swazi, as well as the interaction between plants and people, folk taxonomies, plant-related mythology, ethnoveterinary medicine and pre-colonial plant use are some of the aspects that still remain poorly recorded. In contrast, ethnopharmacology — particularly the testing of biological activity of crude extracts and isolated compounds — has received considerable attention in recent years. The aim of these studies is usually to validate traditional uses rather than to provide information for product development. A review of the literature on various categories of plant use, including recent publications and some hitherto unpublished research, is presented. Ethnobotany remains an underdeveloped discipline in southern Africa and there is an urgent need to systematically document indigenous knowledge on traditional plant use before it becomes irretrievably lost to future generations.",,,South African Journal of Botany,,,,2002-02,2002,,2002-02,68,1,1-13,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"van Wyk, B.-E.; van Staden, J.","van Wyk, B.-E.

Norrland has always been seen as something a bit different from the rest of Sweden. It differs from the southern regions of the country with respect to its ecology, economy, politics and culture. Even though many of these differences can be ascribed to popular stereotypes, facts and figures still paint a distinctive portrait. To start with there is the size of the area. Norrland covers almost 60 per cent of the total land area of Sweden, but within this vast domain, there are few people – just 13 per cent of the total Swedish population. The climate is also somewhat distinctive and challenging. It has short, cool summers and long, dark winters. It represents in the minds of most Swedes a remote and harsh land. It also has the reputation of being a frontier area in terms of its economic and social development. Historically, it was settled later than other parts of the country. It has traditionally had a natural resource-based economy. It has confronted a number of social and economic problems associated with its peripheral status.

Room temperature Raman spectra for x =0, 5 and 10 show the usual T 2g symmetry mode at 241 v cm m 1 , but for samples with x =20, 30 and 50 the dominant Raman mode is at higher frequencies and of E g symmetry. The temperature dependence of the Raman line-widths show initial near linear increases followed by substantial increases above temperatures ( T c ) at 1200, 850, 800, 975, 950 and 920 v K for x =0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50. In the Brillouin scattering experiments, the acoustic modes respectively related to elastic constants C 11 and C 44 initially showed a quasi-linear decrease in frequency with increasing temperature. Above the same characteristic values of T c , where the Raman line-widths show marked increases, there are substantial decreases in the elastic constant C 11 for all samples with x =0 to 50. Only the doped samples showed significant decreases in C 44 at corresponding values of T c . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out on the same systems. From the calculated mean square displacements, the diffusion coefficients ( D ) of the mobile fluorine ions were calculated as a function of temperature for each of the samples. Substantial increases in the values of D occur above the respective values of T c determined in the light scattering experiments. The MD simulations also provide details of the mechanisms of diffusion of the mobile fluorine ions. The results emphasize the role of motional effects as an explanation of the mechanisms responsible and provide a self-consistent explanation of the dominant processes in the superionic phase of doped fluorites.",,,Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids,,,,2002-01,2002,2010-10-29,2002-01,157,6-12,783-788,Closed,Article,"Rammutla, K.

The products of 29 loci were analysed, with 17 loci being monomorphic in all populations. The genetic variability estimates compared well with values reported in the literature. The percentage of polymorphic loci (0.95 criterion) ranged from 0–20.69% and average expected heterozygosity from 0.004–0.069.

The results of the lectins experiments showed a high concentration of mannose (2-3 time) on the mature oocyte coat. From 5 days pre-molt to 2 day post-molt he concentration of mannose, galactose and glucose increasing on the oocyte envelope increaded. The fucose monosacharide was 3 time less than mannose. This results suggest that mannose could be participating in the first gametic interaction., however the involvement of these carbohydrates during the fertilization must be determined by in vitro fertilization inhibition experiments",,,Investigaciones marinas,,,,2002,2002,2002,,30,2,69-74,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gmez, Daniel; Dupr, Enrique","Gmez, Daniel (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile); Dupr, Enrique (Universidad Catlica del Norte Facultad de Ciencias del Mar Departamento de Biologa Marina, Coquimbo, Chile)",,"Gmez, Daniel (Catholic University of the North); Dupr, Enrique (Catholic University of the North)",3,0,,,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/imar/v30n2/art07.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047112197,,

Consequently, the country experiences a fall in per capita food production. Grouping the country's food producers under four categories, this paper argues that production has remained a predominantly peasant affair, characterized by subsistency, inefficiency and low productivity. For a way forward out of the food crises, we introduce a theoretical model of the impact of policy mechanisms on agricultural output. We also look at the target group of the policy mechanisms. The paper concludes that to tackle the food crises, the country needs a radical approach to the problem, with emphasis on a total departure from its hitherto subsistence farming to a modem commercial farming.",,,South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences,,,,2002-03-31,2002,2002-03-31,,5,1,63-84,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ilorah, Richard","Ilorah, Richard (School of Economics and Management, University of the North)",,"Ilorah, Richard (School of Economics and Management, University of the North)",1,0,,,https://sajems.org/index.php/sajems/article/download/2665/1471,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120050970,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 38 Economics",2 Zero Hunger

The work now reported involves a direct comparative study of H-NAS, Zn-NAS and Ga-NAS catalysts (NAS=novel aluminosilicates, comprising ZSM-5-based structures having XRD crystallinities ranging from the substantially amorphous to the partially crystalline and their highly crystalline ZSM-5 analogues. Zinc or gallium has been introduced into the parent zeolitic structure by means of solid-state ion-exchange. Zinc appears to enhance both activity and BTX (benzene, toluene and xylenes) selectivity, relative to the zeolitic parent solid, in contrast to gallium, which affects only BTX selectivity. In addition, optimum activity plus BTX selectivity under the conditions used are found for XRD crystallinities in the range 50–85%. The maximum BTX yields (single pass basis) are lowest for the H-NAS samples, markedly higher for the Zn-NAS catalysts, and at an intermediate level for the Ga-NAS samples.","AcknowledgementsFinancial support from the Andrew Mellon Foundation, University of the Witwatersrand and the National Research Foundation (South Africa) is gratefully acknowledged.",,Catalysis Today,,,,2002-01,2002,,2002-01,71,3-4,429-435,Closed,Article,"Nicolaides, C.P.; Sincadu, N.P.; Scurrell, M.S.","Nicolaides, C.P.

Previous studies suggest that desertification commenced at 14 Ma during global climate desiccation. Sedimentologic data from middle Miocene to upper Pliocene successions in the modern Atacama Desert indicate that a semiarid climate persisted from 8 to 3 Ma, punctuated by a phase of increased aridity at ca. 6 Ma. As such, hyperaridity did not commence until the late Pliocene. Implications are (1) that the rain shadow generated by the Andean Cordillera has had a minor influence on climate change, and (2) that the upwelling, north- flowing, cold Humboldt Current, although important in establishing the generally arid climate of western South America, did not control the shift to hyperaridity. The formation of the hyperarid Atacama Desert in the late Pliocene accompanied the development of the current phase of aridification in the Sahara and Namib Deserts and is attributed to a phase of global climate cooling.",,,Geology,,,,2002,2002,,2002,30,1,43-46,Closed,Article,"Hartley, Adrian J.; Chong, Guillermo","Hartley, Adrian J.

In the first stage, the fraction of copper extracted varied linearly with time according to α=k1t, whereas in the second stage, the dissolution was well represented by the shrinking core model controlled by diffusion through a porous product layer with kinetic equation: 1−3(1−α)2/3+2(1−α)=k2t.

Inoculation of manure with larvae of O. boas significantly reduced the proportion of large (>8.0 mm) aggregates from 81 % in non-cast manure to 3.5% in cast manure. In turn, the larvae converted the majority (92.7%) of the aggregate sizes into the 2–8 mm range compared with 14.5% for the un-inoculated manure. Mean weight diameters of dry aggregates were 5.34 mm and 18.45 mm for the treatments with and without O. boas, respectively. The casts also had significantly higher proportions of water stable macro-aggregates than non-cast manure (99.8 vs 90.2%). The higher stability of casts corresponded with their higher tensile strength (769 vs 408 kPa) and bulk density (1.58 vs 1.07 Mg m−3) compared with the non-cast manure. Chemically, the production of casts from manure resulted in a pH shift towards neutrality and significant increases in the concentration of plant nutrient elements (N, P, Ca, K and Mg) compared to non-cast manure.

South Africa has, paradoxically, redefined state role away from social provision, as it replaced the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) with the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy in 1996. Whereas the RDP accorded the state a pivotal role in meeting basic needs, GEAR pursued outward‐looking development. In accordance with the logic of GEAR, the Northern Province Government formulated its Growth and Development Strategy (GDS), essentially an offspring of that macro‐policy. Using the Northern Province as case study, this paper illustrates that GEAR and GDS have engendered outward‐looking development that is also open to the dictates of external forces. It is argued that South Africa and that province are as such inserted into the global system in a way that they cannot shape or domesticate globalization for resolution of their germane development difficulties. We point out that that form of globalization has not led to the improvement of the poor people’s access to basic needs. In conclusion, we urge for the establishment of a strong developmental state that would engender auto‐centeredness. La nécessité de relever le degré de satisfaction des besoins fondamentaux des pauvres et la qualité de vie en général est inséparable des préoccupations de viabilité et de la capacité de l’Etat d’assumer ses responsabilités en matière de protection sociale. Paradoxalement, l’Afrique du Sud a redéfini le rôle de l’Etat en le dissociant des préoccupations sociales, et remplacé le Programme de reconstruction et développement (RDP) par une Stratégie pour la croissance, l’emploi et la redistribution (GEAR) en 1996. Alors que le RDP accordait à l’Etat un rôle central dans la satisfaction des besoins fondamentaux, la GEAR visait un développement tourné vers l’extérieur. S’inscrivant dans la logique de la GEAR, les autorités de la Province septentrionale ont formulé une Stratégie de croissance et développement (GDS) issue essentiellement de cette macropolitique. Basant son étude de cas sur la Province septentrionale, l’article suggère que la GEAR et la GDS ont engendré un développement tourné vers l’extérieur qui est également sensible aux impératifs des forces extérieures. Selon l’auteur, l’Afrique du Sud et la province septentrionale sont tellement intégrées dans le système mondialisé qu’elles ne peuvent ni formuler ni maîtriser la mondialisation pour résoudre leurs propres problèmes de développement.

Theoretically, engagements of world commerce have included protectionism, inward-looking strategies, integration for interdependence, insertion for dependence, openness to imports and free trade regimes. For erstwhile colonies in Africa, the trajectory of engagement has seemed to be predetermined due to colonial-formation of their economies. As the model of evolution of Africa's external relations demonstrates, states in that continent have been inserted into the global system for dependent extraversion and adjustments. Attempts at trade and market liberalisation there have perpetuated openness to imports. Given that state of affairs, states in that continent have been eroded of capacity of domesticating globalisation for local socio-economic transformation. From a political-economy perspective, the paper views South Africa's Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy as an instrument of appropriation that is set to perpetuate that country's dependent extraversion and openness to imports. The paper uses the balance of payments to demonstrate that country's poor state of commerce with the rest of the world. It argues that as external trade and capital flows and investments, which are shaped through domestic economic policy, affect in return domestic capacity of transforming the structures of deprivation, GEAR has inaugurated a zero-sum game of globalisation, rather than `a better life for all'. We analyse several indicators of economic performance and social wellbeing to demonstrate the paradoxical operations and Janus-faced tendencies of globalisation and the attendant lack of transformation of structures of deprivation in South Africa.",,,GeoJournal,,,,2002-05,2002,,2002-05,57,1-2,15-28,Closed,Article,"Tsheola, Johannes","Tsheola, Johannes (School of Economics & Management, University of the North, 0727, Sovenga, Private Bag X1106, South Africa (E-mail)",,"Tsheola, Johannes (School of Economics & Management, University of the North, 0727, Sovenga, Private Bag X1106, South Africa (E-mail)",8,2,,3.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028184294,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

For each population, three combinations of additive and dominance genetic variances of different relative magnitudes were considered, thereby creating fifteen sub-populations. Constant residual variance was used in all populations. Variance components were estimated using the tilde-hat approximation to REML based on sire-dam model. Populations with few full-sibs (2% and 10%) and small magnitude of dominance variance (50), resulted in inaccurate estimation of dominance genetic variance. In populations with a large number of animals having dominance genetic relationships (20% or greater), estimates of dominance genetic variances can be obtained with improved accuracy even when the dominance genetic effect in the population is of small magnitude. Overestimation of additive genetic variance increased as both the number of full-sibs and the magnitude of dominance effects increased.

Mating systems of many symbiotic crustaceans are characterised by a high degree of mate guarding. A peculiar case of mate guarding has been reported for small symbiotic janirid isopods where males mate with immature females. Field samples of individual hosts and laboratory experiments were conducted to reveal the mating behaviour of the symbiont in a natural environment, that is, on their hosts. Along the coast of the Magellan Strait, Chile, the janirid isopod Iais pubescens was frequently found on the shore-living isopod Exosphaeroma gigas. Symbiont prevalence (percent hosts occupied) was high at eight of the nine sampling sites. Mean symbiont intensity was very low at one site (<<1 individual host–1), intermediate at two sites (1–10 individuals host–1) and high at the other sites (10–40 individuals host–1). The mean sex ratio (males:females) was male biased at most sampling sites (n=7). Females of I. pubescens reached substantially larger sizes (1.5–3.0 mm body length, BL) than males (1.1–1.9 mm BL). The majority of males were carrying small juveniles (66.15%), and males with juveniles were significantly larger than males without juveniles – this suggests that males prefer virgin juveniles to adult females and that they compete for small juveniles. In laboratory observations, males were seen to manipulate the marsupium of adult females that were about to release small juveniles. Males obtained virgin juveniles in this manner. Juveniles were carried for ~7 days, and they moulted shortly before being fertilised and released by males. The high proportion of juveniles carried by males in the field (68.2%) supports previous observations that males initially are not able to distinguish male and female juveniles. It is suggested that the mating system of symbiotic janirid isopods with long-term sperm storage and continuous receptivity in females and male mating with virgin females has evolved in response to highly unpredictable encounter probabilities between the sexes. Mate guarding and manipulation of small virgin juveniles may be favoured on the highly mobile hosts of symbiotic janirid isopods. Furthermore, adult females may gain by leaving their emerging offspring in the protective grip of guarding males, thereby reinforcing the maintenance of this peculiar mating system.",,,Marine Biology,,,,2002-07,2002,,2002-07,141,1,175-183,Closed,Article,"Thiel, M.","Thiel, M.

The capacitance–voltage characteristic demonstrates four effects (frequency dependence, negative capacitance, low-voltage peak, peak migration) that do not fit very well to what the lifetime theory predicts for p–n junction devices, but that are easily explained with relaxation theory. This suggests that the radiation damage has altered the semiconductor material from lifetime to relaxation. Possible mechanisms for the occurrence of the effects are suggested with an emphasis that relaxation theory be used for analysis. A defect introduction rate of 0.059cm−1 has been evaluated.","AcknowledgementsMany thanks are due to M. Edwards for the irradiation runs, to B.K. Jones and T.

Unbranched plantlets of I. flanaganiae propagated from tubers were exposed to three light regimes: 55μmolm−2sec−1, 280μmolm−2sec−1 and 30μmolm−2sec−1 (variants I, II and III respectively) for a period of seven weeks. Isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase and their differential responses to light variations were studied in plant extracts prepared from leaves of all three variants at weekly intervals. The activity of most SOD isoenzymes from plants subjected to low light intensity (variants I and II) remained relatively constant except for one Cu/Zn-SOD that increased gradually during the course of development. Little or no change in catalase activity was observed during the initial stage development of plants from these variants. A profound enhancement of catalase level was detected only from the fifth week onward, especially in variant III. The induction of some SODs and CAT in plants from these variants could be related to possible oxidative stress associated with plant aging. In contrast to CAT, the activity of some of the peroxidase isoenzymes in variant III decreased from the second week onward and was lower than in the plants from the other two variants during the initial stages of development. Plants from variants I and III also showed a steady increase in activity of most isoperoxidases (low and high mobility) with time, which suggests their indirect involvement in the regulation of plant growth and development. A rapid increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase during the experimental period was observed in plants exposed to relatively high light intensity (variant II). The activities of both Mn, and some of the Cu/Zn- containing SODs increased sharply from the second week onward under high light intensity as compared to the other two variants subjected to low light intensity. The Mn-SOD activity remained high throughout the experimental period, while the light-induced Cu/Zn- SODs showed a reduction in activity after the third week. This light-induced response could be an attempt to protect plants from the harmful radicals generated due to photo-oxidative stress under high light. The low activity of some isoperoxidase observed under these conditions is considered to be compensated by high catalase activity as the active oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, is removed by catalase and/or peroxidase. These metal containing enzymes seem to respond differentially to variations in light and could be suitable as a marker for the evaluation of light-induced oxidative stress in Impatiens flanaganiae plants.",,,South African Journal of Botany,,,,2002-12,2002,,2002-12,68,4,518-524,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lall, N.; Nikolova, R.V.; Grobbelaar, J.U.","Lall, N.

The fauna associated with hard bottom mussel beds along the exposed Pacific coast of Chile was examined. The abundance of adult (>10 mm body length) purple mussels Perumytilus purpuratus varied between 32 and 75 individuals per 50 cm2, and their biomass between 4.8 and 8.6 g AFDW per 50 cm2 at eight sampling sites between Arica (18°S) and Chiloé (42°S). At all sampling sites, the associated fauna was dominated by suspension-feeding organisms (cirripeds, spionid and sabellid polychaetes, a small bivalve) followed by grazing peracarids and gastropods. Predators and scavengers also reached high abundances while deposit- and detritus-feeding organisms were of minor importance. The majority of organisms associated with these hard bottom mussel beds feed on resources obtained from the water column or growing on the mussels rather than on materials deposited by the mussels. This is in contrast to the fauna associated with mussel beds on soft bottoms, which comprises many species feeding on material accumulated by mussels (faeces and pseudofaeces) and deposited within the mussel bed. Many of the organisms dwelling between mussels both on hard bottoms and on soft bottoms have direct development, but organisms with pelagic development also occur abundantly within mussel beds. We propose that species with direct development are disproportionately favoured by the structurally complex habitat with diverse interstitial spaces between the mussels, which provides ample shelter for small organisms. We conclude that mussels on hard-bottoms primarily provide substratum for associated fauna while mussels on soft bottoms provide both substratum and food resources.",,,Helgoland Marine Research,,,,2002-03-22,2002,2002-03-22,2002-04,56,1,21-30,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Thiel, Martin; Ullrich, Niklas","Thiel, Martin (Facultad Ciencias del Mar, Universidad Católica del Norte, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile, Chile); Ullrich, Niklas (Universität Kiel, Zoologisches Institut, Arbeitsgruppe Marine Ökologie und Systematik, Olshausenstrasse 40-60, 24118 Kiel, Germany, Germany)",,"Thiel, Martin (Catholic University of the North); Ullrich, Niklas (Kiel University)",95,11,,6.18,https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1007/s10152-001-0098-3,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041074277,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology,

In total 28 objects were observed of which 18 are new measurements. Combining our new BVRI photometry with the data summary published by Hainaut & Delsanti ([CITE]) results in a database of 94 objects: 45 Cubewanos, 22 Plutinos, 13 scattered disk objects, 14 Centaurs. The reddening range seems to be similar among the four dynamical classes (-5 to 55%/l00 nm) and only one outlier (1994 ES2) exists. The spectral gradient distribution of the Cubewanos peaks between 25 to 35%/l00 nm, while for the three other types the maximum seems to fall below 20%/l00 nm. A clustering of red Cubewanos with perihelia beyond ~41 AU in low eccentricity and low inclination orbit suggests that these objects are less affected by the physical processes that potentially produce neutral colors, i.e. resurfacing by collision and by intrinsic activity. For Cubewanos and scattered disk objects, the range of reddening increases with decreasing perihelion distance and with increasing orbital excitation. A correlation of the spectral slope with inclination is present for Cubewanos and scattered disk objects, and is non-existent for the other dynamical types. It is unclear whether these trends (or their absence) are discriminative for the correctness of the resurfacing scenarios. If intrinsic activity is responsible for resurfacing, the start of the effect inside ~41 AU from the Sun may be indicative for the driving agent, while in the collision scenario the survival of the red Cubewano cluster in the central region of the Kuiper-Belt argues for the existence of a population of bodies the surface of which is heavily radiation processed without impact resurfacing.",,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,,2002-10-29,2002,2002-10-29,2002-11,395,1,297-303,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Boehnhardt, H.; Delsanti, A.; Barucci, A.; Hainaut, O.; Doressoundiram, A.; Lazzarin, M.; Barrera, L.; de Bergh, C.; Birkle, K.; Dotto, E.; Meech, K.; Ortiz, J.

253,pub.1028237606,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2002.00745.x,,,The zoogeography of algae‐associated peracarids along the Pacific coast of Chile,"Abstract Aim To describe the zoogeography of the algae‐associated peracarid crustaceans from exposed rocky shores along the SE‐Pacific.   Location  Chile, 18° S to 42° S.   Methods  A standardized sampling programme was used at all sites. Samples of macroalgae were taken at twenty sites distributed along the entire study area. Quantitative samples ( n = 6 replicates of 8 cm −2 surface area each) of calcareous and non‐calcareous red algae were taken in the low intertidal, preserved immediately in 4%‐formalin and washed over a 0.2‐mm mesh before sorting. All peracarid individuals were sorted, identified to the species level and then categorized in separate functional groups according to their feeding habits. Graphical representations of species replacement within each functional group along the latitudinal gradient are provided. A classification analysis employing the unweighted paired group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) was conducted in order to reveal the main zoogeographical zones.   Results  A total of forty epifaunal peracarid species was found. A gradual replacement of species within different functional groups (grazing and suspension‐feeding species) was observed in the central region ( c . 26° S−37° S). In this central region, species with northern and those with southern distribution overlapped, while other species were only found here, resulting in high species richness. The number of species/site/algal species in the northern (north of c . 25.5° S) and southern region (south of c . 38.5° S) was considerably lower than in the central region. The distribution of most grazing peracarids showed a more continuous pattern than that of suspension‐feeding amphipods. The distribution of the remaining species (predators, scavengers, deposit‐feeders, unknowns) was scattered along the examined sites. The cluster analysis for the epifaunal peracarid assemblage confirmed the separation of a northern and southern zone connected by a central (transitional) zone between c . 26° S and c . 37° S. Similar zonation patterns have been found by most other studies on the zoogeography of the Chilean coast, although little agreement exists about the exact limits of this transitional zone. It is discussed that the distribution limits of algae‐associated peracarids (and other macroinvertebrates) – particularly in the transitional zone – may show interannual variations as a result of varying oceanographic conditions. The large affinity of the algae‐associated peracarid fauna from the central and southern Chilean coast to those of other regions indicates that dispersal may be facilitated by rafting with floating algae transported in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.   Main conclusions  The zoogeographical analysis of algae‐associated peracarids confirms the existence of a northern and a southern zone connected by an extensive transitional zone. General biology, habitat use and the abundant presence of dispersal vectors such as floating macroalgae may affect the zoogeography of species living in transitional zones with strong interannual variations in current regimes. In these areas, species associated with substrata of high dispersal potential may show different distribution patterns than species inhabiting other substrata. 
 Resumen En el presente se estudió la zoogeografía de crustáceos peracáridos asociados a algas a lo largo de la costa rocosa expuesta del Pacifico‐SE (Chile, 18°S a 42°S). Se realizó un programa de muestreo estandarizado, recolectándose macroalgas en 20 sitios distribuidos a lo largo del área de estudio. Se encontró un total de 40 especies de peracaridos epifaunales, perteneciendo principalmente a los grupos funcionales de ramoneadores y de suspensivoros. En la zona central (∼ 26° S a ∼ 37° S) se observó un reemplazo gradual de especies para cada uno de los grupos funcionales estudiados. En esta región transicional, especies de distribución norte y sur pueden ser encontradas. En adición, varias otras especies de peracáridos fueron recolectadas únicamente en esta región, lo que resulta en una alta riqueza de especies para esta zona. El número de especies sitio −1 tipo de alga −1 en la región norte (al norte de ∼ 25.5° S) y en la región sur (al sur de ∼ 38.5° S) fue considerablemente menor que el observado en la región central. La distribución de la mayoría de los peracáridos con un hábito ramoneador mostró un patrón mas uniforme que el de los anfípodos suspensivoros. La distribución de especies pertenecientes al resto de los grupos funcionales (depredadores, carroñeros, depositivoros, habito desconocido) fue dispersa a lo largo de los sitios examinados. El análisis zoogeográfico de peracáridos asociados a algas confirma la existencia de una zona norte y otra sur conectadas por una extensa zona transicional. La biología general, el uso del hábitat y la presencia común de vectores de dispersión tales como macroalgas flotantes podrían afectar la zoogeografía de aquellas especies que habitan en zonas de transición con fuertes variaciones interanuales en el régimen de corrientes. En estas áreas, especies asociadas con substratos que presenten un alto potencial de dispersión podrían mostrar un patrón de distribución diferente al mostrado por especies que habitan otros tipos de substratos.","I thank E.

Milne Edwards, 1837) (Decapoda: Anomura: Porcellanidae)","Allopetrolisthes spinifrons is an ectosymbiotic crab of the sea anemone Phymactis clematis. As a consequence of low host abundance, these represent a scarce and limited resource for the crab. Additionally, the relatively small size of the sea anemone host suggests that few symbiotic crabs can cohabit on one host individual, forcing crabs to adopt a territorial behaviour. In order to examine the potential presence and ontogenetic development of territoriality, the agonistic behaviour between crabs of various ontogenetic stages (adults, juveniles, and recruits) was studied in the laboratory. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that adult or juvenile crabs aggressively defended their sea anemone hosts against adult or juvenile intruders, respectively, but both adult and juvenile crabs tolerated recruits. Adult crabs behaved indifferently towards juvenile crabs, sometimes tolerating them, sometimes expelling them. Recruits never showed agonistic behaviour among themselves. The agonistic interactions observed in the laboratory and the uniform population distribution pattern on sea anemones recently described for A. spinifrons indicate that this species exhibits territorial behaviour, which develops during ontogeny. Territoriality in this species and other symbiotic decapods may function as a density-dependent mechanism of population regulation, being mediated by the availability of hosts. Resource monopolisation behaviours may be common among other symbiotic and free-living marine invertebrates inhabiting discrete habitats that represent a limiting resource.",,,Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology,,,,2002-01,2002,,2002-01,35,4,189-202,Closed,Article,"Baeza, J.A.; Stotz, W.; Thiel, M.","Baeza, J.A.

This inevitably led to the democratisation of library and information science (LIS) education. This process was inextricably linked to the social, political and economic events in the country as it prepared for its first democratic elections in 1994. From the traditional approach to library and information work prevalent in the apartheid era emerged an alternative approach. This new approach recognised strong links between libraries and the struggle for democracy and rejected the idea of librarianship as a neutral activity. Various leading librarians in South Africa began to criticise the prevailing model of education for librarianship and to redefine its educational goals and objectives. The need for more appropriate training as well as rapid technological changes necessitated curriculum revision. A newly emerging clientele and the appearance of resource centres and community libraries also called for alternative training for information workers. By 1994, in spite of plans, policy-making and recognition of the need for change in the education for librarians, problems of fragmentation, a lack of articulation of programmes and little differentiation and specialisation persisted in LIS education and training. Although there have been further policy initiatives and gains resulting in legislation in the 1990s, the democratisation process of LIS education in 2001 is far from complete.",,,Libri,,,,2002-06-01,2002,2007-12-04,2002-06-01,52,2,55-66,Closed,Article,"Bell, Fiona","Bell, Fiona (Information Studies, School of Human and Social Studies, University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa)","Bell, Fiona (University of KwaZulu-Natal)","Bell, Fiona (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",3,0,,2.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050842708,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,4 Quality Education

The argument is that these languages should be developed and therefore need to intervene at a level of science, technology, mathematics and commerce or other similar domains. Unless this is done, there are fears and views that these indigenous languages will be viewed as irrelevant in developmental terms and will always be looked at as second-class languages and theiefore poor competitors with ex-colonial languages. Reliance on ex-colonial languages as languages of instruction, is viewed as subscribing to a heritage of colonialism, which is not the case, in say, France, Geimany, etc. This article considers arguments for and against such a view. For academic reasons and reasons of cost effectiveness, a more pragmatic stance is suggested, namely that mother tongues may not necessarily be adequate for academic relevance. The choice of media, particularly beyond secondary school level, is not dependent on a community's wishes, but is rather dictated by global academic pursuits. The article concludes by taking what is considered to be a balanced view with regard to educational, socio-cultural, identity, national and international considerations.",,,South African Journal of African Languages,,,,2002-01,2002,2012-10-24,2002-01,22,2,149-160,Closed,Article,"Moyo, Themba","Moyo, Themba (General Linguistics Department, University of Zululand, Private Bag XI001, KwaDlangezwa, 3886, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, E-mail:, ctmoyo@pan.uzulu.ac.za)",,"Moyo, Themba (University of Zululand)",12,0,,5.42,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106839181,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies; 4704 Linguistics",

Fatty acids were analysed at 0, 18, 38, 58, and 72 days of gonad conditioning. Both muscle and gonads showed a significant decrease in the relative distribution (weight % of total fatty acids) of saturated, monounsaturated, and n‐6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (mg/g dry weight). Generally, an increase of the n‐3 polyunsaturated group was observed for gonads until Day 58, thereafter a decrease was observed, probably as a result of environmental stress. A similar trend was observed for eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were the most preserved fatty acids, suggesting their importance as essential fatty acids for gonad maturation.

He was a teacher … a messenger … a court interpreter … journalist, a founder of newspapers…. He was the first black South African novelist … Plaatje lived and died at the crucial intersection of South Africa's history, where a cowardly imperial government created an overtly racist constitution, and handed the reins of power to the forces of reaction and oppression. He experienced dispossession. He fought against it. He foretold the bleak future of repression and resistance through which generations more were condemned to pass until liberation day. Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje is widely regarded by scholars as a British Empire enthusiast and a moderate leader of the African National Congress (ANC) who, if valiant in his espousal of black rights, then nevertheless was staunchly opposed to radical and working class forces. Yet he criticised, if often in an ironic style, the very Empire and Establishment he allegedly upheld, and he remained throughout his life deeply concerned about the harsh conditions of African workers and the plight of African women, including working women. Today his position as an icon of the new South Africa is well established. However, a better understanding of his complex attitudes to nation, class, and gender is required to fully appreciate this image. In this paper, I primarily examine his attitudes to African workers. To a lesser extent, I survey his use of irony, his attitudes to Empire and women, and his place today in South African studies. I argue that recent insights of literary scholars, together with a close analysis of historical records and especially his journalism, and a re-envisaging of his life project, all point to ‘another’ Plaatje. This necessitates significant modifications to the portrait so ably crafted by his biographer Brain Willan some twenty years ago. This new way of looking at Plaatje is important in interpreting the ideological and historical underpinnings of the current political hegemony of the ANC.",,,Critical Arts,,,,2002-01,2002,2007-08-29,2002-01,16,1,23-40,Closed,Article,"Limb, Peter","Limb, Peter (Michigan State University)",,"Limb, Peter (Michigan State University)",3,1,,4.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010687470,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4705 Literary Studies",

In terms of the model of three phases for the development of an indigenised norm proposed by Gill (1999), we hypothesise that South African English is in the liberation and expansion phase. Our notion of language standards and the context of the acquisition of Black South African English are presented as contextualisation of the problem. Thereafter, we attempt to test our hypothesis empirically. Three sets of data are presented and analysed. Firstly, the attitudes towards and perception of the norm by black teachers of English indicate that there are conflicting opinions about what the norm is, but there is general agreement that English must adjust itself to the new South African context. Secondly, the application of the norm is examined in a correction exercise, where the teachers display a high level of acceptance of standard English forms, but considerable disagreement about the acceptability of non‐standard forms. Thirdly, the data on the reception of the norm by the learners testify to confusion about the acceptability of various non‐standard forms. On the basis of these three sets of data, we conclude that Black South African English is indeed an emerging norm for South African Englishes, but one that has not yet been established securely.",,,World Englishes,,,,2002-03,2002,2003-01-10,2002-03,21,1,113-128,Closed,Article,"van der Walt, Johann L.; van Rooy, Bertus","van der Walt, Johann L.

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the migration processes that have been occurring in Chile between 1977–1982 and 1987–1992, as a market mechanism to re-allocate labor among regions. Using traditional consumer theory, a model is developed for a migrant who is evaluating migration. Secondly, this model is estimated, with cross section aggregate data, for both periods using a logit formulation. The results indicate that there is a strong force in the Chilean regional labor market, which serves to concentrate the workforce around the largest populated region of the country. Finally, regional labor markets are simulated to show that migration forces are very weak to arbitrage regional wages and unemployment rate and specific policy is required to promote balanced development across Chilean regions.",,,The Annals of Regional Science,,,,2002-08,2002,,2002-08,36,2,197-218,Closed,Article,"Aroca, Patricio; Hewings, Geoffrey J.

In so doing, they have contributed to the creation of new institutions of advanced education, the expansion of curricula and degree offerings and the sponsorship of both applied and general research in these northern areas.

We then modelled the structure and stabilities of the dry and hydrated {0001}, {100}, {101}, {110}, {103} and {111} surfaces, which calculations confirmed the experimental dominance of the {0001} surface, which is prominently expressed in the calculated thermodynamic morphologies. The dehydrated morphology further shows the experimental {111} twinning plane, while the {100} cleavage plane is expressed in the hydrated morphology. Molecular adsorption of water has a stabilising effect on all six surfaces, where the surfaces generally show Langmuir behaviour and the calculated hydration energies indicate physisorption (73–88 kJ mol−1). The chains of fluoride ions surrounded by hexagonal calcium channels can become distorted in two major ways: either by a shortening/lengthening of the F–F distances, when the channel is perpendicular to the surface, or by distortion of the Ca–F bonds when the channel is parallel to the surface. Both distortions occur when the channel runs at an angle to the surface. Other relaxations include compression of the calcium sub-lattice and rotation of surface phosphate groups.","We thank Drs J.

If qualitative research is to provide convincing evidence with which to inform theory and practice, it must be capable of withstanding critical scrutiny and practitioners must be given sufficient information with which to evaluate the strength and plausibility of the evidence reported. The process of undertaking qualitative research and of writing and critiquing subsequent reports is not about assessing adherence to rigid rules but of ensuring the appropriateness and thoroughness of data collection, analysis and reporting, given the nature and context of the issue. The espousal of a client-centred ethic also demands consideration of research relevance and usefulness to clients and the degree of consumer involvement throughout the research process.

214,pub.1056929114,10.1051/0004-6361:20020854,,,On the Period-Luminosity-Colour-Metallicity relation and the pulsational characteristics of λ Bootis type stars*,"Generally, chemical peculiarity found for stars on the upper main sequence excludes δ Scuti type pulsation (e.g. Ap and Am stars), but for the group of λ Bootis stars it is just the opposite. This makes them very interesting for asteroseismological investigations. The group of λ Bootis type stars comprises late B- to early F-type, Population I objects which are basically metal weak, in particular the Fe group elements, but with the clear exception of C, N, O and S. The present work is a continuation of the studies by Paunzen et al. ([CITE], [CITE]), who presented first results on the pulsational characteristics of the λ Bootis stars. Since then, we have observed 22 additional objects; we found eight new pulsators and confirmed another one. Furthermore, new spectroscopic data (Paunzen [CITE]) allowed us to sort out misidentified candidates and to add true members to the group. From 67 members of this group, only two are not photometrically investigated yet which makes our analysis highly representative. We have compared our results on the pulsational behaviour of the λ Bootis stars with those of a sample of δ Scuti type objects. We find that at least 70% of all λ Bootis type stars inside the classical instability strip pulsate, and they do so with high overtone modes (Q < 0.020 d). Only a few stars, if any, pulsate in the fundamental mode. Our photometric results are in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic work on high-degree nonradial pulsations by Bohlender et al. ([CITE]). Compared to the δ Scuti stars, the cool and hot borders of the instability strip of the λ Bootis stars are shifted by about 25 mmag, towards smaller . Using published abundances and the metallicity sensitive indices of the Geneva 7-colour and Strömgren systems, we have derived [ Z] values which describe the surface abundance of the heavier elements for the group members. We find that the Period-Luminosity-Colour relation for the group of λ Bootis stars is within the errors identical with that of the normal δ Scuti stars.

The present configuration of a flat slab between 28–33°S may be explained by a series of favorable conditions evolving with time since the breakup of the Farallon Plate at 25Ma. The dramatic shift of the pole of rotation and the rapid eastward propagating rift along the Challenger Fracture Zone induced an unbalanced slab pull force, south of the CH–JF–M, that may have triggered the detachment of the subducting slab. The upwelling of a warmer asthenospheric material and the partial melts of the slab are likely consequences that are consistent with the anhydrous tholeiitic late Oligocene volcanism and the anomalous adakite-type magmatism of the early Miocene, respectively. The present seismogenic zone across the CH–JF–M tectonic boundary shows a continuity for more than 600km along the flat slab segment, in contrast with the much shorter slab southward. Such a tectonic configuration is probably a quasi-steady condition since 25Ma. Gravity modeling along the JF chain and the broadly located focal mechanisms at the locus of the already subducted JF chain indicate a thick (>25km), wide (100km), and continuous belt of lighter oceanic crust, which is the major contribution to the positive buoyancy of the slab. The decoupling of the subducted slab at intermediate depths further contributes to the flattening of the slab, focusing the buoyancy forces associated with the thickened oceanic crust along the already subducted JF chain. The absolute plate reconstruction during the Miocene shows that the JF collision against the margin migrates southward, in agreement with geological and tectonic observations that further support the causative relationship between the flattening of the slab and the subduction of the JF chain. Preliminary deformation models for the indentation of the JF ridge against the continental lithosphere is consistent with the particular east–west trend of the Maipo deformation zone, connecting in this way the CH–JF–M major tectonic boundary in the ocean-continent lithosphere system.","AcknowledgementsThis project has been supported by Fondecyt project 1000136.

211,pub.1001197158,10.1016/s0009-2541(02)00021-9,,,Hydrochemistry of two adjacent acid saline lakes in the Andes of northern Chile,"Numerous closed-basins in central Andes contain saline lakes and salt crusts (salars). Almost all of them are neutral or alkaline lakes. Only two lakes out of 84 studied in Bolivia and Chile are acid lakes. They are located in two adjacent intravolcanic basins in northern Chile. The origin of acidity is due to the juxtaposition of two factors: the very strong hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks in the drainage basins and the high sulfur content in the whole area. Primary minerals are replaced by amorphous silica, limonite, chlorite, white mica and elemental sulfur. The buffer capacity of the volcanic rocks has been considerably lowered and is no longer sufficient to neutralize the sulfuric acid generated by oxidation of native sulfur. Dissolution modeling of chlorite, white mica and sulfur in a neutral inflow water leads to a composition very much like that of the acid inflows. The modeled acid solution is oversaturated with respect to alunite by several orders of magnitude, exactly as observed in natural acid inflows. Some of the alunite reported in the altered zones of the drainage basins could be supergene in origin. The simulation of evaporation of acid inflows shows a good agreement between salar brines and computed brines, indicating that the acidic brines do not originate in the past hydrothermal activity, but result from recent supergene processes: the leaching of the severely altered volcanic rocks and the direct evaporation of the resulting acidic waters. Aluminium shows a conservative behavior in both salars reflecting the drastic lowering of the saturation index of Al-sulfate minerals in evaporating acid brines, which is confirmed by the lack of detection of alunite within both salars.","AcknowledgementsThis study was done within the framework of a Convention between the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD, ex Orstom, France), the Department of Chemistry of the Universidad Católica del Norte (Antofagasta, Chile) and the Dirección General de Aguas (Santiago, Chile).

As promises of political and economic reforms did not materialize and as economically powerful states continued to be indifferent, most African states resorted to the strategy of self-interest for international legitimacy and faith in foreign direct investment (FDI) and aid. Departing from its portrayal as a relatively developed, competitive and civil-minded state in Africa, South Africa reinvented modernity in the hope of servicing similar self-interests. I argue that South Africa’s form of globalisation is paradoxical. While positing as a voice for the voiceless and leader of African renaissance, that country simultaneously mediated Africa’s relations for appropriation of neo-liberal principles. Occurring predominantly through political and economic liberalisation, globalisation of Africa is ‘an old story’ of insertion for dependence on foreign capital. I show that South Africa’s neo-liberal agenda in Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), as well, engendered openness to imports. Given the commonalities between GEAR and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), I argue that the latter is South Africa’s instrument of ‘reintegrating’ Africa. I also illustrate that South Africa’s foreign economic policy in Africa and NEPAD are founded on the marginalisation thesis, misreading of the paradoxical operations of neo-orthodoxy globalisation in Africa and the thinking that South Africa is suffering due to its geographical association with Africa. I conclude that that country’s form of globalisation will further empty Africa of its capacity of auto-centeredness and engender openness to imports, which are yet to deliver continental recovery.","AcknowledgementsI am grateful to Professor David Slater and the three anonymous referees for their constructive commentaries on this paper.

This improvement could potentially result from the accommodation system exhibiting a cyclic tracking response. This type of response would allow the integration of target features over time, resulting in an improvement in VA. In this study we measure VA in simulated astigmatic blur conditions, with the magnitude of astigmatic blur being temporally modulated over a range of astigmatic blur intervals. Improvement of VA with increased range of astigmatic blur would support the integration of visual information over time hypothesis.   Methods:  Three fully corrected subjects participated in a 3‐Alternative Force Choice method of constant stimuli paradigm where they were asked to identify one of three randomly chosen letters (K, R or X). The stimuli (Arial, font size 18) were subjected to varying amounts of Gaussian blur along the horizontal and vertical meridian and presented at a distance of 1.3 m. On any trial, the stimuli were randomly presented to the subjects at one of six astigmatic blur intervals. Each blur interval revolved at a temporal frequency of 2 Hz around the circle of least confusion with the smallest interval presenting the stimuli at the circle of least confusion and the largest oscillating the stimuli across the full interval, i.e. from the most horizontally to vertically blurred meridian.   Results:  From the resulting psychometric functions it was shown that all subjects exhibit a progressive improvement in letter recognition with increasing astigmatic blur interval.

The stimulus (Gabor) was embedded in different levels of external noise (from 9.86 × 10 −5 secdeg 2 to 0 noise). Threshold measures when plotted against noise level produce a linear relationship: the slope provides a measure of sampling efficiency (neural index), and the intercept with the abscissa provides an estimate of internal noise (optical index). Six emmetropes and 15 myopes (≥6.00 D) participated in the study. The data of the emmetropic subjects were used as a baseline for comparison with the myopic group. In addition, biometric data were collected from all subjects.   Results:  All emmetropic subjects showed similar results ( p > 0.5) with sampling efficiencies of the order of ∼14% and internal noise measures of ∼2.4 × 10 −5 secdeg 2 . All myopic subjects demonstrated reduced visual efficiency ( p < 0.01) which could take the form of a reduced sampling efficiency or increased intrinsic noise levels, although most myopic subjects showed reduced sampling efficiency. Interestingly, reductions in sampling efficiency were compensated by lower levels of internal noise in this group.   Conclusions:  Myopes show reduced visual efficiency in comparison to emmetropes. This can take the form of either increased internal noise or reduced sampling efficiency. However, deficits in sampling efficiency are associated with lower levels of internal noise. This may represent a compensation mechanism in the visual system of myopes to impaired neural sampling.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,575-575,Closed,Article,"Vera‐Díaz, F.

194,pub.1036714433,10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00086_8.x,,,Chromatic and achromatic loss of sensitivity in glaucoma,"Purpose:  Loss of both chromatic and achromatic sensitivity in glaucoma has been shown, however, the relative loss is unknown. We aim to quantify and establish which of these systems is affected most in glaucoma.   Methods:  Earlier experiments have shown that thresholds for detection of coherent motion of colour‐defined, spatially structured stimuli are not affected by dynamic luminance contrast noise. We used these results to design stimuli conditions that isolate chromatic and achromatic mechanisms. We studied 13 subjects with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) with mean age of 70 years, 17 control subjects with a mean age of 68 years and 13 young normal subjects with a mean age of 31 years. Contrast thresholds were measured using a 4‐alternative, forced‐choice procedure involving discrimination of motion direction. Achromatic and chromatic sensitivities were measured, the latter along the tritan and protan confusion axes, foveally and at 8° eccentricity.   Results:  There were statistically significant differences between the three subject groups. Comparison of the control and POAG groups revealed a loss of sensitivity in the POAG group. Achromatic sensitivity thresholds increased 1.4‐fold (both at the fovea and at 8°), whereas chromatic thresholds increased 1.8‐ (B/Y) and 1.5‐fold (R/G) at the fovea and 2.0‐ (B/Y) and 1.6‐fold (R/G) at 8°. Comparison of the control and young groups reflected the ageing effects. Achromatic sensitivity showed 1.5‐fold reduction (both fovea and 8°), but the chromatic loss was more severe: 3.5‐ (B/Y) and 3.0‐fold (R/G) at the fovea, and 3.6‐ (B/Y) and 3.2‐fold (R/G) at 8°.   Conclusions:  The results confirm that the B/Y channel is most affected in glaucoma, but both chromatic and achromatic mechanisms are affected by ageing and glaucoma.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,574-574,Closed,Article,"Pacheco‐Cutillas, M.; Barbur, J.

Methods:  Thirty normal subjects (22 females and 8 males, median age 28 years, range 18–58) underwent Goldmann tonometry and optic disc analysis with the HRT. Three HRT readings were taken at each visit and a mean topographic image (MTI) produced. Measurements were performed in the morning (07.00–09.00 hours) and were repeated later the same day (17.00–19.00 hours). We studied the following topographic parameters: cup‐to‐disc area ratio (CDR), rim volume (RV), cup shape measure (CSM), and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFLT) in relation to time of day and the change in intraocular pressure (IOP).   Results:  The median changes in the topographic parameters were as follows (a negative value indicates a larger value in the evening): CDR (median 0.001, 95% CI: −0.007 to 0.007), RV (median 0.003, 95% CI: −0.021 to 0.016), CSM (median: −0.003, 95% CI: −0.015 to 0.007) and RNFLT (median 0.006, 95% CI: −0.010 to 0.009). No parameter exhibited statistically significant change. The median morning IOP was 14 mmHg (95% CI: 13–16 mmHg) and was not significantly different (Wilcoxon's W = 234; p = 0.27) to evening IOP when it was 13 mmHg (95% CI: 12–15 mmHg). The median difference in IOP was 1 mmHg higher in the morning than the evening (range 6 mmHg higher in the morning to 4 mmHg higher in the evening). The parameter changes between the morning MTI and the evening MTI were independent of IOP changes using Kendall's tau statistic for each parameter.   Conclusions:  There was no variation in HRT parameters when measured during office hours. Small intraindividual changes in IOP do not significantly affect optic disc topography.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,581-582,Closed,Article,"Gunvant, P.; Broadway, D.; Watkins, R.","Gunvant, P.

To design the questionnaire to be relevant to refractive correction by spectacles, contact lenses and refractive surgery.   Methods:  Quality of life domains were identified using literature review and professional focus group discussion. Items within these domains were selected from the scientific literature (global, vision‐specific and cosmetic surgery‐specific quality of life instruments) and from suggestions of professionals and lay people. Six focus groups were used for item reduction: Three groups of professionals (psychology and eye care professionals experienced with spectacle, contact lens and refractive surgery patients) and three groups of lay public. The reduced item set was built into a pilot questionnaire. Statistical analysis for item reduction included factor analysis (SPSS) and Rasch modelling (Quest, Rumm 2010).   Results:  Seven domains of quality of life were selected. Within these, 647 items were selected as possibly being relevant. This number was reduced based on the responses of the focus groups to 90 items, which form a pilot questionnaire. The responses of 306 subjects (102 spectacle wearers, contact lens wearers and people who have had refractive surgery) were used to further reduce items using factor analysis and Rasch modelling. This resulted in the final version of the Quality of Life Impact of Refractive Correction (QIRC) questionnaire.   Conclusions:  The methodological approach for item selection, item reduction, question construction and response scaling ensures construct validity of the QIRC questionnaire. The QIRC questionnaire is suitable for measuring quality of life in spectacle, contact lens wearers and refractive surgery patients, for outcome and cross‐sectional research.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,578-578,Closed,Article,"Garamendi, E.; Pesudovs, K.; Elliott, D.

Methods:  In experiment 1, the influence of font type on letter legibility was studied on nine subjects optically defocused using a +1.00 DS lens in front of one eye. Two Punjabi font types used in widely read Punjabi language newspapers and magazines were selected. Legibility was determined according to the method of Strong and Woo (1985). In experiment 2, a single Punjabi font (selected from experiment 1) was used to investigate relative letter legibility in 10 subjects who were optically defocused with a +1.00 DS, +2.00 DC, axis 180 and 90. The Punjabi letters were modified to fit into a 5 × 5‐grid using Coral draw and presented on a standard PC monitor at high contrast using Powerpoint. The method of Strong and Woo (1985) was used to determine relative letter legibility.   Results:  The results of experiment 1 showed no effect of font type on letter legibility ( anova , p > 0.05). The results of experiment 2 were analysed in two ways. Firstly, anova revealed an interaction between blur condition (sphere, cyl axis 90, cyl axis 180) and letter legibility ( p < 0.05). Post‐hoc analysis (analysis of main effects and Tukey HSD test) showed a significant effect of letter legibility only under the +2.00 DC axis 90 blur condition ( p < 0.05). Secondly, the percentage difference in relative legibility under cylinder blur (axes 180 and 90) was plotted against the legibility under spherical blur. We selected 11 letters of equal legibility on the basis of a difference in relative legibility for each cyl condition of no more than 10% of the value of the spherical blur condition.   Conclusion:  Relative legibility of Punjabi letters was determined resulting in the selection of 11 letters.

Methods:  Two hundred and fifty‐two healthy subjects (121 males, 131 females) underwent intraocular pressure and POBF measurement with the Ocular Blood Flow Analyzer (Paradigm Medical Industries, Salt Lake City, UT, USA and formerly the POBF Tonograph). Before POBF measurement, subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic examination including refraction, slitlamp examination and biomicroscopic fundoscopy and Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). Subjects with ocular pathology were excluded from the study. Median age was 29 years (male median 32 years, female median 27 years).   Results:  Average POBF in males was found to be 1052 µL min −1 (95% CI: 988–1116 µL min −1 ) and in females to be 1293 µL min −1 (95% CI: 1222–1364 µL min −1 ). Median age was significantly different between males and females (Mann–Whitney U = 6685; p = 0.0311) but POBF was found to be independent of age in both sexes. As a group, mean refractive error influenced POBF (Kendall's τ = 0.24; p = 0.0017).   Conclusions:  Pulsatile ocular blood flow values in Indians appear to be higher than reported in studies conducted on other racial groups. The reasons for this difference could be instrumental or anatomical (i.e axial length, ocular rigidity).

It occurs under higher background illumination and whilst covering the non‐tested eye with a black patch. We investigated the occurrence of Ganzfeld changes in Short Wavelength Automated Perimetry (SWAP) and assessed the performance while covering the non‐tested eye with a standard black patch and with a translucent occluder.   Methods:  Twenty‐eight volunteers of age 22 ± 3 years participated in the study. A custom made 16‐point test was used to analyse the sensitivity with a standard black patch and with the translucent occluder. The number and duration of Ganzfeld changes in each condition were detected by subjective responses. The visual comfort of the subjects under each patching condition was assessed using a comfort scale (0–5) and subject's preference.   Results:  Ganzfeld changes occurred when a standard black patch was used and appears to influence the ability to see the test targets. With a standard black patch 5 Ganzfeld changes were observed per minute and it varied between 2 and 8 s. The duration and occurrence increased towards the end of the test. Using a translucent occluder almost eliminates the occurrence of Ganzfeld changes and improved the sensitivity ( p = 0.001). Of the 28 subjects, 22 preferred translucent occluder to black patch.

This may reflect sensory deficits, or alternatively, a loss of performance in later mechanisms responsible for behavioural responses. This study compared acuity measured using visual‐evoked potentials (VEP), with behavioural tests, in children with DS. The goal was to determine whether reduced VA could be detected in VEP recordings from the first stages of the response pathway.   Methods:  The subject group contained 34 children with DS and 35 controls, aged 3 months to 14 years. VA was measured using steady‐state, swept VEP (Norcia and Tyler, 1985). VA was also measured using behavioural techniques.   Results:  Visual acuity was analysed using a subject group (DS vs controls) × test type (behavioural vs VEP) anova with age as a covariate. A significant effect of subject group was observed ( F 1,59 = 8.632, p < 0.001) and a significant interaction between subject group and test type ( F 1,59 = 5.169, p = 0.027). The DS group showed reduced VA compared with the controls in both VEP and behavioural tests, but the deficit was more pronounced with behavioural testing. Reduced VA in the DS group was still seen when analysis was restricted to children who accommodate accurately ( F 1,26 = 8.047, p = 0.009).   Conclusions:  Reduced VEP acuity in the DS group supports the idea of an underlying sensory deficit in the DS visual system. Increased reduction with behavioural techniques implies additional losses at later stages of processing. Accommodative inaccuracy does not fully explain reduced VA in DS. Children with DS who do not have significant levels of defocus still exhibit reduced VA when compared with controls.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,572-572,Closed,Article,"John, Ff.

We investigated how the perceived size of visual stimuli in PD depends on their position in external space, as well as on the involvement of the right hemisphere.   Methods:  Patients with mild/moderate idiopathic PD were allocated to a primarily left‐ or a primarily right‐sided group (LPD, RPD; n = 7 or 8 in different experiments) from the severity of tremor, rigidity, and akinesia in the left and right limbs. The ratio of severity of symptoms between the worse and least affected side averaged more than 3 : 1. In a method of constant stimuli, observers judged whether the width or height of a (variable) rectangle in one region of space was greater than that of a (standard) rectangle in another region. Psychometric functions were fitted to each observer's data by probit analysis, from which the mean (point of subjective equality) and slope were obtained.   Results:  In LPD (but not RPD or controls) rectangles in left space had to be wider than identical rectangles in right space, and rectangles in right space narrower than identical rectangles in left space, to be perceived as of equal width. Similarly, a rectangle in lower space had to be shorter than an identical rectangle in upper space to be perceived as of equal height, whether the rectangles were positioned in right or in left space.   Conclusions:  The results are consistent with a perceptual compression of objects in left and upper space in LPD (but not in RPD), implicating right‐hemisphere dopaminergic mechanisms in the visual perception of size. The effects are small (about 4%) but may be important in the visual control of precise movements in LPD.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,577-578,Closed,Article,"Harris, J.

Methods:  Thirty‐six eyes of 18 patients affected by hypermetropia were enrolled as part of a prospective study in which one eye was treated with PRK and the other with LASIK. In the eyes that underwent LASIK the flap was cut on a nasal hinge with a LSK one microkeratome. The laser system was a Summit SVS Apex Plus with an optical zone of 6.5 mm and a blending zone of 1.5 mm. Corneal topographical data was acquired with a TMS‐1 pre‐operatively and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post‐operatively. The dioptric files for each time point were converted into ASCII format and subsequently analysed with purpose written software to extract the Fourier harmonics. This permitted the objective analysis of the irregular astigmatism, equivalent spherical component and regular astigmatism.   Results:  The irregular astigmatism increased in both groups post‐operatively, reached a peak at 3 months and then reduced over the next 9 months. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at any time point ( p < 0.05 all cases). At 12 months the irregular astigmatism values for both groups remained above their pre‐operative levels.   Conclusion:  The irregular astigmatism analysed in this study showed no statistically significant difference between the PRK and the LASIK group throughout the follow‐up period. It appears that, from a corneal topographical point of view, the two procedures induce an equal amount of irregular astigmatism.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,574-574,Closed,Article,"Sciscio, A.; Hull, C.

Methods:  Fifteen healthy, elderly subjects (mean age 71 ± 5 years, binocular VA −0.07 ± 0.05 logMAR, Snellen 20/17) with no history of falls and normal vision were recruited. Postural stability during standing was assessed using an AMTI force plate, and was determined as the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the Centre of Pressure (COP) signal in the anterior–posterior (AP) and medial–lateral (ML) directions collected over 30 s periods. Data were collected under normal standing conditions and when the inputs from the somatosensory and vestibular systems were disrupted. Measurements were also repeated with the subject being given an additional physical task (holding a tray of cups) and/or mental task (counting backwards). For all measurement conditions, postural sway was measured under conditions of binocular refractive blur of 0,1, 2, 4 and 8 D and with eyes closed. The data were analysed using a population‐averaged linear model.   Results:  All factors except the additional physical task significantly decreased postural stability ( p < 0.001). The greatest decreases in postural stability were because of disruption of the somatosensory system (95% AP increase) and disruption of both the somatosensory and vestibular systems (152% AP increase). Increasing refractive blur caused decreasing postural stability, with 8 D blur causing a 44% increase in AP RMS COP under normal standing conditions. The effect of refractive blur was greater when the input from the other sensory systems was disrupted (81% increase in AP RMS COP with 8 D blur). Performing an additional mental and physical task increased AP RMS COP by approximately 24%. All these detrimental effects on postural stability were cumulative.   Conclusions:  All the factors tested, except the additional physical task, significantly decreased postural stability and were cumulative. This highlights the multifactorial nature of balance control. Findings indicate that the visual system becomes increasingly relied upon when inputs from the other two balance control systems are disrupted.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,576-576,Closed,Article,"Anand, V.; Elliott, D.

Methods:  The children ( N = 153) (males 50.3%; females 49.7%), aged 7–17 years (mean = 10.76 ± 2.25 years) were examined with a logMAR VA chart, cover tests, retinoscopy (dry), subjective refraction, Vistech contrast sensitivity test, ophthalmoscopy, Randot stereotest, Ishihara and Farnsworth Panel D‐15 tests.   Results:  Many (34.6%) of the children had strabismus, 2–25 prism dioptres. Uncorrected distance VAs were: OD: Finger counting (FC) to 6/7.5 − 2, OS: 6/7.5 + 2 to 6/7.5 − 3, OU: 6/60 − 1 to 6/7.5. Most (67.6%) of the children had myopia. Others (30.8%) had hyperopia or emmetropia (1.7%). Astigmatism was present in 92.25% of the children. The nearest equivalent spherical powers were: OD: −12.00 to +2.75 D (mean = −1.48 ± 2.28 D) and OS: −8.00 to +5. 75 D (mean = 1.36 ± 2.18 D).  Following optical correction, VA improvement ranged from one to three lines in 71.2% of the children. The corrected VAs were, OD FC to 6/6 − 1, OS 6/7.5 + 2 to 6/6 − 1, and OU 6/60 to 6/6. Many (84.3%) of the children had corrected VA worse than 6/18 in the better eye and were therefore classified as partially sighted or blind (VA worse than 3/60). Stereoacuity was poor (500–70 sec arc) in most (89.5%) of the children, whilst others could not perceive the minimum 500 sec arc on the test. Contrast sensitivity was poor, maximum spatial frequency being 18 cpd with peak sensitivity at 3 cpd. Many (83%) of the children, however, had normal colour vision.  Conclusion:  These children with OCA had poor VA, which could be improved significantly with optical correction. Their poor contrast sensitivity and depth perception, however, were not improved. Most of the children with OCA had normal colour vision.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,572-573,Closed,Article,"Oduntan, A.

193,pub.1051084102,10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00086_14.x,,,Perceived blur in amblyopia,"Purpose:  It is well documented that visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in amblyopia are attenuated at high spatial frequencies: this would predict that amblyopes should perceive objects as blurred because they lack high spatial frequency information necessary to adequately represent sharp edges. In a series of experiments, we explored the representation of blur in amblyopia with blur discrimination and blur matching tasks.   Methods:  Monocular blur discrimination thresholds were measured in a spatial 2‐Alternative Force Choice procedure. The luminance profiles of the blurred edge were cumulative Gaussians with the standard deviation of the reference blurred edge being fixed at 1.88, 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, or 60 min arc. Observers were required to discriminate which edge (right or left) appeared to be the less blurred. Observers also interocularly matched edges which were identical to those employed in the blur discrimination tasks, with the exception that they were viewed dichoptically at all times.   Results:  Blur discriminination thresholds were elevated in both the amblyopic and fellow fixing eye but were within the normal range for interocular matching thresholds. Our results suggest that blur is veridically represented in the amblyopic visual system.   Conclusions:  The surprising result here is that all amblyopes, even those with the most severe visual loss, veridically matched all blurred edges, including the sharpest ones. This implies that amblyopes are able to represent levels of blur that are defined by spatial structure beyond their resolution limit. These results also raise interesting questions about the mechanism by which blur is represented in the visual system.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,575-576,Closed,Article,"Simmers, A.

We report our investigations of the basis of this phenomenon and the level of visual processing that is implicated.   Methods:  We report a single case with left occipital brain injury who showed pathological visual completion in a clear and reliable form. His disorder could not be explained by residual vision or an attentional disorder.   Results:  The likelihood of completion was systematically influenced by changes in the stimulus display. Pattern masking, varying the contrast characteristics of stimuli and changing visible cues to structural symmetry all had precise effects whereas familiarity and structural coherence did not.   Conclusion:  We suggest that in this case, pathological completion may be a positive cognitive event implicating processes that underpin the normal experience of occluded forms.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,577-577,Closed,Article,"McCarthy, R.

We have modified an automated perimeter by adding a second task at fixation and have investigated visual fields in conditions of focused (FA) and divided attention (DA).   Methods:  Two lasers were mounted on a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). They projected red targets 2 mm either side of the standard fixation target. Fifteen young (mean age: 20 ± 1.4 years; range: 18–23) and 15 healthy old subjects (72 ± 5.1 years; range: 65–80) were assessed under FA using Fastpac 30–2 program (sequence 1). Subjects then repeated the test twice under DA (sequences 2 and 3), in which they were instructed to press a second handheld button in response to an asynchronously presented central laser target. They also responded to continuing laser targets after the threshold program finished.   Results:  For old subjects under DA, the mean threshold increased by 2.87 cd m −2 (sequence 2) and 0.8 cd m −2 (sequence 3) compared with FA (sequence 1). By comparison young subjects increased by 0.03 cd m −2 (sequence 2) and decreased by 0.55 cd m −2 (sequence 3). Compared with young subjects, mean threshold for old subjects was 8.44 cd m −2 (sequence 2) and 6.89 cd m −2 (sequence 3) greater. Mean reaction times for the fixation task alone were comparable (young: 353 ± 46 ms vs old: 352 ± 52 ms). However, when combined with the threshold field task, reaction times increased by much more in the old group (e.g. 497 ± 46 ms vs 557 ± 50 ms sequence 2).   Conclusion:  The visual fields of old subjects were only slightly reduced in DA conditions although the reduction was clearly greater than for the young group. There were marked increases in the reaction times of the older group to targets presented at fixation.

The aim of this experiment was to determine whether spatiotopic (perceived proximity) and binocular stimulation would improve the quality of accommodation responses in LOM subjects.   Methods:  Ten emmetropic subjects (mean age 22.3 ± 2.3 years) and 10 LOM subjects (mean age 21.8 ± 1.5 years) participated. A specially modified Canon R‐1 infrared optometer was used to measure accommodation responses. Three conditions were presented: (1) Monocular blur‐only stimulus, (2) Monocular free‐space stimulus, and (3) Binocular free‐space stimulus. Each condition was presented on a separate day to avoid fatigue effects.   Results:  Accommodation stimulus–response curves in the LOM group showed improved accuracy with the spatiotopic stimulus. Microfluctuations were significantly ( p < 0.01) smaller in magnitude in the LOM group with the spatiotopic stimulus, because of reductions in the low frequency components of the fluctuations. A significant ( p < 0.01) increase in the percentage of correct step accommodation responses for the spatiotopic stimulus was found in the LOM group. However, step response times in the LOM group with the spatiotopic stimulus were not significantly different than those found with the retinotopic stimulus, and were significantly ( p < 0.01) longer than those found in the emmetropic group.   Conclusions:  (1) Spatiotopic stimulation produces significant improvements in static accommodative accuracy in LOM subjects compared with retinotopic stimulation. (2) The quality of dynamic accommodation responses in LOM subjects was found to improve significantly with spatiotopic stimulation. (3) LOM subjects appear to rely upon proximity driven stimuli to improve accommodative response accuracy.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,578-578,Closed,Article,"Gray, L.

The purpose was to determine the within‐visit between‐subject, the between‐visit between‐subject, and the between‐location variability of the threshold response in the normal eye with increase in stimulus eccentricity out to 60° as a function of stimulus size.   Methods:  Forty‐eight normal subjects attended for a total of three visits (mean age = 49.5 years, SD = 18.9, range 22–84 years). At the first visit, one randomly assigned eye of each subject was examined with the Humphrey Field Analyzer 750 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and the Full Threshold algorithm using Programs 30–2 and 60–4 and stimulus sizes III and V. The combination of stimulus size and of program, and the order of the combination within‐ and between‐sessions, were randomized for each subject. The results of the first visit were considered as a familiarization period and were discarded. The protocol at the second and third visits was identical to that at the first visit for each subject.   Results:  The ratio of the SD of the group mean sensitivity was determined at each stimulus location for stimulus size III compared with stimulus size V for Programs 30–2 and 60–4 at visit 3. The SDs were greater than unity for Program 30–2 ( p < 0.0001) and for Program 60–4 ( p < 0.0001) indicating greater variability for the size III stimulus. The SDs were also greater than unity for the central inner zone ( p < 0.0001), central outer zone ( p < 0.0001) and peripheral inner zone ( p < 0.0001). The ratios in the peripheral outer zone were not quite greater than unity ( p = 0.054). The ratios increased with increase in eccentricity by up to 2.7 times between 15° and 30° eccentricity and by up to 2.7 times between 30° and 60° eccentricity. The group mean ratio did not vary significantly between the two visits for Program 30–2 stimulus size III ( p = 0.563), Program 60–4 stimulus size III ( p = 0.935) and for Program 60–4 stimulus size V ( p = 0.005). However, the group mean SD was lower at visit 3 compared with visit 2 for Program 30–2 stimulus size V ( p = 0.0004). The SDs associated with the extreme peripheral locations in the superior and nasal fields were smaller for stimulus size III because the threshold was frequently attenuated by lid and facial contour.   Conclusions:  Considerably narrower confidence limits for normality for the peripheral regions of Program 30–2 and for 60–4 are demonstrated with the use of Goldmann size V.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,579-580,Closed,Article,"Kim, L.

Methods:  Subjects were classified as being normal or having OHT or POAG (mild, moderate and severe) based on clinical findings and visual field results. A total of 104 eyes of 86 subjects who satisfied the inclusion criteria and completed the tests successfully were analysed. Sensitivity and specificity of N‐30 Full field FDP tests were analysed for OHT and three POAG groups. GDx parameters were compared between normal subjects and other groups.   Results:  When compared with normal subjects, superior‐based GDx parameters were significantly different ( p < 0.05) in OHT and mild POAG. Average‐based parameters showed significant difference ( p < 0.05) only in moderate and severe POAG. Among all the GDx parameters ‘The number’ (cut off value >19) showed significant results in OHT (sensitivity 66% and specificity 92%) and in POAG groups (sensitivity ≥88% and specificity ≥92%). OHT changes were detected by N 30 Full Threshold FDP test (sensitivity 22% and specificity 83%) and in mild (sensitivity 59% and specificity 87%), moderate (sensitivity 88% and specificity 96%) and severe (sensitivity 100% and specificity 100%) POAG groups when mean deviation ( P < 5) was used as the cut off value.

We reasoned that a consequence of the rod deficit might be a subsequent abnormality in the next level of the rod pathway, the rod bipolar cell. We therefore compared the distribution of rod bipolar cells in pigmented and albino rats.   Methods:  Rod bipolar cells were labelled in 15 µm thick sections of fixed retinas with a monoclonal antibody directed against protein kinase C, and visualized using the ABC method. Counts of the cell bodies and processes of rod bipolar cells were undertaken at various locations across the retina.   Results:  Qualitatively, the protein kinase C staining suggested differences between the albino and pigmented phenotypes both in the outer and inner plexiform layers and in the inner nuclear layer. Staining was denser in the pigmented retina and the bipolar cell bodies were arranged in multiple rows rather than a single row as found in the albino retina. The actual number of rod bipolar cells was reduced in the albino phenotype. At the neonatal age we examined (post‐natal day 15), there was a 14% reduction in the total number whereas in the adult retina the reduction was around 9%.   Conclusions:  Although the reduction in the rod bipolar population is not as great as that previously found for the rod photoreceptors (∼25%), the reduction in both populations suggests a general abnormality in the rod pathway of albinos.

However, few structural and chronological studies of regional deformation are available to support one hypothesis or the other. We address along- and across-strike variations in the nature and timing of plate boundary deformation to better understand the Cenozoic tectonics of the southern Andes.Two east–west structural transects were mapped at Puyuhuapi and Aysén, immediately north of the Nazca–South America–Antarctica triple junction. At Puyuhuapi (44°S), north–south striking, high-angle contractional and strike-slip ductile shear zones developed from plutons coexist with moderately dipping dextral-oblique shear zones in the wallrocks. In Aysén (45–46°), top to the southwest, oblique thrusting predominates to the west of the Cenozoic magmatic arc, whereas dextral strike-slip shear zones develop within it.New 40Ar–39Ar data from mylonites and undeformed rocks from the two transects suggest that dextral strike-slip, oblique-slip and contractional deformation occurred at nearly the same time but within different structural domains along and across the orogen. Similar ages were obtained on both high strain pelitic schists with dextral strike-slip kinematics (4.4±0.3 Ma, laser on muscovite–biotite aggregates, Aysén transect, 45°S) and on mylonitic plutonic rocks with contractional deformation (3.8±0.2 to 4.2±0.2 Ma, fine-grained, recrystallized biotite, Puyuhuapi transect). Oblique-slip, dextral reverse kinematics of uncertain age is documented at the Canal Costa shear zone (45°S) and at the Queulat shear zone at 44°S. Published dates for the undeformed protholiths suggest both shear zones are likely Late Miocene or Pliocene, coeval with contractional and strike-slip shear zones farther north. Coeval strike-slip, oblique-slip and contractional deformation on ductile shear zones of the southern Andes suggest different degrees of along- and across-strike deformation partitioning of bulk transpressional deformation.The long-term dextral transpressional regime appears to be driven by oblique subduction. The short-term deformation is in turn controlled by ridge collision from 6 Ma to present day. This is indicated by most deformation ages and by a southward increase in the contractional component of deformation. Oblique-slip to contractional shear zones at both western and eastern margins of the Miocene belt of the Patagonian batholith define a large-scale pop-up structure by which deeper levels of the crust have been differentially exhumed since the Pliocene at a rate in excess of 1.7 mm/year.","AcknowledgementsThe present work is part of the first author&#x27;s PhD thesis at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia.

Methods:  The corneal polarisation axis and corneal astigmatism directions were measured in 11 subjects, providing data for 22 eyes. One kerataconic subject was included in the sample. The study utilised subjective ellipsometry using an instrument engineered at Imperial College, London to determine the corneal polarisation axis. An Orbscan (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA) corneal topographer was used to measure corneal astigmatism and corneal thickness.   Results:  It was found that the angle of corneal polarisation axis and the steepest direction of corneal astigmatism were correlated. The correlation coefficient for the RE was −0.49, whilst that for LE was 0.43. A similar relationship was found for the flat axis of the cornea.   Conclusions:  There was a fair correlation between the corneal polarisation direction and both the flat and steep axis of corneal astigmatism. It was also found, in agreement with other studies, that corneal polarisation axis in either eye was symmetrical about the nose, as was corneal astigmatism. The kerataconic cornea followed the trend observed, although nothing conclusive can be stated. A relationship between the corneal polarisation axis and corneal thickness was not established. Analysis of the data provided us with simple equations, which could help to predict a polarisation axis for a known direction of corneal astigmatism.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,579-579,Closed,Article,"Mamoojee, A.; Diaz‐Santana, L.; Lara‐Saucedo, D.","Mamoojee, A.

In addition, peripheral achromatic resolution is unaffected by defocus up to 3 D. We have also shown resolution for Short Wavelength Sensitive (SWS) system isolating gratings to be sampling limited in both the fovea and periphery. This means that measurements of peripheral resolution with either stimulus can potentially be used to estimate the density of the corresponding underlying retinal ganglion cell population. We wished to examine the effect of optical defocus on detection and resolution acuity for this stimulus and also determine how peripheral resolution declined with age for both the achromatic and SWS system.   Methods:  We measured detection and resolution for SWS‐isolating gratings in the fovea and at 20° eccentricity for optical defocus between 0 and 4 D. In addition we measured resolution acuity for both achromatic and SWS‐isolating gratings at 13° in four retinal locations in 50 normal subjects ranging in age from 12 to 70 years. Measurements of lens density (age‐related yellowing) were also made in subjects over 60 years of age.   Results:  Detection acuity was initially higher than resolution accompanied by observations of aliasing. Detection acuity declined steadily with defocus but SWS resolution acuity showed no decline until 1 D in the fovea and 3 D at 20°. Resolution acuity was higher for achromatic gratings than SWS‐isolating gratings at all ages and neither displayed any decline in performance until around 55 years. After this both declined in a parallel fashion at a rate of 10% per decade. The individual ratio of SWS/achromatic resolution (0.25) showed no correlation with increasing lens density.   Conclusions:  As resolution for both short‐wavelength and achromatic gratings is robust to optical attenuation and declines in a parallel fashion after 55 years there appears to be no selective loss of SWS‐driven ganglion cell density relative to achromatic density with age.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,574-574,Closed,Article,"Anderson, R.

The occurrence of habitual binocular summation/inhibition is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate binocular performance in 100 ‘ocularly normal’ subjects over the age of 45 years attending an optometric practice. In addition, very little data exist on habitual quality of life (QOL) scores in normal subjects. We aimed to investigate whether binocular performance for different visual tasks affected QOL scores.   Methods:  Right eye, left eye and binocular contrast sensitivity (CS), near and distance logMAR acuity (VA), and face recognition (FR) were measured. Vision‐related quality of life (QOL) scores were measured using the standard NEI–VFQ 25 questionnaire.   Results:  Habitual binocular summation ratios were similar to those reported under laboratory conditions. Binocular summation ratios for visual acuity were 26%, 47% for CS and 11% for FR. Binocular inhibition was shown by 12 subjects with VA, seven people in CS and 31 subjects with FR. No significant associations were shown between the summation ratios of distance VA, near VA, CS & FR and the 13 different QOL categories.   Conclusions:  Face recognition showed the poorest summation as it falls under the complex pattern recognition known to produce lower summation under laboratory conditions. Binocular summation ratios were not significantly associated with either the age of the subject or to the differences between the two eyes. The lack of correlation between binocular summation ratios and QOL was because of the high scores shown by the normal subjects.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,578-578,Closed,Article,"Patel, R.; Pardhan, S.; Hobbiss, A.; Gilchrist, J.","Patel, R.

They can employ briefly flashed stimuli, that can be presented in the retinal periphery; any luminance signal can also be masked by dynamic random luminance noise; and chromaticity can be varied very precisely. We have devised a program that is designed to detect and quantify disturbances in the three major blinding conditions (glaucoma, ARM and diabetes).   Methods:  The tests can be performed very rapidly, using standard PCs.   Results:  Normal results from age‐matched groups prove prominent tritan losses in all 3 three conditions. In diabetes, relatively large abnormalities can be detected before the appearance of mild background retinopathy, and worsen with the appearance of microaneurysms. In suspected glaucoma, abnormalities can be detected when conventional perimetry is ambiguous. There is a good correlation with minor changes on the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT). The loss is related to IOP. In ARM, even with normal visual acuity, very large losses of tritan contrast sensitivity can be seen. Although patients can see the colours on the monitor screen, the targets (small optotypes) cannot be recognised, apparently because of the presence of very small tritan scotomas, which can be demonstrated when the target is flashed briefly.   Conclusions:  Colour vision testing permits rapid screening of patients at risk of developing sight‐threatening disorders, and thus is potentially of considerable use in health‐care programmes.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,582-582,Closed,Article,"Arden, G.

Methods:  Eighty subjects from the staff and student population at Anglia Polytechnic University were examined. Forty subjects (20 males, 20 females) were Asian (originating from the Indian subcontinent) and 40 (20 males, 20 females) were white people. The subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic examination including refraction, slitlamp examination and biomicroscopic fundoscopy. Subjects with ocular pathology were excluded from the study. Subjects underwent POBF measurement on a randomly selected eye with an Ocular Blood Flow Analyzer (Paradigm Medical Industries, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The Analyzer probe was mounted on a slitlamp and all measurements were performed by an experienced observer (PG).   Results:  The median age of the Asian subjects was 22 years (males 22 years; females 22 years) and of the white people was 24 years (males 26 years; females 23 years). The racial groups were comparable for age (Mann–Whitney U = 686.5, p = 0.27), refraction (Mann–Whitney U = 735.5, p = 0.4658) and IOP (Mann–Whitney U = 856, p = 0.5899). The mean POBF values in the Caucasian and Asian groups were 1033 µL min −1 (95% CI: 940–1125 µL min −1 ) and 1061 µL min −1 (95% CI: 958–1165 µL min −1 ), respectively. The difference in POBF between the ethnic groups did not reach statistical significance (Mann–Whitney U = 0.07, p = 0.7987). Females had a higher mean POBF than males (Mann–Whitney U = 1163; p = 0.0005) but there was no interaction with race (two‐way anova F = 1.09; p = 0.2997).   Conclusions:  There was no significant difference between the mean POBF values for subjects originating from the Indian subcontinent and Caucasian subjects. The previously reported gender difference in mean POBF was confirmed. We suggest that reported differences in POBF values in different races may arise from instrumental factors.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,582-582,Closed,Article,"Gunvant, P.; Broadway, D.

Methods:  Subjects with age‐related cataract ( N = 33) were recruited to the study from both private optometric practice and a hospital eye department. All subjects underwent LOCS III grading of their cataract and had their functional vision assessed using the VF‐14 questionnaire. High (96%) and low (16%) contrast logMAR visual acuity were measured together with Pelli–Robson contrast sensitivity. A stepwise linear regression was then performed on the data to find significant predictors for VF‐14 in the three age‐related cataract morphological groups as well as in a mixed group.   Results:  Low contrast logMAR visual acuity was a significant predictor of VF‐14 in the cortical ( p = 0.014 ) and nuclear ( p = 0.024 ) subgroups. For the mixed morphological group both high and low contrast visual acuity were significant predictors ( p < 0.03 ). There were only three subjects with pure posterior subcapsular cataract and so no meaningful analysis could be performed.

Previous studies of eye movements have tended to concentrate on horizontal or vertical eye movements. The aim of this study is to establish baseline data (latency, duration and peak velocity) for oblique eye movement in normal human observers.   Methods:  Eye movements were measured using an IRIS 6500 infrared limbal eye tracker (Skalar Medical, Delft, The Netherlands) customized for the direct recording of oblique eye movements. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 205 Hz and a resolution of 0.05° using a Gould 1604 digital storage oscilloscope. Data were subsequently transferred via an IEEE488 interface bus to a PC for analysis. Ten visually normal observers recruited from the student and patient population of the University of Bradford's Eye Clinic participated in the study. Subjects made saccadic eye movements in 5° to 15° steps in horizontal, vertical and oblique orientations. Stimuli were presented in random order to ensure there was no predictable component to the response.   Results:  Saccadic responses to vertical and horizontal step stimuli were consistent with previous published work. The modification to the eye tracker allowed direct measurement of oblique saccades. The duration of the saccade increased as a function of stimulus amplitude and conformed to the relationship: D = D 0 + dA (where D is the duration of saccadic eye movement; A is the amplitude of saccadic eye movement; d is the rate of duration increase per degree of amplitude and D 0 is the y ‐axis intercept of the duration vs amplitude line). Calculation of latency (∼200 ms), duration (∼80–100 ms) and peak velocity (∼300 ms −1 ) for oblique saccades gave responses which were similar to those reported using indirect measurement.   Conclusion:  A veridical measure of oblique saccadic eye movements was obtained using the modified eye tracker. Oblique responses were generally slower than for horizontal measures of saccadic eye movements. These baseline data will allow a comparison in age‐matched subjects with early onset ocular motor anomalies.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,580-580,Closed,Article,"Kavasakali, M.; Bloj, M.; Winn, B.","Kavasakali, M.

191,pub.1044681266,10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00086_34.x,,,Retinal projections to the thalamus in albino frogs,"Melanin in the embryonic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is essential for normal development of the mammalian visual system: in albino and other mutant mammals lacking this pigment, many temporal retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that usually project ipsilaterally misroute their axons across the optic chiasm to the opposite side of the brain. In human albinos, this misrouting results in higher visual centres receiving predominantly monocular input from the opposite eye and in defective binocular stereovision. The RPE–RGC signalling mechanisms that govern the chiasmatic pathway choices of ganglion cell axons are unknown, but may involve gap junctions, which are a conserved feature of the embryonic retina in all vertebrate classes.  To determine whether chiasmatic abnormalities also generalize to non‐mammalian pigment mutants, we compared the distribution of crossed and uncrossed retinal projections to the thalamus in normal and albino Xenopus frogs. In both phenotypes, retinal terminations from the opposite eye covered ∼80% of the neuropil of Bellonci and corpus geniculatum thalamicum (analogous to the mammalian lateral geniculate nuclei), with uncrossed inputs occupying ∼75 and 25%, respectively, of the two terminal fields. Ipsilateral projections originated from ∼3000 RGCs in the wild‐type and albino frogs, and in both phenotypes they were restricted to a ventrotemporal crescent comprising ∼40% of the total retinal area.   In sum, we found no evidence of chiasmatic misrouting in albino Xenopus , despite the fact that this species normally possesses retinal projections with a substantial ipsilateral component. Our findings support other recent evidence that a lack of RPE melanin leads to defective development of the retina and its central pathways only in mammals.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,581-581,Closed,Article,"Grant, S.; Waller, W.; Bhalla, A.; Kennard, C.","Grant, S.

Here, we investigate the effect of alignment between texture elements on human texture perception.   Methods:  Texture displays, consisting of arrays of elements, were presented to observers for 100 ms. Trials were completed with both line elements and with Gabor patches. A discrimination task consisted of one stimulus presentation, and observers distinguished between two possible orthogonal orientations of a central block, which differed from the surround by the orientation of its elements. A detection task required observers to indicate in which of two presentations the central block was present. For both tasks, the degree of alignment within stimuli was varied either by increasing orthogonal offset between elements or by decreasing the length of chains of aligned elements. Both alterations result in an overall reduction of collinearity within the display. A close‐spaced and a far‐spaced condition were tested. Global element density was kept constant within all line trials and within all Gabor trials.   Results:  For nearly all conditions, alignment was found to improve thresholds. The effect was robust to orientational jitter up to a standard deviation of the array‐element population of 8°.   Conclusions:  Our results suggest that collinearity between elements results in both short and long‐range interactions, which contribute to the formation of a texture‐defined surface. Interactions between close‐spaced elements might be explicable in terms of a linear‐filter summation paradigm, but results for far‐spaced elements would definitely require additional mechanisms.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,580-581,Closed,Article,"Harrison, S.

We investigated the range of ocular movements in both an elderly and a young group of subjects, under both binocular and monocular conditions.   Methods:  Ten old (mean age 71.38 ± 5.2 years) and six young subjects (20.17 ± 1.7 years) with good and equal visual acuity, normal binocular single vision and normal ocular movements participated. Heterophoria in nine positions of gaze was measured on the synoptophore. The range of eye movement was assessed binocularly and monocularly using Snellen fusion slides and the extent of elevation, depression, right gaze and left gaze recorded.   Results:  Under binocular and monocular conditions, the range of movement decreased for all positions in the older group. The difference was only statistically significant in elevation ( p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant asymmetry between the eyes for any position for either group. Under monocular conditions there was a statistically significant symmetrical reduction in the extent of abduction in the older group in both right ( p < 0.01) and left eyes ( p < 0.05) compared with the younger group. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference for either eye on adduction.   Conclusion:  These results confirm a decrease in elevation in healthy older individuals with slight restrictions in all other positions. There was a statistically significant and previously unreported decrease of abduction under monocular conditions in the elderly group. Thus asymmetry between the eyes remains the best tool when diagnosing a pathological weakness in eye movement, but more research is needed to confirm the extent of these age‐related restrictions.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,580-580,Closed,Article,"Davidson, J.

A simple model assuming that a thin SCL aligns to the cornea predicts that these effects are similar on‐eye and off‐eye. We investigate the effect SA has on the power of an SCL on‐eye.   Methods:  The wavefront aberration for 17 eyes and 33 SCL on‐eye was measured with a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor. The Zernike coefficients describing the on‐eye SA of the SCL were compared with off‐eye ray tracing results. Paraxial and effective lens power changes resulting from the SCL‐induced SA were determined.   Results:  The model predicts the on‐eye SA of SCL closely. The SA induced by spherical SCL partly cancelled the ocular SA for 11 of the subjects. The power change resulting from SCL‐induced SA is ±0.5 D for a ±7.00 D spherical SCL on a 6‐mm pupil. Power change is negligible for SCL corrected for off‐eye SA.   Conclusions:  For thin SCL the level of SA is similar on‐eye and off‐eye. SCL corrected for off‐eye SA are aberration free on‐eye but the benefit depends on the individual level of ocular aberrations and the viewing condition. The effective power change of spherical SCL depends on pupil size and can be significant for large pupils even for moderate refractive errors. For SCL without aberration correction, for higher levels of ametropia and large pupils, the SCL power should be determined with trial SCL with their power and p ‐value similar to the prescribed lens.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,573-574,Closed,Article,"Dietze, H.

Methods:  A Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor was used to measure the ocular wavefront in nine eyes. Head position was stabilised using a dental bite bar and the pupil centred using a CRT monitor and circular grating. Twenty Shack–Hartmann images were collected for each measurement. Each observer had three sets of measurements taken; the first and the second after careful alignment and the final after regrasping the bite bar in the same position as for the second measurement, but without pupil realignment. The modulation transfer functions for each set were calculated and the effect of ideal custom treatments on the modulation transfer function (MTF) was estimated.   Results:  There were highly statistically significant differences in a large number of Zernike modes between the three sets of measurements. The MTFs calculated for the residual wavefronts following ideal custom treatment were below the diffraction limit. The RMS wavefront errors were consistently better for the residual wavefronts obtained using the realigned data than using data taken without pupil realignment.   Conclusions:  Sequential measurement of ocular aberrations shows statistically significant differences in a large number of Zernike modes. If aberrations determined by a single measurement are to be used in a custom correction the resulting modulation transfer function is likely to remain below the diffraction limit. Pupil realignment is critical in reduction of the residual root mean square wavefront values to a minimum.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,573-573,Closed,Article,"Diaz‐Santana, L.; Davies, N.; Lara‐Saucedo, D.","Diaz‐Santana, L.

Also, for the age range 4.5 months to 11.1 years, 34% of children with Down syndrome have strabismus, compared with 4–7.5% of control children (British College of Optometrists, 1991–94). In addition, 82% of our cohort of children with Down syndrome ( n = 100) have reduced accommodation at near. In order to investigate the influence of accommodation accuracy on refractive error and strabismus, this study compared the above parameters in children with Down syndrome who accommodated accurately with those who did not.   Methods:  Accommodation was measured using dynamic retinoscopy technique at testing distances of 25, 16.6 and 10 cm. An accommodative lag of plano to 0.75 D is normal for typically developing children (Rouse et al. , 1984). Accurate accommodation for our cohort was therefore defined as ≤0.75 D lag of accommodation (at a minimum of two of three testing distances). Children with Down syndrome who accommodated accurately were age matched with a child with inaccurate accommodation, based on their most recent visit for which a full data set was available.   Results:  Chi‐square analysis of the data for the two groups revealed that there was a greater number of children with significant hypermetropia ( p = 0.003) and strabismus ( p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test) in the under‐accommodating group.

The aim of this work is to develop a system that could be used by primary care practitioners to monitor the progression of PCO using familiar equipment.   Methods:  A Kodak DCS 100 (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) digital data back, which uses a Nikon F3 body, was connected to the camera port of a Nikon FS‐2 photo slit‐lamp. A fixation stimulus was developed and systematic studies carried out to determine optimum exposure and slit‐lamp settings using patients recruited from the YAG laser capsulotomy clinic at the Royal Eye Unit, Kingston Hospital. In all cases conventional illumination was used. Inter and intraobserver trials were then carried out using observers ranging from a non‐clinician to an experienced ophthalmologist. All images were analysed using ImagePro Plus image processing software prior to statistical analysis.   Results:  Optimum slit‐lamp parameters were found to be a 45° slit beam angle, 3 mm slit width and 25× magnification. The flash intensity was set to 2. The optimum camera and digital storage unit speed settings were both ISO 200 for fibrotic PCO but 800 and 1600, respectively, for Elschnig pearl type PCO. Intra‐observer repeatability gave ±0.375 mm (95% confidence) variation in fixation. However, initial results from interobserver trials showed significant variability.   Conclusions:  The current digital assessment system uses a standard piece of consulting room equipment coupled to a digital 35 mm camera. Initial results indicate that it should be suitable for use in monitoring PCO although a more exact measurement protocol is required to reduce interobserver variability. Work is currently underway to complete validation trials and to find suitable image statistics.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,581-581,Closed,Article,"Al‐Farhan, H.; Hull, C.

The aim of this experiment was to establish the effect of VR stimulation upon the tonic elements of the accommodation and vergence controllers.   Methods:  Twenty subjects (mean age 22.0 ± 4.5 years) participated with informed consent in the experiment. The subjects were emmetropic and free of all ocular or systemic disease. Tonic accommodation (TA) was measured in darkness using the Shin‐Nippon SRW‐5000 (Tokyo, Japan) infrared autorefractor which takes a measure of the accommodative state every 1 s . Readings were taken over a period of 3 min and an average TA value was calculated when the accommodative state had reached a stable level. Tonic vergence (TV) was measured in darkness continuously for 3 min using an EyeTrace 300X (Iota AB, Sundvall, Sweden) infrared limbal eyetracker and an average TV value was calculated when the traces had reached a stable level. Subjects were then immersed in a VR environment, for 30 min, generated using SimulEyes field‐sequential shutter goggles controlled by a Dell XPS R450 PC (Bracknell, UK). The VR display required a constant accommodation response of 3D, while the vergence response typically varied between 0 and 5 MA. Following immersion, measurements of TA and TV were repeated.   Results:  A significant relationship ( y = 1.13 x − 0.71, R = 0.85, p = 0.001) was found between the initial TV level and the shift induced by the VR environment such that negative TV positions shifted in the positive direction and vice‐versa. No significant change in TA was observed.   Conclusions:  The VR environment produced substantial adaptation of TV. These findings suggest that the vergence controller acts to shift vergence bias in order to reduce stimuli conflicts with accommodation found in VR environments. This enables subjects to maintain a stable accommodation response despite continual changes in the vergence position.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,576-577,Closed,Article,"Stanger, S.; Gray, L.

We examined the contribution of the optical input to this known altered accommodative response by assessing the defocused contrast sensitivity function in myopes and emmetropes.   Methods:  Contrast sensitivity (CS) to 20 spatial frequencies was measured under cycloplegia, with up to ±3 D of defocus, in myopes and non‐myopes. The differences in the contrast sensitivity functions as a result of defocus were analysed for the different spatial frequencies in the two groups. In addition, the optimum defocus at which peak contrast sensitivity occurred was compared between the two groups.   Results:  The loss in contrast sensitivity with defocus was less symmetrical with positive and negative defocus in the myopic group, although there was no latent accommodation left following cycloplegia. Defocus decreased contrast sensitivity symmetrically in non‐myopes. The magnitude of decrease in CS was dependent on the spatial frequency tested, and was significantly different in myopes and non‐myopes at 3 and 6 c deg −1 .   Conclusions:  Differences in the effects of blur on CS exist between myopes and non‐myopes. Existing models of spherical aberration may explain this asymmetry in positive and negative defocus in myopes.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,575-575,Closed,Article,"Radhakrishnan, H.; Pardhan, S.; Calver, R.

191,pub.1008039423,10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00086_37.x,,,The use of critical flicker frequency (CFF) as a potential vision test prior to cataract surgery: a pilot study,"Background:  To determine whether a patient would benefit from cataract surgery, a pre‐operative evaluation of retinal visual function is required. Age‐related macular disease has been reported as the most important factor leading to poor outcome after cataract surgery. The critical flicker frequency (CFF) is a psychophysical test that measures temporal resolution properties in the visual system.   Purpose:  (1) To evaluate if CFF can be used as a tool to predict visual outcome after cataract surgery. (2) To assess if lens opacities and/or retinal damage affects CFF values. (3) To assess the optimal configuration for the CFF target in relation to stimulus size.   Methods:  Thirty‐two patients have been included in the pilot study. Subjects were divided into the following categories: cataract, central retinal disease, pseudophakes and cataract after pupil dilatation. CFF threshold measurements were obtained after optimal refraction and visual acuity measurement using a Bailey–Lovie logMAR chart. A staircase method was used to find the CFF threshold. For each subject, three different stimulus sizes were analysed.   Results:  Critical flicker frequency measurements were unaffected by the presence of cataract ( p > 0.05). Pupil dilatation gave slight higher results in patients with cataracts, although this difference was not statistically significant ( anova F = 3.6, p = 0.07). A significant difference for the three targets sizes was found ( anova F = 41.94, p < 0.05). Retinal disease produced an insignificant decrease in CFF ( p > 0.05, n = 5).   Conclusions:  Critical flicker frequency appears to be independent of the image degrading effects of cataract. Comparison of the means for the different conditions studied show a slight decrease in CFF measurement for retinal disease in comparison to the cataract group. However, more subjects are needed to determine the usefulness of CFF as a potential vision test.",,,Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics,,,,2002-11-24,2002,2002-11-24,2002-11,22,6,582-582,Closed,Article,"Vianya, M.; Douthwaite, W.

Our research examines the relationship between high and low level visual deficits and copy drawing.   Methods:  We have obtained copy drawings of a Navon figure (a global letter H composed of local letter Ts), and measured visual contrast sensitivity (CS), visual fields, and neglect (line bisection and star cancellation), in 105 patients with cortical lesions. Copying of global and local letters was scored independently. CS was measured using single letters (Bailey–Lovie) or symbols (Ffooks test) at varying sizes.   Results:  Correlations were found between local and global copying performance and CS. Disorganisation of copy drawing at the global level was dissociable from disorganisation at the local level. Global disorganisation was associated with reduced CS, particularly at larger letter sizes. Patients showing extreme distortions such as the omission or duplication of part of the global figure all had reduced CS to the largest letter size. However the converse is not true: not all patients with reduced CS to large symbols were unable to copy the global figure.

Terrorism is, however, a multi- faceted phenomenon involving both a systematic and sporadic use of terror by governments and other social actors, with a view to forcing some specific or general political and related objectives. Using an implicit dialectical materialist methodology, the paper explores the international political economy anchored on an essentially Western frame of reference of interests and contradictory values that permits the US and its allies to run the globe as they deem fit-including using, misusing and abusing the rest of the world. Elements within this frame include violation of international laws; contempt for international treaties as well as for the UN when expedient to do so; selective application of democratic values and principles; support of strong-arm rulers/ tin-pot dictators when they are useful and their abandonment when their nuisance value diminishes. The paper argues that the rule of force as against the rule of law has tended to radicalize the victims, admittedly in varying degrees. It suggests in conclusion, the articulation, by all stakeholders in a shrinking global ecology, of a people- friendly and people-centred ethical compass, one apt at making inter-state, inter-national and inter-people relations more humane and more human.

It is widely used by rural populations in most countries in which it is found. It has multiple uses, including the fruits, kernels, oil, bark, wood and leaves. Because of these multiple uses, and its significance in the landscape, several African cultures have specific beliefs and ceremonies associated with this species, and it is often maintained in homestead and arable plots. Because of the widespread occurrence, potentially high fruit production and use of S. birrea it has frequently been identified as a key species to support the development of rural enterprises based on the fruit, beer, oil or nuts and therefore as a species for potential domestication. Localised breeding and cultivation initiatives commenced in the 1970s and some continue. Interest in this species was renewed after the development of a highly successful liqueur using extracts from the fruit. This has developed further in southern Africa over the last 3 to 5 years, especially commercialisation initiatives orientated towards befitting the rural poor. Recently, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) initiated a project to examine the impacts of commercialisation of non-timber forest products, such as marula, on the livelihood capital ofthe rural poor. As a first phase, the research team compiled a comprehensive literature review of S. birrea, with emphasis on possible commercialisation. This is to be published in two parts. The first part deals with the taxonomy, ecology and its subsistence use and cultural value to rural households. The second part of the review will focus on issues relating to specific properties of the marula, management, intellectual property and its potential commercialisation.",,,Southern Hemisphere Forestry Journal,,,,2002-07,2002,,2002-07,194,1,27-41,Closed,Article,"Shackleton, Sheona E.; Shackleton, Charlie M.; Cunningham, Tony; Lombard, Cyril; Sullivan, Caroline A.; Netshiluvhi, Thiambi R.","Shackleton, Sheona E.

                  The academic political scientists—mainly professors—who were hired by the Babangida military government in Nigeria between 1985 and 1993, ostensibly to theorize and articulate a new political culture and morality through the political transition program (PTP), have been objects, both then and ever since, of serious criticism concerning their role and contribution to a program that promised much but delivered little or nothing. The major criticism is that the political scientists, despite an initial commitment to help the military fashion a new political order, lost their “science” by providing an intellectual cover for the general's schemes and enriched the “political,” including the politics of corruption and self-enrichment. We examine this critique and show that these individuals, by choosing to remain in office—if not in power—even after witnessing so many broken promises by the regime, tarnished their intellectual integrity and moral credibility. Appointed to serve as an instrument of legitimization for the regime, they contained, constricted, and shrank the political and intellectual space rather than facilitating intellectual and democratic empowerment.
Résumé:
                  Les spécialistes universitaires en sciences politiques—surtout les professeurs—qui furent officiellement engagés par le gouvernement militaire de Babangida au Nigeria entre 1985 et 1993 pour théoriser et mettre en place une nouvelle culture et une nouvelle moralité politiques grâce au programme de transition politique (PTP), ont fait l'objet de sérieuses critiques, à l'époque et depuis lors, sur leur rôle et leur contribution à un programme qui a fait beaucoup de promesses mais n'en a tenu aucune, ou que peu. La critique la plus importante à l'égard de ces spécialistes en sciences politiques est qu'en dépit de leur engagement initial à aider le pouvoir militaire à façonner un nouvel ordre politique, ils ont perdu leur « science » en fournissant une couverture intellectuelle aux intrigues du général, et ont enrichi les « politiques », y compris les politiques de corruption et d'enrichissement personnel. Nous examinons ici cette critique et nous montrons que ces personnes, en choisissant de rester en fonction—sinon au pouvoir—même après avoir été témoins de tant de promesses non tenues de la part du régime, ont terni leur intégrité intellectuelle et leur crédibilité morale. Nommés pour servir d'instruments de légitimation pour le régime, ils ont contenu, resserré et rétréci l'espace politique et intellectuel plutôt que de faciliter la prise de pouvoir intellectuelle et démocratique",,,African Studies Review,,,,2002-09,2002,2014-05-23,2002-09,45,2,93-121,Closed,Article,"Amuwo, Ade Kunle","Amuwo, Ade Kunle ()",,"Amuwo, Ade Kunle ()",2,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046238072,,

En qu consiste, hoy y aqu, creer en un Dios salvador? Estas preguntas fundamentales nos remiten al ncleo de la soteriologa cristiana y obligan, a la teologa y a la predicacin, a precisar el carcter histrico de la accin salvadora del Dios de Jesucristo, tanto en su aspecto de consumacin escatolgico-finalstica como en su aspecto de plenitud inaugurada histricamente en la persona de Jess y, por ende, de fuente permanente de sentido y sostn de la autntica vida humana. A partir de la conviccin cristiana de que todo lo humano est constantemente referido, tanto en su despliegue histrico como en su destino definitivo, a una plenitud que lo trasciende y de cuya gratuidad depende, el mbito de la praxis histrica, comprendida en sentido amplio, deviene un tema especialmente relevante para la antropologa teolgica. Si la revelacin bblica remite a una accin salvadora de Dios que acontece en la historia manteniendo empero su radical alteridad con respecto a esta, en qu medida tal acontecimiento integrar el conjunto de actos, actitudes y opciones histricas del hombre, que llamamos ""praxis""? En el presente artculo se intenta reflexionar sobre estas cuestiones a partir de la teologa trascendental de Karl Rahner, no tanto en su vertiente propiamente prctica cuanto como impulso subyacente y tpico transversal al conjunto de su pensamiento,con el fin de vislumbrar las perspectivas que pueda ofrecer hoy una profundizacin de este tipo de enfoque teolgico de la praxis histrica What is the place of the reflection on the content of salvation, in the Catechism and the theological formation of believers, which are primarily aimed at the Christian experience and hope? What is it like believing in a saving God, here and now? These fundamental questions bring us to the nucleus of the Christian Soteriology and force both the theology and the preaching to specify the historical aspect of the saving action of Jesus. This issue considers two aspects; escato-finalistic consummation and the plenitude inaugurated in the person of Jesus. Thus being a permanent source of meaning and support of the human life. in the Christian belief, what is human is constantly referred to a transcendent plenitude (both historically and in its final destination). Hence, the praxis of the historical setting depends non this gratuity which brings about an important topic for the anthropological theology. If the biblical revelation evokes Gods saving action to a historical moment but keeping His radical otherness, to what extent will such events be part of Mans set of actions, attitudes and historical options, which we call praxis? This article reflects on these issues in the light of Karl Rahners transcendental theology, not so much in its practical stream, but as an underlining impulse and pervasive issue of the reflection. The author pursues to give an inkling of the perspectives, which may offer some deepening in the theological approach of the historical praxis",,,Teología y Vida,,,,2002,2002,2002,,43,4,467-502,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Berros, Fernando","Berros, Fernando (Universidad Catlica del Norte, Chile)",,"Berros, Fernando (Catholic University of the North)",2,0,,0.67,http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/tv/v43n4/art01.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022619979,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

Many African countries have committed considerable resources to its exploitation but more needs to be done to promote, develop and sustain a relevant science and technology culture, which includes problem solving and indigenous aspects, in order to narrow the gap between the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the industrialised countries.

Furthermore, higher education research can rely on a relatively stable academic basis if study programmes on higher education exist. Again, this is most frequently the case in the United States. Finally, governments and other macro-societal actors sometimes have their own offices or institutes of policy research and prepare the policies of the actors they report to. In addition, research on higher education can be institutionalized in a - riety of ways. Often, research institutes on higher education are quite visible. They were established as specialized research units within or outside insti- tions of higher education; but no common institutional basis can be observed for this type of institution across the countries. Third, the major themes of research on higher education also differ - tween countries. It has frequently been said that in European countries it was more prone to analyse macro-societal issues of higher education, whereas in the US it tended to study the inner life of higher education institutions, s- dents, and the teaching and learning processes.",,,,,"Stefanie Schwarz, Ulrich Teichler",,2002,2002,,2002,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,2,0,,0.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025644469,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

The question asked in LiSA is how language planning can contribute towards the attainment of these national ideals. Set against the language political realities of the country — the a-symmetric power relations between the languages; the striking differences in the structural; functional and symbolic adaptation of the official languages; and the many language-related problems in the country — it debates the role of language in state administration, national integration, educational development and economic development.

People create, not computers, and these tools give them qualitative relations and quantitative properties that they need to make creative decisions. With detailed analysis and examples from around the world, Applying Molecular and Materials Modeling describes the science, applications, and infrastructures that have proven successful. Computational quantum chemistry, molecular simulations, informatics, desktop graphics, and high-performance computing all play important roles.
